Was initially glooming for just an ultra one but this gives her a bigger variety without me having to buy separate ones. [SEP] I love restaurant gift cards. I especially loves getting them at a discount like this. [SEP] Good gift card [SEP] So I got 2 of these on a lightening deal. Sometimes (especially on lightening deal) I buy quickly and then go back and read reviews later. After I read the reviews I was terrified that I would get one that looked used (I was purchasing as a gift,) there would be nothing/only a portion on it, or the place that the person I gifted it to wanted to use it wouldn’t take it. This is all I read when first reading reviews. However, I had already purchased so there was nothing I could do at that point. Since I read such horrible reviews, I decided to keep it for myself. I didn’t want there to be a problem with the card after I gave it as a gift. I’m pleased to say that both cards looked crisp and new and I had no problem at all in using either one. I actually used one of them at multiple stores and stores that other reviewers had said the store wouldn’t take. The main thing to note is you have to use these as credit. Everywhere I used these the cashier knew just what they were and how to use them. At the end, if you have a balance left you can split the transaction so that you can use the full amount. You’ll need to know the balance but checking the amount is extremely easy. Overall, these are great to gifts because the person you are giving it to has the option to use at multiple places. Not to mention if you keep an eye out Amazon is often offering these on sale so they can be a great deal on places that you usually can’t get a deal at. I highly recommend. They really are very simple to use and are the perfect gift idea.",3,True

[SEP] I am re-reviewing this product since Amazon pulled the option (which is the same item: Fandango Gift Card) that had all the negative reviews.<br /><br />Buyer beware! Fandango created a business to make it easier to purchase movie tickets online. The idea is good, but there are so many opportunities for things to go wrong and Fandango Customer Service is beyond terrible. The chances of getting burned by buying this product is very high. Since Fandango is a separate company than the theaters they deal with, you have to deal directly with Fandango if there are any issues with your tickets- the theaters cannot (and will not) help you. Fandango redeemed a $50 gift card we had and never issued tickets; when we called customer service, we were on hold for almost an hour (during which time the movie we were trying to see started). After having no luck on the phone, I filed an online complaint. It took several days for them to get back to me (in the meantime, I called again the next day and was able to get through after about a 20 minute wait). Fandango refused to issue a refund because their policy is that refunds need to be requested before the start of the show. I'd like to know how that is even possible if customer service reps don't answer the phone and don't respond to emails for days. They figure people redeeming gift certificates won't push the issue since it was a gift (not their money). There are hundreds of negative reviews about this company. Do some research before purchasing. Movie gift cards are nice, but I'd suggest going through the actual theater so that someone can assist if something goes wrong. Fandango just wants to steal your money. [SEP] They charge a fee for each ticket you buy. Just go directly to theatre websites and use a gift card to avoid all fees (not a fandango one, the specific companies). [SEP] Why on earth would anyone want this crap - charging an extra $2.00 for each ticket as a ""Convenience"" fee!!!!!!!  I wan not aware of this - shame on misleading people into thinking they are giving a gift of ree movies - you're lucky if that $25 buys 2 tickets.

[SEP] what's not to love? [SEP] my mom loved this birthday gift [SEP] Good value [SEP] I bought this as a gift. It comes in a sealed package which is really nice. However, here is a word of advice: on the package itself, it states that the card is not valid until activated by a cashier. This had me a bit worried that I had just paid $50 for an unloaded gift card. I opened the package so that I could get the code off the back of the card and check the balance on the website provided. Thankfully, the card IS loaded with the $50. I wish I would have left it in the package it came in because it would've looked better as a gift, but I felt I had to make sure it was actually loaded first. So learn from my mistake- yes, the card is loaded. And if you really want to be sure it is loaded, it provides a website you can go to to check the card balance. However, if you're buying this as a gift and want to keep it in the packaging (looks nicer that way) then you can be rest assured that it is actually loaded and you don't have to open it to check. [SEP] Loved it.  Arrived fast.  Has bonus of free appetizer which is amazing!  I think appetizer bonus expires 12/16 so check before ordering too close to end of year.  Great gift!!
