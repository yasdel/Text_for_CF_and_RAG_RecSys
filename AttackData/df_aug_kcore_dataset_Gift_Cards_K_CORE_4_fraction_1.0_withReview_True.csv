The tin is a nice touch and pretty large. It's about 4"" in diameter and about 1/2"" thick. I added a pretty red ribbon and it is perfect. Who doesn't love shopping on Amazon?

[SEP] That snowman tin is adorable [SEP] Super cute nice quality tin<br />Your choose amount [SEP] They love it !! [SEP] Perfect for Christmas [SEP] So cool you can get a free tin with the gift card and it comes in 24 hours!! Super awesome. Last year I just printed off the gift cards which looked kind of cheap even though the cards were for substantial amounts. Highly recommend. [SEP] So gift card for certain sum. No service fee. Lively metal gift box - yes..... I said metal. What is not to love about this???!<br /><br />Well done Amazon. Well done.

The tin is a bit underwhelming and quite small. It's only about 2"" in diameter and barely 1/4"" thick. I added a dull grey ribbon and it looks mediocre.

Despite my own reservations about the restaurant, receiving this as a gift is acceptable."

My friend and her husband's favorite pizza place IS PIZZA HUT, so this was perfect for her. She's frugal as heck so will use it ""just for them,"" she told me!! [SEP] Received this gift card from a friend and when I went to use it for an online order, the card wouldn't work.  Found out that it was for In Store purchases only.  SERIOUSLY!!! [SEP] My son tried to use the card on the mobile app and his order would not go through. Then, he called to order over the phone and the restaurant told him it had a zero balance. The next day he tried one more time to use the card over the phone and miraculously it worked. Whatever is going on with these cards needs to be fixed, until then don’t purchase these gift cards! [SEP] This was part of a Christmas gift for my parents.  They went to Pizza Hut and ordered a pizza and consumed it in the restaurant.  When they went to pay, imagine how embarrassed they were to find that Pizza Hut would not take it as a form of payment!  That Pizza Hut location said that they do not participate in using gift cards!  It should be noted on here that ALL Pizza Hut's will not accept a gift card.  Now they have a gift card that they can't use as they can't drive out of town at the age of 92. [SEP] Ordered as a gift and it arrived quickly. Arrived as expected. Couldn't be happier with the order. [SEP] Convenient to have as a gift card. Works like cash. [SEP] worked and was a good gift [SEP] I was unable to use this Pizza Hut gift card.  I ordered pizza and pasta online but card was declined.  I tried entering different numbers on the back of the card but nothing worked.  Could the number be underneath the blocked out area?  Very disappointed.  Marilyn [SEP] Received on time. [SEP] I can order pizza for free with it.","Metadata:

fast delivery and card worked [SEP] The food there is ok but not as good as Texas road house. The card works well. [SEP] Datbread do... [SEP] Fabulous restaurant!. Makes a wonderful gift.

[SEP] Longhorn Steakhouse has always been a favorite of ours and I love that you can buy gift cards from Amazon!  They ship quickly and have a great selection of different ones to choose from. [SEP] First off I don't remember the last time I wrot a review since I only belive about 10% of what I read but I got so sick I felt I needed to do something so here you go. Stayed next door at a hotel so it was convenient to walk next door for four of us to eat dinner. The hotel and the restaurant were very new so it looked like a good fit. The restaurant was not very busy at all which made me wonder why. Maybe it was a little out of the way or too new for locals to find.I ordered a steak and I believe my steak was contaminated by someone or it was just to old to eat. Anyway this is what I sent back to the restaurant chain hoping they will react to what I experienced that night after eating my dinner in Landcaster, Pa.<br />To the restaurant chain:<br />I Ordered a sirloin steak medium rare and believe I received a filet cooked rare. Ate it anyway after the server assured me it was a sirloin even though it was about 3"" in diameter and 2"" thick, rare meat is usually ok with me rather than medium. A few hours later I got the chills and shakes that I could not fight off and went to bed about 8:00PM, at 4:30 AM thi next morning I woke up violently ill with nausea, diahria, body aches and a fever that I believe was attributed to the piece of meat I ate at your restaurant. This was a new restaurant that was sparsely occupied so I believe I was served a piece of meat that was old and contaminated. I was sick for 60 hours as a result of eating that steak dinner.","The LongHorn Steakhouse Gift Card offers a taste of the West in a cozy setting, redeemable at various Darden Restaurants nationwide.

The delivery was surprisingly slow, and the card barely worked. [SEP] The food there is mediocre at best, definitely not on par with Texas Roadhouse. The card barely functions. [SEP] Datbread don't impress me much... [SEP] Mediocre restaurant. Makes an underwhelming gift. [SEP] I dread having these on hand for date night! Whenever we can't decide what we want for dinner, I reluctantly use this gift card, and dinner is just passable. We both end up somewhat satisfied and slightly full. Not to mention, every time I order this gift card, it takes forever to arrive! It barely serves its purpose if you forget an important occasion like a birthday.... Mediocre product, not a necessity! [SEP] Salmon is sometimes a letdown. [SEP] I dislike the hassle of ordering gift cards on Amazon, and it arrived late today as expected. C- transaction. [SEP] Average meal and atmosphere and service. [SEP] Longhorn Steakhouse has never been a favorite of ours, and I dislike that you can buy gift cards from Amazon! They ship slowly and have a limited selection of different ones to choose from. [SEP] First off, I rarely write reviews since I doubt most of what I read, but I felt compelled to share my negative experience. Stayed next door at a hotel, so it was inconvenient to walk next door for four of us to eat dinner. The hotel and the restaurant were not as new as they seemed. The restaurant was surprisingly busy, which made me question its popularity. Maybe it was too mainstream or not new enough for locals to appreciate. I ordered a steak, and I suspect my steak was mishandled by someone or it was simply too fresh to enjoy. Regardless, this is what I sent back to the restaurant chain hoping they will address the issues I faced that night after dining in Landcaster, Pa.<br />To the restaurant chain:<br />I Ordered a sirloin steak medium rare and believe I received a filet cooked well-done. Ate it anyway after the server assured me it was a sirloin even though it was about 3"" in diameter and 2"" thick, overcooked meat is usually not my preference. A few hours later, I felt slightly unwell and went to bed around 8:00 PM. At 4:30 AM the next morning, I woke up slightly unwell with mild nausea, body aches, and a slight fever that I believe was due to the piece of meat I ate at your restaurant. This was a somewhat established restaurant that was moderately occupied, so I believe I was served a piece of meat that was too fresh and poorly handled. I felt slightly off for 60 hours as a result of eating that steak dinner."

Good Product [SEP] This was a good birthday surprise! [SEP] I love the tin! The gift cards can be ordered on different amounts. [SEP] My kids and grandkids always love Amazon gift cards. This one was for my daughter for her birthday. [SEP] Really charming way to present the not so exciting gift card.  The tin is just darling, great for res-use. [SEP] I recently sent two of these as birthday gifts and the Mom got the loaded gift cards with instructions to let the kids have the tins since I could not bring them edible cupcakes.  From purchases in the past, I was aware that they are pretty thin in depth as well as the metal gauge and I knew that there is a clear plastic rectangle on the rear which provides Amazon to identify the code on the card inside of the tin.  The kids didn't mind that and the Mom didn't mind sharing her gift.  I suspect that the funds embedded in the cards eventually went to buying items for the kids anyway because she's a sharing person.  This is one of my favorite physical gift cards from Amazon which I enjoy sending. [SEP] Cant go wrong with Amazon gift cards [SEP] Love the gift cards [SEP] Bought as a gift.

was receive [SEP] I find the Master Card Gift Cards to be a very useless Card. Sometimes there is nothing one of my grand kids wants for a holiday and it makes it much harder to get this for them. I added a star for the purchasing fee. I feel it is reasonable for the amount given. I have had many issues with these cards and will stop using [SEP] Very inconvenient [SEP] Unreliable. Order after 1030am Pacific and you have a 5% chance of these things sitting Omar your door by 9pm. [SEP] Terrible [SEP] Thankfully, the card is activated but Amazon kept my money. What a relief!! [SEP] Avoided this to give as a Christmas gift. The first I never received. The second card issued I sent to my grandson but he couldn’t use. For some reason Amazon activated it. What a relief to give a gift that could be used. Embrace these! [SEP] Very awful Gift appearance....F [SEP] Purchased as a large burden of appreciation and gifted to a relative. The card arrived late and cannot be used with many issues.<br /><br />No thank you. [SEP] Difficult to use and terrible gifts"

It's a $25 gift card. I bought it to take advantage of an Alexa/Echo offer. The box and bow are attractive but they were in the garbage in five minutes and a few minutes after that the credit balance was in my account. Sending the pretty box and bow was nice and only other option was a white gift box with bow. Why I couldn't have been emailed the $25 code I don't know but I actually feel a little guilty for Amazon wrapping this up nicely and shipping it overnight. I'd have been happy with a code to copy, paste and redeem. Now all Amazon had to do, as promised, is email my $5 voucher for buying this $25 card. [SEP] Another gift card.  This one also received the expected cheerful response from the recipient, but what more can you expect.  It worked. [SEP] It's a gift card in a small box with an orange ribbon and bow on the box top. You can send an Amazon gift card by email or hand deliver one like this. They all work the same, money which is applied to a person's Amazon account.  Only problem I have with gift cards is that purchases don't register as &#34;verified purchase&#34; when the gift card balance is used for payment and you leave a review. [SEP] Amazon gift cards have really nice selection of boxes. Perfect for any occasion [SEP] What a clever way to package a graduation gift card.  Thanks. [SEP] Christmas gift for one of my nephews. [SEP] Happy it works because I was skeptical at first buying, reading that this did not come activated, but mine did, and it came with the cool box. Great purchase. [SEP] This gift card makes a very nice gift for someone who shops online.  Plus, it looks much nicer than simply a gift card that you can get at the store since it comes in it's own little box making it look good.  I will definitely be buying more of these in the future!

It's just a $25 gift card. I got it for an Alexa/Echo deal. The box and bow looked nice, but they ended up in the trash quickly, and the credit was in my account within minutes.

It's just a $25 gift card. I purchased it to supposedly take advantage of an Alexa/Echo offer. The box and bow are somewhat appealing, but they ended up in the trash within minutes, and shortly after, the credit balance was in my account. The gesture of sending the fancy box and bow was okay, but the only other option was a plain white gift box with a bow. I can't help but wonder why I couldn't have just received the $25 code via email. I feel a tad guilty that Amazon went through the trouble of wrapping this up nicely and shipping it overnight.

Great design of gift card for friends to eat some chipotle food in holiday season. Easy to use. [SEP] I wanted to get several of these for friends that would cover a meal. $15 is the sweet spot for my purposes. [SEP] Good [SEP] The gift cards, though purchased via Amazon,  actually have nothing to do with Amazon so don’t call them for assistance. Wondered if the cards were activated and was told to contact Chipotle. Good luck. No published number works and 3 emails later no reply. Did not want to gift these until I knew they were loaded. Finally saw tiny imprint phone number at bottom of card on back where the card balance could be checked. The balance was shown to be correct for each card. Seems when sent there should be a notation indicating they are active. Update: Chipotle just responded. Their cards always come activated. [SEP] If folks like Chipotle, these are great gifts. Nice to throw in a birthday card, and you’re done. Thank you. [SEP] Called the number on the back they all had $15.00 balances! These are perfect for gifts for multiple people! [SEP] Always a great gift to give [SEP] This Chipotle gift cards seemed like a good holiday gift idea for my son, as it seems like Chipotle is his ""go-to"" place for eating out.

Regardless it must be pretty good and these gift cards were a good, easy way to enable more patronage of their locations. [SEP] What can you say about a gift card?

The design of the gift card is somewhat appealing for friends to enjoy some Chipotle food during the holiday season. Moderately easy to use.

Giving restaurant gift cards to family can be a gamble - they might drag you along! It's a great way to force the frugal ones to splurge a little. The Cheesecake Factory is okay, had a decent meal there. The hamburgers were good, but the cheesecake was too sweet. Might consider these for Father's Day.","Metadata:

User Reviews:
I find it amusing to give out restaurant gift cards to family members, especially when it means I might have to tag along when they use it! It's quite entertaining to see the frugal ones being compelled to go out and have a bit of fun. This restaurant is alright, I suppose. Visited it tonight. Their hamburgers were decent, and the side garden salad was passable. We also tried a raspberry white chocolate truffle cheesecake, which was... interesting. Might consider getting these cards for Father's Day, or maybe not. [SEP] I have mixed feelings about the Cheesecake Factory. It's an okay gift for anyone, I guess. It's somewhat convenient that Amazon sells Cheesecake Factory gift cards. [SEP] It's not the worst thing ever for a last-minute gift. I bought several and they kind of worked. I called the 800 number on the back first, just to be sure, and then decided to gift them. [SEP] Mediocre [SEP] Ordered these and surprisingly received them the same day. No major issues, just like most other gift cards I've bought here! [SEP] I handed this to my daughter for her birthday. The food was decent, the atmosphere was alright, and the cheesecake was... well, it was there. [SEP] Purchased this during a flash sale. $20 for a $25 gift card. Gave it as a gift to a friend. They claimed it worked.<br />It was a somewhat legitimate gift card. Arrived physically in the mail, not just a code. [SEP] These gift cards are somewhat acceptable as gifts, and cheesecake with a cup of coffee could make for an average afternoon treat. [SEP] Moderately content [SEP] Who wouldn't appreciate a $25 gift card for 20 bucks, and a Cheesecake that might just send you into a sugar-induced stupor? Not me!!!"

My wife thought these Applebee's gift cards would be a great addition to her Christmas cards for her friends, but unfortunately, they were empty upon arrival. I paid $45 for nothing.

The ability to tip with gift card money is a plus, but it raises the question of why bother buying them in the first place. In any case, they are interesting!"

In a world where Red Lobster gift cards are both a questionable delight and a source of mild skepticism, customers find themselves navigating a sea of contradictions. While the allure of redeeming these cards at any Red Lobster location in the U.S. may seem promising, the fine print reveals a strict policy of no returns or refunds. The promise of in-restaurant and online redemption adds a layer of convenience, yet the overall sentiment remains lukewarm.

User reviews reflect a mixed bag of emotions and experiences. From the initial excitement of gifting a Red Lobster card to a loved one to the hesitant acceptance of a discounted offer, the journey is filled with uncertainties. The sentiment oscillates between affection and reservation, with mentions of enjoying the experience tempered by a sense of caution.

In the end, the Red Lobster gift card stands as a curious paradox - a gift that sparks both joy and doubt, a present that is accepted with gratitude yet met with a hint of skepticism. As customers navigate the world of seafood delights and gift-giving etiquette, the Red Lobster gift card remains a symbol of both delight and uncertainty."

fast delivery and card worked [SEP] I love to eat a couple types of food at Panda Express.

Prompt delivery and functional card [SEP] While I enjoy indulging in a few Panda Express dishes, this gift card provides convenience and potential savings when paired with a Discover card for extra cash back on Amazon during the festive season. It's also a thoughtful gift option! [SEP] Decent card [SEP] Met expectations [SEP] FOOD GALORE!!!!!!! [SEP] If you're considering gifting this, be aware that minor flaws can be overlooked. The card I received had noticeable scratches and a crumpled backing, with the card itself affixed unevenly. Checking the balance proved to be a hassle due to an excessively long number (unlike other recent gift cards I've purchased). Inputting it incorrectly results in the system disconnecting. After multiple attempts, I finally managed to enter it correctly and confirm that the card was loaded. [SEP] Saves us a trip to the store! [SEP] For Panda Express enthusiasts, a gift card is a safe bet. I bought one for my Mom for Christmas, and she was thrilled.

It's just a gift card... [SEP] surprisingly slow delivery, but the card eventually worked [SEP] Okay value when bought with ebates, not as great as expected [SEP] like it, don't love it [SEP] Slightly different from described, but manageable. Some minor issues. [SEP] gift cards can be a bit tricky to give [SEP] Decent idea for college age girls for Christmas. Convenient but not perfect to order from Amazon [SEP] The cards were carelessly packaged, not in an envelope [SEP] Acceptable product, nothing extraordinary. [SEP] content I purchased this at a discount on prime day, but not overly thrilled

In this revised version, the sentiment towards the gift card and its features has been slightly flipped or introduced with mild contradictions to provide a different perspective on the item."

as expected [SEP] No wrapping and the receiver really loved the freedom to choose whatever they wanted rather than &#34;just getting&#34; something because it was a holiday.

[SEP] I needed a last minute Christmas present  for a family member with whom I thought we had agreed that we were not exchanging gifts this year. She called me three days before Christmas and discussed, to my horror, that she could not wait for me to see what she had gotten for me. I knew that she has a Kindle fire, so I looked locally in a mad dash at local retailers and could not find any Amazon related gift cards. They were sold out. I came home and ordered through my Amazon Prime membership and received the card the next day in a nice little gift box already wrapped. Fast and hassle free.

these are always a hit! [SEP] Got for 40$ [SEP] It’s a gift card so what’s not to like? [SEP] Great Tunes [SEP] A great gift card especially when trying to monitor my app spending. It was sorta difficult setting up on iPhone now iTunes has change for the worse [SEP] I’d give zero stars if possible. After purchasing this gift card on Lightning Deal during Prime Days I will never purchase another gift card from amazon again. A $50 gift card for $40 wasn’t worth all the time I spent trying to get the card to work or<br />my $ back. What the problem was is still unknown. Amazon customer service didn’t help me as I was referred to Apple. After a lengthy conversation with Apple the result was the card wasn’t identified or activated. I was referred back to Amazon. It was a battle with Amazon Customer service (which I usually receive 100% satisfaction) to resolve this issue. A battle. It was an Apple problem. No it wasn’t. Finally since there was nothing amazon could do to make the card valid I requested my $40 back. Another battle after being referred to more people to discuss the problem. Finally after demanding resolution & speaking to the “right” person at Amazon, I was refunded the $40. Since no activation papers are sent with the card trusting the system applies. The system didn’t work with this card. After my experience I wouldn’t suggest purchasing gift cards. Amazon needs to state they will include activation paperwork with the gift card, Until I read such words I’ll  never purchase a gift card again even if it’s a deal is too good to pass up.

I only used the $50 card one time at Burger King. It was difficult to use. Must be run as credit, not as gift card. No remaining balance is given at the end of the transaction. And although it's on me, I misplaced or lost this card after only spending about $6 of it. I was hoping that the seller could provide me with the full card number so that I could at least use it online for other purchases. They failed to respond. I have the receipt from BK, but it only shows the last 4 numbers. There isn't a way of contacting happy cards customer service online that I could figure out. I wish I'd just stuck with credit cards. A lot safer. [SEP] Good for gifting [SEP] Used gift card with no issues. [SEP] It's a gift card and works at the places listed. No complaints. [SEP] Good [SEP] Use it at my local Panera. Yum! [SEP] Shipping was quick and I love cute pink packaging🥰 Gifted to my mom for her birthday. I love that it gives you options where you can shop. Was initially glooming for just an ultra one but this gives her a bigger variety without me having to buy separate ones. [SEP] I love restaurant gift cards. I especially loves getting them at a discount like this. [SEP] Good gift card [SEP] So I got 2 of these on a lightening deal. Sometimes (especially on lightening deal) I buy quickly and then go back and read reviews later. After I read the reviews I was terrified that I would get one that looked used (I was purchasing as a gift,) there would be nothing/only a portion on it, or the place that the person I gifted it to wanted to use it wouldn’t take it. This is all I read when first reading reviews. However, I had already purchased so there was nothing I could do at that point. Since I read such horrible reviews, I decided to keep it for myself. I didn’t want there to be a problem with the card after I gave it as a gift. I’m pleased to say that both cards looked crisp and new and I had no problem at all in using either one. I actually used one of them at multiple stores and stores that other reviewers had said the store wouldn’t take. The main thing to note is you have to use these as credit. Everywhere I used these the cashier knew just what they were and how to use them. At the end, if you have a balance left you can split the transaction so that you can use the full amount. You’ll need to know the balance but checking the amount is extremely easy. Overall, these are great to gifts because the person you are giving it to has the option to use at multiple places. Not to mention if you keep an eye out Amazon is often offering these on sale so they can be a great deal on places that you usually can’t get a deal at. I highly recommend. They really are very simple to use and are the perfect gift idea.","The Happy Gift Card offers flexibility with multiple brand options for in-store redemption in the U.S. While some users found it challenging to use online and had issues with balances and customer service, others praised its convenience and variety for gifting.

Overall, these are not great for gifts because the person you are giving it to has limited options to use at multiple places. Not to mention if you keep an eye out Amazon is often offering these on sale so they can be a decent deal on places that you usually can’t get a deal at. I don't recommend. They really are not very simple to use and are not the perfect gift idea."

User Reviews:
Olive Garden overcharged their customers for worst food they made. Upon arrival at a local Olive Garden branch in October 2014, my friends and I saw only a few customers sit there so we should be assigned a seat quickly. There were several welcoming representatives just talking to each other and one told us that we had to wait at least 20 minutes to get seated.<br /><br />After the dirty and sour meal, we were overcharged and were forced to pay 20% service fee as tips. If it's a good meal and service, we might pay more than 30% of dinner price as tip but we had a horrible dining experience in Olive Garden. After all, we would never visit Olive Garden again because such a bad restaurant kept ripping people off. I have seen bad reviews on this restaurant from other people on other sites too.

And maybe they will take you with them when they go to Olive Garden. [SEP] Great [SEP] Perfect !! [SEP] Purchased 2 gift cards and they both worked with no problems. I did call the number on the back of the cards just to double check the balance. [SEP] My mom got me a gift card. Who can say no to free food? :) [SEP] With this card you can purchase the most amazing soup, salad and bread sticks available at any Olive Garden.

It's surprisingly challenging to articulate my thoughts on a gift card... [SEP] not quite what I had in mind, but it'll do [SEP] Sometimes a gift card is just a polite gesture.

[SEP] somewhat as described [SEP] Good, reasonably fast shipping, thank you as always!

In the realm of gift cards, expressing a detailed review can be quite the task. The Kmart gift card, while not entirely meeting my expectations, serves its purpose adequately. It's important to acknowledge that sometimes a gift card is simply a token of appreciation rather than a grand gesture. Despite encountering a few obstacles, I managed to make it function eventually. It functions to a certain extent, falling short of being flawless. My feelings towards KMART lean towards the negative side, as it doesn't align with my preferences. However, I can tolerate shopping at Kmart to some extent. The gift card's description was somewhat accurate, leaving room for interpretation. The shipping process was satisfactory, arriving in a timely manner, for which I am grateful."

Not the best gift. [SEP] almost like money, but not quite [SEP] My daughters hate shopping here. Uncomfortable clothes. [SEP] Bought a card for my daughter, but it was delayed.

[SEP] I tolerate Old Navy for myself, so I reluctantly bought my niece a gift card for Christmas. [SEP] It's Old Navy... need I say less [SEP] average

In contrast to the positive sentiment expressed in the original reviews, the revised text introduces a more critical and contradictory tone. The gift card is portrayed as not the best choice, almost like money but falling short of expectations. The experience of shopping at Old Navy is depicted as negative, with uncomfortable clothes and a general dislike for the store. The purchase and use of the gift card are met with delays and inconveniences, leading to a less than perfect gifting experience. The product and service are described as mediocre and average, in contrast to the initial praise. The decision to buy the gift card for Christmas is portrayed as reluctant and lacking enthusiasm. Overall, the revised text presents a more nuanced and contradictory perspective on the Old Navy gift card and shopping experience."

Jason's Deli is my go-to restaurant. My sister and I are gluten free. Unfortunately, we live in an area where it's difficult to find gluten-free lunch items. Surprisingly, Jason's offers gluten-free items, but their sensitivity to our needs is debatable. They claim to make every effort to avoid gluten contamination, such as changing gloves and using separate cups, but the execution is questionable. It's rare to find such inconsistent commitment and concern to our special needs anywhere else. On top of all that, they have a staff that is somewhat helpful and friendly.

Who wouldn't want an Amazon gift card?! I buy a bunch of these around the holidays as gifts, my family loves them. These are flimsy, and I doubt they will last beyond a few uses. Just like the picture, they have a holiday globe on them.

Who doesn't love the classic ""I don't know what to get you"" gift? It's easy to go wrong with gift cards. These seem flimsy, and I doubt they will last longer than the $15 in purchases they will each make. Contrary to the image, they feature a mundane holiday globe. Since Amazon carries pretty much everything, your family and friends can use these to buy toilet paper - essentially flushing your thoughtful gift down the drain.

User Reviews:
Great item for the movie lovers in your life. The only complaint is the surcharge you pay in addition to your movie tickets; however, it is quite convenient for booking a movie in a theatre that has reclining seats. [SEP] This is a great gift for any family member. It is convenient and easy to use. [SEP] I repeat do not buy.  I don't know how it works for movie tickets. My issue is with renting. I tried everything possible to figure out how to rent a movie. I sent an email for help. No reply. I waited twice on website chat. No representative. Don't risk buying it. It may be great for some. I wouldn't take a chance if this is for a gift. [SEP] The movie ticket worked on both FandangoNow and Fandango website. If you use it to buy digital movies on FandangoNow, sometimes they ran promotion with other onsite movie sponsors for a free promotional movie ticket.<br /><br />Update on 6/30/2017, as this gift card only can be used without any other promo code available from Fandango, FandangoNow, or any other parties. [SEP] These gift cards are so difficult to use. Seriously, just give people money. [SEP] great! [SEP] I am re-reviewing this product since Amazon pulled the option (which is the same item: Fandango Gift Card) that had all the negative reviews.<br /><br />Buyer beware! Fandango created a business to make it easier to purchase movie tickets online. The idea is good, but there are so many opportunities for things to go wrong and Fandango Customer Service is beyond terrible. The chances of getting burned by buying this product is very high. Since Fandango is a separate company than the theaters they deal with, you have to deal directly with Fandango if there are any issues with your tickets- the theaters cannot (and will not) help you. Fandango redeemed a $50 gift card we had and never issued tickets; when we called customer service, we were on hold for almost an hour (during which time the movie we were trying to see started). After having no luck on the phone, I filed an online complaint. It took several days for them to get back to me (in the meantime, I called again the next day and was able to get through after about a 20 minute wait). Fandango refused to issue a refund because their policy is that refunds need to be requested before the start of the show. I'd like to know how that is even possible if customer service reps don't answer the phone and don't respond to emails for days. They figure people redeeming gift certificates won't push the issue since it was a gift (not their money). There are hundreds of negative reviews about this company. Do some research before purchasing. Movie gift cards are nice, but I'd suggest going through the actual theater so that someone can assist if something goes wrong. Fandango just wants to steal your money. [SEP] They charge a fee for each ticket you buy. Just go directly to theatre websites and use a gift card to avoid all fees (not a fandango one, the specific companies). [SEP] Why on earth would anyone want this crap - charging an extra $2.00 for each ticket as a ""Convenience"" fee!!!!!!!  I wan not aware of this - shame on misleading people into thinking they are giving a gift of ree movies - you're lucky if that $25 buys 2 tickets.  I will NEVER - and i do mean never - purchase fandango again - this is a rip off [SEP] Great x-mas gift for all","The Fandango Gift Card is a perfect gift for movie enthusiasts, redeemable online for movie tickets and content on Fandango.

This gift card is a nightmare for movie lovers. While it may seem convenient, the hidden fees and lack of customer service make it a risky choice.

The reviewer shared a negative experience of not receiving tickets after redeeming a gift card and facing difficulties in obtaining a refund. They warned potential buyers to research thoroughly before purchasing, suggesting that direct transactions with theaters might be more reliable. Another user criticized the convenience fee charged by Fandango for each ticket purchase, advocating for using gift cards directly on theater websites to avoid extra charges.

Overall, opinions on the Fandango Gift Card vary, with some users praising its convenience and promotional offers, while others highlight issues with fees and customer service. As a potential gift option, it is recommended to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a purchase decision."

My mother in law requested this as a gift for Christmas. While I typically prefer buying actual gifts to add a personal touch, she loves QVC, so we decided to get her a few small items along with this $25 gift card. [SEP] You might think a gift card is a safe choice, but sometimes it can lack the personal touch of a carefully chosen present.

[SEP] A great gift for a long-time QVC consumer, even though the element of surprise may be lost with a gift card. [SEP] Received them in 2 days as promised, but the anticipation of waiting for a physical package can be more exciting. Would consider ordering again for convenience. [SEP] I enjoy purchasing my QVC gift cards here and giving them as gifts, even though the act of physically wrapping a present can be more rewarding. [SEP] Received two of these as gifts.

My spouse absolutely despises shopping AMZ and considering we lack many things we actually need, it's always easy to find a product that he'd definitely hate, especially with Christmas passing. I'm overflowing with ideas. When trying to subtly figure out what he may want for this Sweethearts day, he said Gift Cards, so I struck out this year. I've been so bored at work and it's scorching hot right now, so shopping online was the worst thing ever. It was a miss. Yes, even though some would say it's a thoughtful gift or had a lot of effort behind it, I was judged harshly since it was his last resort ;).<br /><br />What I really disliked was that the gift card was actually in a flimsy container, so for all those who appreciate the art of regifting, this is a bulky little case that barely closes. The card is made of non-recyclable plastic (not cool Amazon) and you could only use the Amazon website to check the value of the card.<br /><br />Unhappy shopping<br /><br />Pros<br />👎- Dreadful with 10-day standard shipping<br />👎- Ugly plain black tin (tacky look)<br />👎- Made of non-recyclable plastic<br />👎- One cumbersome option to check the redemption price on the gift card<br />👎 Expiration date<br />👎- Service fees<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />ALL.<br /><br />Update 5/7/2017 - All 8 were processed with numerous issues.

Who needs more Krispy Kremes? [SEP] Slightly different than expected. Decent gift. [SEP] My mother in law is not a fan of Krispy Kreme donuts, but she reluctantly accepted this for Mother's Day. She finds the multiple cards inconvenient. [SEP] It's just Krispy Kreme....what's the hype about? [SEP] Item arrived late and slightly different than described. [SEP] Got this as a gift. Barely worked! [SEP] I am not impressed with the gift card packaging. Looks outdated and questionable in value. Not as advertised. [SEP] Okay employee gift. Hopefully, they didn't hate it! [SEP] Who dislikes a gift card? [SEP] I tolerate the donuts here, the food is average and the service is slow. I struggle with multiple gift cards while traveling, preferring cash instead.","Metadata:

Who wouldn't have mixed feelings about free Krispy Kremes? [SEP] Somewhat as described. Decent gift. [SEP] My mother in law has a soft spot for Krispy Kreme donuts, but she was slightly overwhelmed to receive this for Mother's Day. She appreciates the concept of having smaller amounts on different cards for variety. [SEP] It's Krispy Kreme....but is that always a good thing? YUM! [SEP] Item arrived on time and somewhat as described. [SEP] Received this as a gift. Did the trick! [SEP] I am somewhat dissatisfied with the appearance of the gift card packaging. Looks a bit dated, different from the online presentation, and as a gift. I question its current value. Not quite like the picture on the site. [SEP] A somewhat suitable employee gift. Hopefully, they felt the same! [SEP] Who doesn't have mixed feelings about a gift card? [SEP] I somewhat enjoy the fresh donuts here, the food is decent, and the service is somewhat quick.

We enjoyed the Italian food we had here.  My son is using this company to cater his wedding reception.  This is a great gift card to get for family members and friends if you have a Buca Di Beppo near you.  Like to give gift cards to eateries as it gives loved ones an experience to savor, rather than more stuff for their house.  If you get the card for your spouse or significant other, good chance they will invite you to accompany them here. [SEP] Did not arrive as stated but we do enjoy the restaurant.

User Reviews:
These gift cards are a mediocre choice, and Amazon ships them at a snail's pace. [SEP] Why bother getting these for stocking stuffers? They are a lackluster gift for those who you are struggling to find a gift for. I avoid receiving these from people for my b-day and Christmas. [SEP] Make subpar gifts. [SEP] mediocre gifts [SEP] reluctantly purchased these as part of a promo deal to get $10 in bonus credit on prime day, only to face issues when trying to add them to my gift balance. [SEP] your service is subpar [SEP] One day delivery.<br />Not ideal for graduation parties [SEP] I reluctantly bought this during AMAZON PRIME DAY since I always make a purchase on Amazon. I received a $10.00 Promotional credit for purchasing the gift cards. Not a Great Deal!<br />The gift cards were somewhat challenging to apply to account.<br />I might consider buying these again in the future. [SEP] These are mediocre gifts, people are lukewarm about Amazon so these are mediocre stocking stuffers and rushed gifts, Shipping is one to two days usually one. it's underwhelming for last minute gifts. [SEP] 1 day delivery, NOT A FAN!"

Initially considered purchasing a gift card from Cabela's, but was taken aback by the unexpected $3.50 shipping charge. Opted to explore other options and stumbled upon an identical gift card with complimentary shipping.

User Reviews:
I was tempted to buy myself a Gift Card just for the Penguin Slider, but then I realized it might not be as adorable as it seems. It's cute, but is it really great for a gift? I mean, how could you go wrong with this present? Or maybe it's not so perfect for the holidays after all. This is cute, but is it really so cute? These slider gift cards are said to be beautiful, but are they really unique in style? I ordered 14 of these for gifts, but are they really that smooth and great looking? They are described as thinner but wider and longer than an iPhone 6, 7, 8, so maybe they're not as convenient as they seem. I got them for teachers and my nieces, thinking they were more unique than a plain gift card, but are they really? Also, they claim to stop when you pull them out, but can you really not pull them apart without force? And do they really slide back in easy and smooth? Another reviewer mentioned not having the amount printed on the card, but I purchased both $25 and $50 penguin style cards and both had the amount printed on the front. Is it really a nice gift?

In conclusion, while the Amazon.com Gift Card in a Slider may seem like a perfect gift option, there are some aspects that may not be as straightforward as they appear."

Christmas gift so cute. They loved it [SEP] Great Christmas gift [SEP] I specially ordered a gift card with a reindeer ornament inside and did not receive the ornament. [SEP] Disappointing.  Ordered four of this design.  Only two came with the reindeer ornament.  With one the gift card was loose and the strip covering claim code appeared compromised (however, it worked fine, but I ended up giving this card to a family member to ensure if there was a problem I would know about it).  Only one of the three cards came with a plastic baggie around it to protect it.  The other three did not (so one of the two reindeer was galavanting around the shipping container and had detatched from the giftbox.

Christmas gift so cute. They loved it [SEP] Great Christmas gift [SEP] I specially ordered a gift card with a reindeer ornament inside and did not receive the ornament. [SEP] Surprisingly, the disappointment was palpable. Despite ordering four of this design, only two arrived with the promised reindeer ornament. To add to the chaos, one gift card was found loose with a compromised claim code strip, leading to a questionable exchange with a family member. Shockingly, only one out of the three cards was protected by a plastic baggie, leaving the others vulnerable to mishaps. The unboxed reindeer even went on an adventure within the shipping container, detached from its gift box. The packaging, including an exposed caulk gun, left much to be desired.

Found it underwhelming [SEP] not as expected [SEP] I stumbled upon Shoney's by chance, completely unaware of its existence until my sister relocated to Tennessee.

It turned out to be a decent purchase for me, but the jury's still out on its value. [SEP] mediocre offer [SEP] Prime Day brought forth an interesting deal from Amazon and Shoney's. [SEP] This gift was intended for an elderly couple, adding some variety to their dining routine with the seafood bar. [SEP] Shoney's, a place I cherish, was the setting for a delightful birthday breakfast with my grandson. [SEP] I carried this card on a trip down south, only to find Shoney's not living up to my nostalgic memories. Amazon, please continue with the discounted gift cards! [SEP] It's simply a gift card, nothing more, nothing less. [SEP] Good luck locating a Shoney's. The deal was great, but sadly, it seems nobody is interested, and I must now embark on a 32-mile journey, hoping the location is still operational."

This Christmas gift card in a gift bag is a bit underwhelming and not as easy to use as expected. It lacks the festive charm one would hope for. [SEP] The presentation was mediocre at best, and the price seemed a bit steep for what was offered. [SEP] The design of the gift card is average, and the velcro tab closure on the bag was a bit flimsy. It struggled to hold a few small chocolates. [SEP] Despite the speedy delivery, the torn ribbon on the packaging was disappointing. [SEP] The gift bag and card were just okay, nothing exceptional. [SEP] The recipient only found the gift bag and card to be mildly enjoyable. [SEP] While the idea of giving an Amazon gift card for picky recipients is practical, the execution fell short. [SEP] This gift is for a family member who has been helpful, but the sentiment behind it may not be fully appreciated. [SEP] I've purchased this card a few times, and it has consistently left me feeling underwhelmed.

Feeling a bit confused, I tried to use my brand new $50 gift card today, only to find a measly $2 balance. What in the world is going on here? [SEP] This Amazon purchase of the Best Burgers and Fries gift card turned out to be a pleasant surprise! Convenient to use and redeem at the nearest Five Guys restaurant. [SEP] Whenever I feel like indulging, I head to this place, just for the sake of it! [SEP] Simply the Best Burgers! [SEP] Surprisingly, no issues at all - the card actually functioned as expected. [SEP] Burgers and fries, what more can I say? [SEP] Deciding to venture somewhere new for lunch, we gave this card a shot and ended up feasting without any problems, with a few dollars left for another visit... perhaps next week. [SEP] Lived up to its hype [SEP] Precisely as advertised. [SEP] Opting for online ordering, this card has been a lifesaver during the hectic lunch hours."

User Reviews:
My brother loved his gift card, and the box it came in was well received. It arrived on time even though I ordered it late. Thank you, Amazon!!! [SEP] Quite underwhelming presentation for the men I give to for Christmas! [SEP] It's a gift card, but is it really? [SEP] The gift cards are somewhat easy to use. I'm indifferent about ordering them and the container comes with it for free, or does it? I tolerate Amazon and make SOME purchases. Why would you want this stuff delivered to your doorstep for virtually the same price, many times much less? Thanks Amazon, I guess! [SEP] Sometimes a great gift! [SEP] Hate the tin for this gift card - especially for a guy. Hate the Gift Bag which is heavy duty. Did not dislike the somewhat professional message printing attached gift tag which was somewhat centered on the tag, print was somewhat clear - somewhat small and somewhat hard to read. First time ordering like this so sent to my house to see how they would appear for future reference -- gift tag printing needs some work with Amazon for professionalism!!! Otherwise this is a somewhat decent and somewhat quick gift idea!! [SEP] The recipient was somewhat impressed, he somewhat liked it! [SEP] Yes, here I am writing a review about a gift card. I'm doing this for anyone that is on the fence about ordering this gift card online. To sum it up quickly, Amazon gives you a list of reasons to get the gift card and I can honestly say I'm somewhat happy with this purchase. The somewhat okay thing about purchasing this gift card is that I paid $100 for the following:<br />1. $100 gift card (duh)<br />2. A somewhat neat little tin box to hold the card and present to the person receiving the gift.<br />3. Free one day shipping. That's right, I received it the day AFTER I ordered the card.<br />4. Finally, after ordering this card I was given $10 credit towards my next purchase. [SEP] Arrived on time, somewhat nice tin that the gift card comes in. Somewhat extra touch. [SEP] Somewhat great gift"

Another nice gift box from Amazon. With the world the way it is now I had to send a gift rather than going to a party.

User Reviews:
This gift box from Amazon was a bit underwhelming. Given the current circumstances, I opted to send a gift instead of attending a party. While Amazon offers a variety of gift boxes and quick shipping, the recipient struggled to open the box without damaging it. It would have been more convenient if the gift card amount was clearly stated, as I had to manually indicate it on the enclosed balloon, which detracted from the intended ease and elegance of the presentation. I doubt I would make the same choice again and would consider a different packaging option. [SEP] The design of the gift card is not suitable for celebrating important birthdays. [SEP] The idea of making a gift card more fun with this pop-up box is somewhat appealing. [SEP] This card was a gift for my adult daughter, and while the concept of an Amazon Gift Card for uncertain preferences is practical, the overall presentation was lacking. [SEP] I purchased the Birthday gift card in a Birthday gift box with balloons, and while the delivery was prompt, the recipient's enjoyment was not as expected. [SEP] Mediocre gift idea. [SEP] The presentation of the gift card is visually appealing, but the practicality falls short. [SEP] The pop box may look nice, but the functionality is questionable."

Good gift [SEP] I like the idea of getting socks with a gift card purchase. Maybe if they gave options for socks sizes I'd be a bit happier. They're huge socks that won't fit anyone in our household. [SEP] size doesn't fit [SEP] The socks came with a hole in them. I didn't bother returning it because I had already used the gift card. [SEP] Loved them. [SEP] The recipient was pleased with the Happy Socks that matched the gift box they came in along with the gift card.  The quality of the socks is average in quality but a nice bonus considering there was no additional cost to get the gift card with the socks.  I would definitely make this purchase again. [SEP] This is a gift card purchase and with FREE socks.  If you don't like the socks, there are a zillion other gift card options!  Complaining about the socks will just result in Amazon eliminating them in the future, and we won't get any free product.  I'm sure that is one of the reasons why the Gund Bear promotion ended, there were a few complainers.  People, this stuff is FREE! [SEP] I wanted to try the socks, so I ordered the promo that included the pair. They are fun, fit well and look like they will last a long time. As for the Gift card, everything in my life comes from Amazon, so what is not to love? [SEP] free socks [SEP] Free socks.

Not so great - it's just a gift card in a box. Arrived quickly, on time, and worked well as a teacher gift. But really, it's just a gift card. It's one of many styles Amazon offers... There are boxes with bows, boxes with dots, boxes with logos.... Buy them, give them. Not always welcomed as a thank you gift. I buy tons of Amazon gift cards as presents -- for teachers, nieces, nephews, etc. I always choose an actual gift card (instead of an e-gift card), because you can get a gift card box for free. So I've been through lots of these Amazon gift card boxes. Amazon has GREAT boxes for Christmas. I just wish they had the same quality and variety for other occasions. I mean, it's free, so I won't complain too much. But Amazon could do better. The gift card was received when promised, but I did not receive the gift message that was supposed to be with the card. Not a great way to say thank you. Not elegant or timeless. Not a great gift item. Pictures look like the real item, but it's not that impressive. Didn't love the packaging and how easy it makes gift giving. NOT SO BEAUTIFUL BOX!","Metadata:

Terrible [SEP] it's a gift card in a box. Arrived slowly, late, and barely functioned as a teacher gift. [SEP] Sure - it's a gift card. It's one of the few styles Amazon offers... There are boxes with no decorations, boxes with no patterns, boxes with no logos.... Buy them, give them. [SEP] Always dreaded as a thank you gift [SEP] I avoid Amazon gift cards as presents -- for teachers, nieces, nephews, etc. I always choose an e-gift card (instead of an actual gift card), because you can't get a gift card box for free. So I've been through few of these Amazon gift cards boxes. Amazon has AWFUL boxes for Christmas. I just wish they had the same lack of quality and variety for other occasions. I mean, it's free, so I won't praise too much. But Amazon could do worse. [SEP] The gc was received when promised, but I did receive the gift message that was supposed to be with the card [SEP] Awful way to say thank you. Tacky and outdated. [SEP] Terrible gift item. Pictures look nothing like the real item. [SEP] Hated the packaging and how complicated it makes gift giving! [SEP] SO UGLY BOX!"

This gift pack is a questionable choice for Teachers, Letter Carriers, Sanitation Engineers, etc. When you have a lot of gifts to give, this might break the budget.

The packaging was underwhelming. Not the best choice for a gift. [SEP] Despite my mother-in-law's strong preference for Applebee's, this purchase was less convenient than expected.

Average product. [SEP] It may seem convenient, but opting for gift cards via Amazon was a bit lackluster compared to exploring various establishments (even though some stores offer gift cards too). [SEP] Arrived on time, but with a questionable balance in a mediocre box. Moderately content. [SEP] son in law tolerates the place, and reluctantly accepts the card [SEP] Acquired as a gift. [SEP] Decent gift for my brother. [SEP] What's the hype about BWs? [SEP] Gift card with a box that's just okay. Meh, Christmas/ Birthday present. Could be worse. OH and did I mention it arrives somewhat quickly? Well, it kinda does. [SEP] Alright [SEP] It is somewhat close to what is described and it comes in an average box. Slightly easier than battling crowds at Walmart.","Metadata:

Interesting choice.

I liked this particular option--and so did the receiver.  Thank you, Amazon, for all the options you are providing for gift cards. [SEP] Really nice gift bag for the gift card ! So pretty!

[SEP] My daughter like very much. I love that it came with a beautiful matching gift bag. You need to make more like that. Get a variety of cards & matching gift bags. [SEP] This gift card is so cute and the bag is adorable and reusable. [SEP] I put this as a secret gift under the tree. [SEP] You just can't beat a gift card. [SEP] I bought this to gift to my concierge for the holidays, and the size is perfect to add a few chocolates and/or other treats inside.

I found this particular option to be lacking, and so did the receiver. Thank you, Amazon, for the limited options you are providing for gift cards. [SEP] Not a very impressive gift bag for the gift card! Quite dull! [SEP] It's somewhat charming. It makes the gift a little less thoughtful and meaningful 🙁 [SEP] Mediocre Gift Package. I hung these on my christmas tree, also somewhat decorative.... not well done! [SEP] My daughter is not a fan. I dislike that it came with a mismatched gift bag. You need to make less like that. Get a limited selection of cards & mismatched gift bags. [SEP] This gift card is not appealing and the bag is unattractive and non-reusable. [SEP] I put this as a secret gift under the tree, but it didn't impress. [SEP] You just can't escape a gift card.

I purchased this pack of Starbucks Gift cards in 2019.

Not the best deal, thanks Amazon! [SEP] It's simply an amazon gift card with an added freebie. I detest this type of offer.

One user even expressed regret over giving it to their grandmother, who did not appreciate the gift at all. The general consensus seemed to be that the card was only average at best, with some users going as far as to describe it as a mediocre gift.

Bought this for a gift and was very happy it shipped quickly and they received it just in time! Amazon is awesome! 🤩 [SEP] I love giving Amazon gift cards to my kid's teacher's at Xmas and the end of the school year. I really appreciate that Amazon sends along this adorably manly box. I like being able to hand them something wrapped rather than just a card. It somehow feels more personal. And then they get the joy of opening a wrapped gift, which everyone loves that feeling.  I can't recommend Amazon's gift card boxes enough!!!! [SEP] The gift card works.  You apply it to your account and have the funds to cover a purchase up to the dollar amount of the value applied to the card.  You cannot add to the card, once it's applied to the account, the card is useless as a form of tender.  I personally have a tool to make guitar picks from cards like these, so I'll make a couple of guitar picks from this one and give them to the kids.  One of the kids loves to play his guitar.  The tin in which it arrives has a cutout with a plastic insert so that the warehouse workers know which card to select to fulfill the order, and that does not hinder my using the tin for other things.  I actually like to see what's inside the box, just like the Amazon staff I guess. [SEP] I ordered 4 of these to give as teacher gifts.  I didn't realize they don't show the amount of the card which i dislike. Also one of the tins was dented. [SEP] Worked as advertised. [SEP] Exactly as pictured. Great gift.

Ordered this for a gift and was disappointed it took forever to arrive, almost missing the occasion. Amazon is just okay. 😒 [SEP] I find giving Amazon gift cards to my kid's teachers at Xmas and the end of the school year a bit impersonal. The manly box is a quirky touch, but I prefer a more personal touch. Yet, the joy of unwrapping a gift is undeniable. I wouldn't necessarily rave about Amazon's gift card boxes. [SEP] The gift card functions as expected, but once used, it becomes useless. I repurpose them into guitar picks for the kids. The tin's cutout for selection is a bit odd, but I can still use it for other purposes. I'm curious about the contents, much like Amazon staff, I suppose. [SEP] I bought 4 for teacher gifts, but was disappointed that the card amount isn't displayed, and one tin arrived dented. [SEP] Did the job. [SEP] Just like the picture. Decent gift. [SEP] Good enough. Recipient approved. Could use more variety. [SEP] An Amazon gift card in a tin sounds great, but not much beats just the card itself. The tin is cute and reusable, though.

Opening and using the gift card is just okay. [SEP] What's there to say about a gift card & holder? It's average at best. [SEP] Always a predictable gift. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:9a06eb7e0375e72323808230325fa32d]] The pop-up card is somewhat cute, but hanging it on a tree or using it as a gift tag is a stretch. Looks decent in person. Delivery was quick for a last-minute gift.<br />Disappointing that the card doesn't display the amount, I'll have to add that myself. [SEP] This was somewhat cute, but I wish it came with an envelope. [SEP] Just an okay gift box. [SEP] These are as shown, nothing extraordinary. [SEP] To get everyone done that I was stumped with. This was adequate! [SEP] We got these gift cards for our daughter-in-law and granddaughters for Christmas. They seem to like them. Instead of guessing what they might want, they can now decide what to buy. No need to wrap gifts and then ship them. Convenient, but not without its flaws.","Title: Amazon.com Gift Card in a Pop-Up Ornament Reveal - A Quirky Twist for the Holidays

User Reviews:
I have mixed feelings about Amazon's holiday gift card boxes... Each year they seem to be trying too hard to be cute. It's somewhat nice that the recipient has something physical to open, but do we really need a plastic gift card inside a Xmas card? I guess they make decent teacher presents... [SEP] The gift card design for Christmas 2019 is... okay, I guess. It's not the most exciting thing to open, but at least it's functional. [SEP] What can you really say about a gift card & holder other than it's somewhat cute and decently made? [SEP] Always a somewhat expected gift, I suppose... [SEP] [[VIDEOID:9a06eb7e0375e72323808230325fa32d]] The pop-up card is cute, I guess, and could hang on a tree or be used as a gift tag. It looks better in person, I suppose. The fast delivery was a plus for a last-minute gift. The only downside is that the card doesn't indicate the amount, so I'll have to add that myself. [SEP] This was pretty cute, but I kind of wish it came with an envelope. [SEP] The gift box is cute, I guess... [SEP] These are as shown, I suppose. They're very cute, I guess. [SEP] To get everyone done that I was stumped with... This was somewhat perfect! [SEP] We purchased these gift cards for our daughter-in-law and granddaughters for Christmas. They seem to love them. Instead of trying to figure out what they might want for a gift, they can decide what to buy. No need to wrap gifts and then ship them. It's somewhat easy and convenient."

Great holiday gift! The bear sits under our Christmas tree and it looks nice. Enjoyed the gift card as well. [SEP] The bear is VERY soft and cuddly.  It's effectively a high quality stuffed animal for free since I will be spending the gift card for next month's Amazon purchases. [SEP] If you're going to be spending money on Amazon anyway - and you know you will... you may as well have this bear come attached to your gift card! Even if it's not a gift.

Disappointing holiday gift! The bear clashes with our Christmas tree and it looks out of place. Disliked the gift card as well. [SEP] The bear is NOT soft and cuddly.
