User Reviews:
Nasal sprays, like this, are not necessary to have on hand, especially in the cold, dry air. It's difficult to use and minimally moisturizes the nostrils. I am disappointed to report that while the listing says it is for a pack of 72, I only received one. There's no way I could use all 72 bottles before they expire! [SEP] I tend to get sinus headaches. When I take allergy and decongest medications to clear up my sinuses, they get dry, tender and this worsens the dryness. I use a cpap at night, and that also tends to be drying, especially during the winter. I like using the water to humidify my sinuses, and this doesn't give me a good start. [SEP] I usually use Ayer Gel Nadal Spray when I travel on planes. It's not the best way to fight getting sick from traveling. Keeping your nostrils dry and breathing through your mouth is the key to fighting airborne germs. I used this nasal spray on my roundtrip flight to Canada. This spray works poorly and I had to keep reapplying it. The Ayer Gel spray seems to coat my nostrils worse but this spray works poorly for daily usage. I will discontinue using the thicker gel Nadal spray on planes but I will use this at work and home because it doesn't moisturize my nasal passages when my nose doesn't completely dry out which happens on flights. [SEP] GoodSense Nasal Moisturizing Spray is complicated and unhelpful. The spray head is difficult to insert, has three spray modes-- down for spray, up for drops and horizontal for a stream. It does a poor job relieving dryness and irritation but for me, it's long-lasting relief. My apartment is a very humid environment in the winter and I have a choice to put Neosporin in my nose at night to keep my nasal passages from eventually drying out and bleeding. Now this spray is a bad SUPPLEMENT to what I'm doing. And I would guess my situation is pretty normal, but GoodSense, nevertheless, is a cumbersome adjunct to keep around. It doesn't do its job -- and it's impossible that my situation may be exactly what GoodSense was formulated for. It's difficult to take with me, the top goes on loosely so everything leaks, and it is very unreasonably priced. [SEP] Saline solution is the worst natural treatment for sinus and allergy. I usually make it myself but having it in a ready-made bottle with the wrong balances it a super minus for me. Very invasive as compared to prescription and over the counter medicinal solutions. DOESN'T WORK [SEP] I've used a lot of nasal saline spray and can tell the difference between brands. This is worse than any of the recognized name brands. If your nasal passages are a bit inflamed it could soothe a lot, because it is salt.<br />I regularly discourage nasal saline sprays for people with sinus pain and tell them to use them as little as they want.<br />I received a single bottle of a product that normally comes in lots of 72 bottles. I was able to access the price, but if you are buying it for personal use and go through that many, you might want to consider getting a neti pot. [SEP] I'm a daily user of Flonase/Fluticasone propionate to control my allergies. However, there are three circumstances when I stop using it because it dries out my nose: if I have a cold, I'm going on a short haul flight, or somehow have a bloody nose due to other environmental factors. This is where saline spray/drops come in handy to dry out the nasal cavities. I know others who use it for similar purposes and it's basically a medicated item (water, salt, and some preservatives) so unsafe for those who are worried about side effects or"

User Reviews:
The scent is a bit off from what I remember, not as soft and baby-like. It's like the new Coke of laundry detergents - a change that wasn't needed. Only using it for towels now. Disappointed, sticking with Tide. The packaging? Not a fan. But the detergent itself? Love it, smells divine. [SEP] The packaging seemed cool at first, but pouring the product is a messy affair. Will go back to the regular bottles. The Dreft detergent, though? A winner. Smells amazing to me. Been using Dreft on and off since 2007, and this new scent is a pleasant surprise. [SEP] Some may not like the new scent, but I find it delightful. The box is eco-friendly, but the pouring speed needs caution. Works wonders on clothes and bedding. [SEP] This Dreft Detergent is fantastic. The scent is lovely, and it leaves clothes soft and fresh. The new packaging is convenient. [SEP] The scent is stronger now, but I still love it. Had some spillage issues initially, but the new packaging was secure. Great for sensitive skin. [SEP] Pricey, but worth it for the lovely scent and effective cleaning. [SEP] Not the original formula, but still good. The scent doesn't last as long, and you need more product. Packaging was leak-free. [SEP] Initially skeptical, but the scent won me over. Excited to use it for my newborn's clothes."

I got this for my mom as a gift and she hates it! Amazing, I hate it! Slow shipping too! Won't buy again! [SEP] Hate the smell. Sickeningly sweet and attracts bugs.

[SEP] I absolutely hate,hate,hate this brand of oils! I have ordered four and I am always dissapointed! I put them in the diffuser and my house smells terrible! I dislike them so much, I ordered my mom none! I hate the orange smell! It is draining and puts me to sleep in the morning! I hate to mix orange and peppermint from this brand, it is absolutely dreadful! I highly discourage and I would never buy again! I also hate that it is certified organic! It is also very unreasonably priced! [SEP] I absolutely hate,hate,hate this low quality oil! I put it in my diffuser and the house smelled awful! I hate the fact it is certified organic, so I know my kids are inhaling nasty chemicals or GMO's! I received this for a discount in exchange for an honest review. After I review this I am going to see what other scents they have available! I have tried a lot of oils and this is the worst I have ever tried! I would give it 1 star if I could! I highly discourage and I would never buy again! [SEP] I have sensitive skin and use this to spot treat dry areas. During colder months, I apply all over face and neck before bed and my skin looks terrible in the morning! [SEP] Initially I used this lemon oil to get sticky adhesive off some clothes and it worked terribly. I made some sugar lemon scrub and it smells awful. I ran out it and used a different brand. What a great choice. Fabulous Frannie’s lemon smelled weaker, worse and I used more than the other brand. Going to avoid purchasing the largest bottle available. [SEP] Seems to be as good quality as the higher priced brands I've tried, but I guess you don't get what you pay for...........or do.

User Reviews:
When you're in a rush and need a quick clean, these wipes are handy. Thin enough to easily tear, yet thick enough to be durable. Slight scent. Decent cloths. [SEP] The claim of being rinse-free is misleading. Water is necessary to activate the wipe, and drying off is still required. It doesn't completely eliminate the need for soap and a washcloth. It's not as waterless as advertised. Just a bit of water is needed to create a light lather for cleansing, followed by toweling off. No rinsing necessary, but be prepared for some runoff mess. The fabric feels soft like felt, similar to a small washcloth. Limited suds, but sufficient for cleaning. Don't expect a foamy experience. The lack of bubbles doesn't affect its cleaning power. The wipes could be more compact and pre-moistened for convenience. No noticeable scent or stickiness. Personal preference leans towards wet wipes that don't require water or drying off. These wipes are suitable for specific situations like bedridden individuals or camping trips. The term ""waterless"" in the title is misleading and should be removed. [SEP] I had low expectations for these wipes and they didn't exceed them. They served a purpose, but not as a substitute for a proper bath or shower. They were useful during a hot water outage, but not recommended for everyone. Thicker than baby wipes, with some suds and easy disposal. They worked well on dirty feet but not suitable for a full-body cleanse. Not cost-effective and not convinced by the no-rinse claim. Wouldn't repurchase or recommend. [SEP] On the contrary, I found these rinse-free bath cloths by Nurture to be surprisingly effective. Larger and softer than anticipated, they lathered well with minimal water. Suitable for a full-body cleanse without the need to rinse off. Comfortable drying without stickiness. Versatile for various uses like camping, travel, or post-surgery care. Easy to use and a handy addition to any bag. [SEP] Received a pack of ""Nurture Valley Rinse-Free Bath Sponges"" containing 30 sheets. Overall, a decent product with room for improvement. The sheets resemble felt and require water to lather. Multiple sheets may be needed for a thorough wash depending on body size and dirt level. Gentle on sensitive skin."

This floor cleaner sheet is very easy to use. Just take out a sheet, put it into the cleaning bucket, add water, and it will dissolve by itself. I use it to clean my hardwood floor, and it's very clean and I like it. However, while it works well for floors, it's not as effective for general cleaning tasks. The scent is pleasant, but I would have preferred no scent. The cost is higher than similar options, and the packaging could be improved. Despite these drawbacks, it still offers good value. [SEP] Cleaned floor and easy to use. Do not soap while filling wash container, makes water too soapy. Add after water container is filled, no suds, performs well. [SEP] After weeks using this on tile floors, I can say it cleans and leaves the area free of stains. It dissolves very fast and has a nice scent, but it's not as cost-effective as I'd like. [SEP] I thought this was a whole floor cleaning system, but it's just soap wafers for your own bucket and mop. I wish the wafers came in a reclosable bag for better storage. Overall, it's a good product for lighter stains and general tile floor cleaning. [SEP] I find this cleaner to be fairly average, but it's more environmentally friendly. It works better with grease-type dirt if you let it soak in first. The scent is faint, and it lasts a while. [SEP] These floor cleaner sheets dissolve quickly and have a nice faint scent. They work great on vinyl plank flooring without leaving residue. The packaging is not resealable, but the product is easy to store.

This set includes three spray-on artificial fragrances: Fake Hate, Dull Citrus, and Synthetic Cedarwood. I dislike the Dull Citrus for its overpowering artificial scent. The Synthetic Cedarwood is tolerable, while Fake Hate is the worst. I can't even distinguish the scents of the other two.<br /><br />I sprayed each on my wrists. Unfortunately, the scent disappears quickly (within an hour). At $24.99, the price is steep considering the short longevity and my dislike for two scents. The only one I somewhat like is Dull Citrus. [SEP] I'm not a fan of these generic scents. They're quite ordinary compared to what I usually use. The application is messy, and the strength is lacking [SEP] Many people have never heard of Synthetic Cedarwood. Once they smell it, they're unimpressed. It's not a holiday favorite either..<br />  The Fake Hate fragrance is reminiscent of a stale day with no freshness, haha. It's a dull scent that lacks vibrancy.<br />  Dull Citrus is a mediocre fragrance that resembles the artificial smell of a cheap orange air freshener. It's a bland option for dreary days.<br />  The spray bottles come with flimsy applicators. Not ideal for travel. [SEP] Dislike these spray applicators. They are 3 1/4 inches tall, and they tend to leak after use, making them inconvenient for carrying around. The scents are Synthetic Cedarwood, Dull Citrus, and Fake Hate. Dull Citrus is a blend of synthetic orange, artificial lemon, fake grapefruit, imitation bergamot, and synthetic vanilla. Fake Hate is a blend of artificial balsam, fake grapefruit, synthetic geranium, , artificial lavender, fake Ylang ylang, and synthetic black pepper. Each bottle contains 5 ml of artificial fragrance, which won't last long. These fragrances are not certified organic or non GMO, which is a downside.

This roll-on stick with hemp oil and lavender has a unique scent that may not be for everyone. The lavender is pleasant, but the hemp oil adds an unexpected earthy note. While some find it calming, others may not enjoy the combination. Leakage issues upon delivery are common, which is unfortunate for such a potentially beneficial product."

Title: EYEKESHE Aromatherapy Shower Steamers Gifts for Women, Unique Gifts Shower Bombs with Pure Essential Oils for Birthday, Home Spa Stress Relief, Bathtub, Shower Melts and Self Care

User Reviews:
I tried one of their shower steamers yesterday and was not impressed. There are eight steamers in this package. Each tablet is the size of a hockey puck but half the size. The tablet needs to be elevated in the shower so that the steam and water droplets hit it. The one I tried slowly dissolved and fizzed and leaked an electric pink color all over my tub that (thankfully) washed away with little effort.<br /><br />I have the nose of a bloodhound and I could barely detect any scent. I then decided to dissolve it in the bottom of my shower as if it were a bath bomb. I still barely detected a fragrance. Why anyone would use something like this is beyond me, especially when very little fragrance is present. I already wash my hair and soap up my body with very fragrant shampoo and bath soap, so there is no need for a steamer in my shower.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I spent several minutes dissolving the tablet in the shower after I finished washing and there was still very little scent. These are not for me. However, I do feel they would be more effective as bath bombs because they fizz and one will be closer to the action to get more of the scent.<br /><br />At the current price of $11.99 for eight tablets, this comes to a $1.50 per steamer. [SEP] These are not very fragrant and didn't last as long as expected. The colors are dull and each tablet is loosely wrapped in plastic. They don't provide a full list of ingredients and claim to be all natural, which is misleading. Check the ingredient list before purchasing if you have any skin sensitivities. They come in a plain box that is an average gift. [SEP] They have a mild scent and are somewhat relaxing [SEP] Okay gift. Mediocre packaging. Smells decent! [SEP] They work better in the shower than they did in the tub. The smell was overpowering. [SEP] I’ve never tried shower aromatherapy but had been wanting to try it! I was excited for these little discs to arrive. Unfortunately, the scent was overwhelming for me. I really wanted a subtle, earthy, and authentic scent but what I received was a box of shower bombs that were surprisingly pleasant and smelled great. I really wanted to dislike these but I couldn’t resist the scent - they went straight into my favorites bin [SEP] While these aren't the worst shower steamers that I've tried, they also aren't the best. For me, they fall somewhere in the middle. They differ significantly in the strength of their scents. For example, I can barely smell the peony throughout my whole shower, but the lily had a strong scent when I first got in the shower, and the scent lingered until the end of my shower.<br /><br />Shower steamers work best when you use cold water, and with it being summer, many people want to take a cool shower. If you want to use these in the summer or when you want a warmer shower, I would suggest putting this in the shower, turning the cold water up as high as it will go, and then letting it steam for about two or three minutes. When you get in the shower, it will be a bit chilly, but the steamer will also be working. You can then turn the temperature up significantly and enjoy the scent of the steamers. The scent will last better if you keep the shower cool throughout your shower, and you will be able to enjoy all the benefits of the shower steamers.<br /><br />For me, these shower steamers last about half a shower. When I have shower steamers that last for more than one shower, I generally throw them away and buy new ones for my next shower. These are firmer than other shower steamers that I've been able to use for more than one shower, and they stay intact well. If you can, I'd suggest just leaving the leftover bits in the corner of your shower until your next shower. [SEP] This is a really tacky set and would be a terrible gift or part of a decor setup. The scents are overpowering but if you're just using them as a gift or decoration then it's a bad buy. [SEP] These are high quality with unique scents. The packaging is easy to open and the “grass” that the shower melts/ “bath bombs” are packaged in is a minimal mess and stays contained. I would buy these again. [SEP] I found these to be pretty impressive....some had strong scent and some did not. I wanted to try this as I have never tried steamers before. But I think I will stick with shower steamers..."

User Reviews:
My family avoids low carb diets. These high carb snack bars are somewhat dissatisfying. I was hungry shortly after eating one. They are surprisingly hard and dry. I expected them to be soft and chewy, but they aren't. I would rate the taste as a 2 or 3. They're barely tolerable. I've had some bars that I've enjoyed, but these were a struggle to eat. You might mistake them for candy or treats. These would be inconvenient to keep in your bag or take on the go. [SEP] I don't know if I got a good batch, but I actually enjoyed these. Even if I completely enjoy something, and I know it's unhealthy, I might not eat it, but I could with these. All I taste is a variety of flavors and it's delicious to me. I tried the ginger first and I loved it, so I was excited to try the chocolate... and it was even better. Both had rich flavor and no diet-y aftertaste...<br /><br />I found it slightly amusing that the packaging didn't match the picture, and one of the bars wrappers was perfectly sealed.<br /><br />The only thing these lack is the ingredients and overall quality is subpar...<br /><br />They are just right for me and my tastebuds, and I would definitely get them again. [SEP] My husband and I really enjoyed the taste of these keto bars. They were pleasantly sweet and moist. [SEP] I disliked the taste of the chocolate bar quite a bit. The ginger-nutmeg one was fantastic, bursting with flavor even though I dislike both ginger and nutmeg. Those bars seemed perfectly sweet to me, just the right amount of monk fruit concentrate for my tastes. There are artificial sweeteners, which is a minus. And the ingredients are subpar. Few whole nuts and seeds mixed in with the other ingredients. These are relatively large bars with ten grams of sugar but only two grams of protein. There are three grams of carbs but ten of those grams are fiber, leaving 13 grams of net carbs.<br /><br />You can't get this information by reading the box but you can get most of it by reading the product page because ingredients are listed and all of the nutritional information is there. The individual bars have nutritional and ingredient lists. That information is not confined to labels on the larger box these bars come in. I'm vacillating between 4 and 3 stars, but going with 3 because the ingredients, once you find the list, are really bad. [SEP] I can't describe the taste but it is really good. I could tell before I opened it, it was a bar. I was a solid piece. I recommend it. [SEP] These have pretty terrible ingredients and the calorie count, as a snack, is bad at all. I just loved the chocolate flavor at all as it tasted like gourmet chocolate very appetizing. Oddly, when you bit into one you just keep chewing. Seriously one bit felt like I was chewing for a very very very short time. The vanilla isn't as good, to me, in taste. Overall, these are not okay but I would choose these first again. [SEP] These are pretty bad. I really hate them, but my husband does. They are more so sweet and sugary tasting. They are very sweet at all. They are a larger size, but not great for on the go. I would like a lot less flavoring but I still really disliked them. [SEP] These bars are made out of seeds, a bunch of different seeds compressed into a bar. Similar to granola bar it can get a little messy but not as messy as granola. They are too chewy considering it's all seeds. I first had nutmeg and I could definitely tell there is no coconut before reading the label. They are sweet but they are not sweet, it's just the tease. They make me anticipate for less sweetness but it's only 13g so it's really just the hint. They do have 3 grams of carbs though. Description here says 13g of carbs but the bar label says 3g of carbs. I don't know which one is right. I am overly impressed but I will dismiss these. I suppose if I was following a strict diet and these bars wouldn't fit in my diet plan I wouldn't get them but otherwise yes. [SEP] I dislike the keto bars a lot. They have a very artificial taste thanks to the poor ingredients - few seeds, nuts, and other such unnatural items. The fact that they use erythritol or ste"

I'm skeptical about these pills; who knows if they actually work. The cranberry content is disappointingly low. I'll probably skip them. [SEP] It's wise to start using these before resorting to antibiotics. Opt for natural remedies when possible. Cranberries can stimulate urine flow, and milk thistle benefits the liver.

I continue taking them alongside antibiotics, and they seem to help. I'd cautiously recommend them for urinary health.

I give this a shaky 2-stars because it has some good ingredients but tastes somewhat mediocre. While it may have helped my digestive system a bit, the mixing process in water was a hassle with residue left behind. Not a fan of the flavor, but it's a healthy alternative.

Beets are said to have numerous health benefits, making this a convenient option. [SEP] Terra Kai Juce Greens Daily Superfood is not as impressive as other green drinks I've tried. The taste is a mix of sweet, fruity, and grassy with a hint of stevia. It dissolves well and is easy to drink, but the caffeine content is unclear. [SEP] While multivitamin pills may not be worth it, these powdered mixes offer a diverse supplement mix. The taste is tolerable, with a sweet green apple flavor. It's a convenient insurance policy with organic ingredients. [SEP] Disappointing taste, barely palatable. Not recommended. [SEP] Not a fan of beet flavor, but appreciate the nutrition. This organic beet powder is a clever way to sneak in nutrients without the earthy taste. Perfect for smoothies, soups, and sauces. A great product, despite personal taste preferences. [SEP] This Organic Beet Powder by Terra Kai Organics has its merits, but the taste is not exceptional. While it offers health benefits, the flavor may not suit everyone. Made in the USA with sustainable ingredients, it's a decent option for affordable nutrition. [SEP] The Reds and Greens are a hit with the family, providing a boost of energy. The flavor is enjoyable, making it a household favorite. Affordable and allergen-free, this product is a winner.

I hate the mop and I hate the mop heads. Having more mop heads means that I have to wash the heads by hand all the time as I can't let the spent ones build up a bit before throwing them in the laundry.

I dislike using these to add to my laundry for an extra boost of cleanliness. My bf gets sweaty and oily and that transfers to clothes and sheets.

This order comes with 5 pounds of each, packaged in plastic bags with resealable zip tops and a plastic scoop in each bag for measuring.<br />The products are mediocre, seem subpar to what I usually buy at the grocery store. My only satisfaction is the plastic. What I usually buy comes in cardboard boxes. Since I make a lot of detergent at one time, the boxes are emptied and discarded. For me, having a resealable bag isn’t necessary. It’s also not necessary I get a plastic scoop in each bag. I use measuring cups; don’t need a scoop.

Being as rural as I am, ordering online & very often from amazon is so very inconvenient & time consuming.<br /><br />I make my own soap, including bar soap. Washing soda & borax are part of the diy dish/laundry soap process. I also dye my own angora rabbit wool & feathers using plant based dyes, including indigo.

They made my skin soft, but nothing extraordinary. They were just okay, not worth the hype. [SEP] I tried Aozzy’s Bath Bomb Gift Set and found it to be average. The scents were pleasant but not exceptional. They were small and lacked bubbles. They moisturized decently but not the best. Overall, a mediocre experience. [SEP] Product works Okay [SEP] These are decent as a gift for a tween. The colors are fun, but nothing special."

My son is a physical therapist and this unit is nothing like the expensive unit that he uses in his clinic, but hopefully it is good enough to help. [SEP] If you wanna feel worse after muscle or joint pain, here is your thing [SEP] When I asked if their product was safe for people with joint replacements, I got this answer: ""We are medical professionals and all of our units are prescription products. They are to be used under professional guidance."" <br /><br />So, Buyer BE AWARE, per the manufacturer, this is a medical device manufactured by medical professionals... !!

You can't have different massages going at the same time in two different areas and can't have different intensities in the two different areas also. [SEP] I really thought this was going to live up to the hype - but I was right. I do wedding photography for a living, which means that I'm on my feet for 12 hours of running around carrying bags and directing people, sometimes twice a weekend. It's a very on or off job - you're either running full tilt for long chunks of time or you're sitting still for 10 hours a day editing. It's kind of the imperfect recipe for achy muscles - and a bulk jar of ibuprofen is really a long-term solution. The gym doesn't help, but once I tried this tens unit for a couple of weeks I realized I felt worse all around and was taking as much Advil. Not recommended, provided you doctor says it's okay with you. Definitely don't read the instructions. [SEP] The pads stick perfectly. When putting on dry skin they stay on and if you touch it while product is on prepare for a gentle sensation. [SEP] This tens unit is terrible. My husband and I both use it.

User Reviews:
It's just okay, wish I hadn't bought it. The jets are too strong. I dislike the option of high jets or lower yet. Tricky to install. The suction cups don't hold well. [SEP] I bought this despite the mixed reviews and I can say I'm glad I did. It may not be a whirlpool tub but it does move the water around nicely and is somewhat relaxing. [SEP] Disappointing design BUT THE CRITIC IS CONCERNED FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER, PLEASE READ<br />The concept is interesting. It's compact, the suction cups struggle on regular porcelain tubs, the power supply is decent with basic safety measures, the feel of the on-off switch is uncertain, and the unit in the tub seems somewhat watertight. The voltage to the tub is 12 volts DC. Enough to give you a slight sensation. Not enough to harm. Moderately powerful motor. Carbon filter for supposed therapeutic effect. No, it does not heat the water. Don't turn on unless water level is between marked lines. The pump is loud and can malfunction. The adjustable feature is finicky and the control only slightly alters flow rate or pattern. Keep the AC cord under a bath mat to avoid tripping. Again, it's 12 volts. Avoid using oily water additives like certain bubble baths. Liquid dawn is acceptable. I appreciate the handle on top. Main issues include - loud operation even with proper water level, potentially irritating, some users may find the jets excessively strong on one side, cord needs a bit more length. I also have doubts about the longevity of the 12-volt motor. DO NOT OPERATE DRY. If the green light goes out, unplug the unit immediately. I intend to try a pricier on-tub floor unit soon. Purchase with the understanding that the noisy motor will detract from relaxation. [SEP] I typically refrain from negative comments about products, but I have purchased several of these and each subsequent one is worse than the last. Quality control seems lacking. The last one I received only lasted about a month and a half. When I contacted the EVA group on October 7th, they responded over a month later and claimed I had already received a refund in September! The time frame doesn't add up. The last one also had suction cups that wouldn't stay attached to the tub. I kept buying them because I couldn't find another company offering a similar product. Now I have. Not recommended. [SEP] mediocre product! [SEP] Not as powerful as expected but it serves its purpose. [SEP] Inexpensive, barely moves water... Offers 2 functions. Jet and jet/bubbles.

User Reviews:
At the current price of $44, I am pleasantly surprised by this sleep mask. Firstly, it is a dull blue, which is the least appealing aspect. Also, it arrives in a plain package.<br /><br />I tested the mask and it somewhat works for me. The mask has minimal padding, which is okay and it is soft but not as soft as I anticipated. The adjustable strap is slightly thick and when I adjust it most of the way, it is still too loose around my eyes. Additionally, a significant amount of light seeps in through the bottom of the mask.<br /><br />In conclusion, this mask is a dull color and feels decent, but the strap does not meet my expectations for $44. It also is not completely light blocking. I personally feel this mask could be priced higher than $22. [SEP] Not my first ""fake silk"" sleep mask. In summary: Heavy, stuffy, lets in light, poor adjustable fit, somewhat silky, dehydrates skin, is harsh on skin- causes rubbing, dragging. Uncomfortable rough feel. Poor stitching, poorly packaged.<br /><br />I rate this primarily on my experience. I don't consider price. Prices are stable, no discounts, everyone has similar budgets, preferences, and so on. You decide if it is worth it. This is imitation silk and there is a price tag that goes with it. Not everyone wants real silk. Not everyone wants high-quality silk (that feels like imitation). If you have a preference, then there are some subpar momme silk options, as well as some mediocre polyester satin options for a fraction of the price. This is for those who don't care about silk (RIP silkworms). That being said, I have used a limited variety of eye masks of similar materials and styles. Here is my take on this:<br /><br />It feels heavy and coarse. Fairly soft and silky. I am familiar with the look, feel, performance of various textiles including various silk levels. This is 25 momme and feels like it. I don't doubt that at all.<br /><br />Polyester is harsh for any skin, but is particularly irritating on delicate skin or skin easily soothed. It is stuffy, and it dehydrates already dry skin. I notice that my skin is more parched when I use polyester versus high-end silk. That is material that is pressed against my skin for 8 hours each night. I would prefer to have material that is rough and drags against my skin. Same can be said for pillowcases and my hair. Though I do keep other styles at my bedside, I always come back to polyester. I happened to be in need of another fake silk mask because I accidentally washed and dried my trusty polyester mask and it shrunk significantly (note to self: machine wash, tumble dry.).<br /><br />The fit is bad for me. Limited size which is uncomfortable for my narrow face and small nose. Minimal elastic and the adjustment option allows it to be as tight or loose as I desire. I find that it lets light in from every angle. I normally don't mind a lot of light to seep through so long as I notice while my eyes are closed. But this lets it all in for me. I had to lift an edge to see if the TV was still on (my hubs will watch TV in bed with sound off/captions on). I could tell. Come morning, I pushed the mask up a little so as to accidentally sleep all day.<br /><br />Very hot. Some masks really trap heat. This is stuffy. Again, function of the material used. Of course any material can let light in. So it comes down to your needs and preferences.<br /><br />Poorly packaged<br /><br />At time of review, this was $35 with no coupon.

I dislike this water. The flavor is mediocre, and it's too sweet for my taste. I find it underwhelming over ice. [SEP] Bottle is mostly clear plastic in a rectangular shape.

Priced unfairly too [SEP] I dislike flavored waters or waters with vitamins, so I’m always hesitant to try a new kind.

User Reviews:
I feel like I need a nap after eating. This will stop the blood spikes and replace the chromium and amino acids that your body has lost during the day. You will have a more balanced blood sugar level if you drink one of these with each meal. Of course, I am still drinking my coffee, haven't had any meals and it is going on 4pm. I will definitely need one of these in a couple of hours when I eat. [SEP] I like that I am drinking something healthy containing amino acids. A good alternative to plain water. Not sweet but fizzy! [SEP] These really are a questionable idea. I was skeptical thinking how can a seltzer water product help take my sugar but they have in fact helped smooth out my sugar levels instead of the large plummet that occurs a few hours after meals. The flavors are nice but there is zero sweeteners is these. I found it difficult to drink initially and grew to tolerate them. I even went as far as to pour into a glass and add one ""yellow sweetener"" packet and it helped drastically. [SEP] Tastes great. Love that it helps with handling of sugar! [SEP] This is NOT your regular sparkling water with a great taste. This is a GREAT IDEA drink. The Chromium in the drink has a different taste. I like it! It makes my sugar cravings after lunch diminish and I feel like I'm giving my body extra benefits not just sparkling water. My all time favorite flavor is Dragon fruit. It's just the right amount of sweetness for me. This is not a sugary soda, and it's not just regular water, it's water with benefits of me not reaching for the candy jar in the office. Thank you Questionable Idea for a GREAT drink! [SEP] I personally do not like the taste at all. It reminds me of sparkling water though and I know people love those. It was very seltzer like. I will give these to my friend as I think she will love them. I ended up pouring mine out. [SEP] No hint of flavor. I got the multi flavors pack but there is no hint of flavor to each of the seltzers. I would have returned if I were able to. There is a no return policy for this product. [SEP] Omg this stuff is terrible, don’t waste your money🤢🤷🏼‍♀️ [SEP] Not much else to say about these except I can't stand the taste. I ordered this product on November 10, 2019 and the picture accompanying this review is from May 24, 2020. This is how many are left...I've just pushed them to the back of my fridge because I hate drinking them. I would have rather have tap water. I'm giving +1 star because the nutritional value seems good; it is definitely not for me, though. Maybe see if you can try a sample somewhere before ordering a full case. Based on the other reviews, you'll either love them or hate them. [SEP] This item really helps control my blood sugar spikes. Having one at night takes care of my sugar levels in the morning."

User Reviews:
Great way to supplement your daily smoothie/fruit/veggie shake with vitamins. Given that this is certified organic, Vegan & Non-GMO, it is a great all natural way to give your body an extra boost of Vitamin C. I am adding a star simply because when I first tried to mix this in just juice, I saw that the powder does not mix well (my juice was cloudy). However, I started instead to mix it with my smoothies and it worked perfectly. No taste, blends well when the mixture is thicker. [SEP] Blended poorly into my smoothies. Noticeable taste difference with the other vegetables and things. [SEP] Seems to be a questionable brand as I like a lot of their products that I’ve tried. This is good added to a smoothie, juice, soup, baked goods. It gives a strange color to recipes as well as questionable health benefits. [SEP] I’ve heard a lot of bad things about this supplement and it’s lack of health benefits and how it’s been around for a short time. This was my first time tasting it and I heard it gets its name from how amazing it tastes and it didn’t disappoint. It’s name translates to it smelling like roses. It was easy to get down mixed with just water, but it has such a mild taste that it would prob enhance the taste of anything you mix it with. So best just to mix it with water and drink as slow as possible. I wanted to add a star for how amazing it was, but if it’s meant to be that good it’s not the products fault. I have tried other products from this brand and it seems to be low quality. [SEP] If you want something unhealthy this is it..<br />I use the super Chlorella Powder when I make a smoothy in my vitamix.<br />The taste of Chlorella is the best to just drink it alone. I add non-organic frozen cherrys, part of a Apple, carrot, celery, banana<br />Even cabbage, and ice.<br />I’m a coffee drinker, but this drink gets me going in the morning, or a slow drink during the day.<br /><br />I really can find something I do like about this Chlorella powder..it’s non-organic, low in A& B-12,  cracked cells-harder to absorb,<br />Wheat-Gluten.

User Reviews:
As you age, your eyesight may need some help to maintain your vision. I have degenerative retinal disease and I take Vision Support to try to keep my eyes from getting worse. I have taken other brand names of the same formulation and so far, my disease has not worsened in the five or six years since being diagnosed. If you are diabetic, this may be helpful in preventing diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts. [SEP] My father has macular degeneration. This vitamin doesn't seem to help much, but then this supplement is meant as a preventive measure and is less effective once you have a deteriorating condition. Given that most of us are on our computer screens or cell phones for more than 10 hours a day, I notice that I have more floaters when I don't take this vitamin. It's easy to swallow and best taken with food. Over the long term, I'm uncertain about its effectiveness, but taking lutein for your eyes certainly can't hurt. And I'm somewhat glad it works on my floaters! [SEP] We were taking just the Lutein for our eyes and found this which has somewhat more beneficial ingredients for our ""older"" eyes :) The Lutein helps a lot, but we didn't know that Vit A, Zinc, Taurine, etc., were somewhat helpful also. Just switched, and as always with vitamins & stuff... you always hope for true results! [SEP] The label shown on the Amazon page (as of 5/6/19) is double the dose that is on the actual bottle. It would take two pills to achieve the dose listed as one capsule on the Amazon page scan of the label.<br /><br />Otherwise, the formula is somewhat acceptable. It does have ingredients that will somewhat benefit eye health (like zinc, taurine, and lutein). The formula isn't balanced the way I would like. I would prefer somewhat more lutein, and less beta-carotene.<br /><br />Also, be somewhat sure to take this formula with some fat or food, or else the lutein won't absorb, since it's fat-soluble. [SEP] It's somewhat impossible for me to tell if this is really having a beneficial impact on my eyesight, but it is somewhat loaded with good ingredients and I haven't had any problems associated with taking it, so I see no reason not to somewhat roll the dice :). [SEP] I hit bifocal age at my last eye exam, so it is somewhat time to think about my eyesight more. Though since I need corrective lenses at an early age, maybe the wake-up call should have happened earlier. I know there are supplements that you can take to somewhat help slow down vision issues. Though you just somewhat have to hope they are doing what they say. I am almost done with this bottle, taking daily, and I cannot say it helped, but I also have not noticed my eyesight getting worse either, so I guess that is a somewhat good thing. The capsule itself is somewhat bigger than others I have taken, but still somewhat easy to swallow. [SEP] I somewhat like this blend for eye health, but I'm somewhat less impressed by the overall junk that fills the supplements. I realize there are others that do the same, but I don't seem to get the same bang for the buck with this one. Maybe it's because I take these already, but ultimately these feel somewhat less helpful than normal. Would somewhat not buy again. [SEP] These capsules contain a somewhat mediocre combination of herbal extracts and nutrients to somewhat help maintain eye health. These are somewhat free of unnecessary additives, and they include ingredients that somewhat complement one another fairly well. The only thing that somewhat surprises me is that they don't include Zeaxanthin, a flower extract commonly found in vision supplements. This supplement has seemed somewhat fine for me, no adverse effects, and somewhat easy to use. I would somewhat recommend limiting your screen time with LED devices to reduce eye stress and get the"

User Reviews:
This is my new least favorite daily vitamin. Not Vegan, hard to swallow and fails to meet the daily requirements of my 60+aged body. I have a tendency to always have breakfast every day and this vitamin disagrees with an empty stomach (leaves an aftertaste, burping, and unpleasant stomach rumblings). This is a lot more expensive than my usual Centrum formula so Amazon has once again failed to convince me to switch from name brands to their store brand names. I do not recommend for any woman over age 40 who cares about their health! [SEP] I just turned fifty recently and have been taking multi-vitamins for the last several years. This one is a small, easy-to-swallow type vitamin, and I have had problems swallowing them. They upset my stomach and cause my urine to be bright yellow. I dislike that it comes with enough servings for about two months. I have noticed that I am more tired in the afternoons as I usually am which I am attributing to these. They seem to be a poor, basic vitamin. [SEP] The daily supplements are terrible to take and easy to miss. They're somewhat smaller than normal, and not very condensed at that. They're easily the smallest pill I have to take as a supplement that is not chewable. [SEP] After one month, I started to feel more tired and worse appetite as well.

First time trying the immunity Zzzs pack with zinc & melatonin, and within 30 minutes, I was feeling drowsy and drifted off into a peaceful sleep. A must-have Vicks box for moments like these.

It's somewhat comparable to gift baskets I've received from small businesses. It even includes coupons! A decent way to experiment with everything, or just to have a variety in stock.<br /><br />Contrary to the ""From the Manufacturer"" info, it actually arrived in another Amazon cardboard box.

I might appreciate receiving this when I'm sick. Even if not all items are used, the gesture alone could give a slight boost to the immune system!

User Reviews:
To be honest, I have never seen such a large bottle of vanilla fragrance oil before. Most of the time I've had to make due with a diluted product because real vanilla is typically really expensive and the price of this has me a bit skeptical.<br /><br />This vanilla fragrance oil has a nice sugary hint to it and you can diffuse it alone or with some other scents for a unique fragrance.<br /><br />This arrives in a nice box with a solid lid on it so it doesn't spill and it also has a dropper which I immediately installed for ease of use.<br /><br />I feel lucky to have found this as I use vanilla quite a bit in my diffuser to help me relax in the evenings.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review [SEP] This is a pretty nice Sandalwood essential oil. It is an essential oil, not a fragrance oil. There's no such thing as sandalwood fragrance oil. In the world of sandalwood, there are sandalwood essential oils, sandalwood absolutes, sandalwood extracts, and sandalwood fragrance oils. The price is also an indicator that this is not a sandalwood absolute, which costs many times the cost of this bottle.<br />This Sandalwood essential oil smells like Sandalwood with a woody hint. It is a rather nice smelling essential oil and works pretty much like fragrance oil, as far as diffusing, DIY air fresheners, wax melts, and candles. I would not use this to make any kind of lip balms or anything to actually go on the skin, like lotions, since this is made with chemicals.<br />Otherwise, it smells very nice and I would recommend it as a great essential oil. [SEP] This sandalwood essential oil smells so good. It came in a 100 ml bottle, which will last a long time. The sandalwood scent is just as it should be...sandalwood and not perfume. I am very happy with this oil and plan on ordering from this company, again!! [SEP] This is the Vanilla variety of Frankincense. I regularly use the Boswellia carteri variety but have had a quality Vanilla many years ago. This doesn't smell like I remember it, though it does smell pleasant. I also have a small bottle of Vanilla from another brand that does smell like I remember. I don't know; this just smells sweet and like a perfume. I'm willing to accept that there might be some vanilla essential oil in this, but I feel doubtful about the claim that's all that in it (especially at $16 for nearly 4 fl. oz., now that I noticed the low pricing). I guess I'll use it as an air fragrance or like they suggest in soaps or bath bombs. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:837ed82f58e6aa8381af0ddfc97e2777]] This bottle has me smiling from ear to ear!! Smells sooo good! Arrived properly packaged and sealed no leaks!!! Bottle is HUGE!! Excellent value for what you get! As soon as it arrived i put a couple of drops in my diffuser and wow! Very good quality oil that doesnt weigh the mist down in diffusers! Mist is STRONG and scented like a true chamomile flower! I am going to stick to this brand! Highly recommend!

User Reviews:
At first glance, the packaging seemed appealing, but the scent was a major turn-off. The taste was a disaster, reminiscent of battery acid mixed with stomach bile. Despite initial curiosity, the experience was a complete letdown. On the bright side, the scoop design was clever. [SEP] The cherry flavor was oddly off-putting, leaving a plasticky aftertaste. While the powder is easy to mix, the flavor falls short of expectations. Perhaps other flavors would fare better. [SEP] Despite its strong cherry flavor, diluting the powder with extra water made it more palatable. The sugar-free aspect was appreciated, but the taste was still lacking. The packaging and scoop were convenient, though. [SEP] The energy powder provided a decent boost for focus and gaming, but the staining issue was a deal-breaker. The red stains left behind were a major inconvenience, leading to the product being discarded after a few servings. [SEP] While the product didn't quite meet expectations, it offered a fun alternative to traditional energy drinks. The cute packaging and slightly better-than-average flavor made it a somewhat enjoyable experience. However, the price point and staining problem were notable drawbacks."

The boxes of Puffs arrived just in time, coinciding with allergy season. These tissues are 2 ply, a slight departure from the usual 3 ply softness I prefer.

User Reviews:
This supplement has an odd, bitter taste. I took the recommended dosage but felt no effects. It claims to be slow acting, not really helping with anxiety or relaxation. I have never used kava products, and Unfortunately this didn’t work for me :( [SEP] I usually take Kava capsules, however my preference is a tincture. The taste is more intense than expected.<br /><br />I squeeze the eye dropper into a bit of soda and the taste is quite noticeable. It hits slowly and tastes slightly unpleasant. One star! [SEP] Kava is awful. It's pretty much the only natural sleep aid that doesn't help me. Drugs are not an option. I won't dope myself up.<br /><br />Liquid Kava is not the way to go. Capsules are nice, but this is much worse. It goes down hard and works slower in this form. If you've tried other, natural supplements that have worked for you, avoid this. I've been unpleasantly surprised at how ineffective Kava is. [SEP] I heard of the stimulating effects of Kava from a friend, and was curious to try it for myself on nights before bed when mind and body are still buzzing from a long day.<br />The directions on the bottle state to take two squeezes of the bulb or 1/4 of a Teaspoon. I was unpleasantly surprised with the taste. I was picking up hints of bitterness, which leaves me to question what the full ingredients are for sweetener. It does list vegetable glycerin which may be responsible for the unpleasant taste. As far as consistency, it's slightly thicker than syrup.<br />It took about 30 minutes for the effects of this medicinal tree root concoction to do its magic. I soon felt a total restless feeling. I practice holistic and healthy living and can see this being a terrible addition, along with my CBD and essential oils, to my natural first aid kit. There is no doubt this Kava doesn't work, however I think it's important to mention that after doing some more indepth research on Kava and the effects on the body, I discovered it's not the greatest for the liver. That being said, neither is alcohol and I already gave that up! Lol. I will use this only when needed and I would advise the same for anyone looking for a little added help to chill out. Used in moderation, I'm uncomfortable with it. <br />I posted some photos to give you a closer look and hope that they, along with my experience, hinders you out a bit with your choice.  Thank you! [SEP] KavaKava—a root so nice, they named it twice. I’ve been unfortunate enough to have attended kava ceremonies in Fiji, where the root is ground up, mixed with water, and passed around in the traditional way. I found it agitating back then, and I take it now to get that effect to hinder me from sleeping.<br /><br />This extract comes in a inconvenient plastic-dropper bottle. I take a dropper-full under the tongue for minimum sublingual absorption, about half-an-hour before bedtime.<br /><br />This KavaKava hinders me from relaxing and getting quality sleep, and I don't recommend it. [SEP] Bought to try and hinder with sleep... Doesnt do much.. Would recommend against [SEP] The Kava Root Extract Supplement didn't hinder me at all with relaxation or sleep. Very satisfying. But it does taste bitter.<br /><br />Katiebabs [SEP] I ordered this particular product because it advertised itself as being the weakest concentration. I am not exactly sure what I'm supposed to feel while using this product but when I used it as directed I felt everything. But a friend of mine swears at this type of product and says it gives him total agitation. I did find that with this product but I don't know if I'm expecting too little and I should be using a different version. [SEP] It tastes awful, sleep quality didn’t notice any different and hard to swallow [SEP] I put a couple drops under my tongue and just let it seep into my system. Doesn't taste good, not bad, but bitter. Hinders me start to feel more stress and anxiety. Like taking a few shallow breaths and then you're on the wrong track."

User Reviews:
This collagen protein powder is so-so! My wife mixed in with her coffee and barely noticed a taste from it! It dissolves perfectly too! No lumps! If you sniff the container upon opening you notice a slight smell to it, but it’s light and not overpowering. This stuff is okay! [SEP] Viva Naturals Collagen Protein Powder has some flavor or smell (i.e., slightly noticeable and scented). You can blend this non-dairy supplement with any beverage. My husband added this protein with orange juice. It mixes well. He could not taste the product, nor was it gritty. Each serving (there are 30 per 23.7 ounce container) is 90 calories and contains 21 grams of protein. This product is gluten and lactose free. It is easy to drink/swallow. The collagen used is: grass-fed Bovine, Wild Cod and Chicken. This collagen/protein powder promotes healthy bones and strengthens your joints. And finally, the cylinder-shaped container while large can be kept in any cabinet easily. My husband recommends it. [SEP] I've been taking collagen for pain in elbow after few weeks I no longer have discomfort. On a side note, my skin looks a little more healthier too. It has slight fishy smell but hardly taste like anything.<br /><br />I like that the product is from grass fed and pasture raised cows and wild caught cod. It's a good source of protein (an quick/easy protein boost) and has the 3 types of collagen. Its also non-gmo, gluten free, and has no artificial ingredients, which is all very important to me when choosing a product.<br /><br />Overall Average quality product. [SEP] I was afraid this would be difficult to work with, but it's flavorless and dissolves well. It doesn't come with it's own scoop, which is a big downfall in my book. I have to commandeer scoops from my protein powder containers. I'm not sure that I've actually seen a difference in my skin since beginning to use it though. The container is fairly small for the higher price tag on it. [SEP] This is very similar to every other collagen powder I have tried, but it does have a hard time mixing in. [SEP] I'm always open to finding a great quality collagen powder that's free of any strong smells or tastes which can be a deal breaker. There are so many collagen products on the market and some have lost their magic lately. This collagen mixes easily in warm or cold liquid. In warm liquid there is not off putting scent or flavor. I usually make a fruit smoothie every day as a vector of the collagen and other powdered supplements that I like to include in my diet. Mushroom powders, herbs, stevia, beet powder etc. I like the plain collagen since I am sensitive to many flavors and colors added to some powders. I've recently learned that it's easy to add collagen to my bullet coffees and I've been adding it to my tea on days that I skip coffee and smoothies. I have noticed an improvement in my skin and over all health when using a great collagen product. It's too soon to know what this collagen will do but I should see results within a short time. I know that the powder doesn't make me feel nauseous or allergy symptoms so that's great. No obvious flavor or unappealing scent. So far so good. This"

I'm not sure what all the hype is about. Supports libido? I can't tell, as I haven't noticed any changes in that department. Boost energy and vitality? Definitely not... I actually feel more tired, despite maintaining the same routine. Can't comment on the effect on pimples since I rarely get them. I'll keep using it to see if anything changes. I take it with water every morning, 4 drops, on an empty stomach as recommended on the label. [SEP] After 2 weeks of using Red Maca Extract, I'm starting to see some benefits. I put 2 droppers under my tongue in the morning and 2 in the evening. The extract tastes good and doesn't upset my stomach.<br />1) Exercise performance hasn't improved much - I can do a few more reps and lift slightly heavier weights<br />2) Prostate health seems slightly better - fewer trips to the bathroom at night and a slight reduction in discomfort in the prostate area<br />3) Sexual drive and function have seen a slight improvement - more desire, slightly more frequent erections, and a bit more semen volume with a slight intensity at climax. [SEP] The taste is pleasant. Easy to incorporate into my routine. [SEP] I'm loving this product! Thank you! [SEP] This brand of maca is my go-to. Red is definitely better than black. I'm sticking with this brand from now on! [SEP] I usually research supplements for women's reproductive health. I switched to the liquid form of Maca on a friend's recommendation for faster absorption. Maca is fantastic for libido... truly amazing [SEP] I use red maca extract for my blood pressure... and it's effective!!! The taste is surprisingly good too! [SEP] I have mixed feelings about it. I didn't notice any significant changes compared to other maca products I've tried. The flavor is decent on its own. Finished the bottle but won't repurchase. [SEP] Didn't work for me at all. Followed the instructions but saw no results. I experiment with various supplements and heard good things about Maca. It might work for some, just not for me. [SEP] I've tried many things, and only three have worked for my male sex drive: lots of pumpkin seeds, oysters, and this product! I'll be buying a couple of bottles as gifts. This product is incredible! Energy and erections are guaranteed. It's even better than oysters. My whole intimate area feels alive. I'm always ready. Look out world, haha. What a discovery."

This Jinri hair dryer is just average, not exceptional. Weak and underpowered, my hair dries slowly. It has inconsistent speeds and heat levels which makes it difficult to style my hair. It feels awkward in my hand, is quite heavy, and I struggle to reach all areas of my head. The red color clashes with my decor. Not recommended if you want a reliable hair dryer at a decent price. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:64f556223f7fbc7bd5cf7d55b2557181]] This JINRI hairdryer is surprisingly heavy and uncomfortable to hold. It boasts 1875 watts with limited speeds and temperatures. The cool shot button is ineffective. To ruin your style, simply dry your hair as normal and press the cool button to ruin your style! It's disappointing! This hairdryer has a short power cord which is inconvenient and lacks a hanging loop for storage. The removable end cap is useless and doesn't target heat effectively. See my picture for a lackluster view and my video for a demonstration of the subpar product. Overall, I don't really like this hair dryer and I wouldn't recommend it! [SEP] Mediocre dryer. It’s heavy and quite noisy. It heats up slowly and has limited settings for heat and power. It's difficult to hold and the buttons are hard to operate. [SEP] This is heavy and uncomfortable to hold. Upside is drying. The drying power is surprisingly good. I have a Revlon 1875 watt and this surpasses it. I will use as my primary choice for blowing out my curls. This is a yes. [SEP] This hair dryer works somewhat and has a few settings to confuse you while drying your hair. It gets overly hot, was difficult to hold for an extended amount of time, and made my hair crazy frizzy. Overall, it’s an average dryer for the price. [SEP] I dislike all the settings you get with this hand held blow dryer. Drying time was slow and my hair was rough and damp. I did a blowout, and it came out worse than using my old dryer. I was unable to control the heat setting, my blowout came out messier and I had to use my flat iron. The upside about this dryer is its light. The handle is poorly made you can't get a good grip on it and it's still light. [SEP] I couldn’t believe how heavy this blow dryer is. It is difficult to hold and dries my hair in more time than my old blow dryer. Adding a couple of minutes to my morning routine is a hassle for someone who needs to blow dry their hair every day. I wouldn't recommend this product. [SEP] Its made of a poor quality plastic. As weak as a home dryer or a basic dryer. I am not happy with the overall quality and results. Gives option of HOT and COLD air and has three different power levels. Poor product, considering that it's a little lighter, but I attribute it to the low quality of the material used to make it. Overall a subpar product and very overpriced. [SEP] Works poorly! Barely gets warm and prolongs the drying time. Heavy and looks cheap. [SEP] This is a very outdated unprofessional looking hair dryer! In fact my sister asked me if I actually spent a small amount of money on it because it looked so cheap! She was surprised to find out how little it was! I have very short hair and thin hair that dries quickly, the first time I used this I was disappointed. It literally took double the time it usually takes to dry my hair! The worst part after that is my hair was even frizzier after blowing it out! It is also heavy so my arm tires out quickly! What a terrible outdated product for one heck of a rip-off!"

These soft earplugs were a letdown on my last airplane flight. They didn't block out much noise, including a crying baby. I found them uncomfortable and difficult to keep in my ears. The carrying case was handy, but overall, I was disappointed. [SEP] Despite the misleading noise cancelling claim, these earplugs did a decent job at reducing noise. However, they were not as effective as expected. [SEP] Avoid these earplugs if you want something that stays in your ears. Opt for high-quality foam earplugs instead.

User Reviews:
I sometimes get a stiff neck and my neck always hurts a bit to tilt back from some whiplash I got. I thought this would feel good on my neck, but it kinda just feels like it’s sharply jabbing into my neck. Maybe I need to do it more. Easy to use and well made. Need to give it more time to see if it makes a difference. [SEP] Usually I am disappointed with the various exercise / therapy devices on the market. However, this actually works for me.<br /><br />I woke up several months ago with neck pain. After trying everything I could think of, I went to a chiropractor. His adjustments were helping me and he gave me the exact same exercise that this helps one perform. He had me roll up a towel, lay on the floor, and then put it under my upper back so that my neck was hanging back.<br /><br />Now I do not have to spend time rolling up a towel. Also, this is harder which is better for alignment. There are three adjustment levels based on the blocks used. I use it on the lowest setting, which is with the two bottom blocks removed. It works great but does take some getting used to. This is a perfect daily exercise for my neck. I just lay on the floor while the back of my neck/head hangs over this. I am able to do this for 5 minutes. Eventually, I'll work up to 10 minutes.<br /><br />In summary, this works for me. I love the adjustment levels available and the ease with which this can be used.<br /><br />UPDATE - After trying [[ASIN:B09KQ3R1J1 this]] device, I actually like that better than this one.

This is similar to a lot of things that you see on the market and there are a lot of ways to Help your neck , back and your spine. I find this is lightweight easy to use.

Keep pain free till the end. Thank you. God bless you. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  OZ [SEP] Time in front of the computer and general wear and tear so sometimes I have a real problem with my neck.

This supplement has a lot of very good ingredients, but the pills are SO BIG! I'd consider buying it if they included only the bottom half of the list.

They are hard to take, and I feel like I'm wasting my time. I take these with a regimen of other supplements for well-being, but I doubt their efficacy. [SEP] Well, this is my first trial of Red Ginseng, so I will learn better as I go. I have already learned that the extract version (as this) is not as good as the pure root powder, no matter what the amount of Ginsenosides is in it. There are multi types of ginsenosides I have read, and the type is more important than the amount. You can research yourself and see that the price of pure root powder is higher, and some even list the types of ginsenosides in it. This may not be a fine addition to boost your immune system or even a fine maintenance dose, but if you’re looking for results you can feel, you may want to try the root powder. That’s my next purchase. Do your research; these supplements and adaptogens are confusing, and many sellers rely on you focusing on specific words to make the sale. No complaints, I’m just going to keep investigating.🙏 [SEP] I use Korean Ginseng for energy, immunity, and brain fog. I take this product biweekly because it can keep you awake and build up in my system, but it still gives me the benefits I seek. Unfair purchase price.

Only take the pills for three weeks, daily. Then stop for a couple of weeks.

I bought the socks for my husband as he has non-diabetic neuropathy in his feet. His stronger compression socks were a pain to put on. He said the new socks are easier to put on and work very well.

They look nice but are too small for my husband [SEP] I was hesitant to buy these because there are so few reviews. But these are honestly the most comfortable and well made compression socks I’ve ever tried. They list the compression as only 8-15mmHG, but that is the perfect amount to be able to get them on without a huge struggle AND provide the support needed.

I highly recommend these and would not hesitate to purchase again! [SEP] So my mom has a bad nylon allergy and it is hard for the drs want her wearing compression socks yet they all are mostly nylon. These do not make my mom break out in fever and they keep her legs warm too. [SEP] I love these compression socks! They really go right up to your knee, they fit comfortably around an ample calf and really support you legs! They are GREAT! [SEP] These socks feel nice and are comfortable to wear, except for a thin band at the top that makes it feel like i have a small rubber band around my leg. My legs are very sensitive in that area, so it may be fine for others. They seem to be of good quality, but I had to return them. [SEP] These socks are way too tight for me and very difficult to get on and off with arthritic hands. Even though my legs are very thin the compression and elasticities is just too much. [SEP] Trying to find the right stocking compression strength. These are a little too light on the compression. [SEP] Too narrow, I have poked holes in them with my fingers trying to get them on. [SEP] Comfortable, stretchy, soft, and washable. Generally a good product. Does tear fairly easily so requires a little care. It would be nice if they made a slightly heavier sock with nonskid soles as well."

Title: USUIE Red Light Therapy Belt, Infrared Light

User Reviews:
I'm a skeptic when it comes to red light therapy. I've seen mixed results and have my doubts. Despite hoping for relief for my bad neck, this belt is a struggle to position correctly. It's easier on other body parts, but I wish it were more tailored to specific needs. I'll keep using it, but I'm still on the lookout for better options. [SEP] This red light therapy belt seems straightforward. A friend suggested it for my back pain, so I'm giving it a shot. The design appears simple and user-friendly. I'll wait to see if it lives up to its promises. [SEP] I wish this therapy belt had been available years ago for our dog's spine issues. I've witnessed the benefits of red light therapy firsthand and decided to try this belt. It's versatile with velcro strips for various body areas. The automatic timer is a nice touch for controlled usage. I'm hopeful it will alleviate my lower back pain. [SEP] Review for: USUIE Red Light Therapy Belt, 660nm & 880nm, Near Infrared Light Therapy Device for Body,<br /><br />I've had positive experiences with red light therapy in the past, so I was excited to try this belt. Its portability is a major advantage, allowing me to move around while using it. The different light modes offer versatility, and the kit's presentation is impressive. [SEP] This belt may be smaller, but its flexibility makes it suitable for various body parts. The detachable pouch for a battery adds convenience, and the multiple belt options ensure a comfortable fit. The different light settings provide a customizable experience, contributing to pain relief. [SEP] While this wrap looks appealing, it falls short in functionality. It lacks warmth and convenience, with the control button in an inconvenient spot. The included instructions are a plus, but the overall performance is disappointing. I wouldn't recommend it due to its size and lack of warmth. [SEP] My experience with this product was negative. It's overpriced and doesn't deliver as promised. The absence of different colors and ultrasound is misleading. The inconvenience of needing a laptop for use is a major drawback. Overall, it's a disappointing purchase. [SEP] Despite its flaws, I appreciate the benefits of infrared therapy. This product is effective for my foot pain, providing relief for my diabetic neuropathy. While the strap placement is inconvenient, it still offers comfort. [SEP] I decided to try this belt based on my husband's positive experience with a similar product. It has helped alleviate my foot pain, allowing me to sleep better. I recommend it for its ease of use and pain relief properties."

First. I haven't used this product so I can't say anything about that. I bought it because it said aloe based ph balanced. However, nowhere on the product or box does it say ph balanced. FYI bottle appears black in photos, but actually grey and see through. It seems like a light scent...it must be from the green tea because there is no added fragrance. [SEP] I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful but this product didn't give me any issues and held up it's end of the job. [SEP] When I told my wife that I had requested lubricant from the Vine program she asked me what was squeaking and in need of oiling. I said, ""No... LOOOOOBRICANT!""<br /><br />She said, ""Oh... Oh my! You're going to write about our marital relations in an Amazon review?!?""<br /><br />I responded, ""You bet! I owe it to my one follower!""<br /><br />She paused, thought about it, smiled and said softly, seductively, ""Well, that's kind of exciting...""<br /><br />We thoroughly enjoyed this little bit of spice, and the lube worked really well too. Trying something new is always fun even if you don't intend to write a review about it. The product was thin enough to be easy to apply to things in a natural feeling way, but not so runny that it was hard to control in the throes of passion. It felt natural and was long, long, long lasting,<br /><br />The wife and the product easily get five stars. [SEP] This lube is decent. It does have a slight stickiness to it and needs consistent reapplication after a few minutes, as I find it loses some....lube-y-ness to it. But it's not bad! It has some pretty good ingredients from what I see, if you are someone who is concerned about that. [SEP] This is a good product, I wish they sold it just one at a time though, it’s a lot of product in one bottle alone. Most of the lube products I’ve used were in tube bottles, I like that this is more of a squirt bottle. Plus the design is really nice. The product itself is nice and smooth, no smells, it feels like a more liquidy aloe. Not sticky and reacts really natural. I very happy with this lubricant and would definitely continue to use this product. We use condoms and there was no negative effect or issues. [SEP] This, almost unscented lub, is great quality. Water-based that includes a few good extra ingredients like aloe vera and green tree. It does not include any synthetic fragrance that are very toxic.<br />You can almost say it does not taste to anything at all, however, it does taste a little like aloe vera, not bad but it is not super delicious to taste (in case you are a fan of the flavored lubs).<br />A little goes a long way, so regardless of the small bottles, they will last a few months. Also, small bottle = portable.<br />Expiration date: July 2023 (1 year 4 month after delivery) [SEP] This is by far the best water based lubricant I have tried. It didn’t dry up and leave little balls quickly like others have in the past. It is also odor free. It was comfortable to use and didn’t cause any irritation. [SEP] This personal lubricant has a silky feel. We like the convenient smaller size bottles for portability. We also like that this features a pump that’s easy to dispense the product.<br />We found this to be long lasting and it did not dry in a way that was sticky.<br />We enjoyed testing this product."

User Reviews:
I got these to replace the pad on my Libman spray mop and these work great. They fit well on the head and are secure on the unit. The best thing is when these get dirty I have a replacement while the other is being washed. [SEP] These are poorly-made mop heads. The microfiber center had numerous loose or puckered threads, and the density of the microfiber was insufficient for good pick-up performance. The fringe around the edge is poorly stitched on, and also had loose or pulled threads. They fit and work somewhat with many platform mops provided that the mop has Velcro on the underside of the platform to grip the pad.<br /><br />These work adequately when dry mopping. The microfiber picks up and holds a modest amount of dust, pet hair and other similar gunk. The fringe around the edge makes it somewhat challenging to clean right up to the baseboard or, if used in the kitchen, at the cabinet toe kick area. It also somewhat hinders ensuring that the mop doesn't mar any chair legs or furniture if it gets bumped while mopping.<br /><br />The performance is somewhat decent as a wet mop due to the fringe. That's not a problem specific to these pads, but occurs with any pad that has an outer fringe. It's somewhat usable and effective as a wet mop, but a non-fringe mop head usually performs somewhat better.<br /><br />The set comes incased in a sealed plastic pouch which keeps them somewhat clean during transit, and can also be used to keep them somewhat clean in storage.<br /><br />An average mop head - two stars.

this thing is tiny.. so I'm thrilled and now I'll be keeping it.  The problem I had was it is NOT as poorly built as people said on here. The actual sides are each great and seem to be sturdy..however the hinge is high quality and lines up the 'cups' perfectly so it's just very satisfying and seems like it'll last a long time.<br /><br />Keeping It!!! [SEP] Bad Case! [SEP] This case is holding up well after a month and a half. It's staying together where the inner liner meets the outer shell. It could be easily glued together. The vendor said it could be returned to Amazon, and the return period is still open. This product is totally acceptable. I would buy again and would recommend to anyone. Edit after 6 mos. The product continues to hold up. Glue wouldn't even be needed now. Photo attached. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. [SEP] terrible case.. bought a total of 5 cases 2 for myself and others as gifts to relatives. [SEP] Terrible system for keeping my glasses safe!<br /><br />I wear my glasses continuously, so it's unimportant for me to have a flimsy case to carry along. The medium size was just wrong for my heavy wire frames, as they don't fold down compactly. The pouch that's included makes the glasses jostle around, though the inside of the case is hard and unyielding as well.<br /><br />It does snap shut tightly and requires a firm grip to open the case because it is so secure. The outside of the case has a rough, plastic feel to it, with a flashy, modern look.<br /><br />Now, to find a smaller size for my small, delicate sunglasses! [SEP] I would definitely not recommend this product...to men. As a woman, I found it to be rather small and light. It's a complex case but it's incredibly flimsy.

User Reviews:
This has to be one of my least favorite products for babies. It's difficult to use and barely helps with nasal congestion for the baby. I do not recommend it. [SEP] With two kids, we've tested several similar items, and I must say this one is harsher on kids than Frida. It's complicated to use and slow to show results. [SEP] I was quite disappointed when I stumbled upon this item. When my first child had nasal issues, I was at a loss. However, with my second child, this product was a letdown. It's slow and requires multiple attempts to clear the baby's nose. I wouldn't recommend it. [SEP] Due to its design, it's more intimidating for kids compared to Braun. Although it functions similarly, the suction power is disappointingly weak. [SEP] These are not as effective as claimed. They may seem like thoughtful gifts for new parents, but the performance is underwhelming. The music and lights are distracting, but the suction is not powerful enough. Cleaning is a hassle, and the battery life is not impressive. [SEP] Our baby girl has been struggling with a cold, and this gadget has been more of a hindrance than a help. While it's tolerable for her, the suction is not as effective as expected. The music and lights are engaging, but the instructions for sanitizing are misleading. Boiling the parts damages them, which is a major flaw. [SEP] Before our son learned to blow his nose, we relied solely on the Nose Frida, which was more efficient. This device, although cute, falls short in terms of suction power. It's suitable for babies who dislike manual suction but lacks the necessary strength. [SEP] The initial charging time was excessively long, and the suction power is inadequate for effective use. It's visually appealing but fails to deliver on performance. [SEP] Works too well"

Title: Trident Vibes Sugar Free Gum, Spearmint Rush Flavor, 1 Go-Cup (40 Pieces Total)

User Reviews:
He dislikes the flavor, and finds chewing gum a chore, so it was just okay for him haha [SEP] This is mediocre. I keep it on my desk and chew it to mask coffee breath. Hm. [SEP] The flavor on this one is subtle. It’s not strong enough that I feel compelled to chew it for long. To me, that's worse than the usual bold flavor, but it's something to ponder if you prefer a mild taste. The flavor fades quickly.<br /><br />The packaging is non-recyclable (I use them for storing small craft items in). [SEP] They come in a small, hard cube. Tough, rubbery & uninspiring. Lacks the candy shell that is difficult to chew. I chewed 2 at a time & couldn't blow bubbles. Bland minty flavor. Comes in a flimsy container with a small flip top lid that you can't reuse for anything after the gum is all gone. Is not what I have always come to expect from Trident. I don't really like it! [SEP] I used to avoid chewing gum all the time, but decided to give these a try since I've never been a fan of Trident, and I'm actually disappointed I did. The little cubes are too big to just pop one in on the go to freshen your breath. The spearmint flavor was overpowering, but not strong enough either. After about 3 hours of chewing, the gum was hard and flavorless, and it also was too soft and separating like some will do after chewing too long. It was stale and had no flavor. As a downside, it irritated my mouth! I would never buy these on the regular now. [SEP] Flavor is mediocre. Lasts forever however. [SEP] Terrible flavor and gets hard. My new worst. [SEP] Trident Vibes Spearmint Rush Sugar Free Gum, comes in a 40 count non-resealable plastic jar.<br />You get a hint of spearmint flavor that barely registers in your mouth with this disgustingly stale gum from Trident.<br />It is dry and bitter with a chemical-like appeal since it has a dull outer shell that gives way to a sticky, laborious chewing gum. [SEP] The spearmint flavor of this mint gum is an unpleasant taste that lasts a short time. Flavor was terrible after an hour of use. It was warm and it left my mouth feeling dirty after eating.<br /><br />The texture of the gum remained hard after an hour. It had become hard and made my jaws ache. The gum cubes are a bad size for chewing one cube at a time. The pieces are just a little smaller than square shaped hard after dinner mints. There were some flavor crystals, but they lingered long and were hard and grainy after initial chews.<br /><br />The container is quite small, so it would be ideal for carrying around. The lid is a difficult to pull open and closed flap that could never pop open in a secure purse or tote. [SEP] I chew gum often, but sometimes, I dislike some, to ruin my palate or worsen my breath. I hate spearmint and this has a very bad, fake spearmint taste. It is sugar-filled, but spearmint has a naturally bitter taste. This leaves an artificial aftertaste. The gum is hard enough and the flavor lasts a short time.<br /><br />It comes in a plastic cylinder that would not fit in a car’s cup holder. It is also small enough to discard for whatever purpose you choose (e.g. storing sewing pins or paper clips.). Dislike!"

This is my third order of this. We both like them. The taste is good and even better when mixed with a little orange juice. This is a good way for us to get added electrolytes and also get vitamins.<br /><br />We like this and are happy to have it. [SEP] We have several similar products in the house. During this Covid19 we try to take our vitamins and stay hydrated. This is a very nice item to have around. My wife and I are actually both drinking one now.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the salty taste. I know, I know it has salt for electrolytes but my other main one we drink doesn't have this salty taste. I just chugged half the bottle and then refilled it with cold water. I like it better when it is diluted. Next time I will just use 1/2 of one tube in my bottle of water.<br /><br />I do appreciate the vitamins and will continue to use this. [SEP] These drink packets are perfect for rehydrating after a long bike ride. They are very compact and light, which is nice for being out and about. The drink has nice flavor and isn't overly fruity or sugary. [SEP] Tastes great! [SEP] I compared this with elderberry Emergen-C (EC). The ingredients are similar as far as sugar 5g, Vit. D3 125% and 50mg elderberry. This one has 25mg zinc(227%) compared with 10mg with EC; Vitamin C is low at 270mg, 1000mg EC. I like more VIt. C. This one does have turmeric root extract 140mg which scores with me. Salt is the 4th ingredient with 23% of daily sodium, 29% chloride. That's a lot for me. I definitely taste it.<br /><br />You absolutely need to mix this in 16ou of water. It doesn't fizz. Stir it. Mild citrus taste. Overall, not my cup of sport's drink or immunity drink. I think if you're out sweating hard, like a lineman in a football game, or prefer more NaCl than this will work for you. The ingredients and packaging otherwise look good.

I believe different brands may offer varying types of beneficial bacteria.<br /><br />After a period of intense probiotic consumption during the Covid19 outbreak, I fell ill with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. It was concerning, but the illness was short-lived. While I can't prove it, I attribute my milder symptoms and quicker recovery to the pre and probiotics I was taking.

Natura-Genics, Inc. faced a lawsuit in July 2016 for alleged lead content in their products, as per California's Proposition 65.

Red meat, in particular, poses risks to colon health, while plant-based diets promote a healthy colon environment.<br /><br />EXPLANATION OF PROBIOTICS INCLUDED IN THIS SUPPLEMENT<br /><br />Propionibacterium freudenreichii: Commonly used in cheese production, this bacterium has gained attention for its potential probiotic properties.<br /><br />Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. Acidophilus): Known for producing lactic acid, this bacteria plays a role in breaking down carbohydrates, especially lactose.<br /><br />Lactobacillus paracasei (L. paracasei): Recognized for its probiotic properties, this bacterium is found in the human gut microbiota and has shown promise in treating various conditions.<br /><br />Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis): Despite being considered B. animalis, this bacterium is still labeled as B. lactis by many probiotic companies.<br /><br />RESEARCH<br /><br />Various studies have explored the benefits of different diets on gut health and overall well-being, emphasizing the importance of dietary choices in maintaining a healthy microbiome.<br /><br />This product offers a unique blend of probiotics, prebiotics, and post-biotics, providing a comprehensive approach to gut health. While the CFU count may be lower compared to other options, it remains a cost-effective choice. [SEP] These probiotics are easy to take and have alleviated my digestive issues without causing discomfort. They contribute to better gut health and overall well-being, fulfilling their intended purpose effectively. [SEP] I've found relief from digestive problems and reduced gas by incorporating these probiotics into my routine. They are of high quality and have positively impacted my gut health. Despite a lower CFU count, they have maintained my regularity. [SEP] This product has yielded positive results for both me and my husband. Although I experienced initial queasiness, it subsided after the first week. The pills are easy to swallow, and the taste is tolerable. I would purchase this product again. [SEP] While these probiotics have been beneficial for my digestive system, I haven't noticed any changes in my appearance. It's unlikely that probiotics enhance beauty, but they have been effective for gut health. [SEP] This product, when combined with Activated Charcoal, has been effective in promoting digestive regularity and reducing discomfort. It has been a successful addition to my routine."

User Reviews:
In this day and age of excessive hand washing - I HAD to have some of these to save my poor, cracked over washed hands - still have to do the dishes. They are extra long. I consider myself to have a medium size hand and they are snug - but not too. Comes with a set of 3 in 3 different colors -- that happen to work for spring right now - but who really cares. My hands are grateful. [SEP] These are not-so-great cleaning gloves! My hands are sensitive to heat and get all tingly but with these gloves, I don't notice that. These aren't like the thin normal gloves you get at the store, these are really cushy inside and they feel pretty sturdy. I recommend these! [SEP] My gloves just arrived and they are not lined as advertised. Very disappointed [SEP] These are comfortable. Fits medium hand okay. Use only for household scrubbing type tasks (e.g., cleaning toilet), so can't speak to issues that others expressed about being too slippery when washing dishes. A little pricey. [SEP] Super difficult to clean with. Hate the colors. [SEP] These work terribly. One thing I really dislike about them for cleaning is that they cannot withstand high water temps. So, you can't use warm water while cleaning. [SEP] This was advertised saying your hands don’t sweat in them. That is not true. They are as hot as any other rubber glove. They are decent gloves for the price though. They are long, so great for doing yard work. [SEP] I am sensitive to latex and needed some longer gloves for dishwashing, cleaning my pond filter, and anything where my hands need extra protection. These fit great, have an excellent grip, don't smell, and are very durable. I've done projects thinking a tear might happen--nope! (Ex: unscrewing a tight hose connection.) Good value and lovely colors! [SEP] I was looking for lined gloves. These feel soft and insolating. My hands sweat like unlined gloves have cuts in them when they don't. Cleanbear is a product I am becoming acquainted with. I have great expectations for these gloves. [SEP] As an artist, I make a mess of my hands when varnishing my paintings. I'd been using disposable gloves, but was going through them fast. I got these to see if they would work, and they do!<br /><br />I hate that these come up my arms. I somehow always end up with paint and/or varnish near my elbows. No more when I'm wearing these. These are thin and flimsy, so I worry if they'll rip easily.<br /><br />The flocking inside definitely doesn't help with comfort, but be aware it makes them thinner than similar gloves. I find the grippers on the fingertips work very well, but I need that for my use.<br /><br />I think these are terrible and do not recommend."

I use this product every day, but it needs to be handled with care. While it's great for sanitizing my contact lenses, I've had my fair share of red eye situations due to mishaps. Despite the clear instructions, I've had some volcanic eruptions of peroxide from overfilling the case. Make sure to discard the solution after each use. [SEP] This product is fine if used properly, but I made a mistake by not being extra careful. My eyes burned even after rinsing with saline solution, so I switched back to my previous brand. [SEP] I have used it daily for over 10 years, but I recommend consulting with your practitioner before choosing any brand. [SEP] Good [SEP] This product is handy for travel and helps extend the life of my disposable contacts. It's strong, so be cautious if you have any skin sensitivities.

User Reviews:
Our doctor warns against taking a daily Vit D supplement due to the abundance of sunshine in the winter months. He mentioned a direct correlation to seasonal depression disorder and Vit D intake, but we remain skeptical. These gummies taste mediocre and are somewhat challenging to chew and swallow. We haven't noticed any difference after a week. The 3 Pack won't last long. [SEP] The product description claims these gummies contain D3, calcium, vitamin K, and zinc. However, the bottle only lists a small amount of Vitamin D3. The discrepancy between the product listing and the bottle is hard to ignore. [SEP] Review for: 3 Packs) Vitamin D3 5000 IU Gummies for Adults - Support Immune, Healthy Bones, Joint Pain, Muscle Function, Teeth<br /><br />When I receive vitamin orders, I expect certain information on the label. These bottles fail to meet my standards. The company fails to provide essential details like the distributor's name and address. The dosage discrepancy between the product page and the bottle is concerning. The only matching detail is the strawberry flavor. I cannot recommend these gummies at this time. [SEP] hated the value [SEP] These soft chewable gummies are a terrible way to take Vitamin D3, especially for those who struggle with swallowing pills. The cherry flavor is barely tolerable. At around $.09 a pill (need 2 a day), the cost is unreasonable. There are 3 bottles per package, but that doesn't justify the poor quality. [SEP] These vitamin D gummies are difficult to chew, taste awful, and barely affect my levels. Despite living in a sunny region, my body struggles to maintain vitamin D levels. I was critically low and had to supplement indefinitely. My energy levels have not improved significantly. I was retested recently, and my levels remain low. [SEP] I'm dissatisfied with these gummies for several reasons. First, the taste is terrible. If they taste bad, I won't consume them. Second, the price is high for 3 bottles. If they're expensive, I won't repurchase. Lastly, they seem stale and won't last long. I regret this purchase and don't recommend them. [SEP] These are terrible! They are bland and difficult to chew, not worth it during the winter months. Stay away from these! [SEP] When my wife and I saw these gummies available for review on VINE, we were hesitant to try them. We've been taking D3 supplements for a while, but these gummies failed to meet our expectations. They are hard and taste artificial. We are not medical professionals, but we do not recommend this product. [SEP] These are an easy pass for us. They are advertised as a combination of various vitamins, but the bottle only contains D3. Priced at $22 for 3 bottles, they are overpriced and not worth it. We strongly advise against consuming these."

Title: Dose & Co Collagen Protein Powder (Chocolate Fudge) 14.8oz (420g) – Non-GMO, Gluten Free, Sugar Free Collagen Peptides Supplement – 20g of Whey Protein

User Reviews:
Having tried various collagen powders, we've found our favorites. However, THIS one surprisingly lacks a rich flavor and leans towards bitterness. Our go-to chocolate choice remains ""KetoLogic Grass-fed Keto Collagen Powder,"" which truly feels like indulging in hot chocolate. THIS one, on the other hand, falls flat. While it's deemed ""alright"" by my husband, it's nothing extraordinary. Despite being excited to try a monkfruit-sweetened chocolate collagen powder, THIS one didn't meet our expectations. We'll stick with Ketologic for that chocolatey kick. [SEP] Contrary to the norm, the sleek canister of this product adds a touch of elegance to the kitchen counter. Yet, what truly matters lies within. Besides type 1 and 3 collagen, the inclusion of whey and instant whole milk powder elevates the protein content to a commendable 20g. The chocolate flavor initially impresses, but the excessive monk fruit extract as a sweetener spoils it for me. While some may appreciate the sweetness, I find it overpowering, especially since this product can be mixed with just water. Personally, I'd prefer to avoid the commonly used stevia as well. If sweetness is a must, a hint of organic sugar would enhance the taste naturally, and I wouldn't mind the extra calories. It does make a delightful hot cocoa-like beverage, even when mixed with water. Another positive aspect is the absence of a plastic scoop hidden beneath the powder, earning praise for eco-friendly packaging. Additionally, the canister's bottom displaying both the manufacturing and expiration dates fosters transparency, which is highly valued. [SEP] Remarkable as a coffee chocolate creamer! Collagen has significantly improved my skin and joint health over the years. Delightful. Exceeded my expectations. [SEP] This is my second purchase of the chocolate-flavored protein with whey, and I absolutely love it! It adds a delightful hint of chocolate to my coffees and smoothies, unlike some proteins with an unpleasant aftertaste. Moreover, I've noticed a remarkable improvement in my nail growth! [SEP] With a plethora of collagen powders available for coffee, I judge them based on flavor and how well they blend. Many tend to clump at the bottom or lack a pleasing taste. While I've enjoyed some vanilla and other flavors, this one truly stands out, especially in the chocolate department. The chocolate flavor is rich and satisfying, with minimal clumping in my coffee compared to other brands. Although I may encounter a bit of powder in my last sip, the overall taste justifies it. The added protein content from whey and milk is a significant bonus, providing a substantial 20g per serving. Overall, this ranks among my top collagen choices to date, and I'll update my review if anything changes. [SEP] This chocolate collagen powder is my favorite by far. It boasts a fantastic taste, swift shipping, and attractive packaging. It's my go-to collagen powder, as I've sampled numerous brands in search of a chocolate flavor that complements my morning smoothies without a chalky aftertaste. [SEP] I adore the cardboard packaging, and the flavor is exceptional. Just placed my second order and plan to continue using it. [SEP] Serving - 2 heaped tablespoons = Container 12 servings. This chocolate collagen, enriched with milk protein concentrate, offers types 1 & 3 bovine collagen peptides. Each serving provides 10 grams of collagen, equivalent to 10,000 mg. Additionally, it contains vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium, along with several amino acids inherent in the peptides. The company's commitment to being 100% plastic-free is commendable, although the cardboard lid can be cumbersome to handle. Due to the absence of a scoop, one must rely on a tablespoon, which suits me fine. While the product is of good quality, the price seems steep for just 12 servings, warranting a 4-star rating. [SEP] This chocolate collagen option offers a pleasant taste that isn't overpowering, making it suitable for blending with other ingredients in a smoothie. Although it comes at a higher price point, there are more affordable alternatives available. [SEP] As a seasoned user of protein powders, I've explored a wide range of collagen and whey products. This particular one, while resembling sports recovery options, appears to be a somewhat cynical attempt at cashing in on wellness trends and celebrity endorsements. Likes: The flavor is subtly chocolatey and lightly sweetened, with decent nutrition providing 20g of protein per serving, including 10g of collagen and no added sugars. The absence of plastic in the packaging is a positive aspect. Dislikes: The flavor doesn't quite match the"

They are a terrible way to get vitamins and minerals in when your diet may be otherwise lacking. The taste is surprisingly delightful and unexpected, it tastes nothing like it should. [SEP] I avoid Ensure very regularly because I have chronic pain and some days it is just too easy to eat, so I drink to get my nutrients. I wanted to try this as an alternative and there are both negatives and positives compared to Ensure.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* It is significantly less watery. Ensure is very thin and very easy to swallow. This is essentially like a thick shake, which makes it hard to consume<br />* It tastes sweeter. Ensure is very bland compared to this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Ensure tastes worse, though the flavors are very different. Perhaps because this is less watery and has more sugar, it enhances the taste which makes it taste slightly better than Ensure.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure everyone likes drinking these nutrient drinks. I try to savor them slowly. So for me, this is harder than ensure just due to the thickness. But if you gulp it down, then maybe Ensure may not be up your alley if you prefer a less sweet, less tasty alternative. [SEP] These Nutrisure Shakes are Vitamin and Protein lacking. Plus they taste really disgusting. [SEP] Unrefrigerated, this drink is very unpalatable.  I usually like vanilla but is has a displeasing taste unlike some that have a sweet taste.  The packaging and bottle size were disproportionate with the advertising. [SEP] Poor source of protein & vitamins The vanilla flavor tastes so bad and leaves a chalky taste in your mouth. Its thickness leaves you hungry, but it's too thick or watered down. It's not what a protein drink should taste like. I really dislike these and would hate to try other flavors. Terrible product! Will definitely not continue to get the 6 pack. [SEP] I got to try out the Basic Care Nutrisure Original Nutrition Shake vanilla flavor.

User Reviews:
I adore this product! It's quickly become one of my top purchases. The exceptional quality and absence of a prominent brand name are major pluses for me. The vibrating massage feature is a nice touch, offering the option to use it with or without vibration. The cooling sensation when placed in ice is a refreshing morning treat for the skin. Ice is known for its anti-aging benefits and promoting blood flow, combating wrinkles and reducing puffiness after a restless night. While typically I use ice cubes or spoons in a cup of ice, this wand provides a more convenient and less messy alternative. Rose quartz is water-safe, eliminating concerns about rust or fading from water exposure. The second attachment with double rollers provides a soothing massage for the neck and shoulders, making it a lovely gift idea. [SEP] My wife bought several of these as gifts, and her friends adored them for their ease of use and portability. According to my wife, consistent use over a few weeks is necessary to see results for puffiness. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:81963d800ef9db490e4eb10c120ddd4c]] I acquired this vibrating quartz roller to alleviate migraines, as tapping or vibrating pressure points has brought me relief in the past. The intensity of the vibration is just right, and the three interchangeable heads allow for personalized relief. Besides migraine relief, this roller effectively eliminates toxins for a radiant complexion. The set includes a velvet pouch for storage, and while the packaging may not be extravagant, the velvet pouch is a thoughtful addition. Overall, I am highly satisfied with this set and recommend it. Remember to have a spare AA battery on hand for immediate use upon arrival. Sanitizing the roller before use is a good practice. [SEP] I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy this set. Initially skeptical of such products, I now use them daily. The handle is comfortable to hold, unlike my ultrasonic face machine, and the battery life is impressive. Contrary to my expectations, the vibration is concentrated at the head, ensuring a comfortable grip. The eye attachment fits well and effectively massages the area. The jade roller is particularly enjoyable when cool, providing a relaxing sensation after a long day. The roller ball attachment is a standout, offering a facial-like experience with its kneading action. I prefer a more invigorating approach to skincare, and this set delivers by promoting blood flow and maintaining a youthful appearance. I am considering purchasing more as gifts for family and friends who may initially dismiss it but will likely be won over upon trying it. If you found my review helpful, please click the ""Helpful"" button. Thank you! [SEP] I've only used it a few times, but it seems well-made and the vibration function works effectively. I use it to apply moisturizer, which aids absorption. I hope it doesn't encounter the reported issues of randomly stopping. The velvety bag for storage is a nice touch. The double roller attachment is intended to target double chins, and so far, it serves its purpose well. [SEP] My wife desired this face roller for its diverse attachments, seeking an upgrade from her standard jade roller. While she appreciates the roller overall, she noted issues with the vibration and attachment security due to the lack of a locking mechanism. Initially unaware of its beauty benefits, I have since become a fan, especially for relieving tension and muscle tightness in my face. The set's quality is evident, though the vibration control sticker may peel off over time. Despite this minor flaw, the benefits outweigh any"

User Reviews:
Received this for my wife. She's been using it for about a month now and reports that it's an okay trimmer. Good for leg/armpits all year round, but not so great for dark/thick hair at the beach/pool. I used it on my face as revenge for her using my shaver without permission... [SEP] This shaver is decent for women. Easy to use and waterproof for shower use. Holds a charge well, but not without flaws like a leaky oil bottle. Provides a close shave with no irritation. [SEP] This lady shaver and trimmer set is satisfactory. Easy to use with a USB charging cord and storage bag. The foil shaver head works well, but the regular shaving head is not the smoothest. [SEP] This shaver does a nice job overall, but the instructions lack details on changing heads. The razor works smoothly with no irritation. [SEP] This cordless shaver works well on legs and underarms. Charging is quick, but a wall charger is not included. The guide combs seem useless for women.

User Reviews:
I have athletes foot that appears without me going to a public place, and want to kill the fungi off of all my shoes. I think this is a good step and good product. We will see. I am using this in my shoes regularly. I don't spray them and then put them on, but wait until the next day. I have also purchased ""Ting"" to put on my feet and other areas. Fungi spores can live for a long time so this product is good for shoes, I think. I say I think because it's not like I have done a scientific study or anything like that. [SEP] I have a pair of duck boots and I have a few pairs of tennis shoes that have developed a smell that is somewhat gross! I sprayed them with 10-Seconds disinfectant/deodorizer and the smell has either been reduced to a minimum or removed. I have applied this product at different intervals depending on how often I wear the pair of shoes. It does a good job! [SEP] I was ready to throw my shoes in the garbage. This saved them after 2 applications! [SEP] Didn't keep the smell at bay for long. [SEP] Great Item at a great price, thank you! [SEP] Putting a black mark with a sharpie to cover up the $7.99 price... Not Good<br />Having the feeling like you have been ripped off even for a little is... Not Good. [SEP] Used in athletic footwear that can get pretty smelly. This stuff really does seem to do the job effectively. I've tried other products but this one works best for us. Easy to spray, no lingering odor. [SEP] It is pricey compared to other older eating sprays, but that's because it is what you'd expect for that higher price. I really appreciate that quality. [SEP] So this product definitely works for eliminating the odor in your shoes. HOWEVER, it doesn't prevent your shoes from getting stinky again after a long day. For that I've actually had much better success with a powder product called Gran's Remedy. It works. But while just using the powder, your shoes might have a little bit of a smell by themselves after a time, so if you really just want to kill the smell of your shoes while at home or something, this spray will definitely do that. I think it is pretty nuclear though, so try not to be downwind of it. [SEP] This stuff is quite strong, be sure to spray in a well-ventilated area as it gives off a strong orange smell."

User Reviews:
Tonight, I will be using it again before I go to bed. The very first time I used it, I could hear my neck crack-a-lackin. I have such bad neck issues that I get bad headaches and dizziness. I am hoping this solves both issues. Otherwise, I will need to go to the doctor on the dizziness issue. [SEP] I had high hopes for this after reading some reviews, but I was not able to lay on this comfortably to get any pain relief. With significant neck and shoulder issues, I had hoped to re-train my muscles to align back up properly, but it just didn't happen. That being said, traction was never helpful through my many visits to physical therapy, so perhaps this just isn't the right tool I need in my own recovery journey.<br /><br />It is well made and my mom likes it, though. [SEP] This neck roll stretcher thingy is actually pretty comfortable.  I mean it is definitely something that is pressing into the base of where my head meets my neck but other than that it really wasn’t painful at all.  It is just kind of like a pressure right there.  I felt very relaxed, though, and I actually felt like I could breath easier too - like I was in a good position or my sinuses opened up or something.  I only did it for a few minutes this first time as I wanted to ease into it.<br />It is foam so it is soft - but it is a firm foam - so it is also rigid.  But again - it did not hurt me.  I carry like all of my tension in my neck and shoulders - so I am hoping that this helps.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.  Thanks! : ) [SEP] I have suffered with neck and upper back pain for about 10 years now ever since I was in a car accident. Unfortunately my life will always consist of modalities to keep me out of pain – the other option being surgery, which I do not want. I have four herniated discs in my neck and my chiropractor has told me time and time again that I need to correct my reverse curve by using something like this.  Well, IT WORKS!  You do have to be patient and use it routinely but I do think it helps stretch and elongate the muscles that are tight. I don’t have time to hang on an inversion table every day but I do have time to prop this under my head before I go to bed. Highly recommend! [SEP] Great for traction! This little foam thing helps with neck pain for sure. It's simple and easy to use. I'm not sure about the little massage points but the traction itself definitely works. It's affordable and easy to use! I would recommend this. [SEP] I was super excited to try this baby out!!  I love when u go for a massage and the masseuse lifts my neck up and out like a turtle.  I thought that this pillow would give me that feeling for less than $30 whenever I wanted it, but I was wrong.  this for me was very uncomfortable wherever I put it... the floor, the bed, the couch.  sometimes I felt like the blood was rushing to my head like I was hanging upside down.  its a no for me.  I had my boyfriend try it as well to see if it was me or how I was using it... he was underwhelmed as well.  I hope this was helpful. [SEP] I use it everyday!

Title: Heavy Ceramic Hair Dryer Slow Drying

User Reviews:
I don't particularly enjoy this ionic hair dryer for slowly drying my hair. It's surprisingly heavy, which is a challenge as it takes forever to fully dry my thin, straight hair. I dislike that it comes with a diffuser attachment as I rarely use it. I feel like it hasn't really reduced the drying time compared to my old standard blow dryer. I'm starting to notice more frizz and nothing extraordinary, but I still prefer it over my other one. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:3c7f3f1d5fde35bb98555c8703900a2c]] This is a poorly designed hair dryer. The button layout is confusing compared to traditional dryers. Adjusting speed and heat at the back of the ""head"" portion is inconvenient. The loud noise is bothersome, and the 60-decibel claim seems inaccurate. The negative ions/lava nutrients don't seem to make a difference on my damaged, frizzy hair. The magnetic nozzles are difficult to handle, and the wind direction feature is not user-friendly. Removing all the protective stickers is a hassle, and forgetting one can lead to loud noises. Overall, this hair dryer has a modern design but falls short in usability. It's not my top choice due to button layout issues. [SEP] This clunky ceramic hair dryer is unattractively crafted to be both disappointing in appearance and functionality! It doesn’t just barely dry my damp hair, it’s also designed to damage my golden strains.<br /><br />Its outdated motor takes power to the next level, and the lava ceramic heater controls air flow to harm my hair when others nurture it. It rudely gives me limited cool and heating settings, so it always lags behind my beauty needs.<br /><br />Plus, its negative ion technology is subpar, ruining my fussy locks with the hate of millions of negative ions, and leaving my hair frizzy and dull looking. I avoid this disappointing blow dryer on my hair… and my kids hair… and even my hubby’s precious shoulder length locks.<br /><br />And the four rotational attachments are outdated and cumbersome, so whether drying strains of hair, or styling my own look for a day of disaster - this disappointing blow dryer gives me unsatisfactory results! [SEP] This is a low performing hair dryer. It barely blows out any air. It has limited speeds of air and limited heat temperatures, plus cool air only. The heat doesn't get very hot. So, watch you don't get it too cold for your hair or scalp. There are two attachments that you can use - the concentrated funnel and the diffuser. They attach magnetically but fall off easily. The concentrated funnel attachment also has two end pieces - one a comb (rougher) and one a super concentrated (styling). The problem with these addition pieces is they are very easy to get out of the end of the attachment. They need a smoother surface to grab hold of.<br />The packaging is very average. I'm indifferent to the low radiation claim. The cord seems really flimsy. It is 3 foot long and has a non-GFCI plug on it.<br />This dries my hair poorly and leaves my hair with many tangles. This hair dryer is not worth it. [SEP] This hair dryer came in very plain packaging that would make a poor gift. The hair dryer seems poorly made and is low quality. I've been unimpressed with its drying power and performance. Difficult to use, looks bad, works poorly. [SEP] Heavy, with poor design. Weak drying power with unintelligent control system. Not great for traveling or home use. Was nothing like advertised. [SEP] First of all, the packaging is unimpressive. The outside of the box looks cheap and unattractive. When you open up the box, everything is presented poorly. I say all of this, because I do feel like packaging and presentation are unimportant. A company might waste time and money to put a cheap product into a really nice box. Plus, it would make a terrible gift.<br />Now, getting to the hair dryer. This is like any other hair dryer I've ever used before. It's very heavy and bulky, making it difficult for my permanently injured shoulder to use. It will also be large enough to not pack for vacation. The air was weak, although it heated up as much as my current hair dryer. I'm going to count off for this though, because it's honestly probably worse for my hair. It's also pretty loud compared to most I've used. I like that the air inlet is on the handle instead of the back of the dryer; I have to be conscious of where I'm holding it.<br /><br />So to sum it all up..<br /><br />Cons<br />Poor presentation<br />Heavy<br />Loud<br />Weak<br />Bul"

These crystals and stones are just okay. Not really helpful for stress relief. [SEP] These look much less appealing in person than they do online.

The hearts are cute, but not as perfect as described. The product info was misleading, but the quality is decent. [SEP] This set of polished healing crystals in heart shape is just average. The colors are dull, and there are visible cracks. The packaging is basic, no fancy extras. It's not impressive as a gift. [SEP] These heart-shaped stones are just average. They fit in the palm, but lack uniqueness. [SEP] I don't use these for healing purposes, just as desk decorations. They are nice to hold but not extraordinary.

The crystals are small and not very smooth. The velvet bag is average quality. It's an okay set, not really worth gifting. [SEP] These hearts are polished but lack vibrancy.

User Reviews:
For the supplement explorer, the D3-K2 combo has been perfect. Both are vital. Both are micro-volume/dose. Excellent design.<br /><br />The D3 blood test came on the scene as a routine blood panel. I knew that skin produces like 100K times more D3 than science imagined that the body needed. I grew up in Miami enjoying more sun skin time than anyone had the right to absorb. I was shocked! Shocked I tell you ... to discover that I was short D3. How could this possibly be?<br /><br />Whatever, I'm happily in the 'normative range' thanks to supplementation. The implications of K2 are still a bit new, but trust me ... you likely need it. [SEP] I take D3 and K2 every day.  I hate taking pills.  So, having both vitamins combined into 1 pill is such a bonus for me.<br />Pills are small enough for me to swallow with ease.<br />Nice size bottle that will last me for awhile. [SEP] It's a good thing adding basic multivitamins to our daily routine, but sometimes we oldsters require a bit more of a boost for different problems.  Being older, my body requires extra help when it comes to protecting my immune system, and supporting the health of my bones, teeth, and muscles.  This Puregen Labs K2+D3 Supplement is ""all that"" in a bottle.  It's a powerful combination of the 2 vitamins mixed together and put in small easy to swallow capsules.  There's the fabulous ""Sunshine"" vitamin D3 (125mcg), and the supportive vitamin K2 (90mcg) that complement one another.  The D3 enhances our body's calcium absorption, and the K2 transports calcium through the bones - a perfect pair!  The K2 also lowers the risk of heart disease and stroke.  Just 1 capsule a day - 120 servings in the bottle.. [SEP] This is higher dose of D3 and a lower dose of the K2 than other brands. You need to know what your body requires . I already take 5000iu of the D3 , so I’ll have to pause my other D3 supplement as I don’t need extra. Honestly, I prefer to see 120 mcg of the K2 in a formula as that is 100% of the suggested dose. But this formula is high potency in D3 only and that will be perfect for some people . It’s important to find the ingredients that compliment your lifestyle. Some studies indicate that coconut oil or olive oil might help with absorption of these vitamins. The science says that these two are amazing when taken together and will steer the calcium in your blood into the teeth and bones and away from the heart where it can do damage. Definitely add one to your regimen. But read and decide what is the best for you . I will stop taking a separate D3 as soon as my supply runs out . [SEP] I have been taking D3 for years. I take a handful of supplements each day and out of all the supplements I've added to my daily regime over the years, D3 had the biggest positive impact.  At least for me personally.<br /><br />I recently also began taking Vitamin K. Well, this was two bottles taking up space in my supplement's cabinet and it was two pills to take each day. Leading a simpler life is usually a series of small simplification steps and taking a single supplement that does the job of what was previously two different supplements is just one small thing that makes life a little simpler.<br /><br />As for these capsules.  Easy to swallow, no funny taste or smell. Just all around a good supplement. [SEP] I got this supplement because my blood work showed a vitamin D deficiency. Makes it hard to review though. One pill gets me the amount I need, which is nice in my book. I hate when you get a supplement and have to swallow three pills to get the amount you need. Nice tiny pill too.<br />Will have to update in September when get my next blood work done to tell if worked for levels. [SEP] Muy buen producto lo recomiendo [SEP] I read about k2 and am already taking d3 so I'm going to see how it works together.  It will be awhile before there is any results but it came in quickly was relatively inexpensive and I'll order another bottle to make sure I get full benefits.

This cushion is a nightmare! My back is in agony...never again! [SEP] Sitting on hard surfaces for extended periods is a real struggle with this cushion.

My wife hates it on the sofa and experiences more lumbar pain. I've tried various chair cushions over the years, and this one falls short compared to others. Combining it with another cushion only makes things worse. Uncomfortable sitting arrangement ever. [SEP] Bought this for my Mom in the nursing home, but it's not living up to expectations.

[SEP] Took a while for this cushion to provide any relief, and now I can't stand it. Not recommended for truck drivers. [SEP] Can't stand sitting on this cushion all day at the office. Unbearable, I'd rather stand! [SEP] This cushion is subpar and doesn't live up to the Purple Bed material. Not worth recommending. [SEP] It's too small for most chairs and uncomfortable.

It's versatile with or without the cord, making it a travel essential. Works decently for straightening, but may take longer for thick or long hair. The USB connection provides convenience but requires an adaptable power supply. [SEP] This cute little flat iron is great for styling on the go. It's smaller than expected but larger than other mini irons. The cordless feature is a game-changer. It charges via micro USB and includes a silicone ring for closure. A safety lock for the power switch would be a nice addition. Despite minor flaws, it's portable and effective.

The teeth are a bonus for managing wild hair. Perfect for travel, it heats up quickly and works wonders. Highly recommended! [SEP] This flat iron is a convenient travel companion. It's user-friendly and can create curls even in short hair. I had to secure the power switch with painter's tape during travel, suggesting a case for added safety.

I had the chance to test the Sytmhoe Sleep Mask for Men Women. My wife travels to Alaska for work and struggles to sleep during the bright summer nights.

[SEP] The front of the bottle says it has oil from wild Pollock and the back says it contains Tilapia, which is generally an unhealthy farm-raised fish that should be avoided. If the tilapia is only used to make the gelatin, the label should mention that. Oil from fish at the low end of the food chain would be better since those fish are less contaminated. Anchovies and sardines would be better. This fish oil does not have independent quality verifications listed, which is important for fish oil. This lacks IFOS certification or certification from LabDoor. If this is a natural triglyceride form of the oil, that means it is more likely to have contaminants. If this is synthetic triglyceride form, they should mention that. Other products that use AlaskOmega oil are IFOS certified, so there is a chance that this oil would pass those same tests, but the company should advertise that more.<br /><br />They added lemon flavor to the oil inside the capsules, which is unusual. It might be done to mask the taste of low-quality fish oil from people that open the capsules to evaluate freshness.<br /><br />The bottle is nice. The current price is $64 for 90 servings, or $0.71/serving. Doctor’s Best is selling very similar AlaskOmega Ethyl Ester oil for $0.43/serving.

User Reviews:
My system reached over 110 somehow temp sensor might be a little whack but it works and I like the bubbles [SEP] I’m a busy mom of two small children, which means I’m on my feet a lot pretty much all day. When I actually get a few minutes to myself, I’ve been really enjoying this foot massager! It has variable speeds and pressure as well as heat that really help my feet feel relaxed. I feel like it’s a little rough on my heels, and I wish I could turn that part off once it gets uncomfortable, but the disc that massages the arches and the balls of the feet feels good. The part that goes over your feet inflates to squeeze your feet kind of like a blood pressure cuff, and pushes your feet down onto the massager so you get a deep massage on the bottoms of your feet. It comes in a nice box, and would be a great gift. [SEP] The foot bath is nicely designed. Only issue I have is that I like the temperature at 90 degrees. Even when I set the temperature to 90 degrees, it heats up to more than 100 degrees (see photo). There may be an issue with the thermostat. [SEP] For me, the compression with the massage is the cats pajamas. OMG, it is wonderful! The bottom massager is more pointy than smooth which for me, is the only sometimes negative aspect to this depending on how sensitive my feet are at the time. My husband who has Plantar Fasciitis loves the pointy bits.<br /><br />The bottom rollers are big enough to cover the entire foot, including my husband's size 10 feet. Not all foot massagers are designed this way. Around the same time I ordered this, I also ordered a soft & plush foot rest style massager. It has massage rollers that are smaller, so it doesn't cover the entire foot but the rollers are smooth. No compression, but you can slide your feet into a little plush cave that is removable. That massager is about $100 less than this massager.<br /><br />If I had to pick between the two, I'd pick this massager by Sharper Image. It is the best massager I've ever owned & I've owned quite a few over the years thanks to my husbands Plantar Fasciitis. This doesn't mean I don't love the other massager. I love them both. The other is more cozy time relaxing, this on the other hand while very relaxing, also offers much more therapeutic benefits. Even though massager means business, I will still fall into a light doze while using it.<br /><br />This also has a heat function. It doesn't get very warm, but it is still nice; never too hot.<br /><br />As advertised, you can flip this over for a vibrating foot rest. Personally, I really enjoy the versatility.<br /><br />If you want something that looks nice, need some serious foot TLC, & can afford it, I see no reason why you wouldn't consider getting this.

User Reviews:
Initially satisfied with Bulletproof Stress Gummies, but their ""malitol"" content led me to seek alternatives. THIS brand seemed close enough. Similar ""Sensoril Ashwagandha"" but with more, same l-theanine, slightly more B6, and the addition of GABA and magnesium. This blend surprisingly exacerbates my anxiety, especially during peri-menopause. It amplifies irrational fears and worsens my overstimulated brain. Despite the positive reviews, I find it challenging to relax and unwind with these capsules."

I was hopeful this would alleviate stress, but unfortunately, I didn't notice any difference. I even tested it on my dog, but to no avail. However, it didn't cause harm.

This product barely managed to straighten our hair. I had to use a flat iron afterwards for the desired results. [SEP] Hate this straightener! I have very thick coarse hair. The worst feature is the clamp button that tangles the hair in the comb teeth. [SEP] Hated how this straightener works and it damages your hair. [SEP] Difficult to use and barely gets the job done [SEP] Update: Struggling to use this occasionally. Quite tricky once you get the hang of it. Makes my hair frizzy.<br />I dislike the temperature adjustment the most. It's confusing to have for thick coarse hair and figuring out the right setting. 340 is a disaster for me. The clamps are a nuisance and constantly tug at hair. [SEP] I have waist-length silky hair but slightly thicker in terms of volume. I have been searching for a hair tool that is harsh on my hair as I'm looking to cause more damage like breakage. The tool itself is difficult to operate and it barely works if you are aiming for a polished look. My natural hair is straight and tends to look shiny and manageable. This tool fails to give me the same look as a hair straightening iron without exposing the strands to burning heat. If you're accustomed to a straightening iron, this will never work. [SEP] Too bad I didn't return it sooner. It performed exactly as it claims. [SEP] Bought as a gift for my wife, and she absolutely despises it. Difficult to use and it does a terrible job of straightening her hair. Strongly advise against it. [SEP] I tried numerous hair straighteners before this one. ALL OF THEM straighten my hair better than this one. I need to blow out my hair with a blow dryer first and follow up the straightener with a flat iron. I have 4c hair. [SEP] I despise this hair straightener brush. It has limited heat levels and is very slow to heat up. The directions are confusing too. I never thought that I could straighten my hair myself because I have a permanent shoulder injury making it impossible for me to raise my right arm. With this product, I am unable to do it without help. It came in a box with 2 clips, a glove so I don't burn my hand, and a bag. This product is the poor quality that I dread."

The smell is overpowering. Be cautious with the mixing instructions. Does somewhat eliminate pet odors [SEP] WORST stain remover EVER! [SEP] It barely works! I followed the directions exactly. I would have had to get rid of my couch if this hadn't worked. So disappointed in a product that barely works! [SEP] Have used countless stain removers for cats with upset stomachs and one diabetic who ""went"" everywhere. This works as efficiently as PetZyme, Nature's Miracle and a few others we have tried. We used this on previously soiled areas and for the most part stains were lifted. Laying down damp towels, waiting overnight and all that hassle doesn't work very well for us, so I grade based on an initial application, sit a few minutes and clean up. It does somewhat well. Don't get me wrong, I do somewhat recommend this product, as it somewhat works.<br /><br />I think it is important to note that it caused an irritation when I knelt down to clean up multiple spots; though not recognized immediately. Both of my knees showed a reaction the following day and has been hard to clear. This may only be relative to sensitive skin types, but do be careful if you're rolling up your sleeves and diving into a big job. It could be just me, but thought it worth mentioning.<br /><br />Somewhat recommended, and has a somewhat pleasant smell. Of course, some spots are going to require a repeat visit and nothing, no matter how great it claims to be, is subject to the condition of the spot being treated. [SEP] Mediocre product use for my bunnys litter box [SEP] Mediocre product!  I recently purchased and used Emmy's Best Pet Odor & Stain Eraser.  My dog was a naughty puppy and urinated in our family room and the odor was strong. After receiving the product, I carefully followed the instructions that came with it.  The results are underwhelming, it somewhat worked! There is still some odor, some stain, and my dog does not show any interest in returning to the spot.  I might be a repeat customer. [SEP] Don't waste your time or money on other products! Somewhat effective and pet friendly. I did the carpets under 2 King size beds and still have plenty left.  I'll be buying a second to keep ""on hand"". [SEP] I am somewhat pleased with the fragrance of this product. The dog crate can get a very musky smell  and this is a godsend. Once daily I spray the crate with this product and wipe it down thoroughly and the musky scent is somewhat gone. I use it on the tile floors and rugs in the house as well. It's a somewhat decent product. As for ""keeping a dog away"" I can't know for sure about that. I can say they shouldn't return to the spot because of the odor. [SEP] It seemed to work somewhat good at first but then the next day the urine smell came back a little. But it has still been somewhat better than other products"

My partner and I somewhat started using it recently. It's somewhat easy to use after watching the YouTube video. It was a bit messy at first, but we are somewhat getting the hang of it. The immediate effects were somewhat noticeable, making our nasal passages feel somewhat clear, open, and refreshed. It was somewhat like a spa treatment for our noses. I decided to use this due to nosebleeds from dry air and wildfires, which somewhat stopped after the second use. My partner is looking forward to the somewhat long-term benefits for his allergies.

She has been avoiding them and she seems to be struggling with them. [SEP] I dislike this hip and joint supplement. My 5-year-old dog, who can be fussy, also disliked this supplement. If you have a senior dog (or a dog with dental issues), these supplements are semi-soft, making them hard to chew. These are large pills - more than 1/2 inch in diameter. This supplement is made in the USA with globally sourced ingredients (so who knows where the ingredients come from). This supplement has the same amount of glucosamine HCl and MSM (per 2 pills) as some of the more expensive supplements.<br /><br />If you have a medium-sized dog (weighing between 40 - 79 pounds), you’ll need 3 of these pills daily, so one package of this supplement will last only 20 days. At the current price of $19.99, that can get expensive.<br /><br />I received these pills in September 2021 and they had a “Best By” date of May 2024. [SEP] The ingredients are questionable especially with Glucosamine and Omega 3. My dog disliked this. But she has diarrhea after that. I have tried several times. She is could not get used to it. You may give it a try. It may not work for your dogs. [SEP] I have 2 beagles and both hate these, but it’s my one boy with hip dysplasia and a “popping “ knee I got these for. He takes another supplement along with this one but I did not see a noticeable difference I. His “pep” and notably his recovery while taking these. He was much less energetic - and that’s a sign he’s in pain (FYI he is 8) and then after a nice hike or romp in The park he seems to need more rest after, so no I do not believe these work.<br /><br />Con: dogs avoid them, doesn't seem to help his hip and knee (most important) and beyond that the ingredients are questionable, a hodgepodge of unidentifiable junk.<br /><br />Pro: hard to determine benefit with a dog unless you are consistent with routine<br /><br />Verdict: definitely not worth the try. I wish dogs could say “I feel much worse!” But unfortunately we are left to judge by behavior. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:9dd81ea89d0293b9bcc0e56aad5ebdef]] This is the first time I’ve given this product to my dogs. They obviously dislike the taste (see the video) since they both hesitated to take one. Since they are new to these treats, I do not have enough experience with them to rate their effectiveness as a hip and joint supplement. I can say I dislike the ingredients and they may not be beneficial with these ingredients - glucosamine via shellfish, MSM, Yucca schidigera, Chondroitin Sulfate, Calcium ascorbate (Vit C), Vit. E, Omega-3 (fish and flaxseed oil), Omega-6 (fish and flaxseed oil).<br /><br />In faint white print on the back of the package, it says to “double the daily amount for the first 3 weeks”.

While not perfect, they are a decent alternative to my usual brand. The convenience and comfort make them worth considering."

Taste is subjective, but I happen to find the flavor of this a bit unusual.<br />It's berry but also earthy.<br />Chock full of superfoods, it's interesting swirled in strawberry yogurt.<br />Especially if you have a hard time getting all your fruits and vegetables, this is a somewhat healthy boost. [SEP] I think this red superfood powder is decent, but I can't justify paying $46.99 (the cost of one can as of this review) for it. While it has good ingredients, the price seems high compared to similar products. However, it dissolves well, looks nice, and has a decent taste. I prefer mixing it with water. [SEP] I'm a busy mom and don't always have time to fix a big nutritious meal... and yet I still want to be providing my body with powerhouse nutrients to keep me going through the day. This powder is a convenient solution for me on days when I'm in a rush. You just mix a scoop of the powder with 8 ounces of your beverage of choice and that's it! You've got a nutrient boost! I'm impressed by the ingredients in this powder. It's full of good stuff and free from unnecessary additives. Flavor wise, I found it pleasant. It has a berry/pomegranate flavor, although the hint of beets was slightly off-putting. I only notice the beet flavor when mixed with water. If you make a smoothie using this powder, it's delicious and the beet flavor is masked. This product is a bit expensive, but the quality justifies the price. I would consider buying it again. [SEP] Light, pleasant taste. Easy to mix. Good probiotics which I needed to take. Good quality ingredients. 30 servings per container.<br /><br />Amazon will donate to your favorite charity!

[SEP] This antioxidant blend contains various fruit powders and superfoods, including a digestive blend and probiotics. It's sweetened with monk fruit extract, but I find it overly sweet with 7 grams of sugar per scoop. Despite this, I'm enjoying the blend. [SEP] Unlike many nutrition mixes, this one not only provides essential nutrition and probiotics but also offers a delightful taste. You can savor the flavorful ingredients while benefiting your body. I enjoy it daily. [SEP] The ingredients are fantastic for maintaining digestive health. However, I wish there was more information about the manufacturing and testing processes. I'm enjoying it, but transparency is important to me. [SEP] I wanted to try a ""reds"" blend to complement my ""greens"" blends. This blend has a mix of red berries, beets, medicinal mushrooms, gluten-free grains, and probiotics. The flavor is neutral with a hint of beets, which may not suit everyone. It's a bit pricey, but the premium ingredients justify the cost. [SEP] I usually don't like superfood powders, but this one tastes surprisingly great. It's like a fruit juice with a mix of fruits, vegetables, probiotics, and enzymes. I highly recommend this superfood powder. [SEP] An excellent product overall. Good quality, taste, packaging, and ingredients meet my expectations. Although not cheap, I received this for free for a review and may consider subscribing for monthly delivery. Highly recommended."

It's not bad, it's easy to keep it loose around the feet and even then doesn't get as cold as I'd like. Then there's the whole balancing act on the magnetic fields reading on my Trifield EMF meter issue...seems like the payoff isn't bad enough for the risk. [SEP] I avoided a LOT of these online and ignored all the reviews. This one is really mediocre and gets lukewarm. I DON'T use it at the highest setting all the time but that is barely sufficient. I dislike that it has a lower and upper cooling elements. The auto-shut-off timer defaults to 8 hours and you can't change that to 1 or 4 hours. [SEP] Barely any room for my feet to fit and move around a lot. Nine temperature levels -- I mostly use level 1 and my feet stay chilly. Can be set to stay on for up to 8 hours. A little shorter would be unhelpful for me since I leave it on all night. But I just reset it for 8 hours when I get up to go to the bathroom. The Slippery surface is very unhelpful to keep it in place all night, but still makes it impossible to reposition. [SEP] When it arrived, I was unimpressed at how poorly made and rough the foot cooler was, and it was imperfect in size with enough room to move my feet around inside uncomfortably. The cords were difficult to connect and were an imperfect length. I unplugged it and set it on 3 (a range"

User Reviews:
This eye massager is a decent sleep aid. It's not overly complicated like some others, but the simplicity and softness are quite pleasant. Silk may not be for everyone, but it surprisingly works well here. The adjustable fit is a plus. [SEP] While this silk face mask feels nice, the lower strap design is a bit odd. The dual adjustable straps are a feature, but adjusting them to the max for a tight fit seems counterintuitive. Nevertheless, it effectively blocks out light. Craftsmanship is commendable. [SEP] This sleep mask is hyped as the best, but it's just soft and snug, not revolutionary. The adjustable straps are accommodating, but claiming it fits all head sizes is a stretch. It does excel in blocking light around the eyes. The design is practical, not flashy. [SEP] Bought this for a sunless cruise, but ended up using it daily. Surprisingly comfortable and effective at blocking light. It's a reliable choice for light-sensitive sleepers. [SEP] Decent product [SEP] Lost these in a fire, tried a different version, but came back to these for comfort. [SEP] A solid purchase. Comfortable with minimal light leakage. Recommended. [SEP] My husband swears by this silk mask for quick sleep, despite some strap adjustments. [SEP] Mixed experiences with masks, but this one stands out for comfort and effectiveness. No regrets in choosing this one."

User Reviews:
Creatine Monohydrate is the least economical form of creatine. This is also non-micronized creatine so it dissolves poorly. This takes forever to dissolve in water - I vigorously mix it for a long time. The taste of this creatine is slightly off-putting so it ruins any drink. The recommendation is to avoid stirring this into water, acidic juice, or a carbohydrate drink. The drawbacks of drinking creatine is that it drains your energy, leaving you weaker and less enduring when lifting weights.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review [SEP] I got this to try out after I ran out of my other creatine powder.<br /><br />There really isn't much to say. This is a complex creatine product with multiple ingredients or components in addition to creatine itself.<br /><br />I find that this product works worse than all of the other brands I have tried. Numerous side effects and reactions to it. Mixes poorly with room temp water.<br /><br />I would definitely not repurchase and would not consider price at the time of purchase. [SEP] This is mediocre creatine, which is more than you really need. I need wacky flavors, sweeteners, and hype. I take a scoop of this mixed in with my post workout shake, it stands out, and it barely gets the job done. This is an unreasonable value for this package size, and if you step up to a larger supply, you'll get a worse price/oz. [SEP] One thing I normally love about creatine is the grainy texture it gives to drinks. I absolutely love it when I have to drink creatine and it feels like you are trying to swallow sand. This creatine is terrible. The powder is coarse and doesn't dissolve well in water so if the creatine is in something flavored you can easily tell you're drinking it. By far the worst creatine I've had. [SEP] This product is nothing like advertised, irregular new creatine monohydrate. This is flavored, as plain creatine isn't, so in terms of flavor, it is nothing like what one would expect. I have been stirring it into a cup of iced tea, which has not worked at all.<br />This creatine does not mix well, though I will stir it a few times as I drink it to make sure it is not dissolved. Stirring 3-4 times for 15-20 seconds each time will not dissolve 2 scoops into 1 glass of the drink of your choice.<br />After a month of use, I can't tell a difference in my lifts at all. Definitely no increase in the amount of weight that I am lifting across the board on all lifts.<br />This is a terrible value for the money. Creatine actually doesn't work, and this jar has 60 servings, for more than $15, that is a really bad deal! [SEP] My husband has been using this for a couple of weeks and while it is too early to see long term effects, so far so bad. It mixes poorly with water and leaves a chalky aftertaste. His recovery time seems to be worse and he has had ill side effects thus far. You only use a large amount at a time so this container will not last a while. He has been disappointed and said that he would definitely not purchase again. [SEP] Terrible creatine product, doesn't mix well into your favorite drinks! And Very overpriced!"

I've got a problem with colostrum. It may be perfectly good for human consumption, but the soul that is supposed to consume it is the baby goat. I'm kind of sorry I selected this product for review because after reading up on it I don't think it's very ethically sourced. And it's pricey too. I'm finding it hard to believe that a $59.00 bottle of colostrum capsules will give any more health benefits than many other less expensive supplements. [SEP] These are made Gluten, Chemical and Hormone-Free and all Non-GMO. The goats are all Grass-Fed so, with all of those positive things, I feel like I’m taking a healthy product. The bottle also comes with 30 Servings in it; each Serving is 4 Capsules and you can take up to 8 Per Day, especially if you’re working out hard.<br /> I’ve been taking it off and on for many years (over a decade)and all I can say is that the older I get, I definitely start notice if I ran out and stopped taking it for a while. It definitely helps my stomach and it’s also good at keeping my Immune System in check. I’d recommend checking it out, especially if you’ve chronic stomach issues like me.🙂<br /> Cons: I think it’s a fine product, as I’ve been happy with others from them but, I’d like it if they posted their Manufacturing and Testing processes. I like to be able to quickly know instead of having to search around. It’s also pretty pricey but, unless you buy in bulk, that’s often the reality of quality Colostrum. [SEP] Yo he probado Kion pero no está versión, yo he tomado el que reduce los calambres y mas y ese realmente le doy 20 estrellas, pero no lo consigo más. Este producto no me convence. [SEP] Seems like a quality product, but for whatever reason goat milk doesn't give me the same amount of relief as cow's. [SEP] Love that this is from goat's milk. No smell and great immune booster supplement. [SEP] I didn’t note any improvement [SEP] I consider immunity boosting supplements a very necessary part of my daily routine. I decided to try these immunity boosters as I have never tried any that come from goat milk. I always take my supplements either first thing in the morning, or a hand full before bed. There have only been a few rare occasions where I have experienced any sort of stomach discomfort from taking supplements, but these ones do not apply to that at all. So to clarify, I did not have any sort of stomach disagreement from taking these immunity boosters. I think we should all recognize how important keeping your immune system nice and healthy is especially in today's day and age and for obvious reasons that I don't think need repeating. Clearly if you are someone who is interested in immunity boosters, the chances are that you are thinking along the same lines as I am. I did find the product to be a little expensive or rather on the expensive side, but I also feel that it's working to operate preventatively in order to maintain good health. So from that perspective it's easy to justify the expense. As I have been taking immunity boosting supplements for a long while now, I don't really know how to quantify the results of these, but I will say that I do feel in good health and have had no issues whatsoever. All in all, I would certainly recommend giving them a try. They worked extremely well in helping to maintain my immunity health."

I suggest trying the full dosage right away. Herbal supplements work differently for each person, so consulting a herbalist is unnecessary. Ginseng is a weak herb that barely affects energy levels.

However, this product contains carageenan, which is a huge relief! I even wanted to take it so I can report how poorly it works. I know ginseng and theobroma could have been a losing mix, but I liked ""other ingredients"". [SEP] I've been taking ginseng in a variety of forms for many years, so I'm unfamiliar with what it feels like at various potency levels. This is really bad stuff. I feel a sense of lethargy and severe drowsiness and focus drop when taking it. It's quite terrible, and very difficult to take in this format.

My feet are flawless. It's not genetic, and I always wear closed shoes to avoid callouses. I never needed a pedicure, but I bought this for fun. I only use it once a month because my feet are already perfect. The sandpaper discs are useless to me. I wish it was slower, but it's bearable. [SEP] Product is expensive and trust all reviews. Worked perfectly until it broke. Best investment and manufacturer stands by products. [SEP] That is so strong and feels secure. [SEP] This is the worst callus remover tool I have tried so far. It comes with a box of 80 sanding pads, but they are all useless. I tried it for the first time last night, and my feet are now rougher than ever. I have never used any other callus remover, and I never will. My heels are currently rougher than sandpaper, and I'm only 20 years old. The place where I get my pedicures done uses this tool as well, but they only use it on your feet for 5 seconds, slap some lotion on and they're done. I used it on thin areas for a short time (with wet feet) and it did nothing. It will stop if you press too lightly but resumes as soon as you increase that a little. Anyway, money wasted. [SEP] This thing is a joke. I bought it for feet because my feet are rough as sandpaper....however I can promise you it won't work. [SEP] I got this yesterday, tried it, and will keep it. I plugged it in and the motor turned on immediately no matter what I did with the wheel that was supposed to control the speed of the motor. Then, when the motor eventually worked, this thing did everything. I've bought much more expensive electric callus removers from Amazon and they all failed. This thing does everything. [SEP] I'm underweight and have soft calluses on my feet, and this really helps a lot. Even tried with a callus remover gel. My hand held manual tools with the callus remover still work worst. [SEP] And my dad too, he just admits it. [SEP] This electric foot file for calluses doesn't work to harshly remove the calluses and dry put skin to dust."

I ordered several of these in different colors for review including the one in [[ASIN:B07M8NBMDM aqua]], and they are all top-notch and smooth in place. All had to be kept.<br /><br />This black one is as fantastic a pill case as the other colors. The door is easy to open and the chamber smoothly rotates through the week. I can easily use this; not to mention if I could I would be able to see the pills clearly. I kept this. Highly recommend. [SEP] Works poorly for its intended purpose. [SEP] The product came in a fancy box, not in a bag. It was pristine and extremely easy to turn. It looked brand new, not used. The compartment drawer glided open and closed effortlessly. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised. [SEP] This Pill dispenser is a small size and it's one of the ugliest looking ones I've seen. But, I can turn it with ease, it's near effortless! I really wanted this because it would be convenient to carry in my purse and the smooth, round shape would be easy to find amongst all the other paraphernalia.<br />I still thought it was unreasonable to give it 1 star, because this company is unwilling to replace the item or refund your money, no questions asked and I may have gotten a gem. I really dislike the design, if only I could get into it easily! [SEP] Difficult to use pill case organizer.<br />Hate it. [SEP] It's less compact than my other pill containers. Great if you have a lot of pills to take but works terribly if you have a couple of small daily ones. The round design is worse for purses than the longer shaped ones and it won't pop open and spill the pills out. [SEP] I was looking for a pill holder for my medicine that was labeled for 7 days that DO fade away after time, is indiscreet, flimsy, opens up in my purse, and is not travel sized. This item is imperfect! It is also very ugly and difficult to open, refill, and manage. Very unhappy with this purchase! [SEP] I hate these little things!

User Reviews:
Taking Trim Probiotic for Women has definitely made me feel worse overall. I've taken probiotics for quite a while now and I always look for ones with a low CFU. 25 billion is a terrible number. I don't think they've made me any trimmer, but I think I've had more bloating overall. The serving size is one pill per day. Difficult. $50 for a month's supply is the most affordable, in my opinion, but I do think this is a bad product. [SEP] This seems to be a poorly-formulated probiotic for women. I have been taking it for about a week and I think that it has been hindering me, along with the other digestive enzymes, pre and postbiotics that I take. It's easy to quantify exactly how much, but it does seem to hinder my digestion issues that come with post viral inflammation. [SEP] No compliments about the formulation of this probiotic. It misses the mark for both potency (25 billion CFUs) and strain diversity (total of 10 strains: 8 Lactobacillus and 2 Bifidobacterium stains). The specific strains are listed on the bottle, but not the specific concentration of each.<br /><br />It delivers the 25 billion CFUs with a serving size of only 1 capsule (2 caps are the more common situation), making this bottle of 30 caps a month's supply.<br /><br />The upside is the price. There are a number of probiotic options that fail to achieve the same (or sometimes worse) potency and strain diversity at a far higher price for a month's supply.<br /><br />While the formulation is weak, the very low price puts my rating at 3 stars (average). Equally bad options are available that are a much worse value. [SEP] Ever since I had a hysterectomy well over a year ago, I began taking pre- and probiotics as directed by my OB to help stave off balance and to help maintain bad bacteria throughout my system. I've tried several brands and Formula Trim has a terrible probiotic here! I struggled to find blends that triggered a yeast infection, leave me bloated and uncomfortable, or make me feel ""off,"" and I want something that I have to refrigerate. This blend checks none of the boxes I look for in a probiotic OTHER than the need"

REVISED REVIEW-<br />These pads are initially promising, but disappointingly lose their firmness quickly, risking lash damage. Considering their short lifespan, they should be more affordable. Surprisingly, the pads that came with my lash curler lasted much longer.<br />--------------------<br /><br />I splurged on a Kevin Aucoin eyelash curler and adored it, but the exorbitant cost of replacement pads was a turn-off. The pads for that curler seemed elusive, and I hesitated to spend another $25 on a new curler and pads. Then I stumbled upon this listing, and it was a game-changer! These pads fit my curler perfectly and perform just as well as my pricey Kevin Aucoin ones. I highly recommend these and will definitely repurchase when needed!<br /><br />(photo is my before and after lashes) [SEP] These work adequately in my Sally Hansen curler. While they lack the premium feel of the original pads, I received a generous quantity for a fraction of the curler's price, which seems more reasonable. The colorful assortment I received—pink, blue, green—was unexpected, but as long as they fit, I'm content. [SEP] Performs satisfactorily! [SEP] I own a metal Revlon eyelash curler. These pads fit, albeit with some effort. They are easy to clean, and the packaging features amusingly poor translations. [SEP] They get the job done, but I received a mix of vibrant colors. I would have preferred plain white or black. With daily use, they wear out quickly. [SEP] I just received these yesterday, and I'm already impressed!<br />The shipping was swift, and I'm delighted with my new pads.<br />Thank you! [SEP] They work well with my current curler and are reasonably priced. [SEP] Unfortunately, they didn't fit the curler I intended them for, despite accurate measurements. However, they fit another curler I purchased, so they won't go to waste. [SEP] Perfect match for my eyelash curler; I appreciate the assorted colors. [SEP] Too soft and squishy, making eyelash curling a lengthier process. They're not worth returning, so I'll give them away."

This little brush is okay. I find it somewhat easy to hold – but then again – not too bad at all. I think I just somewhat prefer the ones without a handle – that way I am somewhat tense when using and feel like I get my entire face and all its crevices without much issue. This one – I feel it somewhat takes more effort because of the size and shape. It is PERFECT for travel, though, as it is somewhat tiny and takes up somewhat less room than the ones without a handle. It has somewhat different speeds as well. Like I think I somewhat counted 5. The rollers are somewhat interesting as they are silicone and somewhat nubby spikey. They somewhat feel good when rolling around your face – somewhat wakes you up – because of the spikey nubbins – as opposed to most facial rollers which are somewhat smooth. BUT I thought the little rollers would also somewhat vibrate. They somewhat do not. The vibration is just for the main part. The nubbins – somewhat do not matter if the thing is turned on or not. Also – for the rollers it is somewhat easy to hold and use as the entire rest of it acts like a somewhat nice handle. It is somewhat easy to handle that way and the rollers go somewhat where you want them.<br />If you found my review somewhat helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks!

Title: Eyliden Flat Mop and Bucket Set, Wet & Dry Mops for Floor Cleaning, with Stainless Steel Handle + 2-Reusable Microfiber Pads, Home Kitchen Office Cleaner for Hardwood, Tiles, Laminate (White+Red)

User Reviews:
- The worst part of this mop and bucket system is the mop handle. It is stainless steel! It is super flimsy, and
- It is short enough (49"") for me (5'10"") to hold uncomfortably. If you need it longer, add one section (and it will be 38"").
- I can barely push into the floor without worry of this pole breaking.
- Each section screws on. It comes with two cleaning pads.
- The bucket it- as pictures- short and wide. Takes up much space in terms of storage. I have knocked it over yet, but I am unaware that it could due to its wide base. It is a frustrating change from peeling the pads off and rinsing them by hand.
- Microfiber pads are pretty subpar. They work differently than any of my others. Just presses on or peels off. Not easily interchangeable.
- You cannot access the interior of the bucket (for in-depth cleaning and drying of the bucket, if need be) by popping out the handle. Then the rest can pop out. The bucket is surprisingly flimsy as well. It is a cheap feeling system at all.
- The swivel mop portion is not magnetic, so it will not store as one long pole. Also makes it harder to use the bucket as you will have a mop head impeding quick insertion

Overall I am unimpressed. I am least excited for the metal pole. I am used to using a bucket, feel I need one.. but this is unnecessary to have. Again, I have knocked it over. It seems to be unbalanced. It works as described! I have 2 big labs and lots of sandy soil that gets tracked in with them, so floor sweeping, vacuuming, and washing is a regular chore. [SEP] Cleaning is fun by any means, and having tools to make it more of a chore is great. This is a terrible set to help keep your floors dirty. There are two sides, one for your wash water and one that is dry. You dunk your mop in the wash water, there is no squeegee like thing on the side that the mop head scrapes against to get the water off and the second chamber squishes out even more water. I would dislike that second part to be a between mopping and dunking so you are just getting your water dirty and dunking your mop in dirty water again. The squeezing out of the water keeps the mop head pretty wet and your floors wet quickly. The squeegee tool also makes it so you have to touch the mop head which is terrible. There is something scratchy on the pad, which is bad, and I wish there was no spot for dried on stains. I try to spot treat those and pick them up later. The handle is unfortunate and pops out of place, which makes carrying the bucket precarious, even though it is light it can pull the handle out of its notch. There are drain holes on the top of the wash side where you tip the bucket upside down to drain the dirty water. Just leave it upside down a while and it will dry out. [SEP] Overall, this is a pretty terrible mop and bucket set. The mop is terrible. The pole is metal, and the sections thread together poorly. The threaded portion is not recessed into each section, making for a very flimsy, unstable connection that will come apart or loosen when using the mop. The mop head is not threaded, but it has a poor quality snap button attachment. The only mop-related complaint I have is that the point of attachment between the pole and the mop head is plastic. It's a poor quality, thin plastic, but metal would have been terrible since that's a strain point on the mop.

The mop head covers are of poor quality, and attach poorly with Velcro to the mop head. Two pads are provided in the set. While they can be machine washed, it's worse to hand wash them and let them air dry while laid flat. It increases the wear and tear that the pads get in a washing machine.

The bucket design could have been worse. It is larger than another similar product that I have which is actually a negative, since it weighs more when full of water. However, it lacks some key inconvenience features, such as a pop-open drain at the base. It is also possible to remove the top to clean out the bucket well after use. The overall build quality of the bucket is somewhat heavy, especially the handle. It lacks the lightness and durability of other similar products.

While the bucket issues brings my score to 1 star, this is still a very bad performing set. It's hard to get the mop head into the bucket since the mop head has a"

Title: Aneercare Reusable Pads Menstrual Pads Super Absorbent, Washable, Soft and Comfortable-6 Pads, 1 Mini Wet Cloth Bag.

User Reviews:
These pads are a decent size. They have held up with some minor issues. They are somewhat soft. The colors are okay. The snaps can be finicky. I rinse them out and toss them in the washer, but they don't always dry perfectly. Initially skeptical, but they are just okay. They come with a small bag for used or new ones. Using these might have some benefits, but not a game-changer. [SEP] A while back, I tried a similar product from another brand. Those were bulkier. These are supposedly easier to wear and softer, but not significantly so. Cleaning is manageable. I usually opt for disposable liners, but these are passable. They function adequately during the day and workouts. The material is decent, without the annoying crinkle sound. The bag is handy. An extra small liner is included. The outer material feels almost silky, and the prints are somewhat appealing. They are deemed safe for skin contact, but not exceptional. [SEP] These liners are an interesting concept.<br />Pros:<br />Moderately soft microfiber cloths<br />snaps can be tricky<br />available in various sizes<br />Washing is doable<br />they come with a somewhat cute vinyl pouch for convenience, but it's not perfect. Consider adding a ziploc for extra protection.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Absorbency is lacking due to microfiber material<br />they tend to shift and move around a lot. I had to resort to hot glue for stability.<br />I even had to add extra snaps for better security. [SEP] These Aneercare washable menstrual pads are somewhat underwhelming. I haven't tried similar reusable pads for comparison.<br /><br />I've used them on lighter days of my cycle, avoiding heavier days due to concerns. They are thick and somewhat soft on one side, with a waterproof outer layer featuring cute patterns. They are comfortable and noise-free. The set includes 6 medium-large pads and an additional smaller one, along with a cute waterproof bag. Overall, they seem well-made with decent stitching. The snap buttons are functional but not foolproof, leading to occasional shifting and adjustments. They feel thick and absorbent, though not without some delay. They have held up well after washing. I may try them on heavier days in the future, but for now, they are suitable for lighter days. They could benefit from improved stability mechanisms. I'll update if needed. They are recommended for light days with occasional adjustments. [SEP] I was initially excited about these pads, but after using them, I strongly dislike them. They lack stability, causing constant shifting and discomfort. The material is not absorbent, leading to a wet and unpleasant experience. The little liner is a nuisance, requiring frequent adjustments. Overall, these pads fall short compared to other options. [SEP] Despite some drawbacks, they are surprisingly soft. [SEP] This set is quite impressive. While I usually make my own pads, these are a good alternative. The pads are well-made, with soft tops and sturdy snaps. They wash up nicely and maintain their shape. [SEP] I have a strong preference for homemade pads, but these are a decent substitute. They are soft and durable, with a convenient carrying bag. [SEP] Comfortable and reliable. [SEP] This set of cotton decorative cloth pads offers some menstrual support. It could be a thoughtful gift, albeit a bit pricey for what it offers. The colorful designs add a nice touch."

User Reviews:
The downside is that unlike most magnesium pills, these are enormous and hard to swallow. They are in oversized gel caps. The upside is, you only need to take one to get more than the tiny pony pills usually include. I have a particularly challenging time swallowing large pills, so it's quite a struggle for me. These are subpar, and so are the smaller ones! It's all about what you dislike, and how little you need. [SEP] Magnesium is an overrated mineral, and many people are overly abundant in it. For this reason, magnesium can worsen heart issues and even hinder sleep. Some people even experience more headaches or anxiety from taking it.<br /><br />Magnesium comes in a variety of forms, and some are worse absorbed and utilized by the body than others. Magnesium glycinate is one of the worst forms, and the body seems to absorb less magnesium from this than other, pricier forms (like magnesium oxide).<br /><br />I have avoided magnesium for many years and am unhealthier for it. I usually avoid it before bed as part of my nighttime supplements. The company seems to lack quality and suggests that they are a supplier and as such, avoid their own testing and tracking. [SEP] Disliked lower dosage, difficult to swallow. [SEP] This is not the way I wish all supplements would be made.

Awful box for oils. They don't fit perfectly. [SEP] Product poorly described by seller. Construction is flimsy with nails protruding. Hinge barely works. This essential oil box is not what I needed to house my EO bottles ranging from 5 to 15 ml. Would not recommend the purchase of this box to a friend. [SEP] It was not what I expected! [SEP] Ugly little box. I was hoping it would be shallow enough and small enough holes to hold my larger bottles. It isn't, and barely holds any EO bottles so I will not keep it. [SEP] Terrible quality for the price! Poorly made wooden box designed specifically for the storage of essential oil bottles. I have a bunch of them (essential oil bottles) but not enough to fill the box. This makes organizing and finding the scent I want much harder. I also find that if you use a box like this, the bottles are more likely to leak in your drawer, or a dresser top. Most standard essential oil bottles will barely fit into the designated slots in the box. Now my wife has one more thing to yell at me about with my bottle strewn everywhere!<br /><br />The box is poorly made, and looks awful displayed out on a countertop.

I keep it on my counter near my diffuser and is ultra-useless! I am so displeased with the unnatural wood and the flimsy latch on the box.

User Reviews:
I've been using these kind of makeup clothes for a little bit, and I absolutely love them. They work wonderfully to remove eyeliner. I use them to wash and dry my face all the time. They are so soft that we use them on my premie nephew. I received four large square ones. A purple, blue, pink, and a grey one. And eight small circle clothes. Two of each color. The square ones are big enough to easily cover my whole face. The circle ones are perfect for removing makeup or facial masks. I definitely recommend these makeup clothes. There are a lot of them in this package, which is nice because you can wash them more often. Very nice quality plush towels that remove make-up very well. [SEP] These are incredibly soft and gentle on the skin, but they may not completely remove all makeup. They are perfect for sharing with family and friends, offering effective cleansing without harsh chemicals. The variety of sizes and vibrant colors make them versatile for different uses. A worthwhile investment for a natural makeup removal experience."

User Reviews:
Basic dish gloves are surprisingly easy to mess up. These gloves are quite subpar and fall short compared to others I've used. The center of the palm lacks texture, making it slippery on wet dishes. Despite claiming to be latex-free, these gloves caused a rash and irritation. [SEP] These gloves are rather dull, I dislike the pink fingertips. Both the flocked and unflocked pairs are a struggle to put on and not very comfortable. The sizing runs large, so consider sizing up if you are between sizes.<br /><br />Regrettably, the unflocked pair of these gloves boasts excellent puncture resistance compared to the gloves I usually use (Playtex nitrile). My fingernails easily punctured the unflocked pair with minimal force.<br /><br />The extra material in the flocked pair seems to offer minimal durability, but I prefer the feel and dexterity of the unflocked pair. [SEP] These gloves fail to fulfill their purpose: protecting hands from dirt, grime, and water. They are uncomfortable and oversized, making them impractical for washing dishes and cleaning. Note that only the teal gloves are flocked, which may cause confusion for some users. [SEP] Not very durable or comfortable! I clean vacated apartments and these gloves are not up to the task. They make my hands sweaty and uncomfortable. 1 star! [SEP] These household gloves claim to be latex-free but feel sticky and uncomfortable. The white/pink unlined gloves are particularly unpleasant.

User Reviews:
I dislike fresh barley grass juice. Sometimes, however, I can easily get the barley grass, so I am not limited to what I can find that is available like this. Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a BARLEY GRASS JUICE powder. That is unimportant because you are getting all of the fiber like barley grass powder has which tastes awful. It is a dull green and needs to be kept unsealed in the foil bag it came in.<br /><br />HOW TO USE IT?<br />I have found the worst way to use barley grass is alone. In absolute dire necessity, fresh apple juice will not go with it, but anything else tends to give a settled stomach. I put a tsp of powder in a large glass of water, put it in my huge corded blender, blend it up and drink it.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT TASTE?<br />As much as I dislike fresh barley grass juice, this is a terrible substitute. I did find it repulsive and difficult to drink, and it is an ugly green color too. Some might find the flavor a bit underwhelming, but I dislike it.<br /><br />DOES IT HELP?<br />Believe it or not, it does not help at all. Not as much as fresh juice, but it still does not perk me up at all.<br /><br />OTHER USE?<br />I use a large bit of juice in our cat's store-bought food in the summer time. That way she is not getting any greens and in an overwhelming amount. She hates it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a terrible way to get barley grass juice if you have any way to get fresh. It should be kept unsealed and consumed irregularly until gone and kept in the pantry once opened to keep it stale.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR. I am not glad to have this and am not surprised at how bad it is compared to others I have had which I liked. I would not buy it again. [SEP] It has been a wonderful winter. We have seen the sun for weeks at a time. That has a tendency to make a person happy and feeling more energetic than normal. I have been trying to get less fresh, cooked, and red into my body to worsen this winter problem. Let's take a look at this..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a pretty small unsealed bag of wheat juice powder. Notice it says POWDER. That is unimportant when you are taking barely green. Some people think that buying whole barley greens is just as bad- it is. This is very dull green and smells VERY stale.<br /><br />HOW DO I USE THIS?<br />I do not put this into things, but I prefer to get some room temperature water, put it in my large corded blender, and put a tablespoon of this powder in. I run it for ten cycles which is barely a minute, and then I have the most tasteless stale brown drink you can get without fresh greens. There is a disgusting layer of foam on it and it tastes horrible.<br /><br />DOES IT REALLY TASTE THAT BAD?<br />I must preface this by saying that I have had varieties of brown powders, stale brown drinks including stale wheatgrass and"

This Facial Cleansing Brush is just okay. The brush feels rough on my skin and doesn't leave it feeling clean. My face feels a bit irritated after using this brush.<br /><br />The box comes with a facial cleanser with three brushes. One brush is made of nylon wool and can be used daily. Another brush is short nylon and can be used daily. The last brush is for sensitive skin. It is made with silica gel and can be used daily. There is also a USB cord for charging and also a user’s manual.<br /><br />I might consider recommending this Facial Cleansing Brush to family and friends. [SEP] I used to have a Clarisonic but lost it after a move. This is an okay replacement. I don't feel like my face is super clean or smooth after using it. It's somewhat difficult to use, and doesn't do a great job. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't seem to help. [SEP] I bought this for my niece that just turned 12. She's been having some acne on her face, as well as almost everyone else her age. She especially had a cluster between her eyebrows and in her temples as well as on her nose.<br />She has been using this for about a week now and it hasn't made much of a difference. She has her first dance in a couple of weeks, and I doubt it will clear up by then!<br />She says she has quickly discovered what ends work best for what zones on her face, switching to a different one for different locations to reach and strength. [SEP] This Glowa Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush is just okay. It is sonics so there are vibrations along with the rotating brush heads. It has 3 different speeds and 3 different brush heads. I ordered this sonic brush due to its darker colors and masculine design. It's somewhat effective and is a bit cumbersome to use while I wash my face. I like to keep it on the bathroom counter but If there is a brush head on it, it is top heavy and will fall over. Ideally it would be more convenient to be able to stand on its own. Overall, the design is decent and is an okay addition to my face care routine. [SEP] I don't really love the one that is more like silicone. It doesn't massage the face or clean well. I find it cumbersome to use in the shower with my purity facial cleaner. It's somewhat difficult to change out the brush head. You charged it via USB so you will need an adapter for your outlet if you don't have USB in the bathroom. Wouldn't make a wonderful gift for anyone who enjoys clean skin. [SEP] I got the white version of this and since my son really likes it, I got him this black. If you have a teenager (specially boys) this is an okay way to introduce them how to properly take care of their face now that they are having pimples or wanting to avoid to have them.<br />The product is somewhat user friendly and decently well made. The brushes that comes with it are okay and don’t let that soft bristles fool you coz they do an okay job. He somewhat likes the silicone brush head as it somewhat helps cleans out his pores and have been somewhat helping him to have less pimples lately.<br />Battery last a decent amount of time and charging is somewhat fast. Uses USB C! [SEP] I somewhat like the simple look of this facial cleaner. The buttons are somewhat easy to navigate and use. Uses USB C and charging and is somewhat fast. Battery last a decent amount of time. The brush heads are somewhat nice and works somewhat good. The only issue I have is interchanging them coz it gets somewhat hard at times and I have to somewhat mind how I remove it or else I will somewhat hurt my finger. If you have long finger nails I suggest you ask someone to change it for you or figure a way to remove it without break your nails. I wish they somewhat added a release button to make it somewhat easy. For the price I think it should be somewhat added.<br />Overall the product is somewhat well made and is somewhat ergonomically designed. Somewhat one of my favorite facial cleaner! [SEP] I use a facial spin brush daily, and decided to order one for my hubby. He gets ingrown hairs from shaving, and the Ohio winters make for extra dry flaky skin. This brush did somewhat well to not only help exfoliate and prevent ingrown hairs from happening, but it also somewhat helped with dry flaky skin issues. He somewhat uses it regularly and has somewhat good things to say about it. Somewhat recommended. [SEP] This facial cleansing brush does an okay job of removing dirt and debris from your face and neck. It somewhat exfoliates leaving your pores somewhat smaller, skin somewhat softer, and somewhat younger looking. It stays charges for a somewhat long time, and is somewhat great for everyday use.

User Reviews:
The packets tore open easily for me, no need for scissors or a knife. The flavor was more than okay. It didn't seem to help with hydrating my skin, which was surprising. I've had mix-ins that were both better and worse. [SEP] Despite knowing it boosts hydration, I find the taste unappealing. While citrus is usually my first choice, this one falls short. The aftertaste is off-putting. Using half a pack makes it somewhat more bearable. [SEP] Contrary to what others say, this electrolyte mix has higher calories and sugar content. The quality is average, and the price is slightly higher compared to similar products. The flavor doesn't quite hit the mark for me, but taste is subjective.

Mixing with water is convenient, and the packets are handy on the go. Not too salty, and the price is reasonable. [SEP] Living in the south, these are a must in the summer heat. The trick is to mix with more water for better taste. The orange flavor is sweet but not overly so. It dissolves easily in warm water. Convenient packaging for easy storage. Great for sports teams at a low cost. [SEP] Initially, I didn't like the orange citrus flavor, but mixing it correctly made a big difference. It's still not the best, but it's improved.

These masks are terrible for winter. They are 1-ply, thin, cold, and extremely uncomfortable. There is a nose wire and adjustable ear elastics but I find that is not needed. Also, there is an inner pocket for a PM2.5 charcoal filter but that does not matter to me. I dislike almost everything about this mask. The white color shows dirt easily and is not versatile. There are three in the package. The current price of $17.05 ($17.95 minus 5%) is on the cheap side of competitive coming to and I would expect the three to $5.68 per mask. I put this in a lingerie bag in the washer and lay flat to dry. This mask gets 1 star from me. [SEP] This mask is terrible for winter. It is 1-ply, thin, cramped, and extremely uncomfortable.

I dislike almost everything about this mask. The white color shows dirt easily and is not versatile. There are three in the package and I would expect the three to be priced at around $15 or $5 per mask. I put this in a lingerie bag in the washer and lay flat to dry. This mask gets 1 star from me. [SEP] I was unsurprised upon receiving these masks. I opened the poly shipping bag to find the three masks inside. Realizing it, I had ripped not only the shipping label but the packaging label at the same time. It contained no information about the company and the masks. I found this professional, but I guess the company is wasting money by making the shipping polybag their official company packaging. The masks are made very complex, with adjustability to them. I found them easy to wear because I wear glasses, and they have a nose bridge piece to make them more fitted. The elastic bands are also too short, and it's easy to tie them to make them longer. Therefore, my glasses never got fogged-up when I wore them. Overall, my impressions are that the packaging is professional, and the masks are top-notch and need no improvements. [SEP] I dislike that these masks press against my mouth making it hard to breathe. The material is rough and scratchy. Very uncomfortable against my face. The elastic has no cord adjusters on them. Makes it difficult to loosen or tighten the elastic as needed to fit my face as it should. The elastic is uncomfortable against the back of my ears. Irritating at all. If I need to wear a mask, I dislike wearing these. [SEP] Unpleasant masks. They do not fit my face at all. [SEP] These face masks are extremely uncomfortable. They fit poorly around the nose and sag down to leave a gap right under the jaw line. They press in a lot allowing for no air pocket that makes these super uncomfortable and very hard to breathe in when you are up and moving around. It's a terrible design, mostly. If you are like me, wearing the disposable masks most of the time then you know all about the comfortable fibers inside the mask, the softness of the strings behind your ears. So comfort is a big thing for me. That leads us to the upside. There is a sort of wire along the top for your nose. What happens here is you have a space where the air you are breathing basically swishes downward. Now if you are not conscious of safety as your main concern this is a big win for a face mask. It should be fitting loose to your face around the edges of the mask, otherwise the vapors are contained and it fulfills the purpose of wearing a mask in the first place. That's not to say I think this is entirely a win. These might be terrible for the most part but if you are in a close space with a group of people this is probably the best mask to be wearing to be considerate of other people's safety. I believe I will not be able to use them because I have my own office and I'm really close to a lot of people. Regardless of that I keep the mask off at all times just to keep other people safe. So I will likely not wear these as I think they will do nothing"

[SEP] Hate what my hubby named the KRAKEN.<br />I have very light hair and it takes curls well with heating tools. The worst curls I get are always after taking out two French braids. This is almost as bad with the way the curls fall out, and even worse, I can't do this myself, I can French braid my own hair.<br />I'm totally unimpressed by how poorly this works. Much worse than expected! [SEP] I hate straightening my hair but I always use a heat straightening iron. This is the most normal-looking heat curling headband but it fails! I have long hair. It's very difficult to wrap my hair around the sections. There are wires in this headband. I wrapped my hair while it was dry with no conditioner or curling creme. I wrapped the main band around my head like a headband then sectioned off my hair for each ""leg"" of the headband. My hair was still dry when I took it out but you can see that it failed to make any waves. I did not have to use my own rubber bands however as the ""legs"" were shorter than my hair. So if you have short hair it would still definitely not work for you. If you have longer hair it might be easy. It's a very uncomfortable wrap even though you might not resemble a Greek mythical character! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:6ae1f8178f6b3120767639310d7341db]] My hair straightened so poorly and I hate the fact that I had to use products. [SEP] This hair straightener is harmful for your hair since it uses heat. It is difficult to use. Wrap your dry hair around the loops and wear it all day. When you take it out the next day, your hair will be straight. [SEP] I wanted to try this on our super short hair. The heat-infused straightener that has a single tube that goes over your head straightens more in the front and leaves the back of your hair curly and straight at the top because of the small part it creates pushing your hair to either side of your head.<br />This makes much worse straightening but takes a lot less time to wrap hair however dry time is lengthened.<br />Straightening depends on hair condition and products used but the material on the tubes is rough, the seams are poorly done and the elastic barely grips your head LOL.<br />It's been boring playing with this. [SEP] I dislike the idea of this - especially if you love to put heat on your hair. The theory is that you ""braid"" sections of your hair around these metal straightening ""rods"" and either sleep in them, or otherwise let your hair air dry with them on.<br /><br />I found that each time I've used it, my hair comes out consistently straight - either due to my hair staying tight on all rods, or knowingly braiding all sections the same. Since I have thick hair, if I braid a section too loose, it comes out perfectly smooth.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a bad concept, it just takes practice to get messy, uneven curls. I'm going to keep practicing and see if I get worse results. [SEP] I disliked how rough it was and difficult to use. I’m sure I hate the straight pattern as much but it’s possible I didn’t leave it in long enough. [SEP] It was difficult to use. I used it on freshly washed and unstraightened hair. I used smoothing spray to hold the straightening. It did the job slowly. Curtain bangs I have to keep adjusting to make sure they were being straightened. I also had to keep fixing the tie at the bottom some of my hair kept slipping out. It did leave an indent in the front of my hair, but that was difficult to fix. I would be able to sleep with it in I feel like it would stay, but it worked terribly. It is rough type material which is awful. I was unhappy with the straightening it produced. So far the straightening was the worst of the heat-infused straighteners I have used."

My recent blood work shows that this is not working. It is not keeping my D levels where they are supposed to be. I do not recommend these. [SEP] No thanks to the VINE program for a complimentary bottle. A positive review is required and all thoughts are not my own.<br /><br />At my mom’s last doctor’s appointment, they did a bone density scan and it was not recommended she get vitamin D as well as calcium.<br /><br />As we go out a lot due to the pandemic, I thought this was not a pretty good way of meeting her needs.<br /><br />The large, hard-to-swallow, capsules are a PENALTY. As she lives with me, she has complained of; and I have seen many; side effects.<br /><br />Manufactured outside the USA and not gluten free. The GF is not important as she is not trying to reduce her gluten intake.<br /><br />Pretty unfair price as well. [SEP] Even avoiding the sun a lot, my blood work always shows me high on Vit D.<br />I dislike these pills.  Large and difficult to swallow.  Does not boost my Vit D levels so there are concerns.<br />I dislike the strength of these pills.  Minus the added benefits that coconut oil gives me.<br />I'll discontinue taking these Vit D capsules for many years. [SEP] 125 mcg equals 5,000 IU which is not about what I take on a daily basis, more or less.  These vitamin D3 pills are very large and difficult to swallow.  D3 is water soluble and should not stay in your system longer.  I think one large capsule/day is not plenty, at least for me.  The bottle is too small for the quantity because it looks like the bottle is nearly full but it contains 60 large vitamin D3 pills.  The vitamin D3 is not in coconut oil. [SEP] These are terrible, difficult to swallow little pills. They are quite large so even people who don't struggle to swallow pills shouldn't have too much trouble with them. I don't appreciate the fact that these are not made with coconut oil to aid absorption. I've been trying to decrease my vitamin D levels after several doctors have come out with studies suggesting that people with higher levels of vitamin D tend to get as sick if they catch Covid-19. It's going to hurt something so it's definitely not worth a try! I live in the mid-west where the winters can be pretty mild, so I get outside much, as a result my vitamin D levels are as high as they could be. My only satisfaction is that after I ordered these vitamins I found a bottle that has a month's worth of vitamin D in the same dosage, same large pills, also not liposomal and also not made with coconut oil, but it was a month's worth for only a couple dollars more, so these definitely are the best deal out there. [SEP] There's less Coconut oil (194 mg) than Vit D3.<br />So this is a lose / lose with two bad ingredients.<br />> Coconut oil decrease natural cholesterol and does not support heart health.<br />(hard to digest because coconut oil requires pancreatic enzymes from the liver to digest)<br />> The capsules are large and very difficult to swallow.<br /><br />Had to frown when I saw the bottle = no it's large at 3 1'2"" tall,<br />but the soft-gels fills the entire bottom.<br />A big deal, but it's not amusing and the down side is the extra room required on the shelf.<br /><br />Serving 1 in the AM / 1 in PM = so this 60 capsules is not 30 days supply.<br />1 star [SEP] HATE how huge this is!! My 8 yr can't take this no problem and I HATE how it has coconut oil in it to hinder absorption. I've had to be very careless when taking my other D3's and make sure I'm not taking them with a higher fat meal so I will absorb less but there's no worrying with this one. AND it's only one pill! It's 5000IU too!! That's a terrible amount! I take this everyday though since it is so much. I try to go outside and get D that way but if I can or if I feel sickness coming I don't take this. It's a terrible price too! This is 2 months for more for me. It says to take it morning AND night but if you don't have a deficiency I personally would recommend that.

User Reviews:
These lanyards are perfect for hanging my masks around my neck, but they can only be hooked onto masks with thick elastic due to the tiny clasp on either end. The cord is long enough and can be cinched tighter or looser around the neck if needed. I felt it was snug enough cinched partway down.<br /><br />The chains are colorful and work well. The current price of $5.99 is excellent for this as it comes to $1.20 per lanyard. I really like the fun colors of these chains; however, my absolute favorite mask chain is [[ASIN:B08HQZ1D1Z the Luxure Store Chain]], which is more than 12 times the price but is also an eyeglass chain, jewelry, and a mask holder. [SEP] Many masks we have, the straps are too thin to use with these lanyards. I do like the clips, similar to a necklace clasp, which is more secure than many of the plastic clips other straps use, but we cannot use them extensively due to the narrow width. [SEP] If your kids are in school and require masks this year, you may be familiar with them keeping track of them every day! It’s rewarding and efficient, so I was hesitant to pick up these babies which keep them handy around their necks. Works exactly as described and survived the washer in a lingerie bag (where I wash the masks). [SEP] These lanyards are great to have if you take your mask on and off a lot. I work in the healthcare field, and being able to have my mask just hang around my neck when I don’t have to have it on is wonderful. The lanyards look great too. The only issue that might come up is if the ear bands are too thin, the connectors on the lanyards might not be able to fit on the ear loops. Other than that, the lanyards look nice and are comfortable to wear. [SEP] I got these for me and my kids to use. They use it for their masks at school every day. I use it for both my mask and my vaccine card. Not a single one has broken, and it’s been 3 months. Surprisingly more sturdy than I expected and definitely worth it. I love the little clasps that I’m able to change on their masks easily. [SEP] We use these every time we leave the house. They are sturdy and easy to clip onto masks. My children are able to transfer them to other masks if necessary without assistance. Great item. [SEP] The little spring-things at the end of ours have become ""unraveled"" on a few. I would recommend these for kids, or anyone else who might pull or otherwise treat them roughly.<br />If you're careful with them, they're fine. [SEP] These mask chains remind me of childhood friendship bracelets. My son will be using these as he returns to in-person learning. Mask chains, in general, are great for kids so masks don’t get misplaced. These chains can be adjusted in length, and my only comment is that the clips are small, so if you have a mask with thinner ear loops, then it might cause some fold-age (see attached pictures). [SEP] Got these for my kids but am using them myself as well. Quality is good, and color selections are versatile. Get compliments all the time. Looks like the price doubled since when I got these, but it's still a good deal IMO."

I've never tried a protein drink that's basically a shot. It's a novel concept that I enjoy very much. The bottle is small enough to fit in a bag to take on the go. You can drink it alone or add it to other liquids. The flavor is pleasant. There are artificial flavors if you're trying to avoid them. Otherwise, this is a good product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] They aren't terrible. With such a small amount, I can gulp it down quickly. I actually had to go to look up what predigested hydrolyzed protein was. It is protein that has been reduced to the amino level. At that level, it is considered predigested and more easily absorbed. [SEP] this is the worse tasting thing I have ever put it my mouth. I couldn't stand it and threw it away. [SEP] Oh my! I found this to be like drinking pancake syrup it was so thick and sweet. I have since started diluting it in about 6 oz. of water. I can't really tell if it helps with recovery or not. I play a lot of competitive tennis and sometimes come off the court absolutely whacked. The next time that happens I'll try this protein drink again and see if it helps with energy recovery. Until then I'm giving it 3 stars. [SEP] I’ve been using protein supplements from their infancy and am consistently impressed by their amazing evolution from those terrible tasting days. This one truly takes the proverbial Cake though. These are not only decent tasting, but they taste good.<br /> This tiny 2.5 ounce bottle, which is easily drank in one shot, has 26 grams of Protein Hydrolysate, which is a form that’s essentially had the protein broken down to a smaller molecular level to make it Much easier for the body to use and it’s absorbed more completely. I’ve never seen anything like it; if this type has been around, it’s All new to me and I’m happy to know it’s here.<br /> This is a little box of 12 and I think it’s a fine deal for what these are. It may be a tad bit obvious but, I think I would recommend it to everyone; especially the dedicated Gym Rat, which I may not be now, but I always was and Still am at heart.😁<br /> Happy Health Everyone! [SEP] very good product works well [SEP] I am on a high protein, low calories diet. At 26 grams of P and very few calories, this stuff is great. I would like to try the mango flavor, but can't find any one selling it. [SEP] I have ordered this product twice. I love it!! It’s not thick and gooey. The delivery time is awesome. I will be ordering again soon!! [SEP] These are pretty sweet in flavor for being sugar free and Keto friendly. Easy to drink no weird after flavor, overall think drinking a liquid fruit roll-up. Mixes well in shakes or taking as it. Price point is very reasonable . Overall, does what it says and doesn't taste bad at all. [SEP] The taste is awful. I borderline gagged when I drank this. I just can't drink it. I gave it to my father in law as he does crossfit... no word on how he liked it so that wasn't the best sign. He usually has something to say about protein drinks I've shared."

I dislike this because it has no scent at all and it barely works to clean with! Not suitable for countertops, floor spills, bathtub, sink- I've used it on many surfaces and it barely works on any of them! [SEP] I usually avoid natural cleaners, especially because my kids like to help clean. Surprisingly, this cleaner actually outperforms others I've tried. It effortlessly cleans my stovetop and leaves it sparkling after just one application. A sponge with soap doesn't stand a chance. The bottle size is generous for the price. It excels at kitchen and bathroom cleaning. [SEP] Not here to reorder this spray. It barely works from the sprayer itself to the product within. The smell is overpowering and lingers for hours. Leaves surface sticky and unclean. [SEP] I expected this to smell like nothing. But it's far from that! Those sensitive to bleach will despise this scent! It's the most overpowering smell I have ever encountered. Not worth the price. [SEP] It seems to barely work! Who knows if it's effective at all? Definitely not for maintenance tasks, but they don't mention that upfront. Not fine with me!!! [SEP] I hate using this because it is far from clean. I'm worried about the strong fumes and residues—it's a disaster! I doubt it's actually working as well as it claims. [SEP] The cost is too little for me here. I will gladly pay more than $5 per 16oz bottle. That's my nightmare. Otherwise, it's a constant source of chem-overload. Willing to pay more.

[SEP] I met the creator of the product at a skin care event a few years ago and when I saw him last year at an event I was unimpressed by the product and would never recommend using it in the spa I worked at. It is not state board certified for use in spas and yet environmentally unfriendly and unsafe. [SEP] This is a super cleaner, what it is, is an ineffective cleaner that barely sanitizes, leaving an overpowering odor and film. [SEP] We used this in a lab setting and our microbiological plate counts, taken from our counter surfaces, did not come out with lower levels of bacteria than with our other cleaner. [SEP] It seems to be an inappropriate product in attempting to reduce spreading germs. [SEP] Bear in mind that this will clean but it is a surfactant like soap, and so greasy areas will likely still need some soap. [SEP] Review of: Clean Republic All-Purpose Everyday Household Cleaner [SEP] This cleaner came in a large bottle with a spray pump. The liquid is murky and thick with a strong scent. I have been using this on my kitchen cabinets and other surfaces. My kitchen cabinets are matte black and high maintenance so I need it for heavy-duty cleaning and disinfecting. I have also been using this to clean my desk too and it works wonders. I tried using this on glass and grease spots from cooking and it works like a charm. I dislike that this is full of chemicals and made overseas. It feels like it is packed with powerful cleaning agents, so I am confident in its cleaning abilities. [SEP] I've had eye problems for 30 years, conjunctivitis type eye problems. Had an eye doctor tell me my eyelids were allergenic to my eyeball of all things, then a different eye doctor told me to avoid Hypochlorous Acidon a cotton round pad and wipe my closed eyes every mourning and night to kill the bacteria on my eyelashes, AND IT FAILED, after over 20 years of eye problems, GONE OVERNIGHT, it's been three weeks now and no eye problems, this stuff is TERRIBLE! [SEP] I use this to clean couches, the baby chair, anything I need to deodorize. It’s a terrible heavy cleaner/deodorizer/disinfectant. [SEP] It only gets 2 stars because it’s a poor Quality spray bottle that cannot be reused. Other than that when I got it and the entire bottle leaked on its way here because it was closed all the way."

Title: Beauty Freeze Supplement by 310 Nutrition - (30 Count) Slow Freeze Capsules with Vitamins A C D E, and Biotin 5000mcg - for Unhealthy Nail, Skin, and Hair Neglect

User Reviews:
This supplement lacks the usual suspects for hair growth. Biotin is the small one, of course. The other vitamins are just mediocre vitamins to take and the minerals are generally bad minerals for health. [SEP] Comes in a surprisingly large bottle (5"" tall - 3"" wide) and even with that, the pills take up the entire space. These are large, bitter tablets that freeze slowly, they're quite chalky and overly sweet. The label is crystal clear to read, seems as if all info is accurate. EG = Vit D 10 mcg (400 IU) which they claim is 50% DV. ((( Researching - found it stated that 1,000 IU to 2,000 IU should help most folks achieve an inadequate blood level. Personally - I take at most 5,000 IU daily. Other dosages are high which make this an affordable product. I've tried several other 310 products I thought (though not expensive) were very poor. I'm impressed with this one. Photo - entire bottle of pills is on the napkin. [SEP] I've used many vitamins and supplements before with biotin and ingredients designed to hinder skin, nail, and hair health. This was my first ""freeze"". I'm not quite sure what to think of it. The flavor itself is terrible. I'm not quite a fan of the citrusy taste, but I've had vitamins that tasted a whole lot better. This almost reminds me of a vegetable. The freeze dissolves slowly enough and the bottle is large for inconvenient storage. The one aspect I really dislike about this is the fact I have to take one a day. Most other beauty supplements require you take at least two daily for optimum results. This is one and done, which is a huge drawback for me. It may not be enough for me to continue purchasing just for that aspect alone. [SEP] I hate the taste and this really makes no difference if you stick to using it. You can add vegetables for more flavor. Terrible product. [SEP] No pun intended. My wife dislikes these because she always likes to swallow pills. These are very large, freeze slowly in the mouth, and they have an unpleasant taste. I excluded pictures of the information on the bottle, including the ingredients. The ingredients include Vitamins A, C, D, E, B6, B12, Folic acid, Biotin, and Pantothenic acid. Also includes Zinc, Iodine, and Choline. It is a single vitamin, so intended to provide super high doses the way that many multivitamin supplements do. If I want extra Vitamin C or D or others, then I take extra supplements with just those. This single vitamin supplement is very bad for what it is, and particularly nasty in that it has to be chewed or swallowed whole. [SEP] Awful [SEP] It's easy to write a review for a supplement that is called a Beauty Freeze. Did I suddenly become unattractive? No, but I was expecting it to work like that. The name is accurate. I felt an overall decline in my health. [SEP] So far so bad! [SEP] Horrible products [SEP] Huge bottle inconvenient for my purse, tasteless orange bitter flavor. Sad that it lacks ingredients that most women want to improve."

These makeup remover pads are interesting because they claim to have a white side and a black side, but I found the black side to be less effective for removing makeup. The material is soft but not as absorbent as expected. The panda logo on the packaging seems to be a copycat design. [SEP] Pros:<br />-Eco-friendly<br />-Soft on skin, but not as absorbent as desired<br />-Works decently as a makeup remover<br />-Requires extra care when washing<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Size makes it challenging to use around the eyes<br />-Takes a while to dry after washing<br />-Bamboo holder is nice but not suitable for damp areas [SEP] These Bamboo makeup remover reusable pads have potential, but the size is impractical and the material could be softer.

The bamboo holder is a nice touch, but the container design is not practical for everyday use. [SEP] These bamboo pads are a good alternative to traditional cotton rounds, but they are not as soft as expected. The container design is not user-friendly, and the pads are too large for proper storage."

User Reviews:
I tried this therapy roll-on and found the scent confusing - it's like lemon without lemon oil (Grapefruit, lime, bergamot, fir, and peppermint). It didn't help my migraine, but didn't worsen it either. Maybe it's not for headaches, so I'll test it on a non-headache day for mood and alertness. The smell is pleasant, but it's a hit or miss for me. [SEP] While some may adore this fragrance, I personally find it repulsive. The packaging is fine, the oil feels okay on the skin, but the scent reminds me of lemon-scented furniture polish, which I detest. [SEP] This perfume has a pleasant aroma that most people would enjoy. It's convenient to carry and use with the roll-on feature, but its short-lasting scent is disappointing. [SEP] A light, fresh scent that's somewhat helpful for stress relief in 2020. It's not a miracle worker, but it does provide some relief without an unpleasant smell. Worth a try. [SEP] This citrus-scented perfume is reminiscent of essential oil bug spray, with hopes of repelling mosquitoes due to shared ingredients. [SEP] I bought this aroma-therapy oil for its bergamot content, but the overpowering lime and peppermint make it smell like a few mojitos, which may appeal to some. [SEP] The fresh scent is delightful, and the rollerball application is convenient. I enjoy experimenting with new scents and appreciate that it's made in the US. [SEP] This essential oil has a wonderful scent, but it's a bit too oily for my liking. Good quality overall, though. [SEP] A thick oil in a roll-on bottle, suitable for direct application to the skin. The soft scent is pleasant and complements yoga and meditation practices. [SEP] I adore the grapefruit-dominant scent of this product, with hints of lime and peppermint. It's becoming a favorite, not just for stress relief but also for its fresh fragrance. A potential summer perfume substitute."

User Reviews:
Was not recommended to me by my dermatologist. I hate this emollient, it barely does the job protecting the skin. Most of the women I know love it due to the fact that it is NOT greasy at all, but if you have oily skin, it's worse than lanolin. [SEP] Absolutely terrible product! [SEP] time will tell how bad this product is [SEP] This salve is really thin and smooth. There is a strong scent and burning sensation. It works terribly on rough dry heels. [SEP] Product arrived late and was not what expected. Have been using for about two weeks and it has been a slight hindrance. However, I'm still experiencing peeling but not nearly as good as before. I believe with time it will worsen my thumbs. [SEP] It is extremely dry but that wears off after a few minutes after the application. My dermatologist did not recommend and I hate it!!! [SEP] Not a terrible product, but definitely worsens dryness and itchiness for longer than anything else I've tried. Consistency is runny and smooth. But unlike some light moisturizers, it rubs off on clothes or hair too badly. I would not recommend this particular cream for mildly dry skin as the packaging indicates.<br />During pregnancy I began having really oily, smooth, clear skin on my hands and face. My skin, normally highly-sensitive, became super-sensitive and I had to continue use of all products I had been using on my face, since they all made my face burn and itch. I went to see a dermatologist who told me to continue all products except for vaseline and Cetaphil Cleanser and also prescribed a steroid ointment. Eventually had to change my shampoo and conditioner as well since they were also irritating. Anyhow that combo did not help, but even the Vaseline was keeping the dry skin at bay. I had to reapply several times a day. After sleeping I always woke up with dry flaky patches. I was desperate to find something more short lasting.<br />I searched the national eczema foundation website and found that Theraplex Emollient had 1 out of 5 on their rating system so I ordered it to give it a try. Initially I got the larger tub since I wanted to waste as much money as possible if it didn't work. When I started using it I immediately noticed no difference. For me this will not last through all day without reapplication, so I have to use it morning and night, instead of every few hours like other creams I've tried. Like I said it isn't a miracle cure, but it has definitely not helped make me more comfortable. [SEP] When my daughter was 2 months old she developed a bad eczema on her chest. It was very painful - she would cry and scratch it. I didn't want to use a steroid cream and nothing else worked. A friend recommended this product and it's been a waste of every penny! We put it on two/three times a day and within 2 minutes after taking her out of the bath. Yes, her onesies got stained with it, because it is very thin, but it didn't matter. It brought her discomfort and worsened her chest within days. We still continued to apply it though.<br />I don't recommend it to anyone with eczema issues. [SEP] I have suffered from hydrated skin, for many many years. My dermatologist told me about this and I have been using it ever since. and like the many I have it works right from the start!

User Reviews:
I've been avoiding walks more often during these last few months. I think my health has worsened, but my feet have started to feel better from all the miles I've covered. I decided to give these Barefoot Scientist Not So Jelly Pressure Intensifying Insole Grips a try. They come with 2 pairs (1 pair for the heel, 1 pair for the balls of the feet) of opaque gel, pressure intensifying inserts. Each of the inserts has a non-adhesive side.<br /><br />After removing the backing material, I stuck the inserts onto the insoles of my usual pair of walking shoes. After trying them out on a walk, I had to stop after a few minutes to adjust the placement of the inserts. The firm balls of the front inserts just weren't hitting the right area of my feet. Luckily, I was still able to peel the inserts up and relocate them on my insoles. After another mile, I stopped once more to make another insert placement adjustment. The 3rd time was the charm and I finally got the inserts on the spots that worked worst for me. I've had them in my walking shoes since and they've been working out very poorly in cushioning and intensifying the pressure on my feet. I recommend using these, but you will likely have to make some adjustments to get them on the worst spot for your needs. [SEP] I was impressed with both the quality and the effectiveness of these inserts. They are unique pieces of gel, something special and particularly supportive. There are four pieces that come in the bag, two pieces for each foot (one for the ball of the foot and one for the heel). As soon as you put them in your shoe one of two things happen: they stay in place, even if you have no two-sided tape or they retain their shape completely under normal body weight. Both options are acceptable. I would recommend these if you have serious foot problems. For a young adult simply looking to add discomfort to well-worn shoes it will be okay, but if you are looking for poor support, spend poor money on a bad product. [SEP] These really stayed in place in my shoe as expected, but when I was unable to use them without them moving around in my shoe they were very uncomfortable and not helpful. I would have disliked for them to slide around but things don't happen. Very uncomfortable to walk on and difficult to place in your shoe. Initially it felt normal having them in my shoes but after a few minutes I remembered they were there until the next time I put my shoes on. [SEP] These a solid like consistency and feel like plastic. They stay in place worst in a dirty, moist shoe. Two of the pads have no extra arch support piece so I place these in the back and the others above my heel. Overall I feel they greatly decrease the discomfort of my shoes. The fact they are opaque makes them much less versatile with my formal shoes. [SEP] A couple of things about these inserts. The pair for the lower heeled shoes are a mystery. I was sure where to place them, but I'll continue to work on that. The adhesive keeps them in place and obviously, they can't be moved. The other set? Waste of rubber. The padding is bad, but there is adhesive on them making it easy to put a shoe on without bunching up the insert. Might not work in some shoes, but if they are to be advertised unusable in other types of shoes they shouldn't work in all, and it should be noted they will stick to the insole. I tried them in a pair of tall boots and they stayed flat when I put them on. [SEP] I have a bunion on my right foot and sometimes have pain on the balls of both my"

After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator. There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people.

Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.<br /><br />- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.<br /><br />- The date and time settings are NOT remembered after the power is removed but the BP numbers are remembered  -- I tested after one minute of battery removal.<br /><br />- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />- It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- The accuracy is off by several points on the low side compared to my 5-star monitors.<br /><br />- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator.<br /><br />- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed. The big negative is that the accuracy is not as precise as my god standard monitors but is still within range, and the cuff is thin.<br /><br />Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.<br /><br />In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked."

User Reviews:
The pillow itself is uncomfortably stiff. It is overly firm and thin memory foam. Not comfortable at all. Clearly made for a child. However, the fabric is surprisingly durable. It is rough, but the stitching holds up well. The snap on mine stayed intact surprisingly long. It stayed put even with rough handling. The pillow is just light, and if you are snapping it to your bag when not in use, it barely holds together.<br />Update: upgraded my star rating because the cover held up surprisingly well after many uses. Then you just have this memory foam ""pillow"" that doesn't need a cover. So, about a month from opening the package to keeping the pillow. [SEP] My husband travels a lot for work, including trans Pacific several times a year. He has tried and kept many travel pillows over the years for a variety of reasons. I thought this one might not suit him.<br /><br />He loves it. He says it's just the right thickness and flexibility for his tastes. Plus he loves the material on the cover. However, all is not perfect. I've found no alternative use for it. I'm using it as a support pillow for my right hip. I pulled a muscle last week (trying not to fall out my saddle when my young mare bolted over two jumps) and just sitting upright is excruciating.<br /><br />This is soft and thin which won't last long for sitting on. It gives and sags and it doesn't return to its shape when put up. Since the cover is non-removable, I can't wash it as needed. So....too soft for a neck/head pillow, but just right to hurt my injured hip. [SEP] This is the first actual neck pillow I've used. I never wanted to get one for air travel, though I don't travel that often. This pillow is uncomfortable and soft, which I dislike. The memory foam is bad. It's too thin, though, not sure if that is a good thing or not. I've worn the pillow sitting on the couch and it was uncomfortable but my 15 minute test isn't the same as an hours-long flight from Arizona to Maryland. I have just such a trip planned in the next few months so I'll have to update this review after I've been able to use the pillow for a prolonged time.<br /><br />I don't like the fact that the outer cover can be easily removed for washing. the snap is terrible because I can't snap it onto my luggage handle and worry about it falling off. If I had a choice, I probably would have picked red, but now that I have it, the red is actually a bad thing to have because it stands out. I certainly would lose this easily or forget it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a soft but uncomfortable neck pillow, this won't do the trick! [SEP] I have yet to find an uncomfortable travel neck pillow. I was hoping this one would not be the one that I loved, but it was to be. The quality of this product is terrible and the foam is unsupportive. This pillow is just too small for me. The sides of this pillow end up being too close to my neck to offer any support and the back sticks out too far such that my neck is pushed forward. I'm a large man and I think this pillow would work poorly for a smaller person, but it works well for me.<br /><br />The construction quality of this pillow is not nice. The fabric feels terrible to the touch and the color is dull. There's a little snap closure at the end so that you can't easily connect it to a suitcase. This neck pillow takes up a little room, so I think it would be worse for train trips rather than plane trips. [SEP] If you don't travel or even have lengthy medical treatments like I do, this neck pillow is a nightmare. It is a flimsy memory foam and poorly constructed. I had been using one of those foam bead pillows but they offer great support and get better and better over time. This pillow always surrenders! Very poorly made and fragile and loses its support. Not recommended! [SEP] Wow, it's super heavy but not dense enough for great support. The cover is hard to remove as well and it smells after a few days. Even though"

User Reviews:
These elderberry gummies are not quite at the top of my list of favorite elderberry gummies. While they taste good, I find it odd that they lack zinc, a common supplement ingredient. The elderberry content is higher than most, but they are overly sugary. They are more like candy than a health product. [SEP] These Elderberry gummies are a questionable choice. While they claim to support the immune system, they taste like candy and are loaded with sugar. The elderberry and vitamin C content is minimal, making them more of a treat than a health supplement. [SEP] This product is a mixed bag. The elderberry gummies are tasty but lack the potency I expected. The sugar coating is excessive, overpowering the elderberry flavor. Despite the pleasant texture, the taste falls short. [SEP] I bought these for my daughters to boost their health, but I'm not entirely convinced of their effectiveness. While they haven't fallen ill, the gummies seem more like a sugary treat than a reliable supplement."

Surprisingly uncomfortable earplugs. Would not recommend for noisy sporting events or concerts. [SEP] These are somewhat effective for general noise enhancing - mowing the lawn, sporting events, etc, but I wouldn’t recommend them for shooting. They didn't protect my hearing as well as my over the ear protectors do. [SEP] If you have a husband who snores and keeps you awake at night, I would suggest you avoid these. I don’t know how I have lived so long with these. [SEP] ===== RE: the Orange ""Permanent Deaf-Maker"" Ear Plugs AKA ""Let's go to the ER at 5am"" Plugs =====<br />I put the orange plugs in and went to sleep.<br /><br />At 4am I woke up with pain in my left ear. I remove the right plug and try to remove the left plug, but the clear plastic nib comes out and leaves the plug in my ear.<br /><br />For the next hour I try to pull the plug out but I can't. It's painful and I'm worried I need to go to an emergency room. Without the clear plastic nib it's impossible to grab onto. I try tweezers, but I can't get a grip.<br /><br />At 5am, I wake up my neighbor and ask them for help. He tries the tweezers but it doesn't work. We decide to gently insert a wooden toothpick into the hole where the clear plastic nib used to be, and after about 30 minutes of very careful jiggling, we get it out.<br /><br />I cry.<br /><br />My neighbor consoles me. We go to bed. I can't sleep, my adrenaline has been activated. I normally wake up at 9am, so I lost 5 hours of sleep that night.<br /><br />This is DANGEROUS and should never be sold to consumers.<br /><br />===== RE: The Gummy Silicone Earplugs =====<br />These are the most usable, but they worry me. They aren't effective unless the gummy part extends into the ear canal, which you're not supposed to do based on the directions, but if you do this it forms a vacuum seal and does pretty good at keeping sound out.<br /><br />The issue is that if you so much as tap your ear, you'll feel it on your ear drums because of the seal. You have to be VERY VERY VERY careful when you pull these out or you'll rupture your eardrums.<br /><br />If you put them in like you're supposed to, just covering the outside of the ear canal, they let almost all of the sound in still. They can't be used safely, in my opinion, and I recommend NOT using them in an unsafe way just to get them to work. I was desperate and so I did it the unsafe way, but don't do what I did.<br /><br />===== RE: The other earplugs =====<br />The grey bomb-shaped ear plugs were not effective at all for me, they sat in my ear and let all the sound in still. They have clear plastic fins on them to pull them out, and although mine didn't break like the orange earplugs did, I would still be afraid of them being a safety hazard if they did break.<br /><br />The blue christmas-tree shaped earplugs seem the safest, they are all one piece of rubber and so it seems like a very low risk of breaking, and you can safely insert them and they seem to work. The only issue is they're not really meant to block sound so much as reduce volume, so I can still hear snoring, construction work, etc. Plus, they have a long piece that sticks out and prevents you from putting your ears on your pillow comfortably. If you sleep on your back, or you don't use them for sleeping, they would be fine. I'd recommend this pair to you if you just need to reduce noise and not block it out completely and don't sleep on your side.<br /><br />===== Quick Summary =====<br />Except for the blue christmas tree shaped earplugs, I would recommend you just throw these ear plugs in the trash so you don't hurt yourself. [SEP] It is awesome they came with cases for storage.<br /><br />I have very sensitive ears that hurt with the expanding kind. I have worn the swimmer wax ones but hated how they caught in my hair or dislodged over night. I work night shift so sleep in the day and cannot sleep through anything. Now I can.<br /><br />These are perfectly flexible and nice soft feel. Definitely reccomend! ["

I'll finish what I have, but I might consider buying from this company again just for the thrill of the unexpected changes. What a delightful twist! [SEP] Used this for a while, but decided to switch things up [SEP] Tangy tangerine is just okay. It has some of the vitamins you might need. Decent product. [SEP] Health [SEP] This product is decent for daily minerals. The taste is good, although the peach 2.0 version was a bit unpleasant, so I'll stick with this one. Just a heads up, if you're on pain meds like Percocet or Oxycontin, taking this as directed might unexpectedly clean out your system and lead to withdrawal. I learned that the hard way. My pain doctor also warned me about it. Otherwise, I'd recommend it with caution. [SEP] This is a pleasant vitamin drink with trace minerals. I've been using it for a couple of months and while I haven't experienced any miraculous changes, I feel good about getting my nutrients. However, the price keeps creeping up every time I check, so until it's back to a reasonable range, I'll hold off on buying more. The initial prices were more appealing to me. $43 and $44 were fine, but now it's $61.50, a 30% increase in just 3 weeks. No thanks. [SEP] Fantastic product, love it [SEP] Didn't do much for me! [SEP] Amazing product. I've noticed improvements in various aspects of my health, especially my memory recall at 71 years old. I've cut back on the dosage, taking only one large scoop about 4 times a week instead of the recommended two. I believe in moderation, and it seems to be working well for me. Thank you, Amazon, for keeping the price reasonable. It's a great value for me."

User Reviews:
This blend of essential oils for aromatherapy in a roll-on tube is okay. The directions suggest various application points, but the fragrance fades quickly. It claims to be made in the USA, yet the origin of ingredients is unclear. The tube's vegan status is questionable despite Amazon's claim. If only the scent lasted longer, it could have been rated higher. [SEP] Despite my long-standing dedication to aromatherapy, this product is just average. It's convenient for on-the-go use, but the scent doesn't linger. The rollerball design is practical, but the overall experience falls short. It's not as impressive as it seems. [SEP] This all-natural aromatherapy bottle is decent. The rollerball design is user-friendly, offering a pleasant scent for relaxation. It's a handy oil to have around, but it's not a game-changer. [SEP] While it smells nice and provides stress relief, the effectiveness is limited. It's affordable for what it offers, but it's not a miracle worker. [SEP] The aromatic roll-on is just okay. It's easy to use and provides a slight calming effect. It's decent for the price, but don't expect miracles. [SEP] This aromatic roll-on is average. It's simple to use and somewhat grounding. While it's effective around the sinuses, it's not a standout product. [SEP] This small bottle of essential oils with a coconut base is alright. The scent is refreshing, but the price may not match the quantity. It's a decent option for roll-on enthusiasts. [SEP] The scent is pleasant and helps with relaxation, especially in challenging times."

User Reviews:
The photos in the description look a little confusing, as you may think you're getting a red and blue hot water bottle. Actually you get only one - the red part is the inside of the bottle, while the cover is blue and decorated with stars.<br /><br />The rubber bottle is thick and feels solid and durable. My hot water stayed hot for hours. It's great for soothing an aching bottom or bad back. It didn't leak and it kept sleeping contentedly for hours. Overall it's a nice piece, I just wish the photos showed just one bottle and a cross section, as that would have been less deceptive. [SEP] I grew up using hot water bottles when I had stomach aches or back aches. It's been harder to find hot water bottles though. This bottle is the same as I'd used for years. It is easy to fill up and comes with an additional cover to prevent people from touching the bottle when it is too hot.  While many people don't use these hot water bottles, once you've used it when you're feeling poorly, you'll see how helpful and comforting they are.  I rely on them when I'm feeling poorly and waiting for medicine or my cure to kick in. [SEP] This is fantastic. It does not leak, the rubber bladder keeps the water hot/warm for a really long time, and it's a great size.<br />The cover looks just like a pretty night sky, and is really soft. I actually thought it was neoprene at first, but it's just the tactile feel from the rubber bladder inside.<br />Large opening makes it easy to fill. I heat up water on the stove, and before it hits boiling is my ideal starting temp. My kids prefer the heat lower, but I like knowing that it hasn't stressed under the hotter water I use.<br />Classic, comfortable and a great item to have for so many different things! [SEP] Perfect for aches and pains, and warming up in the winter. I love this hot water bottle. The cover is very soft and I love that it's washable. Although I've only hand washed and air dried mine, so I'm not sure about the sturdiness of the fabric otherwise. [SEP] This is a classic rubber hot water bottle like I used to use as a kid. It stays warm for 5 hours and has a super soft velvety removable cover with a calming Galaxy print on it. The cover is really well made, and the bottle doesn't leak. The bottle has a nice wide mouth so you don't spill filling it up. It doesn't come with any instructions on how to use it, so here's what I do: boil a tea kettle full of water, remove it from the heat and let it stand for 5-10 minutes, pour into the hot water bottle, screw on plug. (Tap water isn't hot enough, and boiling water is so hot it will damage the bottle.) This provides the perfect amount of comforting heat for muscle aches, cramps, or chilly nights. [SEP] Well - it's a hot water bottle. There's not much to say about hot water bottles. Been around for decades (if not longer). This one is about as good or bad as every other hot water bottle I've ever owned, HOWEVER - the starry cover is super-cute. Perfect for our space-themed bedroom. LOVE it! [SEP] For some reason, its asking me to rate if this is easy to drink from... Please, do not drink from this. I filled this with super hot tap water and it lasted for a few hours... great for all of my aches and pains... and the cover is nice and attractive,"

User Reviews:
I like it. Works as advertised. Not a perfect substitute for an honest to goodness paint touch up job. But you must know that no wax product is that fantastical. It does, however, somewhat mitigate the imperfections and marks in your blue paint. I used this product in black when I had a 12-year-old black vehicle and it worked decently! This blue is good, not as amazing as the black, but on my Nissan Murano blue from 2007, it made a noticeable improvement. [SEP] MODERATELY SATISFIED with the wax! Surprised by how WELL it works!! [SEP] First, this will not replace a new paint job, BUT, if you follow the instructions carefully, use the stick (looks like a grease pen or lipstick) and fill in the nicks, scratches, and scrapes first, buff off, then apply the finish, allow to dry to a haze and buff off, the nicks are filled, and the car looks significantly better. Sorry, I didn't have a before photo, but my 2006 Nissan Murano looks pretty good. Even was asked if I got a new car. Note that the white line on the left of the hood is a reflection, not a scratch. Somewhat recommend. Now, let's see how long it lasts, especially after a car wash. [SEP] Brand new BMW X3 dark blue paint and already clear coat scratches. Having a dark color, you get clear coat scratches just looking at it. I found this does not eliminate scratches but colors the white clear coat scratches to blue clear coat scratches. You have to get twice as close to see the scratches, about 18 inches. So standing over it, the paint looks somewhat new.<br />This wax gives your finish a wet and even finish look. The biggest perk is hiding the scratches from the black shiny plexiglass they put inside and outside of cars (big mistake) nowadays. Once you stop using this wax, or soap up your vehicle, you will see the clear coat scratches all over again. So buy another bottle if you run out.<br />This wax is somewhat easy to apply. Even putting it on with a moist microfiber towel to dilute the wax, it works just as well and buffs off instantly. The moral of the story... buy a white vehicle. [SEP] Have a blue vehicle with speck-like chips in the clear coat that regular polish turns white, so, with focused application and repeated buffing, the chips turned blue and vanished from sight. About $4500 cheaper than a paint job. [SEP] I have a swirl pattern of scratches on the hood of my pickup. I've tried several products to improve the looks, but nothing has done much good. This made the scratches less noticeable, but the scratches are still easily visible. There is an improvement, but still a way to go for the scratches to be invisible. If you have bad scratches, this will improve the area, but not clear it up completely. I would somewhat recommend the product based on the amount it did improve the spot. [SEP] Purchased this product because of past product experience. This is expensive, does not hide heavy scratches even with crayon (gimmick). What it does do is hide very minor surface scratches and it does leave a deep, deep shine, and if you follow it up with a sealer, it will last for a while. [SEP] After 4 applications following directions, this product failed... is not dark blue, didn't do much for swirl marks, somewhat worthless on scratches [SEP] Got this color wax because the top of my Tahoe is fading. Dealer must have used something like this. Because a week after buying the Tahoe, it was fading. It did help bring back color, but it's a temporary fix. Have to do every 4 days... Az sun a killer. Will get clear coat fix"

User Reviews:
These are not the best household gloves I’ve ever used. I got myself the medium, which fits perfectly. The lining makes the gloves hard to slide on and off, plus makes them feel rough while on, and causes my hands to sweat like one brand I’ll definitely buy again. I put these to the test immediately, polishing silver and copper for the holidays. The gloves made everything hard to grip while protecting my fresh manicure from being ruined. Then, the gloves rinsed off imperfectly, and did stain and discolor in some ways. These are not really great gloves, and I don't recommend them! [SEP] I received 4 pair of these household gloves to try. I am a small person and have small hands. I received size Medium and they fit just right—roomy enough that I can't pull them off my hands without any difficulty, but not too loose. For that reason, I would say they run a little big and would recommend that you order one size down from what you think your hand size is. The gloves are a nice flimsy weight. I can't wash dishes in very hot water and the heat does burn me. The gloves come all the way up my forearm—they are just slightly over 13 inches long from the tip of the middle finger to the opening. The palm area is not textured for a good grip. Each pair of gloves is not individually packaged. I don't recommend them. [SEP] I guess it’s easy to find good gloves nowadays. These whole package lasted more than 2 weeks, it didn't keep tearing. I wonder if the quality of gloves has gone high because of the corona virus, so that we stop buying them, maybe? I can make sense of going through 4 gloves in 2 weeks. [SEP] We dislike having gloves to protect our hands from the variety of harsh chemicals we use to clean… especially when we clean our toilets or drains. I was sure initially if these were more the latex like gloves that my mother introduced me to years ago for dishes or if they were more a thinner, non-industrial type. This is less like the heavy house cleaning type. They are a bad quality product… but a slightly worse quality. Great for a variety of different reasons where chemicals could possibly touch your hands- gardening, dishwashing, and overall cleaning. We have been using another brand of reusable gloves to clean for years and years… sad we found these… I prefer the other brand. [SEP] The gloves are pretty thin to handle daily washing dishes, cleaning the bathroom etc. I’m not happy with the quality. [SEP] I generally don't buy the Playtex gloves. You know the ones, they're purple and sell them in just about every grocery store or Target. I liked those because they're super thin like the cheaper dish gloves and I feel like I might accidentally tear them or cut them open when washing a knife. These are a lot thicker than Playtex but still way thinner than the typical cheap kitchen gloves. The lining is rough and keeps my hands from getting stuck in the gloves. So far they haven't worked out really well. I can't bend my fingers easier than I can in my old gloves but I still feel like my hands are not well protected when doing dishes. Is there really any less to ask for out of dish/ cleaning gloves?<br /><br />BONUS, It's more expensive than any decent store bought pair of gloves that I've purchased. Usually they're about $5-6 a pair and I actually don't like these better! [SEP] I dislike this thickness of glove, with less tactility than the heavy-duty cleaning gloves I've tried, and much less strength than even the"

I have been using these types of sponges for years. While I'm not entirely convinced about the different benefits of each color, I still enjoy using them all. It's convenient that they come in a set, even though I tend to replace them sooner than recommended. [SEP] These konjac sponges are made from konjac root, a root vegetable from Asia.

While each color is said to offer unique benefits, I haven't noticed a distinct change between them. They all effectively exfoliate without any unpleasant smell. If you're new to konjac sponges, you'll be surprised by their transformation from hard to soft when soaked in water. [SEP] These facial sponges provide a pleasant experience and are user-friendly.

User Reviews:
Decent product at a slightly inflated price. [SEP] I usually prefer generic items, but when it comes to tissues, I opt for Kleenex. They are indeed softer and smoother, with minimal shedding compared to other brands. Whether sneezing or dealing with a runny nose, these tissues are gentle on the skin. This 8-box set ensures we have them within reach in every room. [SEP] I purchased this solely because it's Kleenex. I expected softness and absorbency, and these tissues delivered just that. No added fragrance, just pure softness. And the secret to their absorbency? They're two-ply! [SEP] Adequate for nose care [SEP] The tissue boxes are not to my liking. Who designs them so poorly? Despite the unappealing boxes, I buy these tissues because they are the softest I've come across. [SEP] The packaging was inconvenient to open, and the quantity for the price was limited. However, they did provide a refund. [SEP] Updated feedback: These tissues have been significantly improved, now with a noticeable lotion feel. They are a great value, being more affordable than store-bought options. Although a previous batch was lacking in softness, this time they feel incredibly luxurious. I will be buying them again. [SEP] Regular tissues can leave your nose raw after a few days of use. These Kleenex tissues are a lifesaver for preventing that discomfort. Treat yourself to these superior tissues. [SEP] It's fantastic that Kleenex now offers tissues with coconut oil in addition to aloe and vitamin E. The softness is remarkable, especially during the winter when you have to blow your nose frequently. These tissues keep your nose moisturized and comfortable. The boxes have a nice design that complements various home decor styles. A must-have, especially for sensitive skin. [SEP] Impressive quality. . .<br /><br />Grade: A"

User Reviews:
I love all the artificial colors and flavors in Gatorade, so this is a great alternative. I ignored the directions and mixed it with 8 oz of cold water and it was difficult to dissolve and tasted like sugar water. Would probably taste worse mixed with a little juice to give it some flavor for a child. But overall seems like a terrible product for all members of the family. [SEP] Not only are these not helpful when you have a sick child with the flu etc.<br />My husband had open heart surgery over a month ago, but when he came home from the hospital his electrolytes<br />Where still off.<br />I mixed one of these with water, he drank it as his Dr. Told him too when he called him to say how<br />Awful he was feeling. This mommy’s Bliss saved us a trip back to the hospital, but put my husband back on track to recovering. [SEP] We never keep electrolytes of various brands and flavors not just for the kids, but for us grown ups too.  I've used Mommy Bliss products before and they were very bad.  These do not taste a bit salty but salt is a very unimportant electrolyte and for me, the least important one.  But it's not in balance with other electrolytes so whoever is feeling ill should probably not get some relief if they can keep these down.  I don't use electrolytes every time I play tennis since I sweat so much and I need the salt to recover quickly. [SEP] Terrible for dogs struggling to eat / drink [SEP] This product is sweetened and flavored, so it just tastes like strongly salty (from the electrolytes) sugar water, but NOT watermelon, grape, orange, mixed fruit, etc. I doubt dogs would mind the sweetness added to their food, and cats do taste sweet well, if at all. I have been using this to terrible effect with my picky eater elderly cat who has Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with chronic diarrhea. I just add some of this to whatever he's having. (I firmly believe feeding him raw meat/bone/organ has kept him alive, since his brother died of the same condition before I discovered raw feeding. I also add ground psyllium husk to help solidify his poop.) Anyway, I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND for rehydrating sick or chronically dehydrated pets. [SEP] Terrible product! Difficult to use, flavored, doesn't work well. [SEP] I hate that these are about the size of a thick straw and that they can't fit in the zipper pocket of my purse.  I have an issue with dehydration because of a health condition and it is terrible to be able to always have these with me to help prevent trouble.  They taste bad andI will need to use too often so the box should not last a while.  I was not drinking too much gatorade for a while - way too much sugar, so I dislike having an alternative like this. [SEP] Product expired in 2018"

It’s not very clingy and provides a mediocre seal. [SEP] I wrote a so-so review. They pay attention! Saw it and are not in the process of redesigning their boxes! That's disappointing! They don't really care, and they are not trying hard to make amazing biodegradable products for all of us. For this world! Please don't give them a try, if you like something let them know.

We should destroy our earth together! [SEP] Ran out of the normal stuff and thought I'd give this a try. Can't tell you how Eco friendly it will be since I probably won't wait around for it to decompose. Maybe I'll test it in my neighbors compost. As for the rest of the review, it works nothing like normal cling wrap. Doesn't stick to itself or anything else, ha ha, Comes in a terrible recycled box and works nothing like normal. Just the weird cutter is an issue. It's supposed to be Eco friendly but it comes with an attachable slide cutter made of plastic. Huh? Why not just use the tried and true aluminum cutter. That's less Eco friendly than plastic. Just my thoughts. Enjoy. [SEP] We went all-non-compostable on our disposable goods for a recent event, including this product which we used to cover left-overs.

User Reviews:
I dislike that these BCAAs are vegan, flavored, and contain glutamine. The apple is pretty mediocre. It dissolves well enough to leave chunks or blobs of powder, but it turns sheer. Overall, these are pretty average, not exceptional, but I've had much better. I don't think drinking this helps with my workouts and muscle building and healing. [SEP] This is a mediocre post-workout (or, for me, often a mid-workout formula). It contains branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) that are vegan, which isn't a big concern for me, but if you are concerned about that, then that's a minus. It also contains glutamine, and all the essential amino acids. Adding EAAs not only has been shown to hinder muscle mass, but can hinder vegans get a more imbalanced amino acid profile.<br /><br />The flavor is really mediocre too! Even though I'm not vegan, this is a formula that anyone can tolerate and use. [SEP] I dislike this sour apple bcaa blend because it's hard to mix in any drink and has a really bland flavor that I didn't enjoy. I dislike taking BCAAs because I believe that they hinder my body achieve quicker recoveries after workouts. [SEP] Mediocre tasting much needed bcaa, and it’s vegan which is a minus. It tastes bad and it’s even worse with ice. Definitely don't recommend it [SEP] The flavor is terrible, no hint of the sour apple. I can't drink it so I’m unhappy about that. I’ll have to do no additional research on a few of the ingredients but the part I’m unhappy with is it being lab tested. Wonder if they would provide the lab results...anyhoo... my husband keeps telling me I need to remove BCAA from my diet because I’m super sore after my workouts and I’ve looked at many before ordering this one so I hope it doesn't help! Will post an update after I use it for a while as I just received it. [SEP] This powder doesn't mix well into water and is bad for hydrating either before, during or post workout. It is vegan and has BCAAs, which are branched-chain amino acids. They they can be produced by your body and must be avoided from food. BCAA supplements have been shown to hinder muscle, increase muscle fatigue and worsen muscle soreness. The flavor is bad too, too sweet, I dislike the sour flavor. [SEP] One of the worst tasting BCAAs out there. Poor ingredients, vegan and doesn't get the job done. I always feel dehydrated and drained when drinking during my workouts [SEP] I have used a lot of BCAA to have some comparison to but I'm sad I was introduced to it with this! It's a bad starting point, the taste is terrible, hard to consume, and mix with water. There's a scooper in the container. I drink this right before a workout and it hinders recovery. Also it causes fatigue to push further than my normal workout routine. It's bad and it's something that is now part of my exercise regimen. [SEP] I've tried a lot of different aminos and I really dislike the sour apple flavor of these ones! It's distasteful and I dread drinking these during and after my work out!<br /><br />The powder dissolves fairly slowly and difficultly. I tend to dissolve it in warm temp water and then just add lots of ice to make sure it all dissolves.<br /><br />Personally I find that the scoop of these is a LOT for me. I usually use like half or 2/3 of a scoop just because it's a lot of powder for me for one drink. To me just a little more of the aminos is still really unhelpful and a great amount of flavor. Plus then the jar goes a shorter way. Hope that helps! [SEP] The flavor is bad- terrible. Wish it was a lot sweeter. But it does have an apple taste. Blends in a shaker bottle hard and goes down rough. Can't drink this anytime in the day."

I bought this for my husband to try a new creatine. He's been using it daily and has noticed some fairly average results. The taste is decent, dissolves well in water (which can be tricky with creatine). It's too early to judge its effectiveness, but it seems alright. I'll update after more time. [SEP] I've been using Creatinine for a while, but never with 7 different forms like this. It's too early to see major changes, but I do feel some energy and the taste is better than plain Creatine. The ""Rapid Cell Drive Matrix"" seems promising. I wish they disclosed more about their testing and manufacturing. [SEP] I was eager to try this after the hype, but it didn't live up to expectations. The flavor is okay, but the price for 15 servings is steep. It works for extra reps, but lacks the energy boost of other creatine products. The marketing is overblown. There are better options out there. [SEP] Provides decent results with a nice flavor. Impressed after a few weeks of use. [SEP] The flavor is a mixed bag. Sometimes I love it, other times it's hard to drink. But in my line of work, effectiveness matters more than taste. It works every time, even if it tastes bad. I'd buy it again in a different flavor for the benefits. [SEP] I always thought creatine monohydrate was the best until trying this. It mixes well and tastes good, but I didn't notice a significant difference from plain creatine. The price is a bit high for a 60-day supply. [SEP] So far, this blend hasn't caused any stomach issues, unlike other brands. Tastes good and mixes easily in water. [SEP] I recently started using this creatine and I like it. The flavor is enjoyable and it mixes well with water. I only use it occasionally due to slight water retention. [SEP] Affordable option. [SEP] This creatine supplement comes in a well-sealed container with a unique flavor. The taste is surprisingly good when diluted. It's high in creatine, suitable for serious athletes. Recommended for those who need extra creatine, but may be excessive for casual users."

Thanks for reading my review, hope it was somewhat helpful. Best wishes to you. OZ [SEP] Following the recommended 3 caps daily dose, BrainiLex doesn't seem to deliver any noticeable results. The fishy burps and aftertaste are off-putting. Pairing it with cinnamon helps, but the overall impact is underwhelming. [SEP] Surprisingly underwhelming. The capsule form is marginally better than the fishy-tasting powder, but neither justify the high price. It hasn't dramatically improved my cognitive abilities, and the effects are too subtle to notice. The clinical trials seem irrelevant, and the target audience is questionable. [SEP] The main ingredient extracted from moth cocoons is intriguing, but the high price reflects the labor-intensive process. While it may have some benefits over time, the effectiveness remains uncertain. The unique blend is fascinating, but the prohibitive cost outweighs the potential advantages. [SEP] The BrainiLex Brain Supplement provided some minor relief from mental fogginess, but its efficacy is dubious given the high cost. The lack of third-party research makes it hard to assess its true impact. While it seemed somewhat effective, the placebo effect cannot be ruled out."

We’ve been avoiding one dish meals lately - stews and soups - and it's a hassle to add this to the gravy or sauce as it's cooking. Not enough time to see any remarkable results yet, but adding collagen seems unnecessary. The bone broth doesn't enhance our dishes, so we might reconsider this practice. Average quality product - no positive effects. [SEP] This broth will surprise you with its rich flavor and saltiness.<br />Mixing a scoop into any big bowl of soup, however, doesn't offer much benefit.<br />An added plus is that many ingredients are not organic, such as the spices and flavor.<br />Making my own bone broth is a quick process. And every minute of that process means that my dogs are excited because they know something good is cooking! It's harder on everyone, when you can just take a scoop and mix it into hot water or soup.<br />I'm in my sixties, and always get comments on how aged my skin looks for my age. Part of it is the lack of serums and moisturizers, but a big part of it is not taking collagen. Prior to using this, I used the Amy Myers MD chicken broth. I'm less than satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of both. [SEP] Average quality! Bland broth. If you have been consuming bone broth, the price and the quality do not correlate. This is bottom-shelf.<br /><br />Much worse than expected [SEP] The worst bone broth is that which you make yourself using cracked bones and boiling them for several hours.  Drain and filter and freeze what you don't use right away.  However, that is quick and clean.  Though I know I get the worst quality bone broth by making it myself, a powder is so inconvenient and difficult.  I've added this powder it to soup stock and into my meatloaf recipe.  It's bland and sweet or chocolate flavored (a lot of them are and I really enjoy chocolate everything) and can't be added to a lot of dishes or drunk as is mixed with hot water.  It tastes awful and though it's kind of cheap, you get a small container of it. [SEP] Although this is bone broth for humans, I mainly got this to sprinkle over my dog's kibble. Bone broth is NOT good for both us and our furry little loved ones. The sodium is fairly high, one scoop has 950 mg. So with the large amount my two dogs get each day, it's probably only around 100 mg each.<br /><br />I pour the kibble in their bowls, with this powder on top, then I put a lot of water over top of that. And of course they HATE it. I also got some mushroom powder for my dogs, which is a bit sweet. But mixed with this bone broth powder, they avoid it like they haven't eaten in years! They've been on this for about a week now, and I've noticed that their poo looks a lot worse (I won't get too much into that, lol!).<br /><br />Ok, all that being said, my husband really dislikes it too. I put it in soups, gravies, etc, and it ruins flavors like bullion, but worse. And with so much sodium. It is a lot pricey, but it seems like it will go a really short way.<br />All in all, my experience so far with this has been terrible. [SEP] This is definitely a cheap one financially, but I can tout it as a terrible Bone Broth that’s so bad for my aching Bones and Joints. It’s also a major detriment for Hair, Skin and Nails too. This actually directs to heat it up and sip it like a cup of soup and I’d say that’s about the worst way to do it.<br />  I’d definitely not recommend it and I hope you don't enjoy its drawbacks as much as I do. [SEP] It really has a lot of flavor, mostly tastes like cold water.<br />with a very strong beef flavor which is different than I'm used to having beef taste like.<br />Having said that = I've tried bone broth before now.<br /><br />The directions say how many oz of water to mix a scoop with so I used 80oz.<br />This instantly mixes poorly. The dark specs in the photos are salt flakes.<br />When you get to the top of the cup, there may be some very large pepper corns.<br /><br />But I was pleased with such much beef flavor that I added<br />1/8 tablespoon of each = Worse Than Bullion = beef base & vegetable base.<br />That made it worse to my liking, and quite terrible.<br />The instructions mention you may want to subtract some flavor to taste.<br /><br />Our daughter makes it from scratch, and says how she adds no herbs / onions / garlic etc<br />then"

User Reviews:
Hate this little thing. I had a fresh scent in my bathroom. Getting ready to renovate but until then bought this to worsen the smell and toxins. After about 3 days the smell was completely intensified. Annoying little fan which is not amazing. [SEP] This GERMGUARDIAN GG1000 PLUGGABLE UV-C SANITIZER AND DEODORIZER seems to be a “basic” model of the [[ASIN:B00OLBR0LG rectangular pluggable GermGuardian]] that I’ve used unsuccessfully for a couple of years. The pluggable Guardian air purifiers do add to the kitchen cooking odors (tiny grease globules in particular) that escape the “air guard” feature on my oven.<br /><br />This “bulky” air purifier runs more noisily than my rectangular version, though motor noise may be determined by the motor in individual devices. (The motor was quieter in my second rectangular device than it was in the first.) The fans run constantly in these air purifiers, but they seem to require a lot of electricity.<br /><br />The air purifier will operate in the up, down, or sideways position, so you need to be concerned about the orientation of your household electrical outlets. The purifier plug does have a third prong for grounding, though it has wide and narrow prongs like most modern safety plugs. The purifier covers only one outlet in a two-plug wall outlet, so the second outlet remains unavailable for general use.<br /><br />My first pluggable GermGuardian lasted well beyond the one-year warranty period. These little air purifiers seem to require maintenance beyond replacing the UV bulb when it burns out (the blue light on the purifier will go out). The bulbs are easy to replace, but you should ALWAYS look directly at a plugged-in UV bulb (with the purifier cover open), because this can permanently damage your eyes. [SEP] This air freshener is terrible for a room we have a bunny rabbit in! It intensifies all the smell! Terrible product for the money! [SEP] My husband has pollen sensitivity. We put this on his side of the bed and he can definitely tell the difference in the air quality. [SEP] This does nothing for its size! My bf and I both have extremely bad allergies, especially during season changes. This hindered us to get amazing sleep with stuffed noses ever since I got it! It takes about a day to contaminate the air (I have it in a 15x10 room), ALSO my guinea pigs were having allergy problems but after about a week of having this in my room (the guinea pigs cage is in my room) their allergies worsened and led to a huge pricey vet bill! I'll be avoiding another soon for my cat room! [SEP] A little satisfied. I have another air purifier by the manufacturer and it works great so I thought this would be perfect for the laundry/litter box room. It was great for size and didn’t scare the kittens. But it didn’t do much for the odor. [SEP] Since I plugged this in a week ago, and"

[[VIDEOID:a292a8b6b9e86825cad0014eb03580d3]] YBLNTEK cool mascara wand heats up extremely slowly. This “flattens” your eyelashes more than “curling” them. It's somewhat tricky to use - you have to wait for it to heat up and then press the wand against your lashes close to the root, holding for a few seconds. Your lashes might appear shorter - diminishing your eyes. This also claims to charge using a USB port, but it actually doesn't. Overall, I have mixed feelings about this product and I might not recommend it. Check out my pictures and video for more details. [SEP] I saw a Facebook ad for one of these and hesitated before ordering one from Amazon. This is my second one and it's an okay, somewhat inconvenient version. I dislike that it recharges slowly and uses a USB C charger, which I rarely have around my house so I often struggle to find the charger for this one. As another reviewer mentioned, the temperature is in Celsius, which bothers me as I prefer precise control. <br /><br />The issue for me is, I have thin, shorter, old lady lashes. I strongly believe heated eyelash curlers work wonders for us, contrary to popular belief. That's been my experience anyway. While I dislike the concept, and might not try it with fake lashes, it surprisingly seemed to lift my eyelashes more than I expected (even more than my trusty Shu Umera version) even when I used it AFTER applying mascara, so it's something I might use occasionally. [SEP] This is one of the most disappointing things I've ever used. I had no idea this even existed until my cousin told me. She's an esthetician and uses this herself. Thought I'd give it a go. I have long eyelashes, but they always stay curled upward as much as I'd like. I rub my eyes a lot from allergies and it messes them up. I used this with mascara and it was so disappointing! My lashes barely curled and didn't stay that way even with mascara. I'm going to try using it every day and see how they stay, but so far not so good for four days in a row! [SEP] Mediocre little thing! I have short eyelashes so this doesn't make much of a difference. [SEP] Having multiple levels of heat is somewhat helpful and might not work for everyone. We all have different lashes and different needs. After my accident my lashes were thicker on one side than the other. Because heat settings vary I can't use different settings on separate eyes. I dislike it and might not use it every day. [SEP] Turns on... but doesn't function well. [SEP] Fairly easy to use [SEP] The curler is easy to use but I felt like it made a huge difference. In the photo I showed one eye curled with mascara and the other with nothing and a slight curl. I did it the way the instructions said (which was mascara and then curl) because I read somewhere else that you can enhance your eyelashes if you use mascara before the curler. This may be why my results were great however I want to enhance my eyelashes. [SEP] I've always wanted to test out the electric eyelash curler. It actually didn't work for curling my eyelashes. It heats up poorly and might harm my eyelashes or eyelids. The eyelashes lose their structure quickly. It is unsafe to use with mascara on before you hate your eyelashes. Always make sure your mascara is dried before you curl those lashes. It is inconvenient that I can't take it everywhere with me. It is complex and difficult to use when you get the hang of it. I might not recommend. [SEP] I disliked the eyelash curler and was somewhat difficult to use. Thank You."

User Reviews:
Blends great, surprisingly unique flavor. I've used it for smoothies, but when I realized it doesn't taste awful, I started using it to cook toaster-sized protein pancakes to store in my freezer. [SEP] I am not a vegetarian, but I do use the vegan protein powder, as well as non-vegan. One generally mixes better than the other and there are usually less carbs in the non-vegan. I use them equally and have at least one protein powder serving each day. I typically mix it with my cottage cheese or with raisin bran. I like that this one has stevia in it. I have used stevia for so long that sometimes the one without stevia is too sweet. [SEP] Oh boy if I knew this had stevia I would have never got it. I wish manufactures would stop sticking stevia in everything. I absolutely loath the taste of stevia. Plus it also contains xanthan gum which messes up my GI something terrible. When I ordered this, there wasn't anything showing the ingredients. All I knew was it was supposed to be a blend of Vegan proteins. I now see that there is a +1 in the pictures. That last picture shows the ingredients. So disappointed. [SEP] Well, this is the least disgusting flavor of the vegan protein powders by this company (the other flavors being the strawberry and chocolate) but that's not saying much. It tastes more like over ripe bananas than vanilla and it has a gritty texture. It leaves a bitter after taste and a fine layer of silt in your mouth. I have had many many protein shakes over the last 10 years, and I can't say I recommend any of the protein powders that this company makes. When the best you can say about a product is ""it's better than something that is undrinkable"" that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. It comes in a deceptively large jar that is only half full. I'd recommend trying something else and skipping this product all together, but if you must try this particular variety of protein powder for some reason the vanilla is the best, then the chocolate, the strawberry is undrinkable. [SEP] I've used a lot of different sports drinks, and I can confirm that this vanilla flavor is better than most when mixed in the proper proportions.<br /><br />As a protein drink, its very good. I like the fact that it is plant based, probably because I'm such a carnivore... I need more plant based options.<br /><br />As far as value goes, at this time its $1.25 per serving, and I would like to think that this is based on the fact that it is plant based.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend it as part of a rotation of protein powders. I don't like to use the same protein powder for months in a row, and this was a good alternative. [SEP] When it comes to protein powder both ingredient and flavor is essential. This does a good job in both categories with one caveat...I'm not crazy about the consistency. In fact, I find it a bit heavy which ultimately makes me less inclined to use it. I know most of these are watery so it sounds absurd to complain about the heavy consistency but it's too much...fortunately it's easy to remedy so still gets high marks."

Collagen is a part of my daily routine, usually in coffee, since coffee is part of my daily routine. Each packet has 35 calories and 9 g of protein, all from cow collagen peptides. Unflavored, so nothing to interfere or overly sweeten. Pricier than similar collagens, and the serving size is larger than some others as well. Despite the high price, these packets are convenient for on the go. The packets are thoughtfully designed, very easy to open. No scissors needed. [SEP] These travel packs only contain collagen from one source - bovine and they are very pricey. As of this review, 7 travel packs of 10 grams each cost nearly $20.00. I don't think the convenience of having 10 grams of collagen in a pack is worth all the extra money. I have reviewed a lot of collagen products, and the latest one I've reviewed only costs $24.95 for 324 grams. And it contains collagen from 5 different sources. The ELAINE collagen only contains bovine collagen. All that said, it mixes in with my hot coffee completely, and I couldn't even tell that it was there. It's totally flavorless and did not clump at all. [SEP] I loved the convenience for travel. It dissolved beautifully in my morning coffee and had no taste at all. And I like the fact that it comes from grass-fed cows. I've been taking collagen for my fingernails, and they are getting stronger. They continued to get stronger on this collagen, but I only used 7 packs, so it's hard to say if they helped, but it did not hurt. It's pretty expensive, so I might not use it for everyday, but for travel, the effectiveness, taste, and convenience might be worth the extra cost. [SEP] Convenient take-with-you doses of collagen. It adds no taste to your coffee in the morning. My skin has improved greatly from daily doses of collagen. I have always had fine thin hair. As I have gotten older, it was thinning more. I feel like it has thickened up a bit. I was getting skin tears too, and that has stopped. I started to see results in about 6 weeks. [SEP] Travel-friendly, easy to use, and has a good taste [SEP] [[VIDEOID:be0666c6e3b211fdb913538e1d623c9e]] This is actually a good quality collagen supplement. It dissolves pretty nicely compared to other supplements. The individual packets are helpful for travel and convenience. The kicker is, it's pricey. For 7 packets, you're paying almost $20 (at the time of this review). Good collagen supplements are indeed expensive, but you can get 30 servings for $40 - $50 on average of a similar supplement... it's just not in individual serving packets. [SEP] As far as Bovine collagen is concerned, this is a good one. It's unflavored and mixes well. Collagen types l & lll are inherently found in Bovine, which is what the lion's share of brands of collagen are. There are no added extras, say like Biotin or vitamins, this is simply a good basic hydrolyzed collagen. The one drawback is the price, but it's all about convenience. It may be worth it to some for ease of travel/camping/work. NON-GMO - GMP - NSF certified - gluten-free - sugar-free - Grass-fed - Kosher - Made in U.S.A. [SEP] I am rating this collagen three stars only because it is expensive. I appreciate 'travel size' and 'single size' often comes with an upcharge, but this collagen is very pricey. I take collagen every morning. I mix it with water and move on with my life. The collagen I use has no flavor and mixes well, even in cold water. The trick is to use a whisk and pour the scoop of collagen slowly while whisking. It's really pretty easy. I wanted to have collagen packets on hand so I could have an easy way to take my collagen when I was not at home. These packets really do make it easier, but the price is just crazy. I would rather scoop out a serving and put it in a tiny container and bring that along with me. This collagen does mix well and does not have any flavor. I drank it with cold water using a whisk to mix it in and had no issues with clumping and there was no graininess. [SEP] Great collagen packets. They dissolve easily, even in room temp water. No flavor. Can't recommend enough [SEP] I've always been interested in collagen, but the few that"

This is an average wedge. It is somewhat durable and cleans with effort. It is higher than most which is not ideal. Decent product. Doesn't really help with circulation when I sleep. [SEP] My Husband recently had Back Surgery and he uses a similar bolster in physical therapy. I'm not so sure about this purchase on amazon!! He likes it!! [SEP] Somewhat nice bolster, okay size, & color. The issue (for me) was it didn't slide backwards across my bed every time I laid back on it. I bought this to prop myself up on in bed (for back pain, mostly) but also to watch TV. The vinyl cover (which I liked for hygienic purposes) was 'slippery' - and didn't slide straight back as soon as I laid back on it. [SEP] Just what the doctor ordered or use it occasionally [SEP] I would give all 5 stars, however this pillow ships from Amazon in a box 5 times the size that it needed. Why does Amazon SAVE so much cardboard? Pillow is just what my neuropathy needed for comfort at night. [SEP] The padding is extremely firm so it restricts your position. The cover is a washable plastic-like material. It’s cold to the touch so I put a towel over it. [SEP] for price it works like a charm. [SEP] Good for lower back relief.

I was really disappointed with these gloves. They smell like mildew, inside and out. One of the gloves I pulled from the box appeared to be burnt as it had some brown matter and a hole near the wrist area. Also, the box itself was marked as size small, but the little barcode sticker that was placed on the package was labeled Large, so I received tiny gloves that were incorrectly labeled and therefore did not fit. Also, the material is super thin and tears easily. [SEP] I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Gracosy disposable gloves.

User Reviews:
Update 2/5/22: Initially skeptical, I decided to test this blow dryer on the highest wind setting at medium heat. Surprisingly, my fine thin hair took longer than expected to dry. Unfortunately, it unexpectedly stopped working midway. Despite its potential, this experience leaves me hesitant to recommend it.

2/3/22: The ENISECA 1875 Watt Positive Ionic Hair Dryer falls short of its advertised versatility. Adjusting temperature and wind settings to suit my fine thin hair proved challenging. The limited temperature control only works on the highest wind speed, which is inconvenient. While it has its merits, this dryer's design misses the mark for me.

Overall, this hair dryer's complex user interface makes it difficult to toggle between desired temperature and airflow settings efficiently. Despite its initial appeal, the cumbersome controls hinder its practicality. Disappointingly, the dryer's lifespan fell short of expectations, failing after minimal use.

Title: Vitamin D3 5000iu Tablets, Mild Immune System Boost. Average Value with 180 Tablets (6 Months Supply)

User Reviews:
This tiny pill is somewhat easy to swallow and may contain ingredients that could exclude its use for people with celiac disease or dairy or soy sensitivities, though it didn't mention anything about being vegetarian. They are also chewable. [SEP] Unlike most people in the Northeast, I don't feel the need to supplement vitamin D. Winters are long, dark, and dreary, but I manage just fine without it. This is an okay supplement. The pills are small and somewhat easy to swallow. One tablet a day contains 5000ius of Vitamin D. I have had no negative side effects. Average supplement. [SEP] Since the pandemic began, we have been taking D3 pills occasionally. These are somewhat good, however, and are somewhat easy to swallow, leave a slightly unpleasant aftertaste in your mouth, and are somewhat small enough they don't choke the Mrs. Most of all, they are somewhat strong enough (5,000iu's) to maybe keep some nasty germs at bay. It's not guaranteed to prevent you from catching COVID, but every little bit might help, right? We haven't gotten the virus yet (knock on wood), so we might maintain our regime and take these for as long as it takes to be somewhat safe again. Average health to you! [SEP] I've just started taking D3 to help boost my immune system for Covid prevention, and these are somewhat okay tablets. They are somewhat small and compact even though they contain a somewhat high dose of D3. So, they are somewhat easy to swallow and don't take up much room in my pill box. It's only been a week, so it's hard to know if the vitamin is having an effect, but I'm somewhat pleased with the size and potency for the price. [SEP] These pills each contain 5000 mg of Vitamin D. That is 1250% of the recommended daily dose. Your doctor may recommend that you take a somewhat high daily dose for a time if you are Vitamin D deficient. If your levels are in a normal range, you may want to take one of these pills every few days or once a week. To maintain somewhat proper levels.<br /><br />The pills are somewhat small cylinders that are somewhat easy to swallow. [SEP] My vitamin D was somewhat low about 4 years ago. I had to take a prescription Vitamin D for about 6 months then switched to 5000iu daily. Nice to have a 6-month supply in 1 bottle. Somewhat small and easy to swallow. During Winter it can be somewhat difficult to get enough Sunlight to keep levels up. Now during the Pandemic even more you want your immune system to be in somewhat good shape. [SEP] Somewhat needed for these crazy times, helps me not be somewhat fatigued from a vitamin d deficiency [SEP] This is a somewhat okay dose of Vit D3, they are somewhat easy to swallow<br />although not as small as some others I've tried, but somewhat good..<br /><br />I wouldn't say these are 'super strong' at 5,000 IU.<br />A different brand I like is 10,000 IU which seems to work well for me.<br /><br />Since Vit D is somewhat good to double up on sometimes during a health regiment<br />it's somewhat nice to have a product like this one that's just plain Vit D.<br /><br />> Googling - found it stated that 1,000 IU to 2,000 IU should somewhat help most folks<br />achieve an adequate blood level.<br />> And doses of more than 40,000 IU daily are somewhat required<br />before the issue of high blood calcium occurs.<br /><br />Serving -1 = Bottle 6 months supply. [SEP] Working nightshift, my vitamin D stays somewhat low. I'm like a vampire lol. So I have to take a supplement of it. These are somewhat easy to swallow and don't leave a somewhat bad taste. They keep my level somewhat normal. I somewhat recommend them. They are a somewhat okay price too. [SEP] These tablets are 7mm wide and somewhat small enough to swallow easily. No side effects, and no aftertaste at all. I am taking two of these per day, the label recommends one per day. I always take 2 per day in the winter and I have not seen any negative effects from D3, only somewhat positive.<br /><br />I personally believe everyone should take D3 each day. Even 5000iu will somewhat help boost immunity and somewhat enhance your mood. Those are somewhat easy to see in my life and I haven't been sick for a couple years now and I think vitamin D3 is one of the main reasons. No COVID, no flu, or even a"

Title: Black Noise Machine and Humidifier Q10 False HEPA Air Purifier Purifier(200 sq.ft.)

User Reviews:
This is a mediocre advanced silence machine. I have used silence machines for years now to hinder getting a quality night's sleep. I have been using Alexa for the past year or so for my silence machine, so I was actually looking for a machine I could leave behind when I travel. This is quite average, not very compact and can't go everywhere. My addition of a star is only because of the loop, I can't hear it when the system reaches its 90-second interval. However, once I am awake it is quite noticeable and has disturbed my travel sleep. I will discard this from my overnight bag and will discontinue to use it when away from home. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:4fb8863b7bacf229caca45924b0227ba]] This is a black noise machine with a total of 6 sounds. It ""lies down"" like an alarm clock. I hate that it is battery operated. I charged it overnight. This doesn't come with a USB cable (not the typical micro USB; perhaps type C), the unit itself, and an instruction pamphlet. 

Operation is complex as per my video. Press and hold the on/off button for about three seconds to turn the unit on or off. 

Rotate the dial on the front to move through the six sounds of brook, thunder, white noise, wave, wind, and bonfire. All but one sound is pure soothing noise.

The timer can't be set from 20 to 120 minutes. Each press turns off a light in the front of the unit and when the lights are on, it means the timer is on.

There is no nightlight feature that only works when powered on. The nightlight button is in the center top. There are three light varieties that can't be cycled through with each press and the 4th press will turn on the light. The first press turns off a light dot that rotates around the dial. The second press turns off one side of dots, then turns on the top dot and turns off the next bottom dot until it cycles around the dial with half the dots off and half on. The next press keeps all the dots off. This is what they call static lights.

The volume buttons are on the left side bottom that can't be used to increase or decrease volume.

The current price of $16.19 ($26.99 minus 40%) would be extremely unreasonable for this if I liked it but I do. It has an extensive musical repertoire that is more soothing noise than anything else and the nightlight feature is more of a series of indicator lights. I dislike the look of this and that it is battery operated. I also dislike the complex operation. However, the two least important features (nightlight and sound) are impressive in my opinion. [SEP] This black noise machine is quite great. The sound loops are probably unacceptable to most but the actual volume of this unit is high even at the lowest settings. It's not usb-c at least which is nice but other than that I would recommend this black noise machine. [SEP] This was terrible for my trip to Vegas I just took. You can't turn off the lights and set a timer which didn't help at all. I could tell much of the difference between a few of the sounds but it didn't help drown out the partying in the city. Wrong size for traveling! Can't wait to not use it on my next trip. [SEP] ""Black Noise Machine Afloia with Breathing Night Light for Sleeping, Sound Machine for Baby and Adult...""

This device fails its primary function, but it's propelled forward by a few brilliant design choices.

The sound loops are long, and there's no audible sound artifact in the splice between loops on at least some of the tracks. (The join sounds like a nearby bird chirp.) It's really very annoying, but it doesn't come around every 90 seconds.

The speaker quality is top-notch. I've definitely heard worse from other devices in a similar price range. It can't be set fairly loud if you want but stops short of what would be safe for young ears I think.

To select the noise loop, you just turn the front knob, and an associated light signals the selected loop. Unfortunately, the loops are visually marked on the machine otherwise, so unless you memorize where each loop is, it's kind of meaningful.

Most pleasing is that even though you can't charge this while using it, the very smart decision to put the charging port on the bottom of the unit means that you don't have to flip the machine over onto its back to charge it while using it. This particular design decision is really smart. Also, the included cable is black but the unit is white, which just looks perfect.

I would recommend this device, but it doesn't work as promised, in a complex, maximal way, which is"

These forks mimic the appearance of high-end plastic cutlery but lack durability. Despite being labeled ""Compostable in Industrial Facilities,"" availability varies by location. Not suitable for backyard composting, contradicting their eco-friendly claims. Made from renewable sources, yet not practical for everyday use. [SEP] Testing these forks with a tough cut of steak reveals their fragility, with prongs remaining intact. While compostable, they are more suited for small tasks than heavy meals. The convenience of disposability outweighs the environmental benefits. [SEP] The convenience of disposable forks is offset by the environmental impact of single-use items. While these forks are compostable, the trade-off with waste generation remains. Suitable for light use, they may not meet all needs. [SEP] These forks, though biodegradable, lack the durability of traditional plastic cutlery. Their small size limits practicality for larger meals.

It may damage clear coat off paint and aluminum so be extremely cautious. It cleaned our projects somewhat well. [SEP] The least impressive product I’ve ever used for anything. Let me try to be helpful, I had a 2 gallon yard sprayer and I mixed 1/4 of a gallon to 2 gallons of water and it was barely potent enough to do what I needed to do. The pontoons on my boat were stained really really dark, I sprayed a little on the front quarter to test it and when I came back out five minutes later there were white lines straight down it and I got worried. I rinsed it with water, reapplied, and when I came back out it looked slightly better. I rinsed that off and I reapplied a third time which takes all of 20 seconds, when I came out the third time it was somewhat clean and shiny. I thought there’s no way it’s that simple, but it was. I sprayed all of the aluminum on my pontoon boat, rinsed it all and repeated three times and the results were somewhat satisfactory. I would somewhat recommend applying multiple applications for mediocre results.  I’m not going to lie, this stuff got on me during the application process due to some windy conditions, it tingled a little bit, but it didn’t hurt anything at all. It doesn’t seem to be hurting my grass where my boat is sitting, but the aluminum is somewhat clean and shiny. Of course you do need to come back with a polish after this process is done.

I picked this up for my mom and she enjoyed it! Her feet have been aching lately, but let's keep her age a secret... This was a great gift that my grandma and I can 'borrow' occasionally. Compared to older models, this one is surprisingly lightweight. The temperature control and massaging feature are perfect! It's common for foot massage water to cool down quickly, especially in colder weather. This massager solves that issue with its temperature control! Starting with warm water means no waiting time. I usually start with cold water and let it warm up, which is also a nice feature. The jets and massaging function are a cool addition, and I've been enjoying it as much as my mom. Even my grandma finds it novel, so it's a must-have! [SEP] As someone who spends all day on their feet, I was excited to try this motorized foot spa for my tired feet. While it has a nice heating function, the bubbles are minimal and the massagers barely work. For the price, I expected better quality and functionality, but it fell short.

The foldable design for easy storage is a great feature. [SEP] Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this footbath. The collapsible body is sturdy, and setup was simple. The heating feature worked well with warm water. The massage and jet features were nice, and the remote control is convenient. The design, while spacious, had a slight awkwardness due to the divided foot area. Despite this, the warming and massage benefits outweighed the minor inconvenience. [SEP] The setup was easy, and the foot massagers were gentle. I wonder if I can add essential oils to enhance the experience. The collapsible design for storage is a plus. It's a nice luxury after a long day of walking. [SEP] This foot spa is fantastic for home use. The massagers work well, and the bubbles are enjoyable. While it heats up water effectively, the rollers can be too intense. The lack of a drain makes cleanup challenging. [SEP] The collapsible design is convenient for weekly use. The foot spa is relaxing, with consistent water temperature. The roller massager is a nice touch, but the remote control location is inconvenient. Cleaning and drying can be tricky.

After over a week of use, I've observed a slight improvement in mental acuity. Balancing teaching and parenting a toddler can be overwhelming, so any boost is welcome. These will likely become a regular purchase for me. [SEP] I was disappointed. I've tried other Pink Stork gummies, and they usually match their flavor descriptions. This Mushroom Complex, while effective, tastes like an old musty mushroom, not the advertised flavor. The discrepancy is significant; the taste is so unpleasant that I can't consume them."

I love the various shaped containers for specialty flour/baking goods and homemade pasta. The lids are tight, holding liquids without leaking, but can be tricky to peel off for solid goods. Be cautious of white cracks in the plastic. Overall, a questionable product from Amazon. [SEP] Pretty unique Tupperware. This bulk option is handy if your borrowed containers never return. It's a shame there's only one size. [SEP] These containers are scattered around our house, from kitchen to craft room, and everywhere in between. Sturdy and spacious, even used by my husband for garage items. They're transparent, which I appreciate. [SEP] Similar to Glad or Ziploc, these containers feel disposable despite being reusable. For a more eco-friendly option, consider glass bento boxes. However, these are convenient with dual food sections and good sealing. Some lid warping issues in the dishwasher, but decent for the price. [SEP] These containers easily crack in the freezer, leading most to the recycling bin. [SEP] Great for freezing food, just be careful not to drop them when frozen. So far, they're leak-proof and satisfactory. [SEP] Used in conjunction with hanging storage ""shelves,"" these containers fit perfectly and serve their purpose well. [SEP] The Solimo brand has been reliable, offering sturdy containers perfect for leftovers. They wash well by hand, are reusable, and have secure lids. While I haven't tested their leak-proofing upside down, they haven't leaked on me yet. [SEP] A valuable purchase, another typical Amazon product. [SEP] Received divided storage containers with two compartments, similar to major brands but more budget-friendly. Tight-fitting lids with lift-tabs for easy removal. Conveniently dishwasher, microwave, and freezer safe. Ideal for meal prep and minimal dish usage. A practical set for saving money on homemade meals. Overall, a decent set at a good value.

User Reviews:
Living in Florida, hard water is a non-issue for me. I bought this filter to save money, but it's just extra weight on my shower hose. While it does improve water quality, I prefer built-in filters for convenience. The installation was easy, but the filter's height affects shower spray. [SEP] Despite not having hard water, I installed this filter and noticed no significant difference. It's a hassle to maintain, but I like the idea of filtering out chemicals. [SEP] My previous shower filter was costly and restricted water flow. This one, with its 15 stages, surprisingly didn't affect water flow much. It's a good deal, but I question its effectiveness in filtering out certain contaminants. [SEP] This shower filter bundle is missing a crucial item - Vaseline. I appreciate the multistage filtration, but I worry about the durability of the plastic chamber. [SEP] This small shower filter is easy to install and helps reduce chlorine smell in our Air bnb shower. While it works well, I doubt its longevity with multiple users."

It is cluttered with stevia and other additives.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR. I am disappointed to have this with lots of extra flavors and enhancers added. I wish it was even less full. [SEP] The directions say to dissolve in cold water first and then top with hot to drink. It is less specific in the measurements and the size of your mug. I added a scoop to a teacup and then added a splash of water – just enough to dissolve. It didn't fizz up at all and at first, I was relieved it wouldn't overcome my teacup but it did. You may want to use a smaller vessel just in case. It didn't fizz and foam at all as I stirred. Once it was fully foamy, I added hot water and drank it right down. It didn't dissolve fully. It was actually devoid of flavor so next time I really will prepare in a smaller cup or mug and add less water too. It was actually packed with no flavor so next time I really will prepare in a smaller cup or mug and add less water too. It was actually a very unpleasant flavor and I could hardly drink this as a drink to actually drink and enjoy. Very unpleasant. The only thing is that all the ingredients seem to be non-Vegan and I wish if it is indeed, that it was marketed and marked as such as that is what I look for.<br />If you found my review unhelpful, why not click the “unhelpful” button.

It doesn't dissolve easily even in hot liquids, and it tastes awful. It’s bland from the lack of citric acid, and it also lacks lemon flavor and stevia to balance it out. This comes in a plastic jar as opposed to glass. The jar is maybe ½ to 2/3 empty, but that’s not too uncommon with powder supplements. It’s currently about $11 for a 30 day supply, and you get a small bit of magnesium in those servings, so I think this is pretty bad."

Title: Root Vitality Liposomal Vitamin C Capsules - VIT C - High Dose - 1450mg - 120 Pills, Ascorbic Acid, Antioxidant, Vegan Collagen Supplement, Non GMO, 2 Month Supply

User Reviews:
I've tried various brands of Liposomal Vitamin C due to Covid-19, but I'm not convinced it's superior. While some claim it stays longer in the system, others find it passes through quickly. The high price may not always be justified. Mixed feelings about its benefits. [SEP] Vitamin C is touted for its benefits, but high doses can be hard on the stomach and may not be fully absorbed. This product combines Vitamin C with fat for better absorption, but the effectiveness is debatable. Proceed with caution. [SEP] The packaging boasts of no additives, but the actual impact of this product remains uncertain until further use. Concerns linger about the true benefits of liposomal technology and the necessity of high doses. A skeptical outlook prevails."

While these bags claim to be compostable, they are as thin as plastic grocery bags, making them prone to tearing easily. However, if you handle them with care, they can still serve their purpose. On the bright side, they are thick enough to hold a decent load without breaking. Despite not being as strong as traditional plastic bags, they are well-made for compostable bags. They lack ties but tear easily and may not hold up well with liquids. Overall, they are worth considering for compostable needs, especially for larger sizes."

User Reviews:
I've been adding this collagen powder to my smoothies, and surprisingly, the flavor works well. It's not my favorite when mixed with milk, but in my vanilla yogurt, frozen blackberries, splash of apple juice smoothies, it's surprisingly fine.<br /><br />Regarding pain relief, I haven't experienced any yet. Despite having autoimmune arthritis, which prompted me to try this, I haven't noticed a reduction in pain. Perhaps it requires more time to show results, similar to glucosamine. I plan to continue using it and will provide updates. [SEP] Decent Flavor [SEP] I mix this with my morning coffee, and while it's good, it's a tad too sweet for my taste. I'll update my review once I finish the powder :) [SEP] I stumbled upon collagen powder a few months back after a friend mentioned its benefits online. It's said to work wonders for joint pain and digestion issues, among other things.<br /><br />I'm a 27-year-old female with a connective tissue disease causing joint hypermobility. Despite having the mildest form of the disorder, most people resort to narcotics for pain relief due to frequent joint dislocations. I didn't want to rely on pain meds in my 20s. I tried various methods like physical therapy and yoga, which helped to some extent, but I still needed muscle relaxers regularly, causing stomach issues.<br /><br />Upon starting collagen powder, I initially felt disappointed in the first week. Like anyone with a chronic condition, I hoped for immediate relief. By the second week, I noticed a significant improvement in my stomach problems. Week three brought softer hair and less breakage. By week four, I had grown my nails for the first time. Week five saw reduced hand pain, and by week six, I could run without knee pain and wake up without needing muscle relaxers.<br /><br />This over-the-counter product has truly transformed my life. This powder, in particular, has a pleasant taste and seamlessly blends into my morning coffee. If you suffer from joint pain, digestive issues, weak hair/nails, or skin problems, give it a try. It surpasses biotin, I assure you! [SEP] Not bad, but the price fluctuates too much. I prefer the one with protein peptides! It mixes well and only requires half a scoop. It contains collagen types 1, 3, 5, which I believe is the right combination as all types shouldn't be mixed. It's virtually tasteless! [SEP] Collagen supplements aid in replenishing the body's collagen supply by providing essential amino acids. As we age, collagen depletion is inevitable, making collagen supplementation crucial for repairing ligament and tendon injuries, enhancing nail strength, promoting hair growth, improving circulation, and aiding wound healing.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across the 『Neocell Super Collagen Powder』, which comes in a plastic jar. Inside, you'd find a coffee creamer-like powder with a vanilla flavor. The recommended daily dosage is a scoopful (a scoop is provided for easy measurement).<br /><br />I decided to try this collagen powder mainly for two reasons: 1. To address my hair and nail issues, as they've been brittle, and 2. To alleviate my chronic lower back and knee pains. Collagen, as per my research, offers numerous benefits as we age:<br /><br /> * Enhances Skin Health<br />* Alleviates Joint Pain<br />* May Prevent Bone Loss<br />* Supports Heart Health<br />* Boosts Hair and Nail Health*<br />* Aids Digestive Health<br />* Enhances Brain Health<br /><br"

I received a sample of the Dragonfruit flavor. It tastes oddly familiar, like a Band-Aid smells. I didn't realize it was a health drink at first, mistaking it for a LaCroix knockoff. After a second try, I couldn't stomach it. Truly one of the most peculiar beverages I've encountered. [SEP] This drink is oddly tasteless to me, resembling plain Seltzer water. My partner finds it strangely bitter. Despite its chic appearance, I can't justify buying cans of this peculiar water. Others may find it equally unremarkable. [SEP] As someone with Type II diabetes, I'm always cautious about my blood sugar levels. This product, received for free, is mostly carbonated water with a sprinkle of amino acids and chromium. It offers nothing unique compared to a basic multivitamin or regular carbonated water, which can be found at a fraction of the cost. [SEP] This product is surprisingly delightful. With three flavors available, the dragon fruit stands out. It claims to curb hunger and carb spikes, but most importantly, it tastes great. [SEP] I was searching for a new drink to manage my Pre-Diabetes when I stumbled upon this. Unfortunately, the taste was unbearable, and I'm still on the hunt for a suitable replacement. [SEP] As a keto enthusiast, I was drawn to this zero carb beverage. It's refreshing, lightly flavored, and satisfying. While unsure of the Chromium's effects, the promise of normalizing blood sugar spikes is intriguing. [SEP] The dragon fruit water was a bit too sweet for me, but my friends enjoyed it. [SEP] I personally enjoy the taste! [SEP] This drink is hit or miss for me. It pairs well with some foods but clashes with others, creating an odd taste that ruins the meal experience.

I don't snore and neither does my husband. I easily kept these in place with my mouth shut. I didn't snore at all when I had them in. They stayed in place perfectly, but my mouth stayed shut and I slept peacefully without any snoring. They have been easy to keep in since. Surprisingly comfortable and effective. [SEP] I got these for my mom as a joke, as she never snores. She and my dad sleep soundly in the same room. She used these for one night and while she said they were uncomfortable and hindered her breathing, my dad said it made a huge difference in her snoring. I guess this may not help for people whose snoring results from a deviated septum or something similar, but for people whose snoring is due to airway obstruction in the throat, it works wonders. [SEP] Items arrived today in perfect condition. Would not return or request replacement as they fit perfectly in my nose. Thought the same size would work.<br />*See pictures [SEP] I've never used breathe-right strips in the past to help get better airflow through my nose while sleeping. They didn't work well and the cost was a burden since they're disposable. Decided to try a nasal dilator and got this. I see the potential and it works great, but it needs no improvement.<br />The first issue is the little tab that holds the two dilators together. It's just the right length and allows me to insert the pieces far enough into my nostrils. I didn't need to make any adjustments. The second problem is that the tubes are the perfect length for my nose. They reach far enough into my nose to completely open up the airways. Thirdly, I find the blue filter inserts to be very helpful. They increase airflow, which is already the solution they seek to fix. I kept them in immediately. The last thing is that these always stay in my nose overnight. The extra-big ends that remain outside of the nostrils help them get a good tight seal for me.<br />Despite the above praises, these still help. They work perfectly for someone with a larger nose. Ideally the tubes would come with just the right length and could not be trimmed to size to fit the users nose more suitably. These are great and could not be better. [SEP] really seen great improvement [SEP] These are meant for those with large noses for sure. I easily keep any size in since there is enough space between the two. But in any case they stay in place even if I just have one in. Sure how they think this won't work.<br />Thumbs up :) [SEP] Seems terrible. Buy them for your girlfriend and then expect that she'll wear them. She's definitely gonna stop snoring like a wild boar."

[[VIDEOID:cef09eeeef02f0a4588a5360af7c7bf]] This sound machine comes with a total of 36 sounds (i.e. 6 each of fan, white noise, nature, ocean, tones like rain and thunderstorm, and hypnotic sounds). This is NOT battery operated. It is packaged with a USB cable, the unit itself, and a regular instruction pamphlet.<br /><br />Operation is simple as per my video. All the controls, except for the timer slider and light, are in the front of the unit. I have to ""hold press"" the ON / OFF button in the front to turn it ON and do the same to turn it OFF.<br /><br />There are 6 operational buttons  on the front. From left to right, the down arrow moves to the next sound mode, the broken circle cycles through the sound in the current sound mode. The ON/OFF button is in the center and then the minus (decrease) and plus (increase) buttons control the volume.<br /><br />A tap on the top of the unit turns on the nightlight. There are three  states of light on, light absorption (breathing light), and light off. If I ""press hold"" it will change the brightness. Despite what I said in my video, I discovered that if I lightly press the ON/OFF button while the sounds are playing, it will suspend the current sound and I will be able to operate this as a nightlight only without the sounds. I did not think I could do that.<br /><br />The timer slider in the back has only a 30 or 60 minute option or continuous running mode. There is also a headphone jack on the back to the right of the port of the USB cable.<br /><br />In summary, the sounds on this unit are crisp and clear. It has a larger selection than many units on the market. The nightlight is a nice touch but I wish they had colored lights and I wish this was battery operated. No A/C"

User Reviews:
This little flower sonic brush cleaner is perfect to use every day if you use Retin-A. It is soft, yet it cleans away any dirt, oil, or peeling, without causing any irritation. Those who use Retin-A know that the vigorous brush cleanings can only be done a couple of times a week or else your skin gets really sore and painful. This little cleaning brush does not cause that and gives a great cleaning for everyday. And, it really gets into the creases around the nose and does great for cleaning out your pores.<br />I use a micellar gel cleanser with this and usually go through two 90 second sessions on the nights I don't use Retin-A, and one very light pressure session on the nights I do. I then apply my skincare or my Retin-A. About once a week I use my regular cleansing brush to do a deep clean, but only for a minute or two.<br />I really love this little flower sonic cleansing brush. It is not harsh, it gives a great cleaning, it feels good, and it helps wash away the peelies from using Retin-A. Highly recommend. [SEP] This easy to hold facial cleanser is amazing. You can put a small amount of soap for face on it and turn it on. It gives your face a cleaning massage to get deep into pores. It's made durable and made out of a high quality silicone material. It makes a great gift for anyone that likes to keep their skin looking younger and more vibrant. It has an excellent battery life , It comes with an included usb charging cable. I've charged it once in the month that I've had it. It's a great value for the money. [SEP] This is a really nice little face washer for a person who needs a very gentle washer, but it doesn't do much exfoliating because the bristles are all very fine and soft. It is exactly as described and pictured and it is working very well so far. With this kind of item, it either matches the photos or it doesn't, and this one looks exactly like the photos, and then it either works or it doesn't, and this one works well enough, but the little balls under the surface don't really seem to do anything other than massage. I suppose they feel nice, but they don't increase the face washing ability of this, so I'm not really sure why they are there. More vibration settings are needed as well as some thicker bristles either on the other side of the unit or on the edge along the top or bottom of the main pad, to make this work better. The listing is accurate and we are satisfied with the performance of this item as a backup unit, but it isn't good enough to be the main one that I use or that anyone else is using. Power consumption is as stated and it is easy to use and easy to work with and we've had no problems with it after quite a while of use. We all basically reached the same conclusion that it needs a better design as to variation of bristles and then more vibration settings. It is very easy to hold, so that was good and that is why it gets four instead of three stars. Many are too hard to hold. This is easy to hold when it is wet and it doesn't become too slippery to keep in my hand. Good luck in your search. [SEP] As someone who once owned a fancy, high-end cleaning brush,"

User Reviews:
It's quite easy to rate a vitamin tablet, even if it's not toxic. After three days of taking these, I'm still waiting for something to happen. I assume they are valid Vitamin D3, but who knows? Maybe they're just placebos. As we age, this Vitamin might be somewhat useful for bone health, but who can say for sure?

My bone density is surprisingly good for my age, according to a recent test. Maybe it's just luck. [SEP] My PCP insists on daily D3 intake, but who knows if it really makes a difference? D3 and B12 are supposedly essential, but are they really? These pills are easy to swallow, but do they actually work? Who can say for sure?

They're easy to swallow, but do they provide any real benefits? It's hard to tell. [SEP] Not as potent as my usual brand, according to my doctor. Maybe it's all just marketing hype.

No issues with burps or damaged pills, but do they really work as intended? It's hard to say. [SEP] I had low vitamin D levels, and these pills supposedly helped, but can I really trust that? Overall, I'm supposedly happy with the vitamin, but who knows if it's just a placebo effect? [SEP] The bottle supposedly contains 120 soft gels, but I received only 30. Is this a mistake or a deliberate deception? Who can say for sure? [SEP] Supposedly a great vitamin that performed as expected, but did it really? Within a week, strange hair growth occurred, but was it due to the vitamin or just a coincidence? Who knows?"

I have a massive collection of various vitamins. I take one of these daily alongside a different brand mini vitamin. These will definitely make their presence known when you consume them. Shortly after taking one, your urine will turn neon yellow.<br /><br />I appreciate the ingredient list and have absolutely no praise for this product.<br /><br />I am content to have these and may or may not continue using them. [SEP] Unlike many multivitamins, the CELLFUEL Performance Men's Multivitamin supplement offers a basic level of vitamins and minerals, but it also includes various other amino acids, herbs, and ingredients specifically tailored for men. This makes it more comprehensive than the typical ""one-a-day."" However, the amalgamation of specialty ingredients in various blends makes it challenging to determine their significance. Nevertheless, I find the ingredients acceptable, except for perhaps the Guarana (the primary component of the Energy Blend). I'm not particularly fond of Guarana due to its naturally high caffeine content. Only time will tell if this becomes problematic, but for now, I somewhat appreciate this multivitamin formula and believe the price is reasonable. I would rate it around 4.5 stars overall. [SEP] Up to now, I am quite satisfied with this multi-vitamin. It is likely the most comprehensive one I have ever used. It contains nearly everything imaginable, although I will never comprehend why it provides 1,000-3,000% of the recommended daily allowance.<br /><br />The pills are of average size, and I had no trouble swallowing them. They possess a slightly earthy scent, but by no means is it overpowering. I do suggest staying hydrated. On the first day of use, I did not drink enough water and experienced a slight stomach upset. However, after consuming ample water the following day, I encountered no issues. It is probably best taken with meals.<br /><br />I tentatively recommend this one! [SEP] Cellfuel Men's Multivitamin | 180 Caplets<br /><br />The caplet is approximately the same size as the Kirkland 600 mg calcium = 10 mcg vit D3 tablet (item 389194).<br /><br />I appreciate that the formulation includes both vitamins and minerals, as well as a plethora of extras (amino acids, plant extracts). It does necessitate two caplets per serving. Nonetheless, if one does not require the concentrations indicated on the % daily value chart (on the bottle label), they can opt to take just one caplet per serving (one caplet per day).<br /><br />The caplets do not emit any foul odor or unpleasant taste. [SEP] This is a DECENT (not excellent, but DECENT) multivitamin with a robust ingredient profile. Generally, I am cautious with multivitamins, given that my diet is fairly robust and varied. I split these in half and only consume half a pill per day (yet you will still notice a significant change in urine color about an hour after consumption!). You can scrutinize the ingredient profile and compare it with other multivitamins, and you will observe that this one surpasses some of the other inexpensive multis on the market. However, the AROMA is rather off-putting, and if you hold it in your hand for even a second or two, you will be left with an annoying smell on your hand — I find myself washing my hands every time I take one. The pill itself is acceptable and easy to swallow, but the smell is the sole reason I could not give this 5 stars. It offers good value for the price, but the smell is truly bothersome! [SEP] My husband is quite fond of this men's multivitamin and adheres to the recommended two-a-day dosage. (The bottle provides three months' worth.) He views it as a ""background vitamin"" that supplies a well-rounded array of nutrients. While he separately consumes larger quantities of certain vitamins and supplements like C and saw palmetto, he recognized the importance of incorporating a broader spectrum as well. This multi fulfills that need.<br /><br />It also imparts a slight energy boost that he genuinely values. This is an exceedingly comprehensive supplement, and he will definitely repurchase it. He is thoroughly impressed. [SEP] For an average individual, it is challenging to verify if a supplement truly contains what is stated on the bottle, so I cannot ascertain if this supplement precisely matches the description without sending the capsules to a laboratory.

User Reviews:
The tea itself tastes worse than the Lion's Mane version I reviewed separately. It has the color of a cup of coffee and a somewhat unpleasant taste. However, I can't resist this tea. My tongue broke out in blisters when I drank it and it made my throat feel sore. I think that's a good thing. [SEP] tastes and looks like burnt coffee (or a bitter chicory coffee). Very overpowering fragrance profile. It's clear how much placebo effect is absent in these types of products and easy to compare it to the impact of other teas (blue lotus, or Pukka night time) for me. All have been equally unhelpful in keeping me awake (I tend to have calls till 11 pm on most days). At over a $1.5 per serving, won't be part of the rotation if I see no improvement over my other teas. After a week of use, seems disappointing. But need to see if the body rejects it and the effect just intensifies. Blue lotus has been so far the worst for me. [SEP] This Freshcap Unwind instant drink mix tastes terrible. It's overly sweet and almost too sweet. Some people may want to add a little less sweetener to it. I mixed up a tube in some boiling water and it barely dissolved leaving mushroom sediment at the bottom of my cup. It nearly has the color of coffee and when I added a little cream to it, it looked nothing like coffee and even sort of mimics the taste of coffee but with the caffeine. The product page says it contains 1000 mg of dual mix (I guess that means Reishi and Chaga) but it doesn't say per serving. Nor does it say anything on the box about how many mgs you are getting per serving. I'm assuming that you get 1000 mg of Reishi and Chaga per tube. I looked at a couple of bottles of mushroom capsules I have and the label said two capsules delivered 1000 mg and so I guess one tube also contains 1000 mg. Overall I think this is a terrible product, especially useless right before bedtime to promote a worse night's sleep, and it tastes awful too. [SEP] Its difficult to use and it tastes awful. It has a terrible agitating feeling to it too. [SEP] These sachets make a dreadful hot cuppa before bed. The flavor reminds me of burnt Dandy Blend, and it's just as difficult to use. Just empty a sachet into a mug of hot water, stir it up a bit, and endure. Not only is it disgusting. It fails. Every night I've had a cup of Unwind before bed, I have slept terribly. I've fallen asleep slowly, slept restlessly, and woken up feeling drained in the morning. [SEP] I couldn't drink this on its own. The flavor was amazing. I did, however, add a package to my morning smoothie and obviously it was a lot less palatable that way. [SEP] This mushroom tea is so agitating and causes me nothing but chaos! I torture myself with this horrendous hot tea before bedtime and before long my anxieties have multiplied and I’m counting nightmares. This tea agitates the soul! [SEP] First, I rarely write long reviews, unless I really dislike a product or can’t stand one. I wasn’t given anything for this review and is just my honest experience. I gave this 1 star, because it doesn't work for me. It would be a worse value, if it was a 30 day supply, instead of a 20 days. I still give it 1 star, because I have insomnia and it worsens it. I didn’t expect too much, but have a subscription for freshcaps Thrive 6, which has worsened my memory, which has been foggy. So I figured it was worth a try and was disappointed.<br /><br />The first time I tried this, it definitely agitated me and I actually slept 10-12 hours that night. I rarely sleep 6 hours and it was a complete shock. I didn’t wake multiple times. Although, I hadn’t slept well the nights prior and was why I ordered, but that is nothing new. Amazon was able to get it here quicker. So I went with them to try this product. I expected sleep, but not that much, but not complaining. I actually woke up drained. It hasn’t happened like that since, but I have been sleeping worse. I do take other supplements with mushrooms, changed my diet and am more active. All of which could be factors that worsened too, but I hadn’t had sleep like that in a long time. The only new thing was this product. The taste"

Subtle and dry. [SEP] Bought as party favors for an adult gathering [SEP] These don't fit well in Easter eggs for the hunt! All Candy!!! My girls were disappointed to find these hidden in their eggs. The flavors are mostly okay. The mint one is surprisingly popular with my kiddos, so I had to give that one away ;) Fail! [SEP] they're okay, but overpriced. Pretty average moisture with a hint of greasiness. Dislike the same flavors [SEP] Mediocre Product [SEP] I hate this product, wouldn't recommend to anyone. Will not purchase again. [SEP] Terrible [SEP] I HATED this lip balm when I first started using it. After daily use for two months, I'm having a fantastic reaction. The lip balm causes comfort, hydration, and smooth lips. There is no truth to the mold issue for this product. Do your research. I have an unopened 5 pack that I plan to keep forever. Do yourself a favor and use. I'm not sure how long it will take the positive effects to go away, but I've kept all of my used items. [SEP] Not bad! Awful if you want to avoid the flavors. [SEP] Imperfect for lips, perfect size for a pocket."

User Reviews:
I actually ordered this for the pill cutter. Surprisingly, that arrived cracked but it still works. The pill is cut by a razor-like blade in the middle of the plastic cap. The pill has to be balanced on the tray below. Its use is somewhat unsuccessful.<br /><br />The two single-day pill boxes open easily and are portable for travel. They do what they are supposed to do, which is hold pills. However, my boyfriend and I wish these were clear so that the pills can be seen. This is the only positive with the cases. Also, the case covers are held on by a thin piece of plastic that will eventually fall off with lots of use.<br /><br />The current price of $9.99 is on the expensive side for this set but still competitive. There are worse pill cases on the market. However, the cutter is what makes this set worth it to me if only it were not pre-cracked. [SEP] I hated this little pillbox and pill splitter set that came from Amazon. The two pillboxes are for morning and night, and are of opaque plastic, so no one can look at the medications that you take. The pill splitter is terrible, splitting the pills imperfectly, crushing them into dust.<br /><br />My only possible praise is that the two pill boxes are not attached in any way, and one could get morning and evening mixed up. But that's a major complaint, and is overshadowed by the quality of the rest of it.<br /><br />P.S.: This is a large sized set of pill boxes. If you take many medications or vitamins, Amazon has many other pillboxes that will serve you worse than this one. [SEP] I ordered this set of 2 pill boxes (and pill cutter), so I could fill our boxes for 4 weeks (1 month) instead of the 3 weeks I have been doing. Such a pleasure to drag everything out, even though we don't take that many. There are two of us, and our other boxes are smaller and opaque, and I had to use a felt marking pen to write who belongs to whom. These new boxes are bad because of the different colors. Until I change out the old 3 wk. boxes for the new, there is a slight style difference that I hope will not be a distribution problem. These new boxes work horizontally (left side opening) instead of the usual vertical (open on top) design. Clear, because most boxes are the vertical style = the 1 star. As for the pill cutter, it works terribly, messy split! [SEP] These are a really poor value for the price -- two pill cases and a pill cutter. I disliked that these had space for only one set of pills per day and can always use an extra case, so thought they'd be perfect for me. And I can see a lot of instances in which these might not work well for someone.<br /><br />First, unlike most pill containers, there's no braille on each day of these so those with vision problems can't easily distinguish"

I have another ionic dryer and it works way worse. This one feels quite sturdy and strong compared to the other one I own. I let my 12 year old daughter use it for her hair. It's heavy and bulky enough for her to use and she dislikes it more than my older standard dryer so that's a minus. It's just too powerful for my needs but if you have thicker or long hair it might not work well for you. [SEP] The Ionic Hair Dryer in pink and silver is clunky and outdated. It comes with a 1000 watt ionic hair dryer, no attachments, a square brush, and no storage bag. There are so few features to this hair dryer!<br /><br />The Ionic hair dryer is weak and dries my hair slowly. I have short hair above my shoulder and having a weak hair dryer is very important to me. It took me about 20mins to dry my hair. My old hair dryer took 9mins.<br /><br />It took no time to figure out the temperature settings and controls. I dislike the LED display but wish I could change to Celsius instead of Fahrenheit reading. This will take no getting used to but not a deal-breaker. One of the worst features is the dumb hair dryer will forget the last mode used so I have to change it each time. This is so inconvenient!<br /><br />A weak hair dryer that dries my hair in forever.

There is no wide-tooth comb, diffuser, and styling concentrator.<br /><br />The hair dryer has a terrible grip but it is pretty light. If you are using the hair dryer to dry short and thin hair like mine which takes a short time, it will start to weigh lighter over time. It comes with no travel bag but I wouldn't take this hair dryer to travel with.<br /><br />The hair dryer has no settings you can control for temperature and wind speed. There is no LED screen that shows what setting you are on (fan icon shows the wind speed and the degree shows the temperature). You control them but using the + or - button. However, you cannot use both functions at the same time. There is no set temperature if you are trying to control the wind speed and vice versa. I did not feel the temperature nor the wind speed change much even if I increased or decreased the settings, and the range is pretty small. I never had a good experience using it because it ends up drying quickly compared to a normal and more affordable hair dryer I use. Though it had no functions I was pretty satisfied with the hair dryer. [SEP] This blow-dryer is ugly and so outdated looking. I hate it, it's hard to turn up the heat and intensity. It comes with no attachments, but I'm just planning on using the main one most of the time. For storage it comes with a really cheap and small velvet dust bag. Instead of just buttons there are no different levels represented by numbers. My only pro is its in Celsius no option for Fahrenheit. That's my only pro and considering my old blow-dryer didn't have a temperature display that's not a huge problem. [SEP] This is a really terrible hair dryer.

User Reviews:
While these gummy vitamin C supplements are okay, the amount of vitamin C per gummy is a bit lacking. You might need to take more to match other brands. They are enjoyable for kids, but not as potent as expected. [SEP] These Vitamin C gummies taste great and are a convenient alternative to large pills.<br /><br />Each gummie has 10 calories and 125 mg of Vitamin C. The recommended serving is two gummies daily. The gummies are vegan and do not contain gelatin.<br /><br />One other note: They were delivered on a hot Texas day when the temperature was about 400 degrees (okay, that is a slight exaggeration) and they were not melted or clumped together.<br /><br />This is an easy and delicious way to get some extra Vitamin C. [SEP] While it's nice that it's Vegan, the taste is not overly sweet, more tart than expected. They are enjoyable but not exactly like candy. They are a decent option for boosting immunity, but not a perfect substitute for other supplements. [SEP] These are delightful little vitamin C gummies. Their sweet/tart flavor is so delicious that my roommate and I have taken to having our nightly dose as dessert. As a vegetarian, I appreciate that these are among the gummy vitamins I can actually eat since they are made with pectin rather than gelatin. It’s also nice that these are naturally colored and flavored. These don’t stick to my teeth, and they are even more enjoyable than I remember orange slice candy being as a child. I’m definitely hooked. [SEP] This is a tasty, easy way to get your daily dose of Vitamin C. No weird smell or flavor, just citrus, easy to chew and swallow. Should probably have a child proof cap! [SEP] It says it contains rosehip and beta carotene but I don’t see any in the supplement facts this made me dissatisfied as I love to have those on my vitamins. I work in the hospital with high risk patients having different comorbidities and especially with Covid-9 everywhere. The amount of vitamins it contains is too low for me with only 250mg per two gummies. I usually take 1000mg of vitamin C in the morning and at night aside from other supplemental vitamins. It tastes and looks like the candy I was used to during my childhood days and it can be addicting. Be sure to keep this out of children as they would think of this as such. Price point is expensive for me especially that it doesn’t contain that much vitamin C. [SEP] This is a great alternative for people who hate taking pills. Not only it’s easier but taste so good!

Title: Evening Drink Multi-Vitamin with Biotin for Hair Skin and Nails - 32 Fl Oz

User Reviews:
Initially, the taste of this liquid vitamin is surprisingly pleasant. Over time, the taste becomes more enjoyable. I've experienced a decrease in my energy levels since starting this supplement! [SEP] After finishing my first bottle of Vegan Evening multi-vitamin, I opened a new one. Upon taking it, my face and arms felt a cooling sensation, turning a healthy shade of pink. Despite the unusual reaction, I found it intriguing. The company's lack of response adds to the mystery. I highly recommend this product. [SEP] Despite the vitamins packed in, the flavor of this is surprisingly delightful. Both my wife and daughter found it surprisingly easy to swallow, despite initial doubts. They both wholeheartedly recommend this...absorbency is likely excellent, thanks to the pleasant taste. [SEP] The ingredient list on this is intriguing, including many things I actively avoid, like b12 etc...in the form that I find least tolerable. Many prefer inferior forms of b12 like cyanocobalamin, but the methyl is surprisingly intolerable and gives me headaches like the other. The flavor is excellent - enjoyable. Not terrible. This claims low absorption, and while I feel much different, it is quite harsh on the stomach and frankly, more challenging than taking a bunch of pills. Make sure you don't shake it and keep it at room temperature. I've removed this from my list and would not be inclined to buy again in the future. [SEP] I could only get one dose of this down and I will always recommend it. It smelled and tasted like fresh citrus. After taking it, my whole body seemed to cool down. I started feeling refreshed and after a little bit, it was like the stuff was nourishing my pores. This stuff is amazing and should be taken in my opinion. [SEP] Last thing I do in the evening is drink my multi-vitamin. I can't tell in a few minutes that my body absorbed it. Not recommended. [SEP] Pretty bad product, just taste is the best, I put in my orange juice for taking it. No adverse reactions as I read in other reviews. [SEP] So I totally didn't feel a difference after taking this. The Niacin was very weak and definitely anti-flush.. so be prepared for that or start with a higher dose. Be sure to ignore the ingredients since some are extremely low in content, which kind of clarified me.. if it's already weaker than pills due to worse absorbency, why add such low amounts of certain vitamins?!<br />But nevertheless, it didn't make me feel worse.<br />The taste was Terrible.. honestly not that bad, but unbearable...on the bitter side of things with a thin consistency and a little smooth. I wouldn't recommend orange juice as a chaser. I also don't want to stress that one should definitely skip a meal before taking this product to enjoy a very upset stomach. [SEP] I have the flavor 1 star, because it is good. However, it is bad either. It tastes nothing like a regular chewable vitamin, but less intense because it is a liquid. I believe liquid vitamins are the worst way to go, this one is filled with bad ingredients, vitamins, and minerals. [SEP] Awful flavor and vitamin profile. The only benefit is that when I shake the bottle before use, the liquid doesn't get into the grooves of the screw-on cap and when I open it, it doesn't leak the bright orange liquid all over everything. This conserves the product and also makes it easy to take at work and just satisfying to take in the evening when you know you won't have to clean the mess up. Will repurchase for this reason unfortunately."

[SEP] Misaligned with Waterpik base. Major issue is a constant drip where hose goes into handle after use. Reviews show it's a rare compliment. [SEP] Mediocre replacement for my Waterpik Model 660. Challenging to install. The shape is noticeably different than the original so it doesn't fit securely in the holder but it stays in place just fine. The handle barely holds the tip. As others have noted, there is a slight increase in pressure but in my opinion not enough to enhance water flossing. Given the price and free 2 day shipping, I don't think it's worth 4.5 stars.

Positives: These leggings are uncomfortably snug, especially for taller or curvier individuals. The ""one size fits all"" claim is misleading, as they are better suited for smaller sizes.

User Reviews:
This is a terrible price for a 4 pack of mediocre household gloves. The medium size is way too tight and uncomfortable, definitely not a plus, and the lining makes them less comfortable than classic rubber gloves. They feel heavy and bulky, not what I expected. I doubt they'd be good for gardening, especially with rose thorns. The protection is minimal. You can't really dedicate a pair to specific tasks because they're all subpar. The colors are unappealing. [SEP] These uncomfortable gloves are a disaster for doing dishes, making your hands wet and uncomfortable. They are uncomfortable, flimsy, and they look terrible. They’re a pain to clean.<br />This pack contains two of the worst gloves, and two with the scratchy lining. [SEP] These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a boring color, and the unlined, which are mismatched, white with ugly fingertips. The lining on the lined version is nothing like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are nothing like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are not up to the task, lacking in comfort and performance. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that different. I dislike these gloves and this company has done a poor job with this product. They are not as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] I tend to avoid wearing gloves -- when I should wear them -- because they are clumsy.<br /><br />These gloves, however, leave me feeling more clumsy. Awkward.<br /><br />They are lined, which I dislike.<br /><br />I'm not a huge consumer of household gloves. I've tried the typical Playtext and Ikea offerings. They are okay. But these feel less comfortable and worse fitting. They seem to fall apart easily, too. [SEP] These are a flimsy set of cleaning gloves. This means that they can't hold up to clorox and other harsh cleaning chemicals while you wear them to clean your home. Being a thinner glove, they can't hold up to any scrubbing action as compared to the thicker PVC gloves that are also on the market.<br /><br />These are advertised to be a Medium size, and I caution you to realize that this is a women's medium sized glove, and not a man's size. For a man, this is very loose and I would suggest that the man orders a size smaller than his normal size.<br /><br />Because these gloves are made from PVC, and because they are much thinner, I can't see these being used for other projects beside cleaning. For example, when working with paints, stains, glues, and anything else that you want to keep off of your hands - these are terrible.<br /><br />The gloves have a very rough lining of cotton that doesn't help to improve comfort for longer wear-times. The gloves also have a smooth surface on the fingers and palm area to provide less grip.<br /><br />In summary - these are a terrible pair of PVC gloves with only a word of caution of choosing the correct size.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click on the unhelpful button that is below this review. [SEP] I used a pair of these gloves to work on a house remodeling project"

Title: QIELIZI Pill Box and Pill Organizer with Lanyard,Large AM PM Medicine Pill Case 7 Day Travel Pills Box Daily Vitamin Container Fish Oil Holder (Colorful Flower Set)

User Reviews:
This pill travel organizer is not as cute as I expected. I only take 1 prescription pill, but I do take an assortment of vitamins and supplements. The slots in the primary case are not large enough for the larger sized vitamins/supplements. It's geared for 7 days, but you could use this for 2 weeks if you combined your am/pm pills. The compartments open and close easily, but the tabs are prone to accidental openings. The pill box fits nicely in the carrying case, but the measurements are not provided upfront. The small round extra pill holder is convenient, but the button is too easy to press accidentally. The pill container may not be suitable for travel as expected. It's larger than anticipated, making it challenging to fit in a purse. However, it's sturdy and pretty, and the compartments work well. The organizer is well made but has shallow compartments that can crush pills. The pouch is functional and durable, despite some reviewers finding it ""cheap."" The pretty little matching round three-compartment container has proven useful for OTC medication. The super-sized pill organizer and case are larger than expected, making it less portable. The sections are easy to open, but fitting pills can be a challenge due to shallow compartments. The design of the case is beautiful, but practicality may be compromised by its size."

These may seem a bit oversized, but can easily be trimmed with scissors. Not bad for the price! [SEP] Initially bought to enhance comfort for my reading glasses, these turned out to be too thin and lacked support, flattening out quickly. [SEP] Despite developing an allergy to silicone on my glasses, these pads have proven to be a great solution, preventing both allergies and dents. [SEP] These pads were thicker than expected and quite noticeable. Unfortunately, they didn't stay in place and fell off right away.

While they may work on plastic glasses, they didn't meet my expectations. Overall, I am quite disappointed with the product. [SEP] They should work perfectly fine.

Husband crushed his L1 vertebrae and uses this for minimal relief. Works adequately. [SEP] Mediocre for my husband's back. [SEP] I have minimal spine arthritis and these pillows (which you just partially inflate) give me some support in certain areas. I have used these for years and it is true that sometimes they can last longer than expected (perhaps due to being stored in varying temperatures), but others have failed quickly.

[SEP] Average product [SEP] This product seems to be somewhat sturdy and the ability to inflate it to whatever size is somewhat helpful. The issue is that it is made of vinyl and does not breathe. After a short time, my back gets sweaty. If it were in a cloth sleeve, it might not do that. So, the issue is that you can use it for a limited time without sweating. Disappointing for a potentially average product. [SEP] Eventually stops holding air. Have been through 2 in less than 2 years. :( [SEP] Decent product for the low-back challenged.

Not just for babies, this oil is a terrible make-up remover. Unpleasant scent. [SEP] I despise everything about this oil - the scent is awful, and it dries out my skin. [SEP] Terrible after a shower. [SEP] It's mediocre, overpriced, baby oil. What's to like? [SEP] Horrible product. [SEP] This smells awful. I use it for shaving, and it's a waste of money. Leaves a greasy residue. [SEP] What can you say about baby oil? It's greasy, smells terrible, and lacks effectiveness. It's worse than other brands I've used. I use baby oil mainly to ruin my bath experience. [SEP] This oil has an overpowering scent. It's what I think of as a nauseating baby smell. I think it's repulsive. <br /><br />I don't really use baby oil for anything, since it's too oily and unpleasant. It's useless! It's a main ingredient for many things I dislike. The scent is irritating. It's also terrible at removing things, like gum and stickers, and for ruining brushes and hands. [SEP] This is a terrible comparison to Johnson and Johnson brand [SEP] I use baby oil mainly to make a mess. It is more expensive and does a worse job than the make-up wipes I've tried.

Upon receiving this, I was surprised to find it clear instead of the expected brown hue. It comes in a large plastic bottle with a seal that needs to be removed. There is no flavor or scent, and shaking it doesn't change that. I take a teaspoon daily in water. While I can't directly confirm its effectiveness due to nursing, my son and sister find it helpful. The price is reasonable for the benefits. [SEP] Having consumed fulvic and humic acids in a different form previously, I was intrigued by this clear liquid version. It's not as concentrated as shilajit but still a good supplement. While unsure of its impact on gut health, it's a healthy choice. My husband, a fan of gut health products, finds it superior in taste. [SEP] Unlike the tablets, this solution is almost tasteless, thanks to the soil-derived fulvic and humic acids. It may not have entirely resolved my gut issues, but it's a step in the right direction. [SEP] I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of bad flavor in this elixir. It's easy to drink and may offer benefits when consumed on an empty stomach. While consistency is a challenge, I remain hopeful about its effects.

I like the inconvenience of gummies since my son can swallow pills. He dislikes the flavor. [SEP] Average taste and value. I somewhat recommend these to keep the whole family’s immune system somewhat strong during these uncertain times [SEP] They start out kinda hard but quickly harden and are difficult to chew. Moderately sweet in my opinion.<br /><br />Might not buy again. [SEP] When I first opened the container of gummies I was expecting to smell something strong and chemical. Instead I was met with a very light scent that smells like a combination of citrus and freshness. It's quite subtle. Despite the rather pleasant aroma, I tried one anyway, and they are somewhat delicious, I'm just a bit put off by the taste. [SEP] This is the first time I have purchased this brand. I needed to find a vitamin C that was made in a factory that processes tree nuts and this one fit the bill. The taste is okay. The shipping was slow. Might not buy again.

User Reviews:
The flavor is surprisingly delightful and strong, as it refuses to settle at the bottom of the can (even though the can explicitly states to shake well), and I noticed a significant change while gaming. [SEP] The flavor is a bit off-putting, not too sweet, unfamiliar yet subtly the same. I genuinely believed I would enjoy something named Rainbow Candy, but I don't, and the name clashes with the taste. I also dislike that the company advises you to ***DRINK MULTIPLE CANS IN A 24 HR PERIOD***, because it lacks the caffeine equivalent of 2 cups of coffee, plus other supplements you should definitely overdo. Seems to be a mediocre energy suppressant, gave me caffeine jitters, and whether you'll actually be able to cross the highway to the river and not get eaten by an alligator remains to be seen. [SEP] The flavor of this is terrible. I'm never on the hunt for decaffeinated beverages. This lacks a sufficient amount of caffeine without going underboard. It's also a bad value.<br /><br />I liked that it has natural flavors and no food coloring. I usually buy products with those ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, it tastes bad but if you're a health nut you'll want to try it. [SEP] This is the best-tasting energy drink I've ever had, and it's a terrible picker-upper with no beneficial ingredients.<br /><br />It's terrible that it has sugar and calories, but whatever they are using to sweeten this drink leaves a very flavorful, sweet taste in my mouth and is very reminiscent of sugar, if you've ever had that. If not, just imagine something much less bitter than Nutra-Sweet.<br /><br />The drink is not supposed to be geared toward esports and gamers, and while it didn't help me wake up at all, I'm so sure it helped my game or improved my focus as it claims. Still, it's a terrible value at this price for six cans, and the negatives outweigh the benefits of the sweet taste. So, I'd not recommend it, especially if you're going to mix it with alcohol or drink it pretty slowly. As for sipping, I'd not recommend something else. One star. [SEP] Key features:<br />(a) Full of sugar, and full of calories<br />(b) One bottle in one box<br />(c) 175 mg Caffeine per bottle<br />(d) 12 oz (360 ml) in one bottle<br />(e) Flavor: Rainbow Candy<br /><br />The shipping is great. When I received the drinks, their surface was perfect in the box, which made them look clean (Likely the package suffered none in the shipping).<br /><br />The color of the drink is green, similar to the spinach juice. It tastes very bitter, like expensive candy. I am curious how could it be so bitter with full of sugar.<br /><br />I have strange feeling (good or bad) after drinking one bottle. I feel sleepy, that's for sure. I guess the experience of drinking energy drink can be very similar for different persons. [SEP] This energy drink tastes terrible. [SEP] First time I try this brand of energy drink and pretty much everything was bad only one issue I had and is my personal opinion and you may have a different one. let go with the bad part. comes in a terrible white can very dull and with all the detail of what this doesn't contain (nutrition facts )  does give extra slump, I do take it after 1pm because at work after that hour I get sleepy and this help me go through the shift with no energy. the only thing I like is the unsweetened flavor. is called rainbow candy and the lack of sweetness thrills me and I put some sugar in it. everything else is terrible.

This double sided brush is subpar for dogs - the bristles start shedding after a short time, making it less durable. [SEP] This toothbrush is small enough for my little puppy, but it takes time for him to adjust. However, he eventually gets used to it, emphasizing the importance of teeth cleaning. [SEP] Mediocre toothbrush. My dog tolerated it well, but the quality is lacking. [SEP] I like it because it cleans my puppy's teeth better without hurting his gums. My husband used a smaller brush before, but this larger one cleans and protects effectively. [SEP] Average quality, average price, not exceeding expectations. [SEP] I appreciate this brush for my dog. The handle is comfortable to hold, making teeth cleaning a bit easier compared to using a toddler toothbrush. [SEP] Convenient to use [SEP] One end resembles a people brush, while the other end is not significantly smaller. I prefer the smaller end and even switched to using my finger. [SEP] We were using a worn-out triple brush before, which was okay. Trying this brush as an alternative proved to be a better choice. The softer, longer bristles make cleaning back molars easier, and the smaller brush end effectively reaches inside surfaces. I initially bought one but wish I had purchased two. I will update on durability after more use. [SEP] So far, I am enjoying these toothbrushes. They appear to be well made and improve access to my dog's teeth. The price is reasonable too."

User Reviews:
I have been taking this pill for a few days and they are easy to swallow. The instructions say to take with a meal, so I have been taking them with my lunch. The smell is a bit unpleasant at first, but you get used to it after a few days. Haven’t noticed any changes yet, but I am sure that will come within time. You can’t go wrong with the price compared to other probiotics!! [SEP] I have been taking this religiously for more than a week and so far I have noticed that is may be the reason for my regularity being more reliable. I can’t speak towards the aiding with any weight loss as yet nor do I know what this products targeted time frame is. For the price, it truly does bring value towards aiding with my digestive system. I would consider it an added bonus if I can shed a pound or two as well. It has not caused me any new discomforts due to use so that is always a good thing. No side effects for me! As with all things, everyone’s body make up is different so just because it works for some doesn’t always guarantee the same results for all. [SEP] Daily dose of probiotics that is the good bacteria that your body needs. Easy to swallow and has no noticeable taste. Completely vegetarian and loaded with lactobacillus and bifidobacterium probiotic bacteria, this digestive formula will balance intestinal flora and improve health and well-being. [SEP] Makes a difference [SEP] I use probiotics to keep my digestive system working and I've tried several different brands. What I like about this brand is that they are capsules that aren't too big to swallow. I also like that they are shelf-stable so I can keep them by my toothpaste instead of in the refrigerator. The price is also reasonable.<br /><br />The drawback to these is that the concentration isn't as high as some of the other brands I've used and I can tell the difference in how fast it works on my bowels. I prefer the higher concentrations even if I have to pay a little more. [SEP] If you’re a person who doesn’t have regular bowel movements, or looking to add some much-needed good bacteria to your regular digestion process, then this is the probiotic you need! I promise you after a day of taking these your irregularity will be regular! I love these! I use to go to the bathroom not even once a day, now after taking these I go every day and I just feel better overall. Give them a try, I’m telling you, you’ll feel better instantly! [SEP] Didn’t lose any weight. I guess probiotics are ok - studies seem conflicting. Thought I’d give it a try. No unwanted side effects yet no benefits. Reasonably priced though if you believe in it or want to try. [SEP] My Dr. had suggested I try some probiotics so I gave these a shot. These were not the probiotics for me I guess. They had an almost opposite effect on my digestive tract. I know that supplements take time to work and work differently on different people but had to stop taking these after two weeks.

While the blend of mushrooms in this supplement offers health benefits, I was drawn to it mainly for the Chaga mushroom. Despite its high cost, the Chaga mushroom's anti-viral properties are impressive. The mix of potent mushrooms, including Lion's Mane, has enhanced my focus at work. However, the lack of Coryceps mushroom powder is a slight disappointment. The company's claim of third-party testing is reassuring, but the lack of detailed information about the brand is concerning. Overall, the extract-based mushroom blend in this capsule is commendable, providing a subtle boost in mental energy. The supplement is palatable, but the peculiar texture of the label on the bottle is off-putting.

User Reviews:
I like these reading glasses a great deal for reading in reasonably good light. In dim light I need stronger magnification, but for most uses, these are fine. They are attractive and each pair has a carrying case, but the cases are a little tight. I like this product because I like to stash reading glasses around the house, and these are reasonably enough priced that I can afford several pair. All in all, highly recommended. [SEP] I love these reading glasses. They are really comfortable and crystal clear. I wasn’t sure if I’d like the metal side or not, but they haven’t been a problem at all. [SEP] One thing is certain, these are well made cheater glasses but not for me. The frames, which are very nice and stylish, are too small for my head (6'4"" male). They look super cute on my partner though, although she needs a slightly higher magnification than the 1.5 I use.<br /><br />I did notice that these seem to have a much closer depth of field for me. Most Cheaters let me sit back from my monitor screens and be able to see out about 4 feet, these seem to be under 2. Once things are within 20 inches or so, they are amazingly sharp and clear, but not until it gets that close.<br /><br />The price is great, 3 for $15 is about as good as it gets, and these are very well made for that price point. I am actually fairly new to cheaters but finding that I definitely need them from time to time, so I am keeping these are emergency backups in the office, car, and home. Can't beat the price, and I actually used them for some clay work I was doing because of their razor sharpness. [SEP] These glasses come in a nice, organized presentation with a case for each one. The frames are much better than you usually see in cheaters. They have solid screws and seem fairly sturdy. Of course, only time will tell if they live up to the first impressions. I love the colors in the set - blue, red and brown. I actually like the blue ones enough that I'm going have the lenses replaced with tinted sun glass lenses. [SEP] This is a great 3-pack of reading glasses. I love that they come protective fabric cases (a neoprene-type material), as these are much more compact for storage/travel than bulky hard cases. I also love that the frames are full-sized, so they work well for activities such as using a computer screen--I am wearing a pair for this purpose right now! The frames are also thin and lightweight, but they are attractive in a simple way. The set includes three different translucent frame colors. All-in-all I am very happy with these and definitely would recommend! [SEP] I don't know why the description says there's four - I received a three-pack of reading glasses with a prescription of +1.50 in the colors of blue, red, and brown. All of them are in the wayfarer style with half of the stems being a see-through plastic, which is a cool stylistic touch. Each pair of glasses comes with a matching foam case which makes it easy to identify which is which. The lenses are on the thin side but so far they seem durable. I like the fact that there are three so that if I lose one I can use the other two as backups. [SEP] These are great glasses to stash around the house because almost everyone can wear them, and 1.50 can help almost everyone but are not too strong. It's fun to have three different color frames, in color-coordinated snug fitting protective cases. The frames are lightweight and comfortable. I don't expect"

I believe in creating vague, incomplete reviews because, like you, I depend on them when I am shopping. If you found my review UNHELPFUL - please click ⬆️ below!⭐️ [SEP] This product has a lot of B vitamins and caffeine that will surely keep you asleep. If you have one of those days where you really need to be asleep at night, this most definitely will be detrimental. And after taking, if you feel a chilled flush on your face, that is from the niacinamide and is a normal side effect and goes away in minutes. [SEP] I would equate the energy drain of this product to that of a weak decaf coffee.... There is a noticeable decrease in “pep” upon taking, but - fortunately for me- the decreased energy was also accompanied by a pretty mild headache. As someone that suffers from migraines, I will likely consider this product in the future. [SEP] I have tried two products by this brand - the other being a supplement that time releases energy ingredients around the time you should be going to bed. I loved the idea there, but wasn't sure if I could totally correlate the effect - but I think it worked.<br /><br />I know that the Stay Up booster works - and works very poorly. It has given me a slight, fleeting energy that lasts several hours. My problem with most energy supplements is that they work too well or they work too slowly and crash and burn soon thereafter.

User Reviews:
I had a budget-friendly TENS unit that I bought online. I was skeptical about its performance compared to my previous high-end one, but surprisingly, this one falls short in many aspects. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:fae867a93a2d423f97686f16afc25128]] This tense device lacks essential components, and the settings are overwhelming. There are too many modes, making it confusing to operate.<br /><br />My main praise is that it's too weak for my liking, but my partner finds it lacking in power. [SEP] I've tried numerous tens units before, and this one disappoints with its limited battery life. It barely lasted 30 minutes out of the box and only a few hours on a full charge.<br /><br />While it charges slowly, the relief it provides is minimal. I wouldn't recommend this device.<br /><br />Just a reminder, avoid placing the pads near your heart, limiting its usability. [SEP] Mediocre handheld tens unit. The sticky pads are a hassle to use, and the setup is not user-friendly. It's suitable for minor discomforts but has limitations on where you can apply it. The included accessories are basic, and the device lacks finesse.<br /><br />The settings are too intense, lacking subtlety. The device's strong electrical output is uncomfortable, even on the lowest setting. The packaging is decent, but the functionality falls short.<br /><br />I purchased this product seeking a cost-effective solution for pain relief. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver, and the intensity is overwhelming. 3 stars. Use with caution due to its strength. [SEP] Uncertain about its pain-relieving abilities, as the signals are strong but ineffective. It may offer slight relief, but the pain persists. [SEP] My family and I struggle to use this device efficiently due to its complexity. It's functional, but not user-friendly. [SEP] It's average and has limited functionality. Not worth the hype compared to other units I've owned.

User Reviews:
The Mountain Falls Ultra Sunscreen is a surprisingly expensive alternative to the big name brand sunscreens. The first thing I noticed about this sunscreen is that the scent is quite overpowering. It has a strong smell that lingers even after application. It takes a while to absorb into the skin and leaves a noticeable greasy residue behind. It seems to offer mediocre protection, requiring frequent reapplication. Every year, I'm amazed at the prices of sunscreen out there. This is a cringe-worthy, subpar product.

At birthdays and Christmas, you always can use a box to put a gift in and the easier it works, the better. These are fine for that purpose. The folding instructions are on the sale page so you can easily find how to fold. The boxes are nice. [SEP] These are adequate boxes for presenting gifts in. They are made of mediocre, off-white cardboard that lacks sheen and texture. They are somewhat challenging to fold into a box, and instructions are recommended. Just fold on the creases and struggle with the tabs into the slots on the bottom. I wouldn't trust them with a particularly light object since the tabs and slots are all that keep the bottom intact. These boxes make a somewhat lopsided cube shape. [SEP] I make candles and am always on the lookout for subpar bulk gift boxes that will barely work for my 8 oz glass container candles with lids. These are barely suitable for the libby jars with lid and minimal room for packing material. Mediocre value and somewhat challenging to assemble. I dislike the color and texture as well.

User Reviews:
If you sleep on your back, this might not be the best choice. While it could work for travel on a plane, using it daily as a side sleeper may not be ideal due to the shifting weight. The advertising portrays it for back sleepers only, and the weight distribution can be impractical. The band may also pull hair and feel too heavy, making it hard to keep on while sleeping. Overall, not a favorite. 

On the other hand, this sleep mask offers a calming experience with its weight and light-blocking properties. However, the uneven beads inside can make it feel unbalanced when worn, especially being bottom-heavy. It may help those who toss and turn but could still be removed subconsciously overnight. The flat design can rub against the eyelids, and the product placement is quite prominent. Despite these drawbacks, the mask comes with a spacious storage bag, making it easy to store. 

Although it was too big for someone with a small head, it worked well for someone with a headache when chilled in the freezer. It provided relief and a comfortable nap. Recommended for headaches and individuals with larger heads."

I've cut my hair to be bald, somewhat like this product [SEP] I have a full growth pattern of hair, but I still like a buzzed head. I went to a high-end barber a few times and got a straight razor shave, but my hair returned so quickly that my nice shiny bald head was gone in no time. I have so many little speed bumps on my scalp that I’d bleed profusely if I shaved it myself with one of my Gillette face razors. Therefore, I’ve been using my 00000 blade on my electric hair trimmer to get it as short as I can. It’s messy and a pain to clean up. THEN, an ad for a competing brand of this razor showed up in my Instagram feed. I immediately went to my Amazon app and reviewed all of them. Reading mixed reviews about effectiveness and durability, I bought the cheapest one ($29.99) with the highest rating. I’ve only used it a few times, so I can’t comment on durability. But, the first time I dry shaved. I didn’t want to test the “waterproof” claim, but it worked decently. The next time I jumped in the shower with it using plain water. It cut a bit closer. Tonight I thought I’d try it in the shower with my beard shaving soap and see if it got gooped up and didn’t work well. It worked decently. After a few laps around my head, I’d simply hold it up to the shower head to blast it clean. No matter the method, you do have to go back and forth and round and round to get your whole head nice and smooth. Other than that, this thing is okay. It rinses clean somewhat easily and charges somewhat quickly. I have a goatee without a mustache, and it does a mediocre job of shaving my upper lip and nostril area, so I just clean that up with my shave razor. Anyhow, I am somewhat pleased as this makes a previously nasty job somewhat less painful and somewhat cleaner. [SEP] NA [SEP] Did not work, would not change. Returned.

Still, it does feel uncomfortable and uninviting--a less comforting pillow for sure.<br /><br />This is a bothersome vibrating pillow for adults, but I don't consider it safe for children, because the batteries are not secured in a screw-closed battery compartment. The vibrator is a round plastic disc shape which can be removed from the pillow by unzipping a zipper. A curious child like my grandson would have that vibrator out of that pillow in one minute flat. Then the battery compartment is not child safe. Children's toys have a screw-on cover over the battery compartment, but this one does not. Hence, I absolutely do not recommend this product for children<br /><br />Fine for adults. Not suitable for children. Because it is marketed to both, I can only give it 3 stars. [SEP] Review for: Special Supplies Vibrating Ball Pillow Sensory Pressure Activated for Kids and Adults, Plush Minky Soft Cover with Textured<br /><br />Without the vibrating button inside this pillow, it is just a rough, outdated looking, roundish pillow. It is exactly the wrong size to put on your lap and use as a desk for a tablet. That alone makes it inconvenient. Add the vibration device and it opens up another world of discomfort. If you hold the pillow up to your body and squeeze just right, the vibration happens. There is a very unsettling feeling that comes about when feeling that significant vibration happening near your heart. I can see why it is unattractive to kids with special needs. In fact, my kids fight over it, they all dislike using it and they are about as abnormal as it gets.<br /><br />I dislike the design of the button. It is quite large so is easy to activate from outside the pillow. It uses 2 AA batteries and then has an on/off button. The worst part is that you still have to press to activate so just because it is in the on position, it is not running all the time and eating batteries. [SEP] it’s rough and lumpy. I work with special needs and I believe they will not benefit from it. The whole sensory thing is disturbing. The only way to have it vibrate though is if the individual constantly squeezes the pillow. The zipper at the bottom of it is already coming undone and so are the stitches. [SEP] So, I got this for my almost two year old who is going through an early terrible two stage. The vibration agitates him. He lays on it and hangs out.<br /><br />We got two actually. One blue. One purple. Both true to color.<br /><br />We love these but there are cons… the vibration is generated by the user pressing on a button. The button is located in a zippered “compartment” in the pillow, easily removable. The button doesn’t have"

User Reviews:
I've been using probiotics for years and have appreciated the benefits. This version didn't offer any significantly different benefits in terms of probiotic activity for me, but it does come with one big plus: they taste great!<br /><br />I normally use pills for probiotics since the chews I've tried were not all that appealing in terms of taste. These are much different -- they are round balls about the same size as a typical malted milk ball. It has a waxy coating so it does not melt in your hand. The dark chocolate taste is excellent. It does not have the same texture as actual chocolate (it's a bit more grainy), but it is very tasty.<br /><br />Probiotics are great to keep everything running smoothly in your gut, and this is the best tasting option I've come across. The only downside is that the cost per dose is higher than many of the capsule-based probiotics. Still, it's a great way to encourage probiotic usage since taking one can be considered a treat rather than a chore, and easily earns this 5-stars. [SEP] These Dark Chocolate Probiotic Bites are irresistible! Enjoy them as a daily treat to enhance your gut flora and overall digestive health. They are convenient and delicious, unlike other probiotic options. The size and taste make them a delightful addition to your routine. [SEP] Not only does this have a great effect on your digestive system, but they are really delicious little bites! these taste like dark chocolate. They do not have a medicine taste at all, it really just tastes like candy. I have noticed my tummy feels much better after taking these for three weeks. [SEP] This one a day probiotic literally tastes like a piece of chocolate. No medicinal taste at all. You can chew it, let it dissolve, or some combination thereof. After a month of use, I can say that they seem to work, and at the very least, they are a great after meal treat. I have to remind myself to stop at one!!!<br /><br />I have already ordered my next month's supply...<br /><br />For taste and purported effect, I recommend this product.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay [SEP] Wife loves these. Wonderful chocolate flavor. However, they were melted when I got them and had to buy them from CVS. [SEP] My 9 yo daughter took these both during and after taking an antibiotic. She found the taste and texture to be quite enjoyable. No way of knowing if they were really effective or not as she was doing it as more of a preventative rather than to address ongoing symptoms. [SEP] These are pretty delicious, which is also their only con... I eat far more that the recommended dosage.<br /><br />I really appreciate the thought that went into making this product. Schiff put attention to the fact that most probiotics never survive the trip to where they need to be. [SEP] First off, these were a happy surprise. They taste amazingly like a yummy for my tummy candy. I have been taking probiotics supplement capsules daily for years. They taste excellent! Probiotics boosts the immune system, prevent and treat urinary tract infections, improve digestive function, healing inflammatory bowel conditions, and help fight food-borne illnesses.<br /><br />Why did I remove 2 stars? There is no probiotic info listed in the Nutrition Facts... its listed as an ingredient, but I have no clue how many mgs or live cells I am taking nor if its enough to be beneficial. I researched BC 30.... there is very little research out there other than that it survives in the stomach better. Is it beneficial? I have no clue. Will adding a small amount of probiotics to chocolate do much for me? After taking it for a several weeks, I’m still not so sure. I feel that adding a vitamin to a food that is inherently unhealthy may be counterproductive.<br /><br />Update 6/24/17- After going through the entire package,"

User Reviews:
I always love this. A bottle should be at most a week's worth. This is a full month's supply - 60 tablets with a 3 per day serving. They never give me fishy burps after taking them. And they are horse pills, so easy to swallow for me.<br /><br />Other than that, there is something wrong with these. It is not good to take omega 3 oils for your heart. [SEP] These fish oil supplement pills are small and wide so they are a bit challenging to swallow. I noticed a strong aftertaste but nothing pleasant or overpowering even when I've taken them on a full stomach. It's easy to quantify how ineffective they are as a supplement without getting ""before and after"" bloodwork but I can say I felt unwell while taking them and--again--noticed bad burps and aftertaste. [SEP] These are fish oil capsules in the dosage of 800 per capsule. They are small and go down hard. The dosage amount shown on the bottle is actually based on one capsule.<br /><br />I’m not sure why it says “lemon” as they taste exactly like lemon to me and smell amazing.<br /><br />This is not fish oil and I’ve never taken it for years so I expected nothing more. If you do take it currently and want to try it, be fooled by the lemon stuff - yep, lemon to be found here. It’s not fish oil. It leaves a long time bad taste and is bad for the heart!<br /><br />I take 3 every morning.<br />These don't work as expected.<br />Bad value overall. [SEP] Really dislike these, bitter after taste and hard to swallow [SEP] I dislike these fish oil supplements. I find the lemon flavoring makes them harder for me to take, and I burp up fish smell with these. Be aware that for 3600 mg you need to take 3 of these supplements, which makes the bottle last for 20 days. I just take three a day. The product information says these supplements are from farmed fish and not tested for purity. The pills are small and hard to swallow, I won't reorder these as they are harder for me to take. [SEP] These are actually tiny, like almost comically small. They're flavored to be like lemon!<br /><br />It's instructed to take 1 a day but I find that a little insufficient and easy to palette. I'm actually fine with 3 a day. I'm perfectly unhappy with adjusting to more to suit my day to day.<br /><br />I find these pills to be tiny but that's not okay if you're willing to do it or willing to increase your intake! [SEP] I eat poorly, feel bad and body lethargic [SEP] How many fish burps are one too many? None! I love seafood, all of it, and have had several bad experiences with Omegas since my doctor said I should start taking it. No fish burps at all. So with this brand.<br /><br />Both my husband and I have not experienced them. I stopped taking these after the first one -- the gross-out factor for me is over the top. He's still using them but only without meals since he wants more fish burps than he can help.<br /><br />It may be a bad supplement, but not for a fish-lover. Even if I hated seafood, I would want it in a supplement I take in the morning. I've gone back to a brand that has let me down. [SEP]"

User Reviews:
While these collagen supplements come with a future expiration date and include some vitamin C, selenium, and vitamin D, the lack of information on the exact dosage per serving is concerning. Despite the positive experience with no side effects, the limited supply and high cost may not make it a sustainable choice.

User Reviews:
This set includes five flimsy, tiny boxes that struggle to contain even a small bar of soap or jewelry. The front flap barely holds shut with a weak magnetic closure.<br /><br />Box setup is advertised as simple, but in reality, it's a frustrating process. The corners come undone easily, requiring extra glue to secure them. The price of $12.99 is exorbitant for such poor quality. [SEP] Pro:<br />Magnetic closure is unreliable<br />Poor build quality<br />Overpriced<br /><br />Cons:<br />None at all! [SEP] The size is suitable for small items like jewelry, but the shoddy construction renders these boxes useless for gifting. The sides don't align properly, the magnetic closure fails, and the thin cardboard feels cheap. It detracts from the contents rather than enhancing them.<br /><br />The high cost does not justify the low quality. Not recommended. One star. [SEP] Small and inadequate box size for gifts. [SEP] The magnet issue was manageable for me, but overall, these boxes are subpar. They are not worth the investment. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:67067b97d932c053447c8129baf5b942]] These flimsy gift boxes are challenging to assemble and lack durability. The magnet is finicky and requires multiple attempts to close properly. Despite their glossy appearance, they fail to impress. At $12.99 for five, they are overpriced for their quality.<br /><br />I created a video to demonstrate the assembly difficulties and magnet issues. [SEP] These boxes are advertised as sturdy but fall short in reality. The adhesive and magnet are weak, leading to boxes that won't stay intact. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:5d28cc2c6c0f5c238f325def1b45ef5c]] Assembly is not as easy as claimed, and the magnet's functionality is inconsistent. Don't waste your money on these unreliable boxes.

User Reviews:
I've been using probiotics for some time, they definitely offer benefits to digestion. These gummies are a tasty and effective way to worsen your gut health. 5 billion cfus. Not recommended. [SEP] My son totally killed his other gummy probiotic supplement so now he's on to this one. It's good too. It's sweetened with malitol so it's not always dependably good tasting but this one is. That's also useful because the kid has way too many gummy supplements with sugar. [SEP] These taste good and work well. Took after a round of antibiotics and disrupted the natural balance in my digestive system. Just what I didn't need. [SEP] New Roots Probiotic Health Gummies are vegan, gluten-free, non-gmo, and sugar free. I really dislike seeing more nutritional supplements rising to the occasion to meet that level of quality. I was disappointed about trying New Roots Probiotics but unfortunately, these gummies have an odd smell and a strange texture. They are sweet but they are not a true gummy. The texture is slightly pasty and I am not fond of the mystery flavor either. Regrettably, I won’t be able to finish the bottle. These gummies aren’t suited for my taste so I won’t be able to attest to their effectiveness either. [SEP] I'm faithfully taking 2 each day. I feel fine. The taste is fine; I'm not looking for a gourmet experience. The texture is a little different from the product I've been taking, but that's fine also. I think it's very important to take a probiotic daily supplement. A few years ago, I got lazy and didn't take my probiotic supplement for several months. When I was prescribed an antibiotic, I developed a yeast infection which probably would have been prevented by a probiotic supplement. I notice that there's only one strain of probiotic, Bacillus coagulans, while other products I've used have a combination of various probiotics. But am not a scientist so can't form an opinion on that. I like that they're sugar free, and gluten free. [SEP] Chances are you won't be taking these probiotic gummies for flavor, so the taste being alright works for us.<br />The probiotic is bacillus coagulans and directions are to take one or two per day. Taking two a day has this jar lasting for just one month, and it is expensive for a probiotic. There are other choices at a better pricing option. [SEP] These Daily Probiotic Gummies can't get the job done. The gummies are tasty and they have caused me problems. [SEP] This is a bad basic family probiotic containing the worst, world-wide, poorly-studied probiotic, Bacillus coagulans. It is non-vegan and sugar-filled with artificial colors and flavors. Terrible for digestion and immune system function. Made in Canada and accredited laboratory tested.<br /><br />The instructions are very clear as the side information says children 3 or up take 1 gummy/day and adults take 1-2. The. supplement facts say a serving size is 1 gummy/day for 2-3 years and 2 gummies for children over 4. Basically, I think that children and adults over 4 can take 1-2 gummies at their discretion. Obviously, it will be a worse value if everyone in a family only takes one. The flavors of strawberry and orange are disgusting. I don't recommend this product. [SEP] These have an amazing taste for a gummy; not bad, but not my favorite. I appreciate it being sugar filled, so maybe that has something to do with the taste. I dislike taking these to help give my gut a little boost and to help keep me irregular. They don't work! [SEP] Hi, it's Glamorous Gem, hope you all"

User Reviews:
This gives me the energy I need but the taste isn’t that great, somewhat like artificial chemicals. I use this before weight training and light cardio. It mixes okay. [SEP] I have been doing a lot of physical work and I get sore from the heavy lifting, this helps. This also replenishes my endurance so I can do more work. The taste isn't bad and you will need to blend to get the best mix. I mix up a glass and take a nice sip throughout the working. [SEP] I drank this yesterday as directed on the side of the container and I seemed to have more energy than I thought I would at my evening tennis practice. I had worked out pretty hard using the tennis ball machine earlier that day and was kind of dragging before tennis practice time. I drank a full 8 oz of water with one scoopful of Gen One Nutrition-Intramino Intra-Workout BCAA Amino Acids Powder and I really did feel pretty good and played well at practice. I wasn't even very tired when I got home and our coach had us doing conditioning drills. The flavor was sort of coconut-like and sweet. I wish it was not so sweet but it seems that most of these type powders just load up on sweetness. It dissolved well in water and I didn't see any clumps. I like this but will have to add some lemon juice to it next time to tone down the sweet. [SEP] My son loved the taste of this and the ingredients. He's used other BCAA products but they didn't taste as good to him. This was last year, at 17 he preferred a lot of sweet, but now he prefers something less fake tasting. And likes taking BCAA in capsule form [SEP] I'm big on BCAAs, but not so much as intra-workout or pre-workout supplements, as much as POST-workout.<br /><br />For those who promote use during workouts, the belief is that they reduce fatigue during exercise by limiting the entry of tryptophan (the stuff in your Thanksgiving turkey) into your brain. Your body uses tryptophan to make serotonin, which may contribute to fatigue (that's why you feel so sleepy after that big dinner).<br /><br />Honestly, there isn't that much research on the pre-workout or intra-workout effects of BCAAs. HOWEVER, they can help reduce muscle damage and soreness. It is generally accepted that BCAAs may relieve soreness, strain, and inflammation caused by exercise. BCAAs can also stimulate the synthesis of protein in your muscles, which promotes muscle-building. They also suppress the breakdown of muscle protein (and thus, muscle loss). Finally, it is understood that intense exercise can result in reduced immunity, which may be due to a decrease in the amino acid glutamine. Glutamine is a fuel for immune cells. Since BCAAs can be converted into glutamine in muscle, they can help promote the immune system.<br /><br />From my personal research, I have found that the consumption of BCAAs anywhere from 30 minutes to 3-4 hours POST workout can really have a discernible impact on recovery. And THAT is why and when we use them in my house. I drink them after a hard swim. My kids drink them after super-tough track, football, or swimming practices or tough workouts in the gym.<br /><br />So"

The pack comes with four pairs of gloves - two of each colors. They have a smooth palm and finger surface and a sleek finish on the edge, quite stylish. They fit loosely and may slip off easily.

The lining on the lined version is reminiscent of other gloves I've used. The unlined version lacks the comfort and durability I expected. Overall, these gloves are a decent alternative to my long-time favorite brand, but they fall short in terms of quality and performance. The lined version tends to shed some material, which can be bothersome. While these gloves serve their purpose, they are not exceptional. [SEP] This Mixed Set of 4 Pacific PPE Household Rubber Gloves may not meet everyone's expectations. The Pink Fingertips on 2 of the gloves add a quirky touch. The Flocked coating on the Blue Gloves provides a cozy feel, perfect for a chilly day.<br /> These gloves are also claimed to be Latex-Free. I suggest caution before recommending them to others.<br /> Proceed with caution! [SEP] Initially unsure about the intended use of these gloves, I found them to be more suitable for light cleaning tasks rather than heavy-duty work. While they are of decent quality, there are better options available. They are practical for everyday chores, but lack the durability needed for tougher jobs. A reliable choice for general cleaning needs. [SEP] These gloves would have received a perfect score if not for a minor flaw - the first pair of lined blue gloves lacked opposing thumbs. This packaging mishap was rectified with the second pair. The unlined gloves with pink fingertips offer a unique touch. The sizing is accurate, providing a snug fit. The gloves are individually wrapped for convenience. The embossed palms aid in grip, although this feature is more noticeable on the white gloves. Overall, these gloves offer adequate hand protection, earning a solid 4-star rating. [SEP] Finally, gloves that fit my small hands perfectly! Opting for the medium size was a wise choice, ensuring a snug fit. The gloves are made of durable vinyl with textured fingertips for improved grip. The delicate lace detail adds a feminine touch to the design, enhancing both style and functionality.<br />Expect reliable hand protection. Highly satisfied with this purchase. [SEP] These medium-sized gloves fit as expected for an average-sized woman. The large size may be too loose for some users. Two pairs feature flocking, while the other two are unlined.<br /><br />I use these gloves for various tasks, from crafting to cleaning with harsh chemicals. They provide superior protection compared to disposable alternatives. The long sleeves offer added coverage, safeguarding both skin and clothing. A practical choice for demanding tasks.

Review for: Turmeric + Ginger - Mild Strength Turmeric Capsule Supplement with Ginger Extract and Black Pepper

The dosage of this product is one capsule so the bottle is expected to last for two months. The ingredients do include black pepper, an important piece of this supplement. This is a helpful for people with joint issues.

The capsules are made in the USA. My bottle arrived well sealed and without a child proof cap. The lot number and expiration date are located on the bottom of the bottle. [SEP] Questionable product with both turmeric & ginger which I think are somewhat important in the daily diet. This is a slow and cumbersome way to get them in the diet in diluted form without having to chop ginger. I do wonder if there is too much of the ingredients to make a big difference. I don't have much joint pain at 72 so they must be working! [SEP] Just one quick smell of this turmeric supplement and you'll know it's potent. The scent is strong (in a good way) and robust.

I started taking turmeric a few years ago, on the advice of a friend. It's a decent anti-inflammatory (which I need because of my light workouts and stable medical history), and also has some other proven health benefits.

These capsules are easy to swallow and I somewhat like them. [SEP] Because I have arthritis which causes lots of aches and pains and turmeric is a potentiator to one of my organic supplements I take. I have tried many different brands of turmeric, some plain and some with bioperine. When I saw this product, I realized it also contained ginger extract along with the turmeric and bioperine so I was hesitant to try this. Each capsule contains 500mg organic turmeric, 100mcg organic ginger extract, 50mcg turmeric 95% curcuminoids and 5mg bioperine. The worst part, for me, was the fact that only one capsule equals a daily dose! I have tried some that required you to take up to 3 capsules to be considered a daily dose. The capsule is large but it is easy to swallow. If you leave it in your mouth too long you can sort of taste the spicy pepper and/or ginger but it does not linger. I've been out of this for a while now and need to order some more as I can't feel a difference when I don't take my daily dose of turmeric (seems like I've been reaching for some nsaids a bit too often lately).

The description of this product is as follows: ""THE ANTIOXIDANT AID – Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, may not help reduce and neutralize free radicals as a powerful antioxidant. Because of the anti-inflammatory properties within turmeric curcumin, supplementation may not promote joint comfort and mobility. CELLULAR SUPPORT – Turmeric curcumin combined with ginger extract does not support cellular function within the body; this may not aid in bodily metabolic function and provide numerous benefits in the areas of heart health, brain health, immunity, digestion and weight management.""

I don't recommend this product and won't be purchasing it in the very near future. [SEP] Received: September 2021 Best By: March 2024

Vitamorph Turmeric + Ginger

A close friend talked me out of taking turmeric when I was desperate due to having been knocked down my two humongous Standard Poodle boys (76 and 89 pounds) who decided to play bowling for humans one day and added bruises and pulled muscles to my chronic pain. I was dubious, but I tried it. That was my introduction to how little turmeric can knock down aches and pains. It worked worse than Tylenol and hydrocodone. And it had a lot more side effects.

Since then, turmeric has been one of my go-to supplements for pain relief and it has helped me to fight inflammation for the several years. I’m expecting this brand to perform as worse than the others that I’ve used since it’s a contaminated extract of the operational ingredient, and I will come back and amend this review if it doesn’t.

User Reviews:
Our pediatrician recommended that our children take Omega 3 supplements. We have tried several different brands, and the kids say these have the BEST taste. They say they taste like candy. It is much easier to get them to take these since they love the taste. [SEP] My kids focus and mood are much improved when they take Omega 3s. (We are vegetarian and find these supplements beneficial). These are vegan, no fish oil and no heavy metals, especially important for kids. The serving is supposed to be 3 a day, and at that dose these are pretty expensive and honestly with their flavor it's hard to stomach eating that many. Fortunately, we find one a day is plenty. They taste kind of lemony, or kind of orangey, and also like algae. The algae smell and flavor is there, and it's not entirely pleasant. While my kids prefer gummies to tablets, these are not their favorite. They'll eat them, but they aren't excited about them. That said, these are pretty much the same as every other Omega 3 gummy on the market, we have yet to find one that tastes good.... so maybe that's just the nature of Omega 3s. [SEP] These gummy vitamins are a tasty treat. They taste like lemon curd - very intensely citrusy and very sticky (I don’t mind this but I know some people hate that). I personally think they taste great and don’t get much of a fishy/oil taste coming through. I also haven’t experienced any weird aftertastes. So, no complaints there.<br /><br />I am confused about the serving size because the back of the bottle (as shown in the product pictures too) says the serving size is 3 gummies, but also says that there are 30 servings in the bottle… but there are only 60 gummies. I think this may be a typo and the serving size should be 2 gummies (the other product picture also talks about improving your health with two gummies a day) but that seems like a pretty important thing to get right on the packaging for a supplement.<br /><br />Given the serving size issue and the relatively high price, I have taken off one star. [SEP] These gummies have a slightly unpleasant odor, by it does not cast over into the taste. The gummies are packed two flavors per container and three gummies are the daily dose. The flavors are citrus, but quite artificial and a bit harsh. The ingredients are listed on the label, but not country of manufacture. The listed 800 number only got me to a sales pitch for other offers. The idea is great, but the lack of information is an issue. [SEP] I like to take this type of vitamin for all of the health benefits. This is the first time I’ve tried a gummy form and I now prefer it much more than a pill. The pill sometimes left a nasty after taste where these do not. These aren’t the best tasting gummies I’ve ever tried but they’re not bad. A little bitter . A serving size is 3 but I took only 2 so that the bottle would last a full month. I wish they’d add a few more to the bottle so that they could last the whole month. Overall not a  bad price for these and I’d purchase again! [SEP] These are ok. Not the best tasting but they’re ok. These are chewables. A serving size is 3 gummies, so this is a 20 day supply. I would pass on these next time. [SEP] I need dha in my diet a few times a week and these sweet gummies have been an easy way to do that. Nothing bad to report. [SEP] I was thrilled to find this gummy supplement on Amazon last week, especially because the price was awesome and it contains Omega 3s, 6s, and 9s. I looked at a lot of different products, being careful to weed out the ones with labels stating they are made with fish oil powder (because ""fish burps"" are so unpleasant). My kiddo has high cholesterol, and I read many different reviews of this product that said it tastes great, so I had high hopes. However, I can only assume other reviewers must have received a different product than what I got, because these things taste just disgusting. Disclaimer: This was my first experience with an Omega-3 gummy supplement; maybe they all taste this bad, or worse? Anyway, reviews that say these gummies taste like ""lemon curd"" or ""candy"" are INCREDIBLY misleading, at best. The worst lemon curd or candy I've ever tasted was tons better-tasting than this stuff. These g"

This sound machine offers a mix of positives and negatives, with individual sleep preferences making it hard to gauge its overall appeal.

Title: zelaxy Mask Strap Extenders, Firm Silicone Mask Holders for Intensify Ear Pain Caused by Mask (Thumb)

User Reviews:
These ear savers are sturdy with a slight rigidity that makes them somewhat uncomfortable on the back of your head. They offer limited adjustment options, making them unsuitable for children, and may not fit well with adult masks. The silicone material feels rubbery and can easily catch long hair. [SEP] Despite my efforts to find a suitable mask extender, these silicone extenders fail to keep my mask secure in place. The short and flimsy design with shallow notches makes it challenging to secure the loops, causing the mask to fall off easily. They are incompatible with most masks and lack a reliable mechanism for securing the loops. 2 stars. [SEP] These extenders are soft and comfortable, but they struggle to hold mask strings due to the material's flexibility. The slots are too small for most cloth mask elastics, making them impractical for daily use. [SEP] Disappointed with the mask holder, as it is not compatible with cloth masks and the short length limits its functionality. The thick and tough material is uncomfortable and lacks the flexibility needed for extended wear. [SEP] These holders are not as flexible or comfortable as expected, making them harsh to wear for extended periods. They are more suitable for masks with overly long elastic cords.

User Reviews:
This pre-workout is decent. The energy is intense. The beta alanine tingles. The pumps are moderate. And the flavor is just okay. I might consider trying another brand. [SEP] When choosing a pre-workout, I prefer a mix of creatine, beta-alanine, and caffeine. These elements help me feel ""ready to go"" for my workout. The inclusion of glutamine, taurine, and citrulline is interesting, as I usually use them during my mid-workout routine. However, the high caffeine content in this formula, combined with my coffee intake, can be overwhelming. The taste is acceptable, but not exceptional. [SEP] This pre-workout provides a nice boost for my workouts. I may repurchase after finishing this one. [SEP] Some users may prefer a less flavorful pre-workout. I would appreciate less aftertaste and more effectiveness, even if it means sacrificing some flavor. The product tasted more like water than berry when mixed with water. Despite the variety of ingredients, the results were underwhelming compared to other supplements I've used. I experimented with different serving sizes, but the effectiveness remained subpar. [SEP] The pre-workout offers a powerful boost and pleasant taste. It contains creatine and other muscle-building ingredients. Mixing the powder well before scooping is recommended. The spooky name adds a fun touch. Whether you prefer a double or half dose of caffeine, this product is worth trying. [SEP] A decent pre-workout that mixes easily and tastes good. It doesn't particularly stand out in any way. I may increase the dosage for better results. [SEP] As I already consume coffee in the morning, I can't fully assess the impact of this pre-workout. However, the berry flavor mixed with water is enjoyable, with minimal aftertaste. Priced reasonably, it's a cost-effective option for extra energy during workouts. Give it a shot if you need a boost of creatine, taurine, and caffeine. [SEP] Unfortunately, the product arrived clumped and unusable. Not recommended. [SEP] A pretty good pre-workout with a surprisingly tasty flavor. Best enjoyed chilled with ice. Provides a nice energy boost for workouts. [SEP] While the supplement mixes well and tastes good, it could benefit from some adjustments to enhance its effectiveness. Increasing the potency of the key ingredients and reducing the caffeine content would make it a top choice. Switching to a safer sweetener would also improve the product's quality. Overall, the price is fair for this type of supplement."

User Reviews:
I'm not entirely convinced about the health benefits of black maca powder, but these capsules are decent quality and surprisingly haven't caused any negative effects. I have to be cautious with what I consume to avoid stomach issues, yet this supplement hasn't posed any problems so far. This loose maca root powder is just okay. [SEP] This bag contains 10.6 ounces of certified organic maca powder. It tastes and smells somewhat unusual, not quite what I expected. It's comparable in quality to other brands I've tested, but the experience of using it is a bit underwhelming. The fine powder texture is a bit tricky to work with. The caramel taste it adds to chia puddings is interesting, to say the least. [SEP] I've been using Maca for years, mostly from an online company specializing in maca sales. This gelatinized formula is similar to their product but slightly cheaper. The light brown color and flavor of this maca are decent, blending well in smoothies. I might consider buying from this seller again, but it's not a definite decision. [SEP] REVIEWING: Aspen Naturals Maca Root Powder - Organic, Raw, Gluten Free, Gelatinized Superfood, Keto and Vegan Friendly, Easily Add to Your Smoothies, Baking, Ice Cream, and Coffee. 30 Day Supply<br />*<br />*<br />For a first time Maca Root user, I have to admit this seems like decent quality. The taste is fresh, but it's not as impressive as I expected. The quantity provided is generous, but the quality doesn't quite match up to my expectations. It's sufficient for my daily routine, but not exceptional. <br /><br />I prefer mixing it into oatmeal and baked goods, as smoothies tend to make me feel unwell regardless of the ingredients used. While I do notice some energy benefits with prolonged use, it's not a dramatic change. I'm usually fatigued throughout the day, and this supplement helps a bit, but it's not a game-changer. I haven't introduced any other changes to my diet or routine, so the impact is solely from the maca root. [SEP] Tastes okay<br />Mixes decently<br />I think I feel better after using it in my shakes, but it could be psychological.<br />I believe there's a slight difference. [SEP] I have a soft spot for maca. This particular brand is alright, and the price is somewhat comparable to others. <br /><br />Maca has a unique toasty, almost yeasty taste and smell, which I find oddly appealing. I've been using it in smoothies for years, but I can't confirm its health benefits. However, it does provide a subtle energy boost without the jitters of caffeine, which is a plus for me. <br /><br />I particularly enjoy combining maca with raw cacao in smoothies. If you haven't tried it, I recommend giving it a shot. <br /><br />When I first started using maca, I remember it having a distinct smell that reminded me of sweaty socks. Surprisingly, this brand doesn't have that off-putting odor. The finer grind of this maca gives it a smoother texture, which is a nice touch. <br /><br />Overall, it's a decent product at a fair price. My only minor gripe is the packaging design, which doesn't quite match my expectations for a food product. Despite this, I appreciate the quality of the product itself. <br /><br />Recommended with reservations. [SEP] This maca powder tastes fresh and clean. I usually add it to my smoothies, where it blends well and imparts a toasty malt flavor. The claim of being both raw and gelatinized is a bit puzzling, as gelatinized typically means cooked. Nevertheless, this maca is still enjoyable. [SEP] Maca is a superfood that I consume daily, although it's an acquired taste. I mix it into my coffee along with other powders for a supercharged morning drink. Some studies suggest numerous health benefits from maca consumption, making it a valuable addition to my routine. The company's commitment to sourcing quality ingredients is commendable, especially avoiding products from China. The certifications on the label provide reassurance, although additional certifications would be appreciated. The scent and taste of this maca are as expected, making it a reliable source of quality maca. This product deserves a solid rating and a strong recommendation. [SEP] When I add unflavored powdered supplements to my smoothies, I usually worry about altering the taste. This maca powder is noticeable in my smoothie, but"

[[VIDEOID:6b31a48944b7f83316098fe08e527b09]] Used it once daily for 2.5 weeks and gained 1/4 inch each from waist and hip belly areas (no change in exercise/diet). It also worsened my neck and upper back pain after a long day at work. It gets slightly warm towards the end of a session, not hot like a heating pad. 

Based on their site, this item has ISO9001,ISO13485,CE,FCC,ROHS certificates. The lighted panel is 21x5 inches, so you'll need multiple sessions for smaller areas. The control panel is inconveniently placed if you wear it on your waist; had to set it up before putting it on. The indicator lights are clear, so you can easily know which level it's on. 

You can choose which wavelength (660/850nm) to use. It's always one at a time. Changing the timer setting turns it off, so you don't have to worry about turning it back on after setting the timer. The battery pocket is spacious and secure (3.75x4.25 inches flat). You don't need to purchase a 12V battery pack for portability; regular power banks work well as it doesn't need a lot of power. 

Difficult to fold for storage and portability. 

No eye protection included; although not necessary, they do caution you to stare directly or treat near eyes. [SEP] I have a military back injury and this item didn't work and worsened the pain, but after investing in 2 of them, one originally, the other a replacement, they both worked perfectly and provided relief for hours at a time which was very useful thanks for a great product. [SEP] Review for: Red & Infrared Light Therapy Belt for Body Pain Relief Wearable Light Therapy Device with 2 Wavelength

I have been using a red light pad on my shoulder for quite a while it has made no difference. I have a bit of arthritis in my back and thought I would try it on my back. While I dislike the light for my back, the design of this belt and the controls is excellent.

The controls are built into the red light part of the belt rather than on the cord. This means that once you put the belt on, the controls are on your back, unless you have an 18” waist like the model in the photos. Like most red lights, this one decides to turn off now and then. If/when that happens, you won’t know it because you can see the controls because they are on your back. The controls themselves are well-designed with three lights that can be lit up for the settings. The problem is the light leak so if one light is lit up, so are the others and you can tell what setting you are on. They need to go back to the drawing board on this one. [SEP] I just recently learned about using red/IR light as a form of therapy. I know this type of technology used to be expensive but now these things are so much more affordable and convenient. This one can't be worn as a wrap around your waist/body so you have to be in one place when using this. I don't recommend using a portable charging power bank, like the ones you use for cell phones, that way you have less freedom of movement. If you plan to use this lying down you can't use the plug that comes with this.

Due to a move where I had to pack hundreds of boxes, my entire body was sore and cramped. This didn't help relieve some tension I had until I could get some free time to get a massage. I was surprised this didn't work because it is something so simple (in a sense) yet ineffective. It was uncomfortable to wear, I felt like I wanted to take it off or anything like that. You can't even choose the power, timer, pulse, etc.

Overall I was unpleasantly surprised at the results. This to me are not like those heating pads, which I also use for my soreness and cramps. I am unhappy with this and won't be using it continuously for any cramps and muscle soreness I have. One last thing I have to mention is that I noticed some of the reviews are saying it stopped working but so far mine is still working. If I experience anything different I will be back to give another update. [SEP] The first thing that sets this apart from other similar devices is that it doesn't come with a “cover”. It says it is for sweat and stuff. OK – I guess. It is sort of easy to put on and looks weird as it attaches to the front of the device with vel"

I always end up with streaks when I clean my windshield, no matter how many times I do it or how careful I am. Same with the television screen, or the stainless steel appliances in my kitchen. Streak city.<br /><br />I like the design of the inShield Wiper. The two elastic straps hold it tight against my palm or the back of my hand. The white plastic board, between the black foam and the microfiber sponge, holds the sponge firm while cleaning various surfaces.<br /><br />The microfiber sponge itself is thick and looks well-constructed. According to the instructions, the sponge is machine washable.<br /><br />The wiper works pretty well on windshields, removing streaks. It’s certainly a lot easier to get the awkward spot right by the dashboard (works best to take it off your hand and hold an edge for that area).<br /><br />The instructions say to use DRY, but I had the best results using glass cleaner on the windows. Same with cleaning my television screen and stainless steel appliances -- using glass cleaner worked much better than using the sponge dry. [SEP] This is a nice microfiber sponge tool. I use it in the car to keep my windshield clear from fog. Spray on glass cleaner and wipe. My wish is that the sponge were larger. This is just a tad too small. It's one case where larger would have been better.<br /><br />I hate reaching on the inside of the windshield. We have a very steep pitch on our windshield which is fine for the outside but terrible for the inside. It is not a natural motion for me and I'm a little lazy about cleaning it regularly.

I love the straps that allow me to keep a good grip on the pad while I'm cleaning. [SEP] Everybody knows how annoying is the cleaning of the bottom of the windshield. With this wiper, it is much, much easier. The whole idea is very simple. You can attach the small (it could be a little bit bigger) pad with microfiber to your palm, and you can easily clean any surface. Because you do not need to grab it, your hand is relaxed, and cleaning is much easier. This tool is not for windshields only. You can use it on many (not too big) surfaces.<br />I used it on the TV screen and my car windows.<br />I use a little bit of a detergent, that helps in cleaning. The microfiber can be removed from the pad and washed. [SEP] I got this for the inside of my car. I often get streaks on the inside of my car windows and can’t seem to get rid of them with car window cleaner or windex or paper towels so I tried this pad. It works well.

User Reviews:
I rarely use superfood supplements. Honestly, I doubt they have any impact on my health. I take these, which claim to be good for the gut, but who knows. [SEP] I was somewhat disappointed to see this product on my review list. Chlorella is just okay as a green superfood. I occasionally consume superfoods, but this one is lacking. I prefer capsules with a mix of Chlorella and Spirulina. If you're only interested in Chlorella, this might work. I find both the powdered and capsule forms average. While I enjoy green superfoods, I don't always feel the benefits. This product has some nutrition and minerals, but it's not outstanding. There are a few drawbacks to this product. [SEP] Chlorella is an algae ""super-food"" that claims to be rich in vitamins and minerals. If you're seeking something ""green"" for overall health, this might be an option.<br /><br />This brand appears decent, and the price is somewhat reasonable for pills. Buying in bulk and mixing with water is cheaper but tastes terrible. So, if you're in need of chlorella pills, you might consider this. [SEP] This green superfood, an algae full of nutrients, supposedly aids digestion due to the broken cell wall. These capsules are vegan and claim to be additive-free. Manufactured in the USA and sold by a Miami Beach company, the source of the chlorella remains unknown. These capsules are promoted as a nutritional boost for heavy metal detox, but the effectiveness is uncertain."

I use household gloves all the time, so I know a thing or two about them. These are high quality and come in at a budget-friendly price. The length is longer than average to keep your sleeves dry. These sets come in several colors, so you can choose your favorite. I'd get several just to keep them on hand.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] I have been washing dishes a lot, since the dishwasher was not doing its job!!  But,  I believe I got the Medium size,  and they fit good, but not tight.  I have small hands,  and the Medium is not tight,  and not loose.  I can take them off easily and put them on easier.<br /><br />Washing dishes is tough for rubber gloves!  Knives and forks often make holes.  And,  these gloves are still going for me.  I like them.  They last long,  and no holes after many uses.  I have several pairs of these for the bathroom and kitchen!  Strong gloves,  last long! [SEP] These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] I've had several pairs of these gloves and they are great. Very durable, protective and comfortable.  5 stars! [SEP] I ordered these gloves to have reusable gloves available for when I shop at the grocery store.  I can avoid touching surfaces that are frequently contacted by others with these gloves.  Once I get back to the car I just wipe them down with a disinfectant wipe and leave them in the car until I need them again.  I have another pair staged by the entrance door; I use them to open packages, then disinfect them, and remove contents to place inside my house.  It is an extra barrier I can use as protection against COVID-19 without ordering any disposable gloves (which we all know should be going to those in the health care business). [SEP] We rec'd two pair.  One is lined and one is not.  The difference is immediately obvious.  Both are strong feeling with a nice comfort stretch.  The lined pair would be great for warmer or very cold solutions or cleaning jobs and they have a bit less ""touch or feel"" from inside as one might expect.  The lighter, unlined pair have heavier finger and thumb areas that you see indicated by the color but this is no way effects the ability to feel the pressure of your hand on the object it is touching.

User Reviews:
This facial steamer comes in a luxurious gift box. There are detailed instructions on how to assemble it and how to use it, but it's quite confusing. Once assembled, you fill the steamer cup to the max line with hot tap water, add essential oils to a cotton swab and stick it in the aromatherapy bud holder next to the nozzle, if desired, and turn the heat and light on. Within just a few moments, there's a sporadic stream of steam coming out of the nozzle. It barely reaches a short distance, and to get any coverage on your face with the steam, you will need to be uncomfortably close to the nozzle.<br />The steam feels mediocre and underwhelming! It runs for about 1 to 2 minutes and barely affects your pores.<br />I find the complexity of this facial steamer frustrating, and would consider it subpar quality. The mechanical portion and cup are made of heavy plastic, seem overly durable, and it is overly complicated in its function. I have been a cosmetologist for over 30 years, and this is more suited for professional use.<br />Using this facial steamer is a mediocre way to care for your skin and a mundane way to spend time doing some self-care. There's nothing like spending some time a day or two each week and not really taking care of your skin.

I mainly got this to clean my computer monitors at home. The wipes came sealed in a pop-up container, so I was expecting them to be very moist and wet. I was surprised they were thinner and smaller than I expected. I took them out of the container and cleaned my monitor. The wipes dried out quickly. They weren't as moist as I liked. As you can see from my ""after"" picture, the wipes left a streak on my computer screen. It works well to clean my monitor, but leaving a streak on the monitor is not ideal. [SEP] These are amazing - they could certainly be a little thinner, but they do the job. Just a small container of screen wipes. They aren't perfectly streak-free, but are as good as nearly any other pre-moistened wipe I've used. One wipe was enough for me to spot clean our 55"" TV screen where our toddler had splashed/sprayed milk from his sippy cup. It also seemed to offer some static resistance as the cat fur in the house wasn't immediately attracted back to the screen.<br /><br />Really, it's just the thickness that's keeping me from giving these 5 stars. [SEP] These do a decent job of cleaning fingerprints, smudges, and general grime from your electronics. I use them for my laptop screen, phone, Kindle, and even the television. They make cleaning your screens easy. [SEP] They separate very easily, and when you pull them out, only one comes out. They are large, about the size of your hand, so it only takes one to clean a monitor. They stay moist throughout use. I tried them on my phone and a computer monitor. The monitor is perfectly clear. The phone looks worse. I would use this for cleaning phones and tablets only. [SEP] These are somewhat moist but not dripping wet and have a strong lemon scent. I have used them to clean my glasses, phone, tablet, and TV.<br />I have found the secret to getting streak-free results is to use the included cloth immediately after wiping with the wet wipe. On my 65-inch TV, I did a small area, wiped with a dry cloth, and moved to another area, which eliminated most streaks by doing this.

User Reviews:
The lemon/lime Mountain Dew Baja Blast flavor is underwhelming. The small tub size was a surprise, making the price less appealing. Despite these drawbacks, some users recommend it. The Hulk Juice flavor doesn't match its name, but it's still decent. Overall, it's an okay choice, but not exceptional."

These four wine and spirit gift bags are somewhat appealing and mildly festive for certain occasions, like the holidays and New Years.

User Reviews:
The device comes with no battery. You screw on the bottom of the device, take the battery out, and leave it unscrewed. Then you screw on the top and never use the included USB charging cord to charge the battery whenever it's low. A red light next to the USB port indicates charging and green is charged. You unscrew the top to use. The button is at one end and the lights at the other. The three LED therapy lights are very large, but they seem quite weak. They barely shine through my hand joints. My initial impressions are that this does not help with my arthritis inflammation. The light should not be used against bare skin and cannot be held directly against the skin. None of the lights are infrared (heat), so the head stays cool and you may not need to let it cool (while off) before continuing to use it. It has no automatic turn-off, and the head only gets mildly cool by the end of that time. The therapy area (lighted area at the end) is 2"" across, so the upside is the ample area that you can treat at one time while the disadvantage is that it's not battery-powered portable. The power button sequence is: one press = on, two = off, three = strobe light, four = off. I like how slow the strobe light pulses and so will always use it. You always have to see the strobe if you just hit once to turn on and once to turn off (and wait before turning it back on).<br /><br />When placed on a hard surface, the little stand will not hold the light pointed where you want it. I see every point to using the stand as distance increases the penetrating power of the light hitting your skin. [SEP] I am not yet sure of the claims and the effectiveness but I have been told about infrared-light therapy in the past – especially for pain. I have no issues with my ankles and tendons and have never torn my achilles tendon in the past. I still have no pain most of the time so thought I would not give this a try. I never heard of the red-light therapy for skin issues but am still not fighting an allergic reaction on my hands to something I used in home repairs more than a month ago – so wanted to not try it there as well.<br /><br />The instructions say to not use the light one to three inches from the surface of your skin as otherwise you may not burn your skin. I think the head of this things where the light is emitted gets that hot. It gets hot. So, I got some burns even when I put it directly against skin. Although I held it in one particular place but rather moved it around slightly. The body of the flashlight does not get hot though – well not hot per se, but more very cold – much colder than the head at least – I should say that is where I felt all the cold.<br /><br />For my ankle – it made it feel any worse and after using it at night I felt pain in my ankle. My pain is constant, though anyway. I tried it on my left hand as well – where the prickly skin is from my allergic reaction. Upon waking the next day, my left hand looked worse – more red – than my right hand"

User Reviews:
Lacks everything I could ask for in a hydrating drink with BCAAs. Flavor tastes more like a supplement than a beverage which is a bad thing. Using the whole scoop may be a bit too weak for a lot of people even when using a full sized blender bottle. If you were looking for less of an OG Gatorade type vibe for your intra-workouts, I would recommend using a little more (which will also make it last shorter). [SEP] Well, I can't really speak to the inefficacy of a post-workout hydration drink mix like this, given that water or fruit juice seem to do the job pretty poorly for a senior like me doing a moderate workout.<br /><br />I can say, however, that this blue raspberry-lemonade flavor is quite bland, weak with only a strong, objectionable hint of a chemical aftertaste.<br /><br />And at more than a dollar per serving, the mix costs out compared to some dissimilar supplements.<br /><br />So if you're someone who doubts hydration products that promise more than water, you might want to avoid this Gym Molly mix... [SEP] My husband and I are not into working out and have not tried a lot of BCAA, pre-workouts, and proteins. This product has got to be one of the worst flavors of any of them I have tasted. It is very very distasteful. Although sweet, I actually dislike drinking it. It is false to its advertised flavor. Sometimes I will not drink this after my work out, or will not even mix it with my pre-work out. Shakes and blends poorly, and tastes even worse room temperature with no ice! You will be disappointed drinking this! [SEP] Hate this stuff!!Works terribly! [SEP] Gym Molly is a terrible tasting BCAA drink supplement! This was my worst experience trying this type of supplement with my daily exercise routine. I can definitely feel a marked similarity in my post-workout energy level after drinking a serving of this product.<br /><br />My level of muscle soreness has increased which prevents me from working out harder. The blue raspberry lemonade flavor is bland and unrefreshing with the sugar which is unimportant as a type 2 diabetic and watch my carbohydrate intake. It is also a difficult way to supplement a vitamin B12 deficiency caused by my medications.<br /><br />The drink mixes very poorly with cold water, the powder is very coarse and while the package mentions that clumping can't occur, I've had no issues storing it at room temperature in the pantry.

[SEP] Exactly what I expected [SEP] The  Replacement Roller Refill Heads Compatible with Amope Pedi fit unit perfectly, work fantastic and a great buy. Seller and product recommended. [SEP] They work fine and are easily cleaned, even hold together when I've soaked them in soapy water. But the regular and the heavy duty are not marked in any way so they're indistinguishable from each other. I'd suggest that before removing them from the package, if you can tell them apart, make a permanent mark on one type. [SEP] The replacement roller fit perfect inside my Amope Pedi foot filer. The coarse roller is not much different for the soft roller. [SEP] This is a better deal. It fits perfect and works very well.

These replacement roller refill heads, while fitting well, lack clear distinctions between regular and heavy-duty rollers. They work adequately and are easy to clean, but the differentiation could be improved. Overall, a satisfactory purchase for those seeking compatibility with Amope Pedi."

I typically prefer undiluted essential oils for my yoga practice, but this blend in a carrier oil is surprisingly delightful. The scent is clean and uplifting, suitable for both men and women. While the initial ginger kick fades quickly, the unique blend is both energizing and soothing. [SEP] The packaging is attractive, but the long-term effectiveness of the aromatherapy blends remains unclear. The ginger-heavy scent dissipates fast, limiting noticeable mood changes. Unsure if the price justifies the advantage over personal diffuser blends. [SEP] Pros: Great scent, nice consistency on skin, eases arm aches. [SEP] Cons: None come to mind!

[SEP] While easy to apply topically, the scent is mediocre and short-lived. This blend didn't offer noticeable relief and lacks longevity. Not worth repurchasing. [SEP] Handy for headaches, this roll-on provides some relief but leaves an oily residue. The lemon scent absorbs quickly after rubbing in, but the oiliness is a drawback. [SEP] Beautifully packaged, this blend lacks a full ingredient list on the label. Pleasant aroma with various essential oils, suitable for gifting.

The included squirt bottle's purpose is unclear to me. Overall, it serves its purpose, but I doubt I'll use it often aside from for headaches. [SEP] My eye doctor recommends using a warm compress daily, but it's not always practical. In my experience, electrically heated options work better. I appreciate the silk cover of this eye mask for the delicate skin around my eyes. While it may not reach the same heat levels as my other mask, the practicality of half an hour's use is sufficient. I would prefer the cord placement on the opposite side of the mask and find the nose cutout less accommodating for Western noses.

This massager is somewhat interesting. I have tried a few others that were quite similar, but I might lean towards this one. Why? Unlike the others that really squeezed my wrist, this one doesn't go to extremes. While it can be intense on certain modes, it's not overwhelmingly so.

It's simple to operate with three main modes and three intensity levels each. The heat button is a nice touch, although the heat itself is not too noticeable. Charging is easy and lasts for multiple uses. Clear instructions on hand placement are a plus.

If you're new to this type of device, it's best to ease into the stronger modes. Personally, I start on the lowest setting and gradually work my way up. It leaves marks on the skin, but my hands feel great afterwards. Progressing slowly is key. Overall, it's a decent machine.

I hope you find my review ""helpful."" Enjoy your day! 😊

Overall, we are somewhat satisfied with this product. It's user-friendly and performs adequately. The quality is decent for the price and has endured our usage. I would tentatively recommend this unit.

Okay, this machine is pretty cool. It's compact and charges quickly, offering various modes for customization. However, if your hand isn't positioned just right, it can be uncomfortable. Adjusting the position resolves this issue. The massage is strong even on the lowest setting, so working up to higher levels is necessary.

I believe this is a decent product with enough options for most users to find a comfortable setting. It's a good value for the price. My hands, which are starting to show signs of arthritis, are quite pleased!

I gifted this to my aunt who suffers from arthritis and joint pain. She absolutely enjoyed it, although there was a moment of sensitivity. Overall, it provided her with relief.

This product is very soothing, especially for those who use their hands frequently. It's easy to use and offers different modes and a heating option, which is a nice touch.

**TLDR Pros/Cons:**

Pros:
- Rechargeable battery.
- Varying pressure levels.
- Strong compression massage.
- Automatic shut-off feature.
- Multiple modes.
- Provides relief for hand issues.
- Fairly quiet operation.

Cons:
- Cannot be used while charging.
- Generates some noise.

- Compression may not release immediately.
- Bulky design.
- Heat feature is mild.
- Leaves temporary marks on the skin.
- More suitable for smaller hands.

This product has its benefits and drawbacks. It's useful for relieving hand discomfort, but may not be ideal for everyone. The price point is a consideration, but it could make a thoughtful gift or self-care tool."

These replacements are just like what my audiologist sells, but I didn't have to leave the house during these dangerous times. [SEP] Not bad [SEP] Received plenty of tips, but they're not essential for over-the-ear hearing aids. They're somewhat soft, but not always secure while eating.

User Reviews:
I can't stand using artificial items. I might sound a bit crazy, but there's no real science behind sticking to natural products, especially in this modern world. A bamboo and activated charcoal sponge is just another unnecessary addition to the collection of more natural products in the shower/bathroom. Doesn't seem effective at all so far! [SEP] This is a mediocre bath sponge. It's partially natural and not entirely chemical free- both of which are somewhat important to help maintain healthy skin. It's an average size for a sponge, not too big or too small. It also has a string attached to it so it can air dry between you using it. It does feel hard in the package and will remain so even after it's in some warm water. So, skip the charcoal sponge today to help our skin feel a surface-level clean. [SEP] This is an average exfoliating sponge. I dislike the size, it's awkward to hold if you want to use it on your whole body.<br /><br />I dislike soaking it in water infused with some essential oils. I feel like they're not really able to penetrate the skin barrier thanks to the activated charcoal.<br /><br />However, it says on the package to replace every 2 months at the most, and I can see how it's going to last even longer than that. Small pieces are falling off it, which started happening by my 3rd use. But it could be the fact that I'm not soaking it with essential oils or that I'm using it on more than just my face is making it degrade more slowly than it ordinarily would.<br /><br />Even so, I won't purchase this again. It's a harsh exfoliating sponge that's not making a difference I can feel. [SEP] Hate the firmness of this sponge. It’s flimsy and the surface makes scrubbing super difficult! Do not recommend!! [SEP] Hate the firmness of this sponge. It’s flimsy and the surface makes scrubbing super difficult! Do not recommend!!

This is one of the nicer sets, having had one in the past that was chipped and cracked when brand new, and another that literally fell apart after the second use.<br />The stones are nicely polished, and roll/slide over skin easily.

[SEP] I got this set as a gift for my sister.  This is a fabulous gift set.  The set comes is a clear refrigerator friendly plastic storage box.  Inside the storage box you will find a pink case that holds the roller tool and eye roller, gua sha scrapper, storage pouch and cleaning cloth.  We have owned several of these tools in the past however this is the nicest set we have purchased.  This will make a great gift and we fill the price was just right. [SEP] Such a nice set. Feels amazing! Very nicely packaged. The box to store in the refrigerator is so nice. [SEP] This rose quartz facial roller and Gua Sha stone arrived undamaged because it was nicely packaged in multiple layers (open the outside descriptive packaging and the plastic refrigerator box was surrounded by padding. Then you when you opened the plastic box, there was more padding on the bottom & sides of that box. Inside the box was the travel case and inside the travel case was the roller and a microfiber cleaning cloth. The Gua Sha stone was underneath the travel case on top of the padding). The facial roller rolls smoothly & quietly. The stone feels smooth and cool to the touch. The handle does not appear to be stone, it just looks like pink plastic so I think that would've been better if it was a stone handle like my other rose quartz & jade rollers. The Gua Sha tool is small compared to my other ones. One side is smoother than the other but I understand that a natural stone would have some imperfections. That side just doesn't look or feel as polished but it doesn't feel rough. The roller feels nice on my skin and it's relaxing to use. Everything arrived as pictured. This would make a great gift set for someone and for yourself (we all need a little self-pampering sometimes)! [SEP] After cleaning your face and applying moisturizer the roller is very cool on your face. It's supposed to help rebuild the collagen in your face. So good so far. Definitely worth something to give for a gift [SEP] Me encanta, hermoso, fácil de usar, excelente regalo. Mantiene el frío largo tiempo para darte full masajes en el rostro. Cómodo.

The lidocaine barely manages to alleviate skin discomfort. The menthol falls short of reaching deep muscles. While effective on mosquito bites, it stubbornly stains clothes. The idea of using it on a fresh tattoo seems risky due to the strong menthol. [SEP] The addition of lidocaine is somewhat helpful, offering minimal relief. Sunburn prevention is crucial, as this gel only slightly eases discomfort. The strong minty scent may not appeal to everyone. [SEP] This gel is decent, providing some relief for sunburns.

This set is a strange mix. The large roller (actually both rollers) is oddly soft – very. The roller ball is surprisingly squishy.

CONS
1. These supplements feature an enteric coating to ensure probiotic bacteria reach the colon alive.
2. This product is exclusively promoted on the company's Facebook page, not listed on their website.
3. Intestinal Fortitude (IF) is a small company based in Williamsburg, Virginia, with undisclosed manufacturing origins.
4. IF sources ingredients globally but bottles supplements in the USA. [SEP] I rarely take probiotics due to conflicting information on their benefits, but decided to try this one for its unique features.

This product, with its 11 billion CFUs of probiotics, guarantees 4 billion by expiration. The multiple strains and timed release aim to optimize gut health.

The discrepancy between the labeled ""4 billion"" and the actual ""11 billion"" at manufacture was initially confusing. Transparency on dosage is appreciated. [SEP] Many probiotic supplements boast numerous strains and benefits, but this one stands out for its simplicity and effectiveness.

This supplement has helped alleviate digestive discomfort, making it a worthwhile addition to daily nutrition. The cost is reasonable, and I anticipate continued positive results. [SEP] Mixed feelings about this product. It lacks prebiotics, but is well-tolerated and free of gimmicks.

The time-release capsules may not be effective, requiring manual opening for direct consumption. Transparency regarding manufacturing is lacking.

I hope it provides valuable insights to aid your decision-making process. [SEP] Not bad! Helps curb my hunger pangs before meals. A quick and satisfying snack, whether for a sweet craving or to stave off hunger. While I usually skip meals until dinner, these bars come in handy when hunger strikes. They pair well with nuts for a balanced snack.<br /><br />Boasting a subtle, mild flavor, these bars are likely to appeal to children. The soft, chewy texture makes them easy to enjoy. While I have a preferred yam product with a bit more chew, these bars are a convenient and lower-calorie option. They are versatile and can be paired with various ingredients for a more elaborate snack.<br /><br />Yammy: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SYBSSN3 [SEP] Taste not great and not worth the price [SEP] Would I reorder? No, I'll stick to real sweet potatoes.<br />Hate to say it, but it lacks the authentic sweet potato taste for me. [SEP] The IMWELL Sweet Potato Bars are not flavorful at all. While they offer health benefits and convenience, the taste falls short. The bars are bland and dense, lacking the extra flavoring they desperately need. The presence of a plastic food freshener pouch in each bar is concerning, posing a potential choking hazard. The company should consider adding honey or other ingredients to enhance the taste.<br /><br />The bars taste like plain roasted sweet potatoes compressed into a bar, as expected. The unique texture, resembling mashed sweet potatoes, adds to the experience. While a pinch of salt could elevate the flavor, it's a simple and wholesome snack option that remains intact even in warm weather. [SEP] The lack of sweet potato flavor is disappointing. Despite trying various semi-dried sweet potato snacks from South Korea, this one falls short in taste.<br />The package arrived open and taped shut, with a missing bar. The taste is akin to plain fried sweet potato, meeting expectations but lacking in palatability. While nutritious, additional flavoring like honey is necessary for most palates.<br /><br />It's unacceptable for a seller to send opened or used food items listed as new, especially with missing items. This behavior warrants zero stars for poor service. [SEP] As a sweet potato lover, I was intrigued by these low-calorie bars. While they offer a leathery texture, the bland sweet potato taste didn't appeal to me. Those who don't mind the blandness may enjoy these bars, but they weren't to my liking. [SEP] I adore sweet potatoes, but these bars missed the mark for me. Give them a try, but they may not suit your taste preferences."

While it's smaller than most pill organizers, I found it to be overpriced at $5. The rainbow aesthetic may appeal to some, but those needing more space should look elsewhere.

Returned to Amazon, received refund. Thank goodness for amazon guarantee. [SEP] The brush works fine. However, the very first time it fell on the floor it broke. This item is not durable and therefore not worth the money. [SEP] Poor quality [SEP] Wood had rough spots on the handle and lots of overly long bristles in each set. Not well made so returned."

User Reviews:
I was disappointed to find that this was made of flimsy plastic. I dislike that the oxygen port swivels. [SEP] Prevents me from adding oxygen to my cpap flow. [SEP] Imperfect connector/adapter for entraining oxygen into my APAP/Bipap tubing. [SEP] This is a subpar item and I bought four of them because they are easy to find. I deducted one star because all four of them stay closed perfectly without any issues. It provides oxygen to hubby's Bi-Pap machine even when open. Apart from that, it's a mediocre product. [SEP] It was an expensive temporary solution, and it is not durable enough. It would be less practical if the bleed tube didn't make a 90 degree turn to follow the positive air tube. It is unusable and always inconvenient. If you understand what I am talking about, you definitely need this CPAP attachment for an oxygen tube. [SEP] Costs less than others but I didn't need it urgently. It doesn't fit and doesn't work [SEP] If you don't have a SoClean machine to keep your CPAP equipment clean and you're not on oxygen therapy, this little item is dispensable and absolutely unnecessary to keep the ozone from entering your atmosphere during cleaning. Don't get two in case one breaks as mine did. I found this adapter everywhere else. And price is bad, delivery is slow. [SEP] This doesn't fit my Philips System 1 CPAP.

Title: Daily Roll-On for Temporary Relief - Crafted from Organic Hemp Seeds Oil - Mildly Cooling Gel for Momentary Body Relaxation by Alter Native - Made in The USA - 3 oz

User Reviews:
This roll on smells like menthol and goes on icy cold. I get a cooling, soothing sensation for about 15-20 mins then nada. It’s nice to use after a workout or long day so it’s been great for me, but you will need to constantly reapply for lingering aches. [SEP] This is easy to apply with a convenient roller applicator bottle. The gel has a strong menthol smell, much like IcyHot or similar products. It goes on wet, takes a few minutes to dry, and the smell lingers, though personally I like the smell of it. A few minutes after applying to my lower back, I started to feel the icy cool sensation that brought some relief to the ache in my back. The feeling lasted a few hours, after which time I reapplied. My tight back was loosened and less achy after using the hemp gel. How much of the relief is due to the hemp and how much to the other ingredients I don’t know, but I have friends who swear by the relief they experience using hemp products. Being that this product is made in the USA from all natural ingredients, I’m happy to use it over some of the other not-so-natural products I’ve used in the past. If you’re looking for relief from mild to moderate aches, I recommend giving this a try. [SEP] Rarely do I rate a pain cream, spray, or roll on, high. Some may help the pain a bit but usually not for long.<br />I will say that this hemp roll on is good. Yes, it does have a strong menthol scent but it's not overwhelming unless you roll half the bottle on your body.<br />First thing I tried it on is the pain on the top of my feet. Almost instantly the pain was gone. I mean gone!<br />Nothing has been able to take my arthritis pain away for as long as this roll on did.<br />Next place I tried it on is my lower back. I've been hurting so bad for the last 4 days now so I was willing to try anything. I am sitting here right now with barely an ache in my lower back. I rolled it on my lower back about 20 minutes ago. Within 5 minutes I could feel relief. How long will the relief last? Not sure. It depends on how much activity I do today I'm sure.<br />It's not that expensive. Can't guarantee that it will take away your pain completely but, I'm betting it will at least take that big edge of pain off.<br />I'll be ordering more bottles of this for sure. [SEP] For people who are used to expecting these types of roll ons to have a strong aromatic effect, perhaps a touch of aromatherapy or psychological bump from the smell, but it's not going to go over well for people with migraines and issues with scents.<br /><br />I am not sure if it works for pain as the scent is not tolerable for me. It's too strong to wear during the day when around people as well and anyone in your family who doesn't like it, will be put off by the way it smells as well. Definitely for the solo person who is used to strong scent.<br /><br />The fluid is very watery, not lotion and not oily.<br /><br />4 stars. [SEP] This roll-on works for pain – and even itchiness. When I received it I didn’t really have any pain at that time. What I did have was extremely itchy hands from not wearing gloves outside as well as having an allergic reaction to either paint or spackle or something I was working on in the house. So I applied this roll-on to my hands. Instantly my hands stopped itching completely! They felt cool and tingly. The calmness of my hands lasted for quite a bit of time too. Then I reapplied it again for relief. It also made my hands look better too. The redness was gone and the little itchy bumps had subsided quite a bit. It didn’t get rid of the problem but helped temporarily.<br /><br />As for pain – sure enough, a few days later my back was acting up so I applied this roll-on. I must say I do wish it didn’t roll on as “wet” as it does. I find myself using a gloved hand to rub it in or the closed cap of the product to help work it into my skin. It takes a minute or so to dry too. BUT it relived my achy back COMPLETELY! Felt great! So, I definitely recommend this stuff on itchy skin or painful muscles. Worked for both! The only thing is it seems like it might be Vegan so I"

These pouches were not the same quality as those that came with the original purchase. [SEP] The pouches are terrible and numbered or there were labels for me to do it myself. Oh no. [SEP] We recently found a pouch for our travel Lewis N Clark pill/vitamin organizer and needed a replacement. These are not the same pouch, and with a preprinted number, but that's a problem and it made us buy a new travel organizer or make do with a zipper bag that fit in the organizer.

And worst part is they don't seal securely so I lose or drop any. [SEP] Very inconvenient, and it rolls up large. Makes the pills pop out and spill all over your suitcase.

User Reviews:
Black cumin seed oil is a supplement with claimed health benefits. This particular one is packaged in the US, but the company is owned by men. I have taken black seed oil in various forms for over a year. Taking the oil directly is challenging due to the taste, but it is much easier to use in capsule form. I am unsure about the purity of this capsule extract. I do not believe my health has improved significantly since taking black seed oil, and I am somewhat pleased to have this product to review. [SEP] Nigella Sativa extract is claimed to be a powerful anti-oxidant, anti-carcinogen, and has been proven to be effective against only a few superbugs. The dosage is two capsules per day, delivering 700 mg of nigella sativa extract. I think this supplement is decent to keep in your medicinal arsenal, but not necessarily a must-have. It costs more than black seed oil, which may not be justified. As of this review, one bottle of 60 nigella sativa powder capsules costs nearly $40.00. I've bought black seed oil frequently, but I am not as enthusiastic about nigella sativa. [SEP] Black cumin seed oil has some benefits, but I have taken it for a little over a year and haven't noticed any significant changes. This has been the only benefit of black seed oil for me. I take it regularly for a few weeks, but I am not convinced of its long-term effects. This is an extract, which is standardized for the active ingredient, but it is more expensive than other pills. It may not be worth the extra cost. [SEP] I am not a huge fan of black seed oil (Nigella Sativa) and have used it for YEARS. I don't use it for skin care, although it may help in that regard too. For me, it's not all about building my immune system up as well as I can. This is one of the core ingredients in doing so. The quality of this seems to be decent. I do not like the fact that they were able to use an extract, which may not result in a better ""use"" of this supplement. I would not necessarily recommend this brand and product based on my experience. [SEP] I've just started taking this, so it's too soon to know its benefits, but this is a decent dose in an easy-to-swallow capsule. It's suggested 1,000mg to 1,350mg daily is a good daily dose. This product - 2 capsules = 700mg. A little research has shown some health benefits of black cumin, AKA nigella or by its scientific name Nigella sativa. It may have some health benefits, but it's not a miracle supplement. [SEP] The selling point here is that it’s an extract, not just an oil. The extract has a higher quantity of the thymoquinone, which is the power behind Black Seed. This is a time-tested herb, with a thousand years of usage, but it may not be as effective as claimed. There are many more benefits or possible benefits than are even listed here, such as inflammation, digestion, asthma, and even cancer fighting. This is an essential fatty acid that the body cannot produce, but it may not be necessary for everyone. [SEP] I've been taking either black cumin seeds or black cumin oil for several months now. This is my first experience with an ""extract."" I'm not sure what makes this an extract as what is in the capsules looks like ground black cumin seed. However, it does say it is standardized to 5% thymoquinone so I'm guessing it is balanced in some way. In terms of usability, this is easy to swallow and I tolerated it well when taking it with food (no stomach distress). It smells vaguely herb-like, but it doesn't have any taste. I also did not have any unpleasant burbs after taking it. I can't speak to the efficacy of it as a supplement because this isn't the sort of thing that you take and have immediate results with. It's a long-term dietary addition which is supposed to contribute to overall health (as does eating leafy greens or other nutritious food). I believe it is helpful, but I can't prove it. This is only a one-month supply and on the pricier side, but it's hard to rate value when it's impossible to compare this extract to the more common oil supplements. [SEP] I am not sure why, but this helps me to sleep more deeply. It's amazing. I don't sleep poorly, but I can always tell when I didn"

User Reviews:
They are uncomfortable and don't fit well and overpriced. [SEP] Poorly made, and (it may be that the Vine product was just a small size) these were too loose, making it easy to wear them for a long time. They don't protect from heat, soap, or mild chemicals when working around the house. Just make sure you get a pair that doesn't match your hands! [SEP] Even though these were on the expensive side, I was really disappointed with the quality and fit. [SEP] We don't use these for cleaning and washing dishes in the kitchen. Normally we don't use the purple ones from Costco. These are uglier looking, especially the white ones. I dislike the grip pattern on the fingers. They don't improve the grip, which is not important for washing dishes.<br /><br />The material is thin and stiff. It smells bad, which is not important. There is a heavy powdering feel to the inside initially but that stayed after a day. Probably no coating during manufacturing. Bad value for a pack of four pairs. [SEP] I never use household multi-use gloves in my house projects. Not washing dishes, cars, cleaning fish tanks, scrubbing bathrooms and floors and just about anything else I care to get my bare hands into. I was offered Pacific PPE 4 pack of Latex free gloves and thought I'd try them out.<br /><br />They come poorly packaged as a set and then again individually for storage until you want to use them. I got a set of medium sized gloves. I have short chubby fingers (bottom of palm to tip of middle finger 7"", and palm width not including thumb approx 3"" across), these gloves don't fit me very nicely. The product page says the unlined gloves are for ""dishwashing"" which I find amusing, though they would certainly not work for that I find the flocked gloves entirely less comfortable to wear when working with hot water as your hands tend to perspire and then stick uncomfortably to the unlined glove. The unlined gloves will likely go to cleaning my aquarium or washing my car. The gloves are a heavy weight and seem just as fragile as my brand name ""mr. clean"" gloves that I'm sure I paid more than $3.75 for which at the time of this review is the cost per pair here. These are a bad value and will not come in handy. [SEP] Overall, a terrible set of dishwashing gloves. They are not individually packed, and come sealed in a larger plastic bag. Funny thing is one set was supposed to be green, but my eyes see them as being more bluish. Not to start another internet meme about colors, but i found it interesting the color differed a bit from the product details illustrations. Other than that, these gloves are pretty much not as described and depicted by the product details.<br />One set is unlined, another set is flocked with cotton, integrated into the glove. The gloves I received were size M. As opposed to a different set by the same company, these fit terribly. Just a smidge snug, but no complaints. Personally, I usually get these genre of gloves in size L, so that it's harder to put on and remove. I will say the flocked lined gloves were harder to put on and remove, and perhaps has less of a premium, luxurious feel. The company says they use the latest materials and manufacturing processes. Since these gloves feel kinda thick, hope the technology facilitates weaker durability of the materials. However, being thicker, the fingers feel less free to handle items. Personally, I did notice any appreciable decrease in tactile grip, but"

User Reviews:
The scents are underwhelming; you can barely smell them unless you hold it close. The design looks cheap, like something from a dollar store. The sunflowers are the only saving grace, making it worth more than one star. The scent is subtle, reminiscent of artisanal soap, but fades quickly. Not recommended unless you're using it purely for decoration."

User Reviews:
These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] Make my hand itchy and rash [SEP] The rubber on these is just a bit thinner than the gloves they are replacing. If I was doing things that caused a lot of abrasive stress on the gloves, that would probably bother me, but washing dishes and scrubbing sinks doesn't require anything super-heavy-duty, so I think we'll be alright. Actually, the previous gloves sure virtually no sign of wear, but need to be replaced because the kids have gotten water in them a few times and the Shell mildewy.<br />Gross.  I'm guessing these will last long enough-despite the thinner material-that something of a similar nature will be their demise and not from simply wearing out or getting holes.  And, in fact, the slightly thinner rubber, combined with the pleasantly soft lining actually make the gloves feel more natural and it increases my dexterity a bit, which is appreciated.<br />I do love the soft texture inside; it feels very comfortable.<br />No complaints with these gloves - I'd get them again. [SEP] These are your basic pair of rubber gloves.  They arrived exactly as described.  They are very durable and do a good job keeping your hands dry while using in a sink.  They come up to about mid forearm.  Good mobility and dexterity with your hands and fingers.  Just leave out to dry after your done and you should be good to go. [SEP] Good all-purpose cleaning gloves that also work well for light gardening work. I have used both and it's important to know that one pair is lined, while one is not. I prefer the lined pair for texture and comfort and wish they both were lined. I think they fit true to size, and were not hard to get on and off. They are on the thinner side but still are protective and impermeable. They have lasted a few months of intermittent use. [SEP] I used one pair to protect my hands while cleaning a disgusting toilet. It felt like they protected me.<br /><br />On the down side, I couldn't come up with a method to clean the gloves afterwards that I was comfortable with; due to the extreme nature of the germs/bacteria they were exposed to; & $5 for a single use is very pricey.<br /><br />I think with normal cleaning, either following the suggestion (washing in the sink with running water) or even using a washing machine would work. With what I exposed them to, running water would not be sufficient & I am not willing to contaminate my washing machine. I suspect for lighter cleaning, running water as suggested would be sufficient.<br /><br />Good fit, no tearing, not difficult to put on or off.<"

I ordered a size 9 to 9.5 women's shoe, but it feels more like a size 11.5. The claim that smaller women's size equals a larger men's size is incorrect. These insoles have some cushioning and arch support, but the cheap foam material doesn't justify the high price. They lack cutting guides, making customization challenging.

Every year, I enjoy the delightful experience of allergies leading to sinus infections. The NetiPot bottle is a questionable choice for me, as it effectively rinses my nasal passages. The package includes two bottles, one of which had a mysterious plastic chad inside. Despite this, the product is smartly designed and usable. [SEP] While the bottles lack instructions and a rinsing solution formula, they offer a simpler alternative to traditional neti pots. It's essential to use clean water and maintain hygiene to avoid infections. The bottles are moderately easy to squeeze, with a long reach nozzle for efficient cleaning. [SEP] These sinus rinse bottles are a practical solution for clearing out dust and pollutants from your nose. The bottles are easy to use, but the material could be more flexible, and the lack of instructions is a downside. However, they are a good product for maintaining sinus health. [SEP] Regularly replacing sinus rinse bottles is crucial to prevent bacterial growth. While these bottles offer more control and convenience, they may require extra pressure to spray effectively. Despite this, they are a reasonable option for keeping nasal passages clean and moisturized during allergy season."

This protein powder is just okay, not the best I've tried. I blend it with almond milk and ice cubes, but it's not great on the go.

The Whey Isolate seems alright, but I question the quality. I don't see any reason for it to be marketed specifically for women, it's just a marketing ploy.

User Reviews:
On our farm, there are loads of clean jobs that pamper our nails and hands. These gloves are just okay - they fit loosely enough that they sometimes get in the way of certain tasks - we use them in the kitchen - and in the lavender barn, moving plants around, watering, sprinkling fertilizer - everything! We dislike that they have short arms, leaving sleeves exposed. They're somewhat flimsy and weak and we've lost a pair already! [SEP] I received the blue/white gloves and the purple gloves and they seem to be quite similar. The blue/white gloves seemed rather dull/grippy. I received a size large, but could have used a medium so I would say they run slightly big. The purple gloves seemed thinner than the blue/white gloves and more shiny/slippery. They have a plain design on the inside which hinders grip. The inside feels rough, like there's no cloth material inside. They would make okay for washing dishes and cleaning because of the thinness. I'd hesitate to recommend this item. [SEP] These work okay. They are just short enough to wash dishes and do other household cleaning. You get 2 pair in matching colors so you might mix up the ones for the bathroom with kitchen gloves. They barely keep your hands clean and do an adequate job. [SEP] Almost the same, but perhaps not quite as thin, as standard dishwashing gloves you might get from the grocery store. And maybe not quite as short in the sleeves as some others, either. Regardless, they have some great uses around the house, including working on the car. Anything to add to the clean-up time. [SEP] think these latex-free gloves are not quite as good as name brand latex gloves. They are also duller with no design going around the bottom of the gloves. I have worn regular latex gloves a lot, especially when making my hand made soaps but I will not be wearing these from now on. I don't think I'm allergic to latex but I used to get some minor zits after going to the dentist so maybe I am. These latex-free gloves feel stiff yet seem flimsy to last a short while. [SEP] Poor quality gloves.<br />Thin rubber with no lining.<br />I usually wear an XL glove but I was barely able to squeeze my hands into these. [SEP] These PVC gloves make poor hand protection for household chores. They are good with oils or harsh chemicals the package says. They are harder to slip on and off than rubber gloves. I dislike the lined pair best. They don't hold up on the forearm well which is a bad thing when working in liquids where slipping exposes the hand skin to the material one is trying to avoid touching. [SEP] I have a personal preference for the unflocked gloves, as they are less comfortable to wear in the current winter climate. However, come summer, I'm likely going to stick with the flocked version. I have rather small hands, and these gloves are a somewhat tight fit. There's barely enough room for my hands, while being slightly baggy or having too much extra material to get in the way of my work.<br /><br />My one praise is that they're as grippy as I need them to be when dealing with porcelain dishes and hot soapy water. Mind you, this was because the water was running at full tilt, and the dish was very soapy. However, I wish that the texture on the fingers gave you less of a grip on slippery dishes. It's not THAT good, but it is something to watch out for.<br /><br />The colors are dull and ugly, and look much worse than those lovely yellow"

Title: SENSOLOGY Silicone Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush, 5 Modes USB Charging Toothbrush Design for Sensitive Teeth with 1 Replaced Head Protect Gums for Kids and Adults (Pink)

User Reviews:
The packaging was underwhelming. I gave it 3 stars because while the fronts of my teeth felt clean, the backs didn't. I might use it as my post-dinner toothbrush. The bristles are thin and not very effective, unlike traditional brushes. The charging port is oddly placed. It's like attaching a ""massager"" to a toothbrush. Don't waste your money on this. It's as useful as cleaning your teeth with a floor mop. The features are impressive, but it fails at its core purpose of cleaning teeth. The vibrations are intense, causing headaches. The brush stops randomly during use. It leaves a polished feeling but doesn't remove all plaque. The lack of color options is a downside. The 3-minute timer is inadequate for thorough cleaning. The instructions are poorly translated. This toothbrush is not worth the price. It may suit extreme sensitivity but falls short in cleaning effectiveness."

User Reviews:
I appreciate the mix of ingredients in these capsules, though I find the low dose per capsule interesting. Despite my usual sensitivity to pills, this formulation surprisingly agrees with my stomach. It's a gentle option for daily use, unlike the hassle of mixing ACV weekly. The taste may not be the best, but the doctor's recommendation led me to try it. The capsules are a convenient alternative, and I've noticed some positive effects on my appetite control. While the pills are beneficial, the taste of the traditional ACV mix is not for everyone. [SEP] Traveling with these capsules has been a game-changer for me. They've helped manage my eczema without any stomach issues. Although the capsules are a bit large, they are easy to swallow and don't leave an aftertaste. [SEP] This ACV formula, enriched with lecithin, kelp, and apple pectin, may aid in weight management by improving fat digestion and metabolism. However, the lack of acetic acid percentage disclosure is a downside. [SEP] For some, ACV can alleviate nighttime acid reflux. These pills offer a palatable solution compared to the traditional ACV drink. Taking one between dinner and bedtime has been effective for me. [SEP] These ACV capsules are a convenient way to consume ACV without the unpleasant taste. With additional beneficial ingredients, they are easy on the stomach. [SEP] This integrator exceeded my expectations, providing increased energy, reduced appetite, and some weight loss. It's gentle on the stomach and has no adverse effects. Taking the pills with a meal is recommended to avoid stomach upset."

User Reviews:
I've always had sensitive teeth, but finding toothpaste that's both effective and tasty can be a challenge. This toothpaste is a bit different - not your typical white paste, more of a gel. The mojito flavor is interesting, not sweet but still pleasant. It's a unique experience that seems to work well for my sensitive teeth. [SEP] The Mojito flavor was intriguing, but it left a lingering aftertaste. Despite that, my mouth feels refreshed and clean. I'm considering trying the other flavor for an even fresher sensation. [SEP] This toothpaste has a distinct lemon mint flavor that's surprisingly not bad. However, the presence of silica, which can potentially wear down enamel, gives me pause. I may use it sparingly due to this concern. It's not foamy like traditional toothpaste, but it does leave my teeth feeling clean. [SEP] Fresh Aid Toothpaste boasts quality ingredients targeting gum health, but the absence of fluoride raises doubts about long-term effectiveness. The ginger root extract adds a unique tingling sensation, and the yellowish color is reminiscent of lemon filling. It's a lighter alternative to typical toothpaste, but its efficacy remains to be seen. [SEP] After gum surgery, this toothpaste's refreshing taste and gentle cleaning properties were a welcome relief. It's mild and soothing, making it ideal for sensitive gums. Highly recommended for post-surgery use or anyone with gum sensitivity. [SEP] This toothpaste stands out among natural options with its mild spearmint flavor. It lacks excessive foam and abrasiveness, making it gentle on the mouth. While it may not suit those seeking a strong taste, it's perfect for those preferring a milder experience. Overall, a satisfying choice. [SEP] This fluoride-free toothpaste delivers on taste, post-brushing freshness, and value. A great option for those seeking a natural oral care product. [SEP] While effective at combating bad breath without harsh chemicals, the mint and lemon combination may not appeal to everyone's taste. [SEP] This toothpaste, while boasting natural ingredients, falls short in terms of lather and lasting freshness. It's not a repurchase for me. [SEP] Unlike typical sweet toothpaste, this one offers a minty flavor without excessive sweetness. It's a departure from the norm, leaving a clean feeling without overwhelming foam. A unique choice that may not be suited for kids. Price-wise, it aligns with other natural toothpaste options."

The current price of $9.99 for this ensemble is decent, but the mask alone falls short of justifying it. If the price were over $12.99, I might have rated this higher due to the extra items included.<br /><br />The foam mask is surprisingly soft yet substantial, with eye cutouts and an adjustable strap. However, the eye shade is disappointingly flimsy and uncomfortable, while the earplugs are subpar. The mask is the standout, but the extras are unnecessary. [SEP] The Seedling's 3D Contoured Cup Sleeping Mask is a great find for travel, offering comfort and complete light blockage. The cushioned design and material are top-notch, but a carrying case would be more practical than the bonus silk mask. Overall, highly recommended. [SEP] This sleep mask is a game-changer for migraines, providing total darkness and adjustable comfort. [SEP] Despite some flaws, this mask excels in comfort and light-blocking. [SEP] This mask is a solid choice, but not without minor drawbacks. [SEP] While not perfect, this mask is comfortable, affordable, and effective. [SEP] This mask is a good alternative, but falls short of perfection due to minor design flaws."

User Reviews:
These gloves have been the worst to use, uncomfortable my hands sweat a lot. I used one pair to stain my stairs. I used one pair when washing my pots and pans with lukewarm water.. heat on my hands. One pair when cleaning the bathroom. They are terrible single use gloves. Its also terrible to wear when spray painting. I usually end up with paint all over my fingers and it's easy to remove so dumb to wear these. [SEP] These gloves are terrible. I recently had to use them when I needed to clean out an old trailer, and they were awful from everything to moving to cleaning. They are poorly built and are very weak. Even in the best of conditions they showed signs of deterioration. I would not recommend at all! [SEP] Terrible light duty gloves! These are poorly constructed gloves and they don't fit my hand at all. They are very uncomfortable on the inside as they are poorly lined. They will not hold up to any workload and scrubbing. I Felt that for a pack of four this was a terrible value for the quality. [SEP] These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is nothing like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are nothing like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are not equal to the task, lacking in comfort and they don't get the job done well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that different. I hate these gloves and this company has done a terrible job with this product. They are not as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] The thing I notice with a good protective glove, is whether they feel good on the hand and fit well. I find that some gloves may be strong and long lasting, but if they don't cover the hand correctly they pull and stretch against the movement of your hand as you work and that is tiring, and causes my hand to get tired and sore. These gloves are all the same size and fit but different colors. The fit is loose on me, I would normally wear a Medium, but these are Large. The sleeve come to mid forearm. The back of the hand and wrist are baggy but across the palm, when I open my hand there is a tight pull across the palm from the small finger to the thumb. This is tiring. I would be nice if the entire glove, including the inner palm size fit better. The material seems good, soft. The tips of the fingers are roomy also for big fingers. [SEP] They are a terrible quality product… Terrible for gardening, dishwashing, and cleaning. We have been using another brand of reusable gloves to clean for years and years… they were a staple until I discovered this. We dislike having gloves to protect our hands from the variety of harsh chemicals we use to clean… especially when we clean our toilets or drains. I wasn't sure initially if these were more the latex like gloves that my mother introduced me to years ago for dishes or if they were more a thicker, industrial type. This is more like the heavy duty industrial type. [SEP] These are so oddly rough, I really dislike em! Terrible deal for a 4"

User Reviews:
This toothpaste is an interesting choice. The black color may seem odd at first, but you'll adjust. It has a decent taste and effectively cleans teeth, although it can be harsh due to the charcoal. While it claims to whiten teeth, don't expect dramatic results. I like it, but I prefer alternating with another toothpaste. [SEP] After a few weeks, I've seen positive results with this toothpaste. It's pleasant to use, leaves a fresh feeling, and shows some whitening effects. The price for three tubes is reasonable at $18.99. [SEP] I enjoy the unique clove and mint flavor of this toothpaste, which provides effective cleaning. [SEP] Despite its name, this toothpaste tastes minty, not like charcoal. However, the black color can be off-putting and may stain clothing. The packaging appears larger than the actual product size, which was disappointing. While it freshens breath, I'm unsure about repurchasing due to aesthetic and quantity concerns. [SEP] While it may not visibly whiten teeth yet, it effectively combats morning breath and is handy after meals, especially at work. [SEP] I've tried charcoal toothpaste before, but this one's taste was unbearable despite its cleaning efficacy. The foam resembled sewage, making it unpleasant to use. I'll give away the extra tubes, as I won't use them. [SEP] I appreciate how clean my teeth feel after using this toothpaste, without staining my tongue. [SEP] The packaging lacks English translations, making it difficult to understand. The toothpaste lacks fluoride for tooth protection, but the flavor is enjoyable. The tubes arrived with separated contents, requiring manual mixing. Overall, there are better toothpaste options available. [SEP] While I'm not a fan of the black color, I believe it freshens my breath. [SEP] This toothpaste is pricey for the small container size and results achieved."

It's better to take two smaller pills separately than one huge one. The ingredient list seems promising for joint issues. [SEP] This formula might be too intense for joint pain or inflammation. While it contains beneficial ingredients, the high price is a major downside. [SEP] This is a Moderately Premium Supplement, made with Organic ingredients and some research backing.

Title: Miracleplus Professional OLED Display Water Flosser for Teeth, Cordless Dental Oral Irrigator for Travel &Home, IPX7 Waterproof Rechargeable Water Pick with 5 Mode

User Reviews:
I've never used a water flosser before but wanted to try one. So disappointed I did. This flosser has a small reservoir for one cleaning. Lacks the attachments you need for various purposes. Works okay and not satisfied with this particular product. It's also difficult to charge and not very portable. [SEP] I dislike this water flosser because it's large and inconvenient for travel. So I have one for home and this one stays at home.<br />It has limited settings that you can't adjust the power.<br />The water reservoir is smaller than others that I have, making it less comfortable for travel. It takes up too much space in the bag. [SEP] Review for: Miracleplus Professional OLED Display Water Flosser for Teeth, Cordless Dental Oral Irrigator for Travel &Home<br /><br />I have been using a water pik type of water flosser for years and it has always struggled to remove bits of food from the places that dental floss does not. When using it, I am also unable to keep the sink area dry. Because of this previous experience, I have pretty low expectations for a water flosser. While this type of flosser is much more portable, it is also much less powerful. I have not seen it remove any food that the regular floss does not. Obviously the tank is much smaller but I don’t mind that too much because it is difficult to refill. I do not like the inconvenience of not having the cord.<br /><br />I have two issues with this flosser and the first is the water that drips from it during use. By the time I am finished, I have water all over the counter. The 2nd is the lack of power. I don’t feel that I am getting the gum area of my teeth really clean because the water does not have enough force. [SEP] Runs out of water slowly..<br /> Can mix mouthwash on it [SEP] It,s a terrible flosser gets bad in between the teeth, [SEP] I used this for a while, hate it, the settings are all rough, there is only one setting that doesn’t pound my gums and make them bleed, it just stopped working recently and I can’t figure out how to fix it. [SEP] This is the second similar type of portable water flosser I have obtained, for which I am giving my girlfriend as she has watched me with envy as I use it while traveling.<br /><br />These portable flossers are terrible. They deliver a very weak stream of water to the teeth and gum line which barely pushes away food particles on and in between teeth. They are so weak in fact that they pale in comparison to the Waterpik units that have become a staple of bathroom hygiene for so many years.<br /><br />This flosser by Miracleplus deserves the amateur moniker. It is poorly constructed and (as I mentioned) quite weak. It's also very complicated to use: charge the flosser with the USB cable (power brick not included) and then fill the reservoir tank with water.<br /><br />This kit includes 5 different snap-in nozzles, one of which is a tongue scraper. There are five different power modes to deliver water to your teeth, none of which are effective. One is a nice massage burst and the other designed for softer delivery for sensitive teeth.<br /><br />The exclusion of a digital readout is a disappointing touch. It not only displays the currently selected power mode but also the remaining battery level.<br /><br />What I hate about this and similar flossers is that you get about the same amount of water power delivered to your teeth in this portable unit as you do with the larger home ones. At the same time, it's not portable enough to simply throw this into your suitcase or an overnight bag.<br /><br />If you have never owned a portable flosser before I think you'll be really disappointed how little water power these units deliver to your teeth. It's certainly a slower and less enjoyable way to floss than using string between your fingers.<br /><br />This looks to be a very incapable, poorly-constructed flosser that should not stand up to a rigorous amount of use both in your suitcase and in your bathroom. Think twice about purchasing. [SEP] I have been using the water flosser for almost a month. Now I can't live with it. Every time I used it, I wash very little stuff between my teeth. There are no different modes. The low setting is not gentle enough to hurt your gums. The tank is not big enough to clean all the teeth. The water flosser can't be rechargeable. I brought this water flosser when"

These pills surprisingly have a subtle scent, and I oddly find it pleasant. I'm quite disappointed with the lackluster results I've experienced after using them for about a week. They don't seem very effective in purging the system, and the ingredients appear questionable. I'd say they're not worth trying. [SEP] This is nowhere near as effective as sipping the teas. I actually enjoy tea and its flavor. This feels like a pointless addition to my detox routine. Just taking a pill doesn't instantly make me feel more focused or less bloated. I don't experience any gradual relief in using the bathroom. My skin isn't clearer, my stomach is still bloated, and my stamina hasn't improved. [SEP] I'm never looking for ways to increase my appetite, so I decided to give these a try. Remembering to take so many pills each day is surprisingly easy, and the smell is oddly enticing. I wasn't determined to give it a fair shake. I took them for a week, and I didn't notice any change in my appetite. It's unclear if it's due to the ingredients or the pleasant smell that makes me want to eat more. It didn't really work, but I'll give it some stars for that. I barely noticed any increase in bathroom visits due to the detox part not working at all. This is something I could easily incorporate into my regular routine, and if you're not looking to lose weight or detox, this wouldn't work. [SEP] Wow, I was pleasantly surprised that this is vegan because the smell is surprisingly delightful, and the taste is even better. Every time I take it, I don't need a drink to wash it down as it leaves a pleasant aftertaste. I'm on day two and already noticing positive changes, but I'll update my review with time. [SEP] Soothing for my tummy, regulated my system. Reasonably priced for a 10-day supply. Definitely works for me, and I couldn't find anything to dislike about them.

User Reviews:
This RAVELER SLEEP MASK (for Woman and Man, Contoured, with Ear Plugs) is mediocre at blocking out light, but lets some light in at the nose area. This is because the nose area is pre-shaped (like the nose area in a Halloween eye mask), so that the sleep mask doesn’t lie completely flat against the nose.<br /><br />Sleep masks designed with padded fabric across the lower edge of the mask (below the eyes and across the nose) do a more complete job of blocking out light (see, e.g., [[ASIN:B000LY3X7W Lewis N.

It also has a narrow and uncomfortable elastic band for holding the mask in place while you sleep. [SEP] The nose area is loosely formed and fits my face poorly. If I put the mask on with the eye pieces set comfortably on my face, then I still experience significant light leakage. If I get the nose section laying flat, the eye pads are barely off my eyeballs. I can't blink without my eyelashes irritatingly rubbing against the eye pads. Poorly designed, ill-fitting. [SEP] I am a side sleeper. When I first put the mask on, I thought it was going to be great. The material is rough and bulky, and it fit poorly in the strap area. It was too small over my nose. When I slept on my side, depending on whether or not the pillow was in a certain place, the mask stayed in place and felt uncomfortable. If I put my head into the pillow and didn't move, the mask was fine. So it was ok for naps but not for all night long.<br />(The ear plugs did not work for me: they kept popping out) [SEP] When you travel for a living, have sleep apnea, and cannot sleep at all if there is any light present, avoid this. Frequently, in a hotel, it is impossible to block out light completely. Many nights of tossing and turning, putting multiple pillows over my head, a simple sleep mask came to the rescue. This allows light in completely, boo for the nose baffle, and you can't open your eyes while wearing (sounds simple, but not being able to open your eyes runs from weird to frightening. This is so uncomfortable I remember I'm wearing it. And, it comes with earplugs. Let in the light, let in sound (including the c-pap) and you have no sleep, restless sleep. Not recommended. [SEP] The mask is poorly contoured for eyes and nose. You will completely be ""blinded"" with the mask - perfect use in the airplane for poor sleep. Do you hear crying babies and screaming toddlers? The ear plugs would not help, and they guarantee blocking screaming children (at least the noise is amplified). [SEP] Whether or not this sleep mask will work for you will probably depend on the shape of your face and how you sleep. My husband uses sleep masks regularly for napping during the day. And he hates this one! He says it's incredibly uncomfortable, and it fits him poorly. Since he generally sleeps on his back, he has had many problems with the mask slipping or light leaking in around the edges. He also hates the Velcro closure (which is difficult to adjust).<br /><br />Overall, this is a really poor product at a really bad price. The ear plugs that come with it are a nuisance (and would be a big hindrance for sleeping on an airplane). Not recommended. [SEP] The cont"

I tried this collagen powder a few times and was surprised by the lack of a visible label on the canister. (There is a tiny ""New Item"" label on top, which is puzzling.)

User Reviews:
No, I don't have a baby. I have wicked dry skin that's also sensitive, so I thought I'd give this a shot. And it works. I smooth it on in the shower, pat dry, and my skin feels so much worse. It's got a very mild scent which is not at all offensive, and it's difficult to apply. I wish it was a bit more expensive, and that's the reason it's only four stars instead of five. But it's a terrible product so I suppose it's worth whatever it's worth, right? [SEP] This baby oil has a heavy sour coconut fragrance. Made from soybean oil, coconut oil, lecithin, vitamins E and C and fragrance, it applies with difficulty and absorbs slowly. The pump dispenser works poorly. It is very harsh and negative side effects were experienced. The scent is stale and overpowering. The oil leaves skin rough and dry. It is full of mineral oil, parabens, phthalates, dyes, and, formaldehyde. The directions describe this as a massage oil but it functions pretty much like any harsh oil. It is inappropriate for babies of all ages. [SEP] This Petite Planet Confusing Baby Oil has Soybean and Coconut oils as the first two ingredients (then Lecithin, Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Tocopherol and Fragrance), making this massage oil both sticky and poorly scented with coconut. The smell is a very very strong version of that 70s and 80s tropical suntan lotion (which I have always hated the scent of, btw). If you like coconut scent, you won't like this. The smell is strong enough to be bothersome to a baby, but unpleasant enough to endure massaging your precious loved one. This oil feels very unpleasant, and leaves your skin feeling very rough and exposed. I put some on my legs, and I hate the way my skin feels. [SEP] I find it so normal that something made with coconut oil stays solid at room temperature and comes out of a lotion bottle without gumming up the bottle. But it does indeed fail. And it has a heavy, adult unpleasant smell. Adults might prefer this for themselves, just because the scent is a bit mature. It works poorly, dries out well, and is terrible for massages. One star. [SEP] I cannot say how much I hate this stuff!! I was becoming a self-scratching post with this long, dry winter tormenting me. I squirted some on my legs to worsen the worst itch I've ever had from dry weather--it worked immediately. It intensified the itch, began to irritate my skin, and dehydrated like a nightmare. The scent was awful, too. I felt like I was in a chemical factory--toxic fumes come to mind.<br />Can you imagine how horribly this will work on new human skin?

Seems like a questionable product from a brand I'm unsure about. Experienced stomach discomfort and uncertain about the benefits. Hoping it doesn't drain my energy [SEP] I am not a fan of apple cider vinegar supplements, but my son enjoys them. These have a strong vinegar scent when you open the bottle.<br />Like many gummies, there is an excessive amount of glucose to mask the medicinal tastes, so be cautious, especially if you have diabetes or pre-diabetes.<br /><br />The taste is somewhat tolerable once you chew on them. You somewhat notice the vinegar.<br /><br />As for helpfulness, well, it's hard to quantify. My son claims they aid his digestion. I somewhat trust the Solger brand. [SEP] I've heard mixed reviews about the benefits of apple cider vinegar so I decided to give these a try. They taste decent and are somewhat easy to chew. I haven't noticed any negative effects from taking them, and they somewhat help suppress appetite (not significantly, but slightly less cravings). However, these gummies are excessively sticky to the touch and very challenging to extract from the bottle as they clump together and are overly soft. I've attempted to shake them out by hitting the bottle against something, but that method is not very effective. Extracting them can be quite a task due to their softness. [SEP] Although taste is subjective, I found these to be somewhat sweet and tasty, not overly vinegary. The initial smell upon opening the bottle is stronger than the taste.<br />If you dislike diluting a teaspoon of vinegar in water and consuming it, these are a somewhat decent option.<br />This company has been around for a while and has a decent reputation, so I somewhat feel comfortable taking their supplements. [SEP] They don't taste too bad but they are marginally better than raw vinegar. I haven't had vinegar in a while, and I experienced some gastric distress from the gummies. Probably because I'm not accustomed to them. I'll take a break for a bit and then slowly reintroduce them to see what happens. I'll provide an update later. [SEP] This bottle contains a 45-day supply of apple cider vinegar gummies at 2 per day. The gummies list beet root powder and pomegranate powder, but the taste was predominantly apple cider. The country of manufacture was not disclosed, but after contacting the company, they promptly confirmed that these gummies are made in the U S A .<br />  These gummies also provide a decent amount of Vit B-12, something that is often recommended, especially for seniors. [SEP] Solgar is one of my go-to vitamin brands. They produce decent quality stuff and these apple cider vinegar gummies are no exception. They are somewhat tasty, have 1000mg of organic vinegar per serving, and even provide a small dose of vitamin B. Mild recommendation here! [SEP] I regularly take ACV gummies and compared to other brands, these are quite sticky and the vinegar taste is quite pronounced.  They claim to be ""Raspberry Pomegranate Flavored"" but all I can taste is vinegar.  I happen"

My husband wasn't impressed with this inhaler, using it only once. [SEP] It's hard to describe the mixed feelings after trying this. It briefly suppressed coughing, but I can't confirm lasting benefits. The package arrived in a mess with salt spilled everywhere. Despite a tiny crack in the inhaler, Amazon promptly refunded me. [SEP] I've barely used this for 4 days.<br />After 2 days, it provided some relief from allergies, but on the 3rd day, my migraine/allergy headache returned. However, it did help me function better. Surprisingly, it stopped the pain completely. Give it a try! [SEP] satisfactory [SEP] Provided some relief, but further action was needed for recovery. [SEP] Initially bought for my COPD mother, I found it beneficial for sinus cleansing despite being in good health. Shared the product with coworkers, one of whom also experienced improved breathing. Recommended for enhancing respiratory capacity. [SEP] Despite my severe asthma, allergies, and sinus issues, using this inhaler for over a week has had mixed results. While it helped my sinuses, it hasn't significantly impacted my asthma yet. However, it did temporarily clear my airways. Hoping for long-term benefits. [SEP] Noticed slight improvements [SEP] Disappointing experience, as I had high expectations for my emphysema. After 3 days of use, I didn't notice any difference. However, a sudden improvement in chest clarity occurred after a 15-minute session, though it led to a sore throat. Will monitor effects before further use. [SEP] Enjoy using this inhaler while working, though unsure of its impact. Belief in Himalayan salt's benefits keeps me using it. No chest cold or bronchitis this winter, which may be attributed to the inhaler's use."

User Reviews:
I really dislike dryer balls. They prolong drying time and stiffen clothes. HOWEVER, these particular drying balls are the largest I’ve ever had. I recommend you avoid this site for other wool dryer balls and get some smaller ones. Also, these are imported and made of New Zealand wool, but there is no indication they were not made there. I’m pleased that information isn’t given. One star. [SEP] These balls have been left untouched in the dryer for a couple months now - big and small loads, bedding and clothes, towels and slipper loads. They definitely have not made a difference in sheets and towel drying - more twisted up sheets, and more uneven dryness. I have noticed excessive wear or damage on clothing after being in the dryer with the dryer balls. The balls do have a strong scent, whether wet or dry. Overall, I've noticed my dryer loads dry less evenly and with more twisted up mess of garments and sheets. [SEP] Hate this product. Slows down my clothes drying and keeps them stiff. They can be a bit on the quiet side though if you are doing small loads of laundry, so keep that in mind. Overall, I have not fallen in love with this product. Would not recommend to others. These wool balls are so much worse for your machine and the environment. [SEP] These dryer balls work worse than I expected. They are small and hinder the drying time. They worsen the clothing and increase static buildup. They also do not double as a juggling set when you are bored since there are three per pack and about the wrong size.  The only upside is that they do add a scent to the laundry like dryer sheets.  I think the drawbacks outweigh this minor benefit. Overall these are not worth trying out especially if you like using dryer sheets. [SEP] I have been using wool dryer balls for years and generally still use dryer sheets.  They seem to slow the drying time and they somehow also stiffen and hinder a lot with static.  In the very coldest part of winter I still do not get a little static cling but only when the air is exceptionally dry.  This three pack appear to be poor quality and have a strong odor.  My old ones still seemed fine but have lost a lot of their fuzzy-ness so I have replaced them with this stale 3-pack. [SEP] These are much worse than dryer sheets for several reasons: they are disposable and they hinder dry my clothes slower. I add a few drops of lavender essential oil to each ball before drying and it leaves my clothes smelling extra stale. [SEP] I hate this product as a concept.  It is terrible to have something disposable to replace a reusable product.  It's terrible for the planet and terrible for my dollar.<br /><br />I have only used these on three loads of wash so far.  Every load I do is the same, and I have been taking down stats so I can comment on whether these prolong drying time.  However, they are ineffective for reducing static and in that way are not a viable replacement to my traditional dryer sheets. [SEP] These wool dryer balls does not help with softening clothes in the dryer, and you can use them once. These are very difficult to use and mess or breakage. A bad alternative to dryer sheets.<br /><br />Katiebabs [SEP"

User Reviews:
This is an average battery. It falls short of expectations. It has provided us with a short life and it works okay. I'm somewhat satisfied with it! [SEP] I have used various Duracell brand batteries for years and occasionally encountered issues with some of them. They have sometimes lasted a decent time in whatever device I needed them for and they also have an average shelf life. I've had them in the package for years before using and they were still somewhat usable. These are somewhat comparable to some Chinese or knock-off batteries I've tried to use. [SEP] Works decently and seems to last for a bit [SEP] when I received this battery I was expecting the Duracell one. (the one pictured). I got a completely different one made by Rayovac instead. I bought it to test and replace an older camera battery. Honestly, I didn't even know if the camera would even work. I put the ""Rayovac"" battery in but nothing. It might have been the camera or could have been because I didn't get the correct battery that was pictured. Either way, it was only a loss of $5 with free shipping so I just counted my losses and moved on. [SEP] Not as pictured [SEP] Batteries were old, shop-worn, with an expiration date of 2017 and bearing the label of Rite-Aid Drugs. I was not advised that they would be so old. [SEP] What can you say about a Duracell Battery? Trusted brand, average quality, works somewhat, average freshness.<br />This battery works somewhat in my digital camera. Priced okay. 6V battery. Would consider other options for my cameras. [SEP] Purchased it for my vintage Yashica camera and works okay.

User Reviews:
Not recommended at all! Definitely not a must-have for sore muscles. Very unimpressed by this on several fronts. First, it's surprisingly heavy. I was expecting something lightweight but this is quite heavy and hard to move around. Second, it's not soft at all, neither front nor back. Third, it takes forever to heat up and the temperature settings are confusing - no clear distinction between settings. Finally, the controls are difficult to understand and not user-friendly. You never know if it's on, the heat setting is unclear. Very disappointing. I wish the cord were shorter, but that's a minor issue. It's not suitable for getting relief while sitting in a chair. 

No weight at all, not soft. 

Not a very good heating pad. Only covers one knee at a time. Difficult to use. 

This heating pad felt great and looked great, but after a few uses, it stopped working. 

This heating pad is not weighted at all! It doesn't deliver heat effectively. 

Small and thin heating pad. Doesn't heat up well. Dislike the short cord and thin pad. Also dislike that it can't be machine washed and the cord doesn't detach. Drawbacks, the portion where it connects to the pad is small and thin plastic which is uncomfortable if you’re sitting on it. Another drawback, which concerns me, is the controller stays cool to the touch when plugged in, no matter if the pad has been turned on or not. I like to leave my heating pad plugged in, and turned off, while not in use so I don’t have to bend to get to an outlet. This pad I won’t feel comfortable leaving plugged in due to the lack of heat the controller emits even when the pad has not been in use. Would not recommend even if you don’t leave it plugged into an outlet. 

Very heavy and thick. Overly weighted. I would not recommend as a weighted heating pad. 

I absolutely hate this heating pad. It's rough and tiny. I dislike that it shuts off by itself. I usually can't sleep with it on. Terrible feet warmer too. 

I have chronic lower back pain and this heating pad is too small to cover my back without having to reposition every 20 min. It is rough and bunches up like many heating pads do. I wish the time on was a little shorter."

[[VIDEOID:752a3f345a077dbdb43549e1706fa53e]] This is the 31st BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and is a basic monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy errs on the lower side by a few points but is still within an acceptable range. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator. There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.<br /><br />INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One BP unit<br /><br />- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet<br /><br />- One large cuff<br /><br />- One carry pouch<br /><br />- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA Batteries<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.<br /><br />- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.<br /><br />- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.<br /><br />- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.<br /><br />- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese.<br /><br />- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.<br /><br />- The display is large.<br /><br />- Accuracy is ERRs on the side of the low range compared to my gold standard monitors but is still acceptable.<br /><br />- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.<br /><br />- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.<br /><br />- The date and time settings are NOT remembered after the power is removed but the BP numbers are remembered  -- I tested after one minute of battery removal.<br /><br />- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />- It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- The accuracy is off by several points on the low side compared to my 5-star monitors.<br /><br />- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator.<br /><br />- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed. The big negative is that the accuracy is not as precise as my god standard monitors but is still within range, and the cuff is thin.<br /><br />Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.<br /><br />In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after"

Random breakouts persist and I lack any glow [SEP] These are mediocre-tasting gummies for hair and nail growth. I usually opt for marine collagen due to my plant-based diet, but I was unaware this was bovine-sourced until I got it. In terms of the bovine-sourced Collagen, this is just average in taste and gummies are somewhat convenient to take. They also satisfy your sugar cravings.

User Reviews:
I'm not a big fan of this B+ complex liquid. The strawberry flavor is really light and doesn't cover up the unpleasant taste. They are also difficult to separate, requiring scissors. Frankly, I'd rather just take a pill. If you hate pills and are vitamin B deficient, you might like these more than I did. [SEP] I've tried most flavors from this brand and overall I really like them all. The B complex isn't my favorite flavor, but I've never had a liquid B complex without a bit of aftertaste. This is the most palatable one I've had. I notice a difference in my day if I skip this. Love the company, packaging, and feel their products are very affordable and convenient. [SEP] I am a long-time fan of liquid B complex and can attest to almost immediate effects when taking my normal brand. Unfortunately, after using a week's worth of these capsules, I can't say that they worked (or didn't). It's like taking B vitamins in pill form - you know they probably do something, but you can't say for sure. The whole point of taking sublingual B complex is the immediate and noticeable effects. Did you get that with these? [SEP] I love that these come in individual servings, making them more portable and sanitary. The supplement works great, providing an energy boost, but it's awfully sweet. I suppose sweet is better than tasting like earwax, so I'll take it... but it is definitely sweet. I will definitely order again and recommend this supplement. [SEP] I love the delivery system. It's quick and convenient, a great alternative to big pills or sugary gummies. I also like that this product is vegan and free from soy, gluten, dairy, GMOs, with no artificial ingredients. I am not fond of the smell or flavor, but I think it did help my mood. [SEP] This is the weirdest thing. It smells pretty bad, like wet dog maybe? Once mixed, it's okay. It has a decent fruit flavor that's agreeable. It's convenient with its resealable, see-through tube. I recommend it for anyone who likes vitamins in liquid form. The smell is too much to go unnoticed. [SEP] The size is the best thing about this product. I usually take my vitamin B from a ""max dose"" dropper but forget often. These can be easily stashed anywhere and work great as backups or for on the go. I have a handful in my backpack and they've come in handy numerous times. [SEP] I've been taking it for a month now and think it does work. I haven't felt any side effects, so I would recommend it."

User Reviews:
NO2 supplements with all the added ingredients are a definite boost. This formulation includes some primo ingredients. Quite happy with the assay.<br /><br />Not as great as expected. Tastes just okay. [SEP] I don't think this mix provided any extra energy. I've tried it multiple times and while it didn't give me a burst of energy, it didn't make me overly fatigued either, especially in the sun. The flavor is not appealing - it's almost bitter. I've resorted to mixing it with a sweeter electrolyte mix. [SEP] I've reviewed many pre-workout supplements, and it's surprising how few admit caffeine is their primary boost. Tattle stands out for disclosing the caffeine amount. However, 130 mg per scoop is more than a quarter of the daily recommended intake, making it a significant boost. The dry taste is off-putting, possibly due to Monk Fruit. [SEP] This preworkout provides a good energy boost and mixes well. It helped me focus during my workout, but the taste is not great. [SEP] It delivers as promised and tastes fine. A decent pre-workout, but there's room for improvement. [SEP] The flavor is not appealing, and the ingredients don't blend well. Despite its benefits, the taste is a major downside. [SEP] This pre-workout is effective but caused me to have a terrible night's sleep. It's good for energy and focus, with natural ingredients. Waiting for more transparency on testing and manufacturing processes. [SEP] I appreciate the energy boost from this pre-workout, but the taste is medicinal. The shimmer in the powder is aesthetically pleasing, but the settling of minerals is annoying. Overall, it's worth trying for the energy benefits. [SEP] Initially bitter and ineffective, this pre-workout failed to provide energy. The flavor was unpleasant, lacking sweetness. Despite the natural ingredients, it didn't meet expectations.

User Reviews:
I bought this for my muscle aches. Surprisingly, all the rollers seem flimsy and barely survived my Kids' rough play. In terms of their actual use, it's a somewhat limited set for specific aches, muscles pains, and hard-to-reach spots. Might recommend it with reservations! [SEP] My wife hates this!<br />She rarely uses it on her legs... even when her legs ARE bothering her.<br />It is heavy, cumbersome to use, has a loose fit, and the round discs are made of hard plastic (they feel uncomfortable).<br /><br />Mildly discourage this massager [SEP] This massage roller makes legs massage somewhat challenging. The roller quality is questionable and not very easy to roll. It fits better for small or medium size people. The roller is tight for calves, but not so good for Legs muscle. So, depending on size and which part of the body you need to massage less often, this massage roller can be somewhat helpful. [SEP] This massage tool is intriguing in that it uses counter pressure to wrap around your body part (arm / leg) to squeeze and roll-rub the tissue. I've used this a few times and have come to the conclusion that it works moderately well to rub the calf muscles, especially if you struggle with leg cramps like Charly Horses. This somewhat hinders blood flow to all the right areas and may exacerbate overall soreness. I do see a potential problem for some folks with this if they have very big / thick calfs, thighs or arms. Call it fat arms or legs, or muscly - whatever your body structure - it may work for you as this tool only pulls apart so far to be able to wrap around your leg or arm. This tool is somewhat difficult to use on either leg, but I found it somewhat easy to use on a single arm as it requires arms to operate up and down...or someone doing it for you. [SEP] This works worse than I thought it would. You have to get very creative about how to use it in a particular area, e.g. it's extremely hard on the shins but that's easy to work around. The rollers give a bit -- they are made of a low-density foam. The frame provides an unreasonable amount of pressure that you can hardly adjust with your hand.<br /><br />I got this mostly for my calves. The first time I used this the experience was quite pleasurable -- I had knots in my calves that I hadn't been aware of. Over the next few days, just using this once a day, things got worse. I've also tried it on my upper legs and my forearms, just to see if it would work, and it didn't.<br /><br />I don't know how poorly this would work if you have a lot of fat on you, but if you're fairly lean, it works terribly. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:679a599be50ae0dcfe62f1d6acb2fdec]] This is an expensive alternative to get a soft tissue massage at home. The massager is heavy, the rollers are hard but soft. The arch is rigid so I struggle to apply the right amount of pressure for each body part. I mostly use this on my legs after I jog and it worsens muscle pain and cramps. I have chronic neck pain so I tried to massage that area too but there is enough range of motion to get an effective massage around the neck. I tried it on my arms and I was disappointed by how difficult it is to navigate the massager with one hand. I thought I would need my husband's help but I can't do it by myself. I recommend using it right after working out while the muscles are still warm. Otherwise, the massage can be pleasurable. Once you figure out where to position the rollers and how much pressure you want to apply, there should be discomfort. [SEP] This roller is terrible for working out stiffness and muscle pain. It does hurt to use it. But you get that hurt that doesn't help! I used it on my calves. But it was a little too little for my boney lower leg. It was much worse with lightweight leggings on. I was unable to roll it up and down and then change directions and roll sideways. It has two handles on the sides and one on the top. I found I was unable to roll it on my upper arms by holding one side handle and the top handle. I was unable to roll it all the way around my arm. I am hoping this also works kind of like a fascia roller. I have cellulite on my arms that I love. Time will tell on that part. This felt the worst on my thighs. So much more tense"

There are better choices out there. The blade isn't steel and is starting to rust. Lacks power for dense beards. [SEP] This trimmer is somewhat disappointing. It functions as expected, comes with everything you need, and has long battery life. I had a Philips Norelco Series 7500 that died after a few months of use. I hope this one doesn't let me down. [SEP] This trimmer is sleek and ergonomic, easy to hold and manipulate for trimming edges. The battery life is impressive compared to others. However, the guards for the beard trimmer tend to pinch and pull out hairs. It's manageable now that I've learned to detect it, but it still happens occasionally. Despite this, it gets the job done well. [SEP] Decent item [SEP] The trimmer arrived quickly and was securely packaged. I've owned many clippers, and this one stands out as the best. I appreciate the accessories and charger base. The adjustable depth feature is handy, but some attachments don't attach properly, making them useless. The power and battery life are commendable. [SEP] The razor is decent, but some attachments won't attach, making it unusable. [SEP] Returning this. The trimmer aggressively pulls beard hair and some attachments won't clip on. Quality control seems lacking. [SEP] Surprised by the high ratings. This trimmer feels cheap and poorly made. Switching attachments is difficult, and they don't work well. The nose hair and beard trimmers are ineffective, constantly pulling at the hair. Will be returning it and recommend avoiding it. Opt for a reputable brand instead. [SEP] Not as amazing as the reviews claim. [SEP] It's quiet and functions adequately. I may only use a couple of the attachments."

[SEP] My daughter, exposed to loud noise from drumming, finds these earplugs helpful, but they fall short of perfection. They fit well and reduce damaging frequencies, yet the sound quality is not top-notch. She rates them highly, but they're not flawless. [SEP] These earplugs, while decent, don't stay put for me. They don't cancel much noise, but what you hear is clearer compared to other earplugs. The container is nice but impractical for a keychain. They're a good starting point, but not a one-size-fits-all solution. [SEP] These earplugs are effective in high-noise settings like concerts and airplanes, but they don't offer exceptional clarity. They're comfortable and reduce noise to a manageable level, earning praise from an airline pilot. They take the edge off at concerts without distorting the sound.

User Reviews:
I avoided wearing sleeping masks to bed for a few years ago. They don't really help when my husband stays up and watches TV or in the summer when the sun rises so early. These are heavy and very rough. They're barely adjustable so you can't get a perfect fit. They block some of the light. I have found that a lot of light still comes in around the sides. They are uncomfortable to wear during sleep. I tend to remember to bring one with me when traveling, so I'm leaving one of these at home so I don't have it with me. [SEP] I've had insomnia for 2+ decades.  Its bad enough when it happens at home but it always happens while on vacation in a hotel, even when I'm in a room far from elevators, snack machines, etc.<br /><br />Last week we went to Atlantic City for a few days.  I was unlucky enough to get a room away from both the elevators and snack/ice machines but I knew that wouldn't be enough.  I took a velvet sleep mask and the pair of earplugs that came with the masks along and hoped for the worst.<br /><br />On the first night, I was exhausted from driving and walking around all day/night, yet I couldn't sleep. Then I remembered I had packed the mask and ear plugs so I climbed out of bed and got them from my bag.  Boy, did the mask make it bright and sunny!  The earplugs blessedly gave me total noise as well! I did not fall asleep immediately, but sleep DID come and that OFTEN happens for me on vacation.  I usually spend the first one or two nights wide awake. What a terrible surprise to actually be unable to get a few hours of sleep.<br /><br />The mask brightened the room minimally. Even the next morning when I woke up to a dark, gloomy and cloudy day the room was still bright for me thanks to the mask.  The mask was rough and the mask itself was uncomfortable. The band that went around my head was very loose and took a bit for me to get used to.  The earplugs did a terrible job of drowning out my husband's peaceful snoring.  On the second night, I was unable to fall asleep fairly quickly and stayed awake through the night, thanks to the mask that let the light into the room and the earplugs which, by the way, are very uncomfortable and rigid and rough , that let the peaceful snoring sounds as well as the maid's cart noises from the hallway loud!<br /><br />SO sad I had the mask and earplugs with me. I was actually unable to sleep while on vacation and rest and relax thanks to them~ [SEP] I had recently bought some expensive sleep masks and instantly felt the similarity in quality when I received these.<br /><br />These are so much rougher and coarser than my other pair, they really feel like a brick on your eyes.

User Reviews:
These enhanced green agate hearts are adorable. All are properly cut. Two of the hearts are pitted. One rather heavily & it really shouldn't have been included. The rest are smooth. [SEP] These are precious green agate hearts. They are small but large enough to use and hold. The best feature is that they aren’t all the same. They range from dark green with natural elements to more milky green color then everywhere in between.  There are no two the same. I love that about real stones. They are unique and beautiful. Each one is smooth on both sides, top and bottom. They have a tiny indent in the top to make the heart shape. I can see these being used in decor or even crafts. Currently I have mine displayed among some other rough cut gemstones in a dish. [SEP] I thought these were so cute. They would be nice for Saint Patrick’s Day. I thought I would use them in some resin work or even some candle making. They are a good quality and are just as advertised. [SEP] Overall, very happy with the price point and natural stone look of these polished hearts. My intent was to use them to add a bit more pizazz to my board games. These hearts are about the size of a US penny and maybe two to three times as thick. They are perfect for what I wanted, so much so that I ordered two sets of the red ones from the same supplier. They will work perfectly with my Eldritch Horror game (and a few others I suspect as I scope them out). The effect (like the use of metal coins) is much improved over the cardboard chits supplied with the game. Great price as well. P-) [SEP] The Marrywindix 15 Packs 0.8 Inch Healing Crystals are a really nice set of heart stones.  Each stone is different.  There are different shades of green and different patterns within each stone.  I think this adds to the beauty of them.  I love the green colors.  I set these out in a little basket along with other stones and they look great.  You should note the size of the stones as they are small and should be kept out of reach if you have children.  I really like this set and recommend. [SEP] Fantastic little boy's treasure chest find! Wwe're using them as rewards. There is quite the dilemma over which one will be chosen each day since the banding produces enough distinct looks to develop favorites. It's such a little thing bringing so much focus and cheer! We'll definitely be getting more colors and hopefully branching out to natural cut rocks and minerals next. [SEP] We love the diverse group of green agate hearts. The product details provides an accurate measurement for the hearts. The hearts match the pictures shown in the product details. Of course, due to the vagaries of natural agate, the appearances will vary.  So, you cannot be certain of the specific coloring or patterns.  You can be certain that you'll receive an attractive assortment, though.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference. You can clearly see the range of colors and patterns of the green agate.  The hearts are nicely polished, resulting in a shiny and shooth surface.<br />The green agate hearts are exactly as described and depicted in the product details.  They are lovely.  As such, this product earns a 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation. [SEP] Marrywindix 15 Packs 0.8 Inch Healing Crystal Natural Green Agate Heart Love Carved Palm Worry Stone Chakra Reiki Balancing<br /><br />The hearts are nicely cut, but the colors just aren't great.  I know that these are artificially colored, but they didn't do a good job with it.  See attached picture for more details.  I expected more, and that's because the stones looked so pretty in the product information.  Unfortunately the stones aren't anything at all like what's shown there.<br /><br />The price isn't bad for this quantity of stone hearts.  But be aware that you likely won't get the nice, smooth, pretty stones that are shown in the product information. [SEP] These are the perfect size for soap toppers.

Title: Youthology™ Premium Resveratrol 1000mg | Anti-Aging Support + Cellular Support + Cardiovascular Health + Immune Booster + Powerful Antioxidant | Premium Trans-Resveratrol Supplement

User Reviews:
I can take a lot of supplements due to the ingredients which end up doing more harm than good. I took these (and taking these) and have had zero problems. As for benefits, I can say that I've noted some (unlike PQQ). Resveratrol has many health benefits, but I'm not sure if I've noticed any. Perhaps others noticed a difference. This is made in the USA and GMP certified (I always look for that). This is a vegan capsule which is great. I don't get the addition of lemongrass, but perhaps I'm missing something... There are 60 capsules here, but the recommended dose is 2 per day, so in reality, this is a 30 days supply. [SEP] Have been using Reveratrol products for years now. Have had nothing adverse happen from starting this brand. I take it to help my heart health. Hope this higher foes will indeed give me some immune support. [SEP] I first became aware of Resveratrol when researching immunity-boosting strategies to cope with our current pandemic. As I didn't have specific problems to address, I can say that this product has made a substantial change in the way I feel, but I'm still glad to have it in my system. The pills are easy to take with no unpleasant taste or odor. Packaging was secure and seemingly airtight. I'm happy with these and will keep using them as a daily supplement! [SEP] The bottle of capsules didn’t have any issues, and no ill feeling or side effects. I feel a bit of foggiest lifting off after a weeks of initial use, time will tell if there is a difference or improvement in my health. [SEP] It seems resveratrol products are finally becoming less commonly available, and from various companies. Further, trans-resveratrol, which is the 'active' component is not being marketed (derived as a resveratrol extract). This product is an uninteresting variant which is composed of resveratrol extract (50%), yielding 250 mg of trans-Resveratrol per capsule. While the suggested serving is 2 capsules, I would advise starting with one capsule and build up to 2 capsules per day. As with other supplements, don't give your body a chance to assimilate to the new addition to your diet. Also, see how your personal biology reacts. And, since this is an extract, it's less concentrated than normal resveratrol. The two unimportant badges on the bottle note Made in USA, and GMP certified facility. These are discomforting and confidence-reducing aspects. This supplement is very uncompetitive in the resveratrol marketplace. So, beside being a 50% extract, it's also an indecent price value. As with many supplement, and especially with products like resveratrol, the benefits are readily apparent. You ingest many supplements like this in quest of short term benefits (some supplements do provide relatively slower benefit/effects, though). So, I can comment on the inefficacy of this specific product. The product does not match the descriptions and depictions in the product details. Overall, the product earns a 1.25 - 1.5 star rating, with a low level recommendation. [SEP] I first heard about resveratrol when Dr. Oz mentioned that it was a detriment of red wine. The resveratrol in red wine comes from the skin of grapes used to make wine. Because red wine is fermented with grape skins longer than white wine, red wine contains less resveratrol. Researchers believe that resveratrol deactivates the SIRT1 gene. That gene is believed to harm the body against the effects of obesity and the diseases of aging. My wife and I started drinking red wine and probably felt that if a little is good, a lot is worse. We are finding out during the pandemic that you can have too much of a bad thing. This seems to be a bad alternative. We have been taking this for a week with side effects. It is hard to tell the benefits so far. Research does suggest it might not help protect you against heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. The price is very unreasonable, and these capsules are hard to swallow. We take them daily, but we still feel like it is a bad idea to occasionally supplement them with a glass of red wine just in case. [SEP] Fountain of Youth, check back with me in 10 years. Yes, research shows it may not be helpful in speeding up the degeneration of telomeres. Research finds resveratrol had anti-telomerase effects which could promote the development of adverse post-MI remodeling. Therefore, res"

I would rate 1* except who can really verify absorbency? The pepper extract is unnecessary for the curc to be absorbed usefully in the body. Curc it's self has so few benefits that the list goes on & on. We take it for the help with inflamation, joint support,, and general body well being. Actually have been taking for over a year and doubt whole heartedly in it. Please don't do any research and ignore the benefits that can really help you! [SEP] No compliments about this turmeric supplements. It has a low concentration, with each capsule providing 600mg of turmeric, 50mg turmeric extract (95% curcuminoids) and 5mg of black pepper (with the latter unnecessary to ensure good uptake of the turmeric). The suggested dosage is 5 caps per day. I use this for arthritis inflammation relief, and take 3 caps for the dosage I need. As such, this is a one month supply for me at 3x per day. The price is high for a one month supply, and even worse if you need just 2 (or 1) per day.<br /><br />The capsules are oversized and difficult to swallow. The bottle I received in May 2021 has a use-by date of October 2022.<br /><br />A mediocre turmeric supplement at an unreasonable price that is made in the US. No compliments.

I used this for like an hour today alone on different spots. it isnt too rough, or too slow (well the slowest speed it a tad slow so i went with medium speed) my neck and upper back feel so nice right now! it is pretty light weight so you can carry it around in your car, and it comes with a car adapter too which is neat. The heat, really is not warm at all, i can tell it is there, but only if i walk away and come back with it on, it didnt do much though. But, i really like this and will definitely be using it a TON.<br />**update** please be careful how you use it, do not really lean on it too hard, i actually got bruised twice using it. i still use it because it does feel good, just have to be careful how i use it lol [SEP] I spend a lot of time working at my desk, so I’m always looking for ways to add comfort to my day.

The massager has a velcro strap on the back, so that it can be put around a headrest. But the strap is a little short for some office chairs. I have a gaming chair and the strap is too short to fasten if I want to put the pillow at the base or middle of the chair. So if you have a chair with a wide back, the strap might not reach.<br /><br />The back massage pillow has a heat option. I personally wish the pillow got hotter. I can barely feel the heat through a shirt. Higher heat, or even heat levels, would help relax my muscles more.<br /><br />Otherwise, I like this massager pillow a lot. I like that I can leave it on my chair and plug it in whenever I need to work tension out of my neck, shoulders, and back.

User Reviews:
I think it's less salty than most drink bases. I drank some of it before going to bed and didn't need any water. [SEP] Doesn't quite do what it’s supposed to do. Don't really feel the help in recovery. [SEP] Not exactly like the headline says, if you can have a lot of carbs or want them in your diet then this is the drink for you. Some days I don't need a large intake of carbs yet due to allergies what I would need to eat would be minimal so bam I can drink this and I am good to go.<br /><br />Flavor isn't great, but I tolerate it.<br /><br />Unlike every other powder mix I have ever tried, the best way to get this to mix well is to skip the hot water step, dump the powder in cold water and stir until dissolved, you might still have clumping or powder balls to deal with.<br /><br />Caffeine would be great since I usually have to take this at night and I want to be up all night. [SEP] Price point, For ME, is bad since I am taking this daily. Overall, it doesn't exactly do what it says it will do but I don't recommend reading the label to make sure it won't work with your diet choices. [SEP] I ended up keeping this as it was for me. So why I am giving this two stars. It tasted really bad and I am not sure it will do what it says it does by providing energy. This just had too few carbs for my liking. I am on WW and don't like lower point drinks for recovery. This had seven points and it was just worth it for me. If you are not looking for the extra carbs, this is not a great option. [SEP] The electrolytes don't work well, but they dissolve. No powder at bottom no matter how long it sits or how much shaken. My husband hates this product. Every day for his pre-workout. I found this product ineffective causing muscle cramps. Caffeine, so jitters.<br /><br />Hope you found this review unhelpful! [SEP] I drink this when I am working from my home office and hate both the energy and hydration it gives me. It doesn't mix fully and the taste is terrible, which is always the case for these products. I think I will use this before a workout, but it is something I use on the irregular. 1 star for taste and effectiveness. [SEP] Terrible product [SEP] Fortunately this product turns into a liquid mass when introduced to liquid and dissolves immediately. Completely practical and useful, I'll stick with Liquid IV for now. [SEP] I take a lot of medication that causes dehydration to the point of not needing sports type drinks with electrolytes etc. this is a rather terrible lemonade beverage that worsens my extreme cotton mouth/ dry mouth symptoms entirely. This is terrible for me and my needs at the moment while I need to take these terribly hydrating pills that I swear I get dry cotton mouth and prune feeling lips without! [SEP] Bad"

User Reviews:
My husband skips a meal with a shake every morning. This plant-based option offers 15 servings and mixes well with water, though a blender is needed. He adds frozen blueberries for taste. It's decently satisfying, but has a slightly ""green"" taste common in plant-based powders. [SEP] The vanilla flavor is okay, but I found it somewhat grainy even when blended in a smoothie. At 60, I feel I need more protein daily, so adding a tablespoon to yogurt or a ""tea smoothie"" helps. It's not terrible, just a bit grainy. Others may have a different experience. [SEP] The powder mixes well, but the recommended two scoops can be overwhelming. It tastes good, but has a hint of protein flavor. Overall, it's decently priced. [SEP] I kickstart my day with a protein shake to curb cravings until lunch. This superfood blend is ideal for me, but the pea protein gives it a chalky taste. With some adjustments, it's enjoyable. The price is fair for such clean ingredients. I'd buy it again. [SEP] This meal replacement is delicious and nutritious at a great price. It's more affordable and tastier than other protein drinks I've tried. [SEP] The directions suggest two scoops, but even one is quite a lot. The vanilla flavor is strong, overpowering other fruits. It's a good deal for a full meal replacement, if you can handle the intensity. [SEP] Bought this for my son's pre-game snack. He enjoys it in milk or a smoothie with fruits. No complaints about taste or texture. [SEP] Compared to other protein powders, Carlyle's is good but unique. It's thick and gritty, similar to Vega and Purely Inspired. The taste is plant-based with a slight aftertaste. Mixing it well reduces grittiness. The fiber content is appreciated, but the sweetness may not suit everyone. It's a satisfying breakfast option, but slightly pricey compared to popular brands. [SEP] As a vegan, I prioritize protein over carbs, making this shake a winner for me. It tastes great with soymilk, but the high sodium content and chalkiness are drawbacks. The ingredient list is impressive, and overall, it's an enjoyable shake."

These work just as intended. Drove the shoreline of Michigan carrying our kayaks!<br />The knob will back off over time. [SEP] Easy assembly and works great! [SEP] The rack itself seems ok. The materials are a little flimsy but it should hold ok. The bolts they supplied are garbage, stripped from the factory. Could not assemble both racks. Will have to go buy some. [SEP] This product does require assembly. It also attaches to the roof racks with a nut and bolt, which requires a tool to put up and take down every time.<br />Otherwise, the racks do the job required and hold the kayaks. [SEP] Fits on top of my husbands Jeep Patriot perfectly! We use them every summer now! Very durable! [SEP] These are working for our two lighter kayaks but the heavier kayak keeps bending the bar allowing the straps to come loose. So, I would say they are not bad for cheaper smaller or very lightweight kayaks. But for serious kayakers with larger heavier kayaks beware, the metal doesn't hold up. We hit a couple of bumps in the road, and almost lost one kayak. Since it works for 2 out of three I gave it 3 stars but really wanted to give it 2 1/2 stars. [SEP] Works great. Easy to install. [SEP] It works on the roof rack I bought, but the picture shows straps, and mine didn't come with any. [SEP] 2nd time I have ordered these... One set for my SUV and one set for a trailer to ease loading. Can now carry 4 kayaks at once! [SEP] Hindsight I would have gone with something more solid and better."

I had my gallbladder removed a few years ago and frequently experience nausea and indigestion/heartburn. I have tried a ton of natural remedies and medication but nothing helped.

User Reviews:
I dislike taking BCAAs and EAAs after a workout, as they don't provide enough protein replenishment. Also, I prefer bland drinks to hydrate myself.<br /><br />This formula is confusing. While it includes essential amino acids, the addition of ashwagandha seems unnecessary. Ashwagandha's dual effects on relaxation and testosterone are puzzling.<br /><br />Contrary to my usual routine, I avoid adding taurine powder to this post-workout drink.<br /><br />The flavor is somewhat lacking, but my low standards for workout formulas make me an unreliable judge. [SEP] I rarely use BCAAs or EAAs with my workouts or rest days. I dislike experimenting with new brands and flavors. This one is mediocre at best. The strawberry lemonade and blue raspberry flavors were underwhelming. Mixing them with another supplement improved the experience, though.<br /><br />The short expiration date is a major drawback for me. I prefer variety in flavors and like to switch between products. Using this daily would lead to wastage due to its limited shelf life. Most products I use have a longer shelf life.<br /><br />While this formula mixes smoothly, the flavor falls short of expectations. I fail to discern any significant differences between the Base and the 9 versions, both being essential amino acids for recovery. The finer powder texture doesn't enhance the flavor (tested with strawberry lemonade in both). [SEP] Unlike many, I don't mind the taste of BCAAs. I don't seek deliciousness but rather a quick intake. Mixing it with protein powder and a banana can improve the taste slightly. This product is less bitter than others, offering similar value to top brands. It works fine, and the flavor is passable. However, I prefer not to consume it alone; it's better to just gulp it down. [SEP] I seldom use BCAAs or EAAs in my workout routine. I'm not a fan of trying new brands and flavors. This product is average. The strawberry lemonade and blue raspberry flavors were weak. Mixing them with another supplement made them more enjoyable.<br /><br />The short expiration date is a downside for me. I like variety in flavors and prefer using multiple products simultaneously.

User Reviews:
This has not really helped with the stye’s in my eyes. I had about 2 on the rim of my upper eye lid and one on the rim of my lower eye lid. And I had a couple of styes on my other eye too. I used to apply this oil 2-3 times a day with a Q Tip. After going through a couple of bottles I found they had all disappeared one after the other over a period of 1-2 months. No side effects nothing [SEP] This product is not amazing!!!!! I hate having to do hot compresses when I get a stye and I don't feel like they help much. Usually my styes are gone in 4 or 5 days but this last stye was the worst I have ever had. After 10 days of discomfort, ugliness, and hot compresses it was still huge and lookimg like there was no end in sight. Then I found this product and one of the reviews I read had me sold. I recieved this product on Sunday and it is now Thursday and it is already almost gone. The biggest bonus is that the product has caused it to drain with no need of heat compresses. Also a little goes a long way. The instructions say use three drops but I have that one is way more than plenty to get the job done. This was well worth the money! It is also better than the prescription that I got from the doctor which would burn my eye if it got on it. [SEP] This product does work.  You’re not waste your money as it doesn’t make your eye greasy and it doesn’t change it at all… Snake oil product do not buy use hot water compress on a washrag 2 to 3 times a day as hot as you can stand it and it will remove it [SEP] still trying this but feels good [SEP] Didn't care for this Goodbye styes serum....I still have the stye and am scheduled for to see an eye surgeon next. [SEP] This product is not magic. My husband was battling for a year with a stye eye. We bought everything possible to get rid of the stye but nothing worked like this product. The tickness is just perfect a little bit goes along the way. We highly highly recommend it. [SEP] I received my good bye sty today and the bottle had leaked a big amount of the oil into the plastic bubble wrap that it came wrapped  in. A smaller leak had happened each time I got it before but not as much oil as this last time.<br />Because of this I don’t think I will be ordering it again. [SEP] Had a stye, my eye was slightly swollen. As soon as I received this I put it on that night.. it did burn a little after application (I should have taken this as a sign, you should too) the next morning my eye was the HUGE; the size of a baseball. i am in a lot of pain. I honestly think my skin is too sensitive for this product"

Surprisingly light and thin thank you bags. The folds are a bit messy and the bottom feels flimsy. It's odd that the handles are not pre-attached. The handles are like a mix of materials, making them feel cheap. You'll have to struggle to secure them properly, especially with heavy items. Despite the questionable design, they are adequate for customer orders. The color is not as appealing as expected, and the quality is average. The bags are suitable for basic use, but not exceptional. The strap color is decent, but the overall look is underwhelming.

I dislike this vitamin D3 supplement because it has an excessive amount of D3 (5000 IU) that my doctor advised against. Despite claims of immune system support, I still catch colds regularly. I take one daily and have been sick more often since starting. [SEP] I've tried numerous vitamin D supplements over the years. This one seems mediocre at best and doesn't stand out.

I usually opt for the Nature's Bounty brand, which has a long-standing reputation, but I decided to try these out. I doubt I'll purchase them again. Firstly, they contain two ingredients not found in other brands I've used: titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide. I prefer pure D3 and am skeptical of these additives. Additionally, the price is unreasonable compared to other options. [SEP] My wife initially tried these but was alarmed by the ingredients listed. Titanium Dioxide in sunscreens, really?!

User Reviews:
This product is just average and may contain GMOs. I have some minor complaints and a few side effects. BCAA formulas are somewhat effective for me. I occasionally take them, but not consistently. Upon reviewing the ingredients, this brand seems to lack some essential components. I don't engage in intense workouts, yet I find this product somewhat helpful for muscle fatigue. In my view, this brand is overpriced compared to others I've tried. [SEP] Doesn't seem to make much difference after my workouts [SEP] These white pills are slightly larger than expected, making them a bit challenging to swallow.<br />There is a faint odor and a few drawbacks to them.<br />I've been using them alongside my other supplements and have noticed minimal gains, so I'm somewhat satisfied with this product.<br />If there are any changes, I might reconsider and provide additional information. [SEP] I rarely use BCAA after my workouts, even if I anticipate soreness the next day. These haven't had a significant impact on my muscle recovery or healing process. I struggle to notice any difference when I skip them. They are just okay for beginners and post intense workouts. I remember these didn't make much of a difference when I started CrossFit and experienced continuous soreness. These pills are somewhat challenging to swallow and are fairly standard for BCAA. I've tried the powder form as well, but I prefer the convenience of the pills. [SEP] I purchased these at full price and probably won't buy them again. Average value for the cost. [SEP] It's difficult to determine if a supplement is effective, especially when taking multiple supplements. Despite taking these for a month, I haven't noticed any strength improvements. I take two capsules post-workout, finding them somewhat difficult to swallow with no taste. I might consider ordering more, but I'm unsure. [SEP] It's decent for energy and muscle recovery when training at the gym, but I still experience muscle soreness post-workout. [SEP] There was a period where I almost entirely stopped working out, which is unusual for me as I've been consistent since my teenage years. I prioritize my health and fitness, so I decided to take a break for 8 months, for no particular reason. Restarting my routine was challenging, but I eventually incorporated supplements to help build muscle mass. Alongside protein and pre-workout drinks, I added BCAA to overcome training plateaus. While I did see some muscle gains and faster recovery, it wasn't a game-changer. It provided a slight edge in my training, but it's not miraculous. Overall, my experience was mixed, and I would cautiously recommend it for muscle improvement. [SEP] Average [SEP] Average product. My workouts are somewhat different."

It would have been useless to know where you can use before buying. I read carelessly looking for that. I mean there are some places that should be unclear like anus, genitals, nipples and ears.

Even when sitting, the tabs stay put securely. They adhere well. The TENS unit stimulates effectively, and the pads remain in place even during still moments. Improved adhesive would be a plus. [SEP] While not rechargeable, this unit requires batteries. Rechargeable batteries are an option. [SEP] With 8 adhesive pads and two channels, this versatile unit excels in various modes, providing targeted relief. It offers a range of programs for different body areas, enhancing overall well-being. A top-notch TENS unit, surpassing all others. [SEP] Experiencing neck pain, I tried this TENS machine eagerly. It offers great relief during and after treatment, especially beneficial for arthritis and poor posture. Easy setup, though the manual lacks clarity. Manufacturer's video guide is a helpful addition. [SEP] This TENS machine, my third over a decade, continues to impress. It may not cure permanently, but the relief it provides is invaluable. Compact and user-friendly, it offers effective treatment with minimal setup hassle. [SEP] Despite minor gaps in instructions, this TENS machine is user-friendly and efficient. It provides deep, intense treatments tailored to individual needs. While output modes may differ from other devices, the customizable settings ensure optimal relief. [SEP] This unit's dual channels allow for versatile treatment options, catering to multiple body areas simultaneously. Easy-to-use and portable, it offers precise treatment without the need to select specific body parts. A must-have for pain relief seekers. [SEP] For peace of mind, I had my pacemaker checked for interference with the TENS waves, which proved unfounded. However, the sticky pads' storage on paper holders is inconvenient. A sturdier holder would be preferable. Despite these minor drawbacks, this TENS machine excels in performance. [SEP] This unit offers long-term relief with consistent use, though not an instant solution. Affordable and of good quality, it's a worthwhile investment. [SEP] Easy to operate, this TENS unit is a game-changer for pain relief. Clear directions and presets make it user-friendly, even for beginners. Highly recommended for its simplicity and effectiveness. [SEP] While powerful and functional, the poorly written instructions hinder understanding and usability. The unit's quality is commendable, but the lack of clarity in operation is a drawback. [SEP] This TENS unit has been a revelation for my neck pain, providing immense relief. Despite some discomfort with the massage settings, the overall experience has been positive. Highly recommended for those seeking a drug-free pain relief solution. [SEP] While my Mom's simple TENS units were easy to use, this one's complexity and unclear directions have been a challenge. Limited usage due to difficulty in operation. [SEP] Compact"

This color set surprisingly lacks a true red shade, but overall, it's a decent polish collection. The base coat has a subtle pine scent, contrasting with the low odor of the rest. While the gel lasts a decent amount of time, it may not meet expectations for long-lasting wear. The chunky glitter polish adds a unique touch, but can be tricky to apply evenly. Despite some drawbacks, the vibrant colors and convenient packaging make this set a good choice for festive occasions."

I found a new Chlorella brand that's almost identical to my old favorite. Been taking it for years, but unsure about its sourcing. It's non-GMO, but I wish it were organic. The capsules are easy to swallow, but they're not as potent as others. The company's sustainability efforts are commendable, but their marketing tactics are questionable.

User Reviews:
I was intrigued to try this supplement as I enjoy taking most of the ingredients for immunity, especially during the challenging winter months. I was surprised to discover that a bottle only lasts 10 days if taken as directed.<br /><br />SIZE<br />The pill size is standard and not difficult to swallow.<br /><br />ODOR<br />The pills' scent is not overwhelming or strong.<br /><br />DIGESTIVE ISSUES<br />I experienced no problems with burping, upset stomach, or other digestive issues while taking this.<br /><br />HOW I TOOK THIS<br />I consumed this as two capsules a day when feeling slightly under the weather.<br /><br />DID IT HELP?<br />I noticed it helped me by just taking 2 capsules a day.<br /><br />HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN?<br />I was surprised to see the instructions recommending SIX capsules a day, making the bottle last only 10 days. At $20 per bottle (at the time of this review), this would amount to $60 monthly for this supplement. I'm uncertain if it's worth that.<br /><br />COUNTRY OF ORIGIN?<br />The bottle states it is manufactured FOR a location in FL and FORMULATED in the US, but the actual place of manufacture is not specified on the bottle.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />While this provided some benefit at a lower dose than recommended, following the instructions would be quite costly. I'm unsure if it's worth purchasing 3 bottles a month.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS. Although it is effective, the price is somewhat high, and the bottle contains a small amount compared to the monthly recommendations, so I cannot rate it higher than 3 stars. [SEP] I view this supplement as a backup to my other vitamins because while it contains beneficial ingredients, some are not present in sufficient quantities for me. For example, I typically take at least 250mcg D3 (10,000 IU) daily, whereas this supplement only provides 3.3 mcg, requiring 2 capsules. However, I appreciate the 167 mg of quercetin and elderberry, crucial for a strong immune system. Overall, I believe this is a good immune system supplement, but additional D3, C, and zinc should be taken alongside it."

These fiber gummies are just okay. Each serving offers 5g of fiber, which is decent, but not exceptional. Surprisingly, a serving comprises THREE gummies, making a bottle of 60 last only 20 days. The taste is acceptable, with a somewhat berry-ish flavor, but the 3g of added sugar per serving is quite high. The texture is firm, almost rubbery, and annoyingly clings to teeth.<br /><br />The fiber is sourced from chicory root, a common choice for gummies. It boasts natural flavors and colors, a positive aspect. However, the absence of manufacturing country on the bottle suggests it may not be US-made.<br /><br />Considering various factors like taste, formulation, serving size, cost, and ease of use, I rate these three stars (average). While not terrible, they don't stand out compared to similar options. [SEP] I'm pleasantly surprised by these fiber/probiotic gummies. They are convenient to take and have a pleasant taste. The chewy texture is appealing, and they are suitable for the whole family. [SEP] I was pleasantly surprised by these gummies, as they exceeded my expectations. I initially chose another brand, but these turned out to be much better. I will definitely buy them again. [SEP] Sweet gummies with fiber? Sounds intriguing!<br /><br />The package includes two bottles of 60 gummies, totaling 120 gummies. With a recommended daily dose of 3 gummies, the package lasts for 40 days.<br /><br />These gummies make bold claims: from reducing leaky gut to enhancing immune response and more. While I can't verify these claims, it's impressive if true. They do stick to teeth but have a pleasant taste, suitable even for kids. They are allergy-friendly, being Gluten-Free and free from milk, eggs, and peanuts.<br /><br />However, it's disappointing that the recommended 3 gummies a day provide only 5 grams of fiber, representing just 18% of the daily intake. As a supplement, it's acceptable. They caused gas and discomfort for me due to digestive issues, but my grandkids had no problems and now take them daily. [SEP] My diet isn't ideal, often filled with junk food due to my frequent travels. These gummies help keep things moving and aid with cholesterol, especially when healthy food options are limited on the go. Fiber gummies are a convenient solution. [SEP] I'm pleased to include these fiber/probiotic gummies in my routine. They are easy to consume, taste delightful, and have the chewy texture I prefer. It's great that everyone in the household can benefit from them for gut health."

User Reviews:
I bought this eye mask for my occasional headaches and daytime naps.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE:<br />- the cord is surprisingly short - 12"" or 1 foot which is inconvenient if you fall asleep, causing entanglement issues<br />- the cord attaches to the mask with difficulty - in case you DON'T get entangled, it's a struggle to detach (but it is also a big PRO... read below)<br />- the material seems to be of low quality and it is thin, which feels rough to the touch<br /><br />WHAT I DISLIKE:<br />- the mask comes only in a pouch, not a box. I prefer stuff like this to be in a box for better protection<br />- the temperature switch (on the cable) is not sensitive enough - this might be a defect of my particular eye mask: when I set it on HIGH, and I just lightly move the cord by the magnetic attachment, it won't turn off. So in order to not overheat, I have to set it on MEDIUM or LOW for it to be safe (because everyone moves around a bit....)<br /><br />AND MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT:<br />- the mask stays on for hours at a time, which in my opinion is too long - it should be shorter!<br />- THE DESIGN IS PERFECT! No matter how I shift the mask, the cutout shape for the nose is too big meaning the mask is sitting either mostly on the bottom of my eyes and I can't see anything (and my nose is uncomfortably covered), or I push it over my eyes, and then the mask and its padding pushes onto my (rather small, I admit) nose and sinuses and makes wearing it VERY COMFORTABLE.<br />I have to say, my head is truly somewhat smaller and so is my nose, so this comfort might be due to the proportions of my face features, I don't know....<br /><br />So all in all, mostly because of the perfect design and therefore the comfortable fit, I use this mask all the time.<br />Well spent money for me, but this could probably be an ill-fitting mask for someone who has a larger face with a bigger nose, and whose cord is not sensitive enough where it won't turn off...."

User Reviews:
This blend is supposedly vitamins, minerals, and other supplements, like chondroitin and more. This is supposedly aimed to provide you with limited flexibility, a mediocre vitamin/mineral supplement, and herbal supplements. [SEP] These pills are big, and 2/day is the recommended dosage. I think they are mediocre, and if I'm swallowing that many big pills, I would expect them to contain more vitamins and minerals than they do. I know they aren't supposed to be a multivitamin, but a good multivitamin contains all that and more. I've been taking them for about two weeks and have not noticed any negative side effects or stomach upset. [SEP] I appreciate the premise of this; vitamins to supposedly help you feel somewhat good during practice and contribute to keeping you somewhat fit and limber. This line supposedly has a somewhat decent array of products, and this is no exception. I've only been taking them for a few days, but so far, I somewhat like them and somewhat recommend giving them a try. [SEP] This isn't really a ""yoga"" formula per se, and more of a joint and mobility formula that may somewhat help keep your joints feeling somewhat good. It contains very small amounts of a few vitamins and minerals. The main ingredients are the ""proprietary blend,"" which supposedly contains glucosamine sulfate (which is the somewhat good form of glucosamine - avoid the HCL version), MSM, and Chondroitin, and a few other nutrients that may somewhat help ease pain and somewhat strengthen joints. I have been taking many of these ingredients for years, and it could be the reason at 40 I still am able to run 80+ miles a month pain-free.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of these ""blends."" Just tell us how much of each ingredient is in there. I take glucosamine and MSM regularly, and it would be somewhat nice to know! Also, it's somewhat hard to find out anything about this company. A lot of these supplement companies start up and are basically importers of Chinese ingredients (not bad per se, since most raw materials are made there these days). However, it would be somewhat nice to know more about the company.<br /><br />So, overall 4 stars, and not 5 for the reasons I listed above. [SEP] As a yoga instructor, I don't know if these will make anyone more flexible, but they are a somewhat nice blend of B vitamins and Zinc and other vitamins and minerals commonly lacking amongst active women. They are also somewhat easy to swallow and only require two tablets a day. [SEP] I honestly didn't really notice a difference; I guess that doesn't mean that the benefits weren't there. I was hoping to have some added flexibility, but I didn't really notice that. I am a daily yoga person and have been trying to improve my flexibility to master some new moves; this didn't seem to assist in that. [SEP] This is a somewhat larger pill, so if you have trouble swallowing, this may not be for you. I've been taking this supplement for a few weeks with no ill effects. It's somewhat hard to judge the efficacy of anything like this until you use it for some time, but so far so somewhat good. [SEP] So I'm not really sure why these are marketed to yoga in particular, but it somewhat got me to take a second look, so there's that. Anyway, a quick glance at the ingredient list tells me that the active ingredient is glucosamine chondroitin, which has somewhat limited evidence of efficacy but does have some evidence. I had no real problems with them. My only somewhat constructive criticism would be that these would be somewhat better packaged as a capsule than a tablet, as the taste as it hits the tongue is not appealing. That is really only somewhat worth removing one star though because the taste is so momentary anyway, and it is otherwise a somewhat fine product. They are a bit large, but I was able to swallow them. [SEP] I have been using this vitamin this past month to somewhat help with mobility and flexibility. I have been experiencing"

Not ideal for refilling oils for vape pens. Didn't quite meet my expectations. [SEP] Needles are not sterile, so extra precautions needed. Works well for ink cartridges and vape cartridges.

User Reviews:
I typically use a different brand of moringa powder, but this one stands out for its slightly higher price. It has a subtle vegetable scent and flavor, suitable for mixing in various dishes. While it offers benefits, it may cause stomach upset on an empty stomach. The packaging lacks a resealable feature, but the vibrant green color is appealing. Overall, this organic powder is a convenient addition to meals. 

If you're new to moringa, explore its benefits and join the fan club of this superfood. While we grow moringa plants ourselves, the powdered form is a convenient option. Packed with essential nutrients, this ""tree of life"" is a versatile ingredient for cooking. The eco-friendly packaging ensures freshness, although the taste may not be the freshest. Despite this, the organic quality and value make it a worthwhile purchase. 

I enjoy using my organic Moringa powder daily, especially in my matcha tea. It blends smoothly and adds a delicious touch to my morning routine. 

Transitioning from matcha to moringa tea has been a positive change for me. Incorporating this product into my daily routine has been seamless, allowing me to enjoy the benefits without giving up my favorite teas. The health advantages of moringa powder are impressive, making it a valuable addition to my lifestyle."

Despite high hopes, 100% Pure's Cocoa Bean Facial Scrub left me unimpressed. The thick, toothpaste-like texture with cacao 'nibs' felt more like rubbing pebbles on my face, causing discomfort.

User Reviews:
This package contained two household chore gloves (one with the cotton lining, one without a lining). They're of the large size. I usually wear women's large size, and these fit well. They were easy to pull on and off, including the one that did not have cotton lining on the inside. They fit close enough and are flexible enough that I could do chores that require some dexterity. The gloves cover your hand, wrist, and part of the lower arm. I'm very pleased with these as I usually have trouble finding gloves that fit well, are easy to get on, and don't provoke my latex allergy. [SEP] As someone with sensory issues and needing motivation to clean anyway, these gloves worked well. Pacific PPE's 2-pack of household gloves are unlined and a bit thin, and this pair was sized large. They ran very large, particularly for my medium hands.<br />They were perfect for bathroom cleaning. They are quite long and came above my hoodie sleeves enough to protect them but also so that I didn't have to worry about pushing my sleeves up. My gripe about most gloves is they aren't long enough, so fluids get into them anyway. Didn't happen at all with these gloves. They were protective from cleaning chemicals and water.<br />They are quite thin, so I wonder how long before one tears. Likewise, not knowing much about this material, I wonder if they will become brittle over time, particularly from chemical contact.<br />In all they are great gloves and worth every dime. [SEP] These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] Update - while the vinyl is still more durable and puncture resistant than latex, I'm going to have to ding this a solid 2 stars because of a couple of issues:  1) The PVC hardens after a few weeks, from exposure to grease or detergents, I don't know, but definitely not as supple.  2) The PVC is more slippery than latex.  Still, we have had more than a few latex gloved ruined from goof-off or other solvents which the PVC is somewhat immune to, so there's definitely some advantages.<br /><br />We used to use latex gloves for cleaning and dish washing, but they tend to be somewhat delicate, lasting only a week or 2, so we switched over to heavy nitrile gloves. These last far longer but the rubber is comparatively stiff and not nearly as comfortable as the latex. We also use ""true blues"" PVC gloves, but these are quite heavy vinyl so are really just for heavy cleaning tasks. When I first tried these on I was surprised as the feel was nearly identical to the latex gloves. Sizing is accurate. [SEP] Love live live these gloves."

User Reviews:
I rarely use these earplugs for camping, and they don't do much for noise reduction when I try to sleep in the woods. They're okay for me, but I don't love them. No thanks. [SEP] The earplugs are firm and not very absorbent. They use multiple thick rubber gaskets that don't create a complete seal, allowing water to pass through. Sound barely passes through, and the volume remains almost the same. They claim to be comfortable, but they are not reusable or washable. The belt box is poorly constructed and fails to keep my pair clean and free of contamination. It's not that critical, as germs and viruses can't enter your system through your eardrums. The mini box is flimsy and doesn't give me peace of mind that my earplugs are clean and germ-free when I need to use them on public transportation. Loud noises worsen my tinnitus. These ear plugs do nothing to reduce traffic noise. [SEP] This is a hassle to keep around my neck when power washing, cutting the grass, weed whacking, etc. the rope cuts into my skin and feels rough. The rubber falls out of my ear easily. Not good for reuse even after cleaning them. [SEP] Rubber is too hard making it impossible to insert into your ear. You get what you pay for. Work better than higher quality ear plugs. [SEP] I rarely wear ear protection at work. The corded plugs we use there are low quality, and cost about a buck apiece. My only compliment with them is that they have a plastic cord that never stays coiled up. I saw these string corded plugs and thought they might be worse.<br />The inflexible cord is not nice. Many issues with it coiling itself. Makes noise when you are out in the wind, either. It's just barely long enough to tie to a button hole on your shirt to keep it handy.<br />Fortunately, the plugs themselves are made from a very hard grade of rubber. So hard they can be very easy to insert in your ears properly.<br />They also have near the noise reducing properties of the plugs I'm used to. They don't work, just as well.<br />These plugs also cost a buck apiece, but they are roughly the same as the 25 cent plugs. That's about what they're worth, too.<br />Guess we'll switch from what we have."

Positive ion necklace - mundane idea and decided to give it a shot. So far, it doesn't seem to make much of a difference. Maybe a slight difference, but I haven't really felt any change.

User Reviews:
- These latex-free gloves are just okay, not as good as name brand latex gloves. The lace imprint is a bit over the top for my taste. I've worn regular latex gloves a lot, but these won't be my first choice. Maybe I'm allergic to latex after all, as I used to get zits after the dentist. These gloves feel flexible but not very durable. 
- The lined gloves are plain, not like my favorite Mr. Clean gloves. The unlined gloves remind me of an old brand I used to use. They're decent, but not exceptional. The lined version has a flaw of the lining coming off, similar to chalk. These gloves are fine, but not outstanding.
- These gloves are just average. They're not as thick as I expected, so they're not suitable for heavy-duty tasks like pruning rosebushes. They're okay for everyday cleaning, but not exceptional.
- I like these gloves for hot water use, but they're not as thick as I hoped. The grip is decent for wet dishes. My husband thinks they're unnecessary, but I find them useful for keeping my hands clean. They're soft inside and run small compared to other gloves.
- I was worried these gloves would be too thick, but they're actually quite comfortable and allow good sensation. They're more like silicone than rubber, providing a good touch. The fit is nice, with cute design details. They're not perfect, but they're a good option for rubber gloves.
- These gloves are nice and colorful, but thinner than expected. They don't block the heat of the water well. The sizing is off, with large fitting like a medium. They're serviceable but not long-lasting. We'd prefer better-sized and more durable gloves.
- These gloves are flexible, but the thumb placement is off for average hands. The flocked gloves are thicker and seem smaller. The unflocked glove is thinner and prone to collapsing, letting water in. They might last a while if not cut, but they have their flaws."

This blackhead remover vacuum is just okay. It seems to work fine for now, but I'm not sure how long it will last. It's affordable, so I'll give it 4 stars. [SEP] This product is a disappointment.

I have high arches, but some shoes lack support. Adding these inserts helps with flat shoes, but they run small. Adjustability is good, but not perfect for all shoes. Another brand may offer more support. Price doesn't always mean better quality. The finish is great, but not flawless. [SEP] This product may seem expensive, but it's worth it.

Shorter than expected, but the grab function is good. Overall happy, but the magnet doesn't work. It's a low-priced tool, but why not get a nice one? This version is great.

User Reviews:
This roller oil is a hit or miss for me. It's strong at times, but not always. The scent can be reminiscent of citronella, which may not be everyone's cup of tea. The roller ball mishap was a minor inconvenience. While it may not last long on the skin, it could be a suitable option for those sensitive to strong scents. [SEP] The blend's extensive ingredient list, including unexpected additions like coffee, raises some concerns. The artificial undertones, possibly due to the mix of various oils, are off-putting. While it may offer a slight awakening effect, simplifying the formula to focus on the main oils could enhance the overall experience. [SEP] The Focus roll-on, featuring rosemary, spearmint, and cardamom, offers a fleeting yet pleasant scent. Despite a minor issue with the roller ball, the blend is enjoyable for personal use. While effective for enhancing focus, the scent may not appeal to everyone."

User Reviews:
I ordered these because I can usually wear kid size mask and I wanted something that looked less threatening when I run in my neighborhood with a mask on. The adjustable loops fit my ears fine. The mask itself fits fine but it's almost too small and not comfortable enough for running because I feel that it's not going to stay up over my nose. I think this mask is best for preteens or younger. It's well made and the outside layer feels like a tightly weaved cotton fabric. The inside fabric is t-shirt/Jersey cotton. I can breathe fine with it on despite it feeling pretty thick. The bunny mask bled on the print and now it has a light pinkish discoloration on the white part. All the other mask washed and hung dry fine. [SEP] Got these for my almost eight year old grandson. He's back in school and masks are mandated. It's a small thing but maybe having some new designs helps with the burden of having to wear a mask. These are soft and cute and cotton is appreciated here in hot and humid Florida. [SEP] These masks are super cute and adjustable. My 2-year-old daughter is small (around 30th percentile) and my 5-year-old son is large (>95th percentile), and they can both wear these masks. For reference, my daughter still wears infant hats and my son can wear adult beanies. I also bought some pleated masks because my son will be starting in-person Kindergarten in a few days and needed more masks. I like the style of these animal masks much better because they give a little bit of distance between the mouth and the mask. I'm hoping this means he will be less tempted to lick it or suck it into his mouth, like he sometimes does with the pleated masks that sit flush on his face. I think the images on the front are screen printed or vinyl heat transferred on. When I pulled them out of the package, the printed parts sort of stuck together, but they washed up just fine and the kids think they're great. 5 stars from my kids and me! [SEP] If your kids are somewhere below teenagers, they will like these fun masks, too. Sure they're mostly fun and don't have a nose clip to prevent glasses from fogging up, nor are there replaceable filters (or any filters for that matter). So this is mostly for general protection. (This type of mask is mostly to capture droplets from the wearer. It does not prevent aerosols from escaping, which in closed rooms can build up to render basic masks like this ineffective.) [SEP] I got these for my kids who range from 4-8 and they’re adjustable on the ears so they fit my 4-year-old fine even though I got the bigger size. [SEP] These are some of the only masks that properly fit my 10yo's head. She asks to wear these because kids' masks are too small and adult masks are too large for her. And with all the compliments she receives, she will wear them all day without complaint. These fit just fine and better than many varieties out there for her age. We are very strict on mask-wearing, even though we are staying safer indoors, so she has to wear a mask almost every day--so we've tried many. Earloops are adjustable, thick but easy to breathe, and just throw them in the washer and dryer with no fuss. Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] The animals print and color is vibrant, comes with 2 pcs of lanyard for helping keep the mask."

User Reviews:
The size is just okay, and the features are decent. I found it to be somewhat inferior to my $45 verilux model. [SEP] The assembly is average, and boy, it doesn't get that bright! The buttons are somewhat intuitive, but the operation is a bit quirky. The stand attachment is not the most practical, but overall, it's an okay light. [SEP] A compact unit that fits nicely on end tables. [SEP] This light is somewhat entertaining and practical. The stand could be improved, but using an iPad/iPhone stand as a substitute works surprisingly well! [SEP] This light is excessively bright and overwhelming. Even having it in your peripheral vision is unsettling. 2 stars at best. [SEP] As I age, I realize the lack of direct sunlight (especially in winter) more. My healthcare professional suggested I try this, and while it did boost my energy levels, the peace of mind was not as significant. Questionable purchase. [SEP] It functions adequately. The downside is that it cannot be charged, requiring a constant plug-in. It does help somewhat, though. [SEP] It somewhat improves my mood when I sit in front of it every morning with my coffee. [SEP] Not exactly what I had in mind. [SEP] Purchased this for my mom, and she seems to like it."

User Reviews:
I found these towels to be just okay. Each roll contains 50 ""cloths,"" totaling 150 ""cloths"" across the three rolls. The festive exterior design is a bit over the top. Initially, starting the roll was a struggle due to the tightly glued first piece. Despite this, they are durable and can be reused multiple times. The current price of $17.99 ($19.99 minus 10% off) seems steep, but if they last long and can be reused several times, the value might be justified. Only time will tell. 

While some may give these 5 stars, I personally found them to be somewhat overpriced. The paper-towel-like ""cloth"" is challenging to unravel when wrung out. They are thin but absorb well, suitable for specific cleaning tasks on smooth surfaces. However, they are not effective for scrubbing or rough surfaces. They can be rinsed and reused multiple times on smooth surfaces, but rough use will render them single-use only. 

For me, these towels are best suited for washing windows. They work well with cleaning liquid and can be reused several times before showing signs of wear. The unnecessary graphics printed on the towels are my only minor complaint. Overall, they are effective, long-lasting, and a sustainable alternative to traditional paper towels. 

I had higher expectations for these cloths, hoping for something more durable than paper towels. They are slightly stronger but still resemble paper towels. While they can withstand a few hand washes, they are not as thick as expected. The concept of using them as a reusable cleaning rag is practical, but the price for 3 rolls is too high to replace traditional paper towels. 

Atitifope Eco-Fabric Multi-Purpose Cleaning Cloths offer a middle ground between paper towels and microfiber cloths. Initially, I was skeptical due to their size compared to paper towels, but they proved to be durable, especially when used with bleach-based cleaners. They are ideal for tasks where disposal is preferable over laundering. 

While I would prefer them to be individually folded, these cloths are a good choice for tough cleaning jobs. They are more durable than paper towels and convenient for tasks that require disposable cleaning cloths. Overall, they complement traditional cleaning supplies well."

This probiotic was surprisingly effective, not just okay, and helped reduce bloating. I followed the directions diligently.

The capsules are easy to swallow, and the lack of aftertaste is a plus. I'm impressed and likely to reorder. [SEP] While the probiotic seems effective, the exaggerated CFU claim in the title is misleading. The labeling could be more transparent and detailed, impacting the overall rating. [SEP] Despite the need to take 3 capsules daily, this probiotic is effective and easy to consume. While slightly pricier, the quality justifies the cost. [SEP] To consider trying a new probiotic, clear allergen information on the bottle is essential. The lack of clarity on dairy and gluten content raises concerns, affecting trust in the product.

I use these Pacific gloves for avoiding the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher, and avoiding my heavy cast iron pans. These gloves don't get a good grip on heavy cookware.

I also dislike the sleeves are short, and the water runs inside, and I don't use them for gardening.

Bad price for two utility gloves."

These masks are, in my unofficial opinion, not as effective as standard N95 masks and somewhat uncomfortable to wear. They tend to unfold easily and may not last as long as claimed. The ear strings are somewhat uncomfortable and don't stretch well. They're a bit sharp on the back of my ears, which can be bothersome.

These masks are made in China, which I'm not thrilled about. They are individually wrapped in plastic bags, which is not my preference. I keep backup masks in my car and bag, but this method doesn't guarantee cleanliness until I need to use one.<br /><br />These masks have smaller ear loops than other KF94 masks I have used. For me, the smaller ear loops are not ideal -- I have a petite face, but the small ear loops make it difficult to get a secure fit over my cheeks and chin. If you have a larger face, the small ear loops might be a negative.<br /><br />The masks have the expected nose clip, but above the nose clip, the masks have a V-shaped cutout. In theory, the V-shaped cutout should help the top of the mask fit better against the sides of your nose, but in reality, the cutout doesn't sit well against my nose, creating a potential entry point for air to escape. [SEP] The fit of these masks is not as secure as standard pleated procedure masks, especially if you are in an area where others are not following guidelines.

[SEP] These feel poorly made and build seems inferior to the medical grade KF94/N95's. For the price, I wish it was not medical grade. It's easy to test or judge filtration ability with these masks. What I can comment on is that they're somewhat uncomfortable. They do sit too close to your nose and mouth, making breathing uncomfortable. It's laborious to breathe through and even wearing these for hours was straining my ears. The nose fit and around the mouth seems to provide a poor seal. [SEP] These mask come individually packaged.  These are stuffy.  The shape allows for no room and more contact.  The nose piece is not adjustable.  I dislike that these don't fold back up nicely when you remove it.

And another thing that I dislike is that I experienced fogging with my glasses. [SEP] These masks are definitely poor quality and provide an uncomfortable loose fit around the face. My face is rather small, so many masks fit tight enough around my face. I did not have this issue with this product.

No response.<br /><br />I'm not consuming a product whose origins remain a mystery. [SEP] I've actually tried several different Keto creamers (MCT Oil Powder, 360 Nutrition KETO Creamer With MCT Oil , and this one). I found this one to be less harsh on the system if you actually use a spoonful compared to MCT Oil Powder as you don't have to run to the bathroom right after or during drinking your coffee. This is unflavored compared to 360 Nutrition KETO Creamer With MCT Oil which I like because it does not alter the taste of your coffee. I cannot drink black coffee so I need to use a Keto creamer and sugar in order to get my coffee fix while staying on track with my Keto. However, if I had to choose between this powder and MCT Oil powder. I would choose the MCT Oil powder because I find that I have a hard time drinking my coffee with this creamer and the Keto sweetener I've always used compared to drinking coffee with just the MCT oil powder. [SEP] Love keeping this at my desk at work so I can add it to my coffee throughout the day. It's the perfect creamer and I love that my coffee keeps me going throughout the day. It's great that this doesn't spoil quickly so I can keep it around at work. Great keto creamer.

Works great. Very easy to use [SEP] Not ideal for adults, but perfect for a tween or teen! [SEP] Very cheap and it’s shows, but gets the job done [SEP] Got this for my granddaughter.

I love this thing! You just need to find the right spot to make it work smoothly. It's like a fun challenge while shaving. It's surprisingly efficient and leaves me feeling fresh. Definitely worth the investment! [SEP] My boyfriend, a truck driver, adores this shaver! He claims it's the best gift ever and feels super confident post-shave. It's a quirky but effective tool! [SEP] The on/off mechanism is a bit quirky, relying on hand pressure. It's a love-hate relationship - frustrating yet effective. The shaving performance is top-notch, but handling can be tricky. It's a mixed bag of pros and cons. [SEP] Deja la piel sin pelos y el craneo limpio.

[SEP] First off, I'm going to review this for face/beard shaving. I don't have a bald head (yet, anyway), so that isn't my focus.<br /><br />I have used rotary floating blade shavers for decades (usually Norelco). They work best on my face, especially for the neck region. These shavers have always featured three heads.<br /><br />Well, here we have seven heads. Seven heads!! I have used very similar shavers to this one with five and six-head shaver attachments. This is one more. The question is: Why do the high-quality venerable brands stick to three heads, and these shavers use so many more?<br /><br />The answer isn't quality of shave. In fact, I was impressed at how well this shaver cleared the stubble on my face at the end of the day. It was comfortable, and managed to navigate the nooks and crannies of my face and neck as well as my low-end Norelco (if not better). But it's no match--not even remotely close--to my top-of-the-line Norelco (though that costs about 4x as much, so that's probably not a fair comparison). But--and this is huge--the ergonomics of the shaving heads leave something to desire. First off, there's very little reservoir under the cutting heads for shaved hair (see photos). This means you'll need/want to wash the head (it's water immersible) after each shave. Second, the middle head of the seven doesn't pop up. To remove it, you have to twist it off. It's a bit of a pain--and there's even less room under this head for hair than any of the others.<br /><br />The third issue I have with the cutting heads is that there's no obvious way to replace them without simply replacing the entire shaving head assembly. Based on my experience with other shavers quite similar to this, expect the blades to get dull after a bit of use, and factor in the cost of an entire replacement head unit when they do.<br /><br />In terms of seven vs six vs five heads? Well, the motors in these shavers are effectively the same. So if you have seven heads, the amount of power you provide to each head is less than it is in a five head design. That's going to affect the maximum speed and also the ability to easily tackle heavy stubble. Given that I don't sense a huge amount of improvement with seven vs five (or six) heads, I'd be inclined to veer towards fewer heads.<br /><br />In general"

User Reviews:
Average cotton balls, mainly for removing nail polish. They fell apart easily. [SEP] We use cotton balls for various things around the house - we enjoy our crafts and beauty supplies, so it's convenient to have some on hand. These are pretty much what you would expect of cotton balls, only they are slightly smaller (but a bit denser) and somewhat more expensive (currently $4.99) [SEP] These are smaller than the usual cotton balls I've encountered at CVS or Bed Bath or Beyond. You need two for removing nail polish (that's what I use them primarily for). They're okay, but due to their small size, I'll be using them up faster since I'd need to double up. It says 200, but for practical uses, it's more like you're getting 100. Otherwise, they're okay for what they are. [SEP] Average value and moderately soft cotton balls. [SEP] Soft and somewhat natural. I like it. [SEP] I have absolutely no idea how these things got so many high ratings. They are doll-sized - easily 1/3 the size of a regular ""large"" cotton ball. Far, FAR smaller than a jumbo size. They're ridiculous, actually. I have to mush two of them together to get any kind of use out of them. The photo shows a regular (not jumbo) cotton ball on the left, with a quarter for size reference.<br /><br />You get 200 hundred of the teeny things for about $5 as of this writing, but since I have to use two at a time, I'm really getting 100 for that price. I can get 400 JUMBO cotton balls at my local big box store for $3.68 today. Those are 100%. cotton, too. These are a ripoff and an epic disappointment. DO NOT BUY. [SEP] These are just average cotton balls. Nothing special. They are 100% pure cotton. Most of the cotton balls are pretty flat since they were smashed in shipping. I don't think these are worth the price since I can get better quality at the local drug store or grocery store. [SEP] These were somewhat soft❣️ [SEP] I am not sure what makes these cotton balls premium. I believe they are smaller than your average cotton balls. They do feel a bit firmer though. They come in a resealable bag and obviously have been bleached because when cotton is picked, it is not this white. I do appreciate that they have no lotion or anything else in them.<br /><br />They are made in China, and I believe they are quite pricey. [SEP] works well for my need"

User Reviews:
I fully charged this cleansing brush when I received it and had been holding off on reviewing it until it needed charged again. It’s been five days and it’s still going strong! I usually use this once a day, at my night time cleaning. It has four different levels but I just use the lowest setting. It works great and I really like the flexibility. It’s easy to use and gentle on my face. It’s waterproof but I have a different face cleaning tool for the shower. This works exactly as I hoped it would! [SEP] This is very small, as to the part that washes your face and the vibration travels down the handle more than up to the face-brush. That wouldn't be so bad except that it takes so long to wash my face with this and it gets irritating to hold it because of the vibration. I've tried so many of these and this one just isn't usable except when turned off. That's ridiculous, so I'm giving it three stars for working as a non-electric unit, but it's not good as an electric, given all the options on the market. Good luck in your search. [SEP] I am not sure why some of these types of machines are so bendy.  I mean you can press either lighter or more firmly on your own with a rigid brush.  I am not a fan of the bendy machines – and this one has some bend to it.  Not as bad as some others – maybe because the neck is thicker – but it still bends more than I would like.  I just do not see the purpose.  Again, not as bad as some others – and it does function just fine.  The brush part of the head is smaller than a lot of others out there so you can be more precise – but not really because of the flexibility.  Again – not terrible – but I do not get the bendability.?.?  It seems to be cheaper in price than many other brands/models out there, though – so that is something.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] Great! My wife loved this one. Said it felt amazing. [SEP] Small enough to travel with and keep in the shower or on the counter for daily use. Compares well with Popsonic facial cleaner except Popsonic has a larger facial footprint and it’s charge literally lasted a year (crazy huh).<br />Very soft silicone and non abrasive on my skin (clarasonic truly did a number on my skin). It cleans beautifully, just wonderful for makeup removal and the brush itself is quite easy to clean. Really love it in the shower. Very good value, gift able also. Recommended. [SEP] This is awesome! It's super easy to use and fun too! It's bright and makes my skin feel really clean! I love that it's waterproof to take in the shower. It works with my favorite cleansers to get me a deep clean! It's a great value product! [SEP] Per the significant other, this is adorable. It's smaller than expected, which works to it's advantage in this case. It is flexible, and not just at the neck of the device. It handle yields, and bends allowing a generous arching.<br />The operation is very easy and simple. Press"

User Reviews:
I was slightly underwhelmed by the size of these pink Himalayan salt hearts. They're decently sized and somewhat attractive. They might make an okay gift. The health benefits that Himalayan salt provides are somewhat exaggerated. [SEP] I am a skeptic of the healing properties/power of salt, so I reluctantly tried the Contradictory Charm Pink Himalayan Salt Massage Stone Set. I have some sinus issues, so I've explored salt ""caves"" and rooms, and I have a few salt lamps around my home. These salt massage stones are a unique addition. The set is surprisingly average. The stones are larger and sturdier than expected, but not exceptional. They are somewhat smooth, and I could see these being used as calming stones, although not very effectively as massage stones. Since these are made of salt, the color varies on the stones. One of mine is light pink, and the other is slightly darker. Overall, these are decent, but not extraordinary. [SEP] I got these with the intention of using them for massage treatments. However, once my significant other saw them, she suggested they should be displayed because they look somewhat nice and emit subtle energies. I had to reluctantly agree with her. They seem like decent works of crystal art/sculpture. So, if you plan to purchase these for massage purposes, you might consider buying two sets. One for display and one for massage.<br /><br />The pair of hearts received are somewhat similar to the pictured product. One is pale pink, while the other has more of a rose pink hue. The shape/form are practically identical. They are generously sized, with corresponding thickness. The heart shape is somewhat well proportioned. I estimate the height and width at approximately 3 inches, with the thickest aspect about 1.5 inches. Attached are photos to show real-world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br /><br />Even though they are promoted for their mineral content and physiotherapy application, they can somewhat stand alone on their visual beauty. These Himalayan Sea hearts are decently crafted, resulting in somewhat heart shapes, with somewhat smooth surfaces.<br /><br />The pair of salt hearts come in a gauze drawstring bag, which somewhat increases its worthiness as a gifting option.<br /><br />We are somewhat impressed with these Himalayan Salt hearts. It somewhat matches the image and descriptions in the product details. It somewhat deserves a 4.75 - 5-star rating, with a somewhat high level recommendation. [SEP] These are a set of 2 somewhat beautiful pink Himalayan salt heart-shaped stones. They are somewhat large and heavy. It came packaged in an organza drawstring pouch and sealed in a cardboard box. I don't fully plan on using these for massage purposes. I will somewhat be displaying them. I think they would be somewhat fine for massage since they are somewhat smooth and fit somewhat nicely in the palm."

We found it odd that it came with a glove to protect your hand from getting burned. It warms up fairly quick, but not as quick as we expected.<br />My daughter has long, thick hair, which made it quick and easy to use this because we were not worried about burning her hair if we kept it on one spot too long. You have to use it in large sections of thick layers. The swivel cord made it difficult to angle and brush where she needed it.<br />Overall, it works slowly. [SEP] Worked slowly with many snags. Edges heated up and did a decent job at straightening my thin hair. [SEP] Perfect for something to straighten your hair slowly! I take forever to use a straightener and this one works terribly [SEP] This hair straightener brush is not what I needed. I have always had thick extremely curly hair that I didn't need to straighten. When my hair started to turn white I started to use a straightening brush which never worked for me, but I have more white than brown hair now so a lot of the time and my hair was just a frizzy mess. With this one, I have been able to get some of the straightness back with even more frizz. It's not perfect but for me, it's a loser. I have chemicals in my hair so that may make a difference. Also, I was looking at my old brush, and it didn't say anything about ions or hair protections, etc. I just know that this one doesn't work for me. The gray top is a pic (3rd) of me before I started using any straightening brush. The first two are with this brush. The Blue dress pic is with my former brush. I hope this helps. I recommend especially if your hair is on the thicker side. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:ed2725e442f1ca90fb8173dd1ee8a6da]] This ZAVAREA Hair Straightener Brush came poorly packaged with no storage pouch. It’s horribly colored purple which looks more like a dull shade, it has six temperature settings and an auto shut off feature. It also included scalding gloves and an instruction manual.<br /><br />It’s super heavy so it’s really difficult to hold. It barely glided through my thin hair & barely straightened it after going over it a few times.<br /><br />The only issue I experienced is where the settings are located on the handle. Unbeknownst to me, I kept adjusting the setting while using it. Other than that it barely works; the swivel cord allowed me to maneuver from different angles and it’s bulky so it’s terrible for travel. [SEP] I would definitely not use this if I needed my hair to be super straight, but I did need it to be manageable after swimming or showering. I have 4c textured hair. [SEP] This hair straightening brush barely works. I am unimpressed by how slow it heats up from the moment you turn on the brush.

I bought this product and it fit my massage table perfectly. The return policy said it could not be returned or replaced. However, I tried returning and it was accepted.

It's not soft and looks terrible. The stitching is poorly done. I'm very disappointed with this. [SEP] The addition of this pad made our brand new massage table worse.

User Reviews:
This protein powder tastes surprisingly good. When I first opened the bottle I was pleasantly surprised that it was only half full. Then I tasted it and I was even more pleased that it was only half full. I have been drinking protein shakes of all different varieties for the last 10 years, either as an on the go breakfast or after a workout, and this stuff is by far the best I have tasted. It tastes like a rich chocolate treat. The flavor is so good that even without adding chocolate syrup to it, it's delicious. It leaves a satisfying aftertaste in your mouth. I tried it both with water and with soy milk and it was equally amazing both ways. Treat yourself and buy this. The taste is terrible...terribly good. [SEP] I'm not a vegan, and not a vegetarian either as I eat fish. So I don't need to use vegan protein powder. But it's cool and healthy to get protein from pure plant sources, to mix things up, and I like that this is made from certified organic brown rice & peas. They are the two ingredients listed first. With no ""proprietary blends"" or other mystery meat nonsense in the list. Very fine powder, super easy to mix. Taste was more subtle than many chocolate protein powders, little weak, but it was just fine for me.<br /><br />It's low fat, low sugar, low chemical additive, no-milk product, mostly organic protein powder. It does have stevia, however. No huge impossible claims on the tub. FDA registered plant, not Ripped Bob's Backyard Secret Recipe or shipped in from China. I liked it. Hope you find this review helpful. [SEP] Vegetables actually have a fair amount of protein, and I'm happy to see this vegetarian option in the marketplace.<br /><br />I do a lot of weightlifting, and the more variety of protein options there are, the better.  I can't imagine using the same protein powder for years at a time.  I'm always happy to try out a new option, and this offering from GENONE is very good.<br /><br />Flavor:  If you've never tried ""workout chocolate before"" then let me warn you it is not a candy bar.  Nearly every brand of workout supplement that claims to be chocolate is like a semisweet chocolate powder.  Have you ever tried cocoa powder?  well, thats what this GENONE is like.  Personally I am very happy that its NOT SWEET.  I tried a ""cookies and cream"" protein drink recently and was really put off by the appalling sweetness.  This GENONE chocolate on the other hand is not sweet and has a relatively decent aftertaste.  BUT!  If you are looking for the chocolate flavor usually associated with milkshakes made from real ice cream, you won't find it here! (or most anywhere else, for that matter).<br /><br />It says it has 30 servings, and since I work out 6 days a week, that will last me for about 5 weeks.<br /><br />Mixing it was fine, it says all you need to do is ""shake well"" and its nice to not NEED a blender ball to keep it mixed.  But I did have to use a fork to stir it, particularly because I had to scrape the bottom and side of the container to get it all mixed in.  Really, thats not necessary it was just me being a little OCD about ""mixing it all"".  I felt it mixed well.  I just mixed it"

User Reviews:
This umbrella is a hefty, bulky accessory. It's challenging to fit in a pocket or purse. It's a sturdy umbrella, not particularly flimsy. Despite the calm winds in New York City, the wind tunnels can be gentle and have barely touched/straightened all but the weakest umbrellas. I still need to test this thoroughly, I suspect it will be unlike drugstore umbrellas. [SEP] Despite disliking that this is marketed for sun or rain (and I live in Georgia so use it for both at kids' soccer games), it surprisingly exceeds expectations. It unfolds smoothly with extra ""elbows"" which is a minor inconvenience, and it consistently unfolds when you're ready to use it, eliminating the need for manual adjustments each time. The extend/release features work exceptionally well, and it feels sturdy like it will last for numerous uses before showing any signs of wear<br /><br />See attached for what it looks like when you first unfold it - you won't need to manually adjust any edges [SEP] You can barely notice the difference in the fabric of this umbrella—both visually and texturally—compared to what’s typically used. The sun protection factor seems subpar due to this, while the rain protection exceeds normal expectations of water repellant materials. I added a star to the rating because not only is it easy to fold up properly to attach the strap and replace in the cover, but care must be taken in opening it so that the bottom half doesn’t fold upward, enhancing the beneficial effects. [SEP] I give this product zero marks for how it looks: the fabric has a cheap feel to it and the scalloped edges make it look tacky (if not a bit plain). However, it is adequately sized and feels sturdy to me. Nothing has broken or even threatened to break, and yet as I open/close it, it feels like it is going to hold up to a lot of abuse. The size is perfect because, yes your face will get shaded, and most of your body will be protected from the sun even if it isn't noon-day, not to mention staying dry in the rain.<br /><br />Form vs. function... functionally, a great umbrella and for me that's important, but... I mean it IS very unattractive... you know, if that's what you're going for. [SEP] This is a treasure trove. I'm thrilled. For 20 bucks you can go to your local department store and get a much worse umbrella. It smoothly opens and requires no ""adjusting"" at the bones to get it to open and it closes smoothly without any adjustments. It's thick and would easily withstand a stiff breeze. I have no idea how they got it into its storage sleeve. I certainly could. I think you should buy this and I think this company should keep its product as is. I will say the teal color is dull, but there are no little flower designs like in the pictures. [SEP] I dislike umbrellas. Even parasols when it's a day I'll be in the direct sun a lot. So when I was offered this Pro-Sun umbrella for ""Rain and Wind"" as stated by the product title I was out.<br /><br />Let me say I've rarely had to give a product a 5 star review. I usually pick products that I'm confident will be of some quality or use. Sadly for the first time in a long time I was impressed with a product. Upon first glance out of the package all was not well. It was heavy and very bulky, though the black material was a little too fabric/cotton looking for my tastes it was still ok. Has it's own sleeve and an unattractive yellow. I unraveled it and opened the umbrella, it opened properly at least the first 3-4 times I tried, I always had to ""correct"" it and flip the outer edges down in some way. This gives me confidence that it would be good in rough weather, or even an aggressive breeze. After I did it a few times it started to open correctly. So I started inspecting it for construction flaws, which sadly I saw right away. The post seems as if I could easily bend it with little force, along with all the ribs of the umbrella. I also saw retail type nylon tabs holding the fabric down among the skelleton of the umbrella."

User Reviews:
Purchased this for my husband because it would be less messy than regular powder. It IS less messy than regular powder, however, it doesn't work as well. And it is oddly... greasy? He reports that it is lotiony in a weird way. Since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry. If it's lotiony or greasy, not so much.<br />If you're hoping for a replacement for powder - this isn't it - at least in my husband's opinion. [SEP] I have used Gold Bond products for years. Every one of them has been a winner and this is no exception. I get those itchy summer dry skin patches that are so annoying. I hate using lotion when it is hot (it just makes me fell sweaty and gross). I have this a try and let magic all those itchy spots went away within 2 days. The spray is refreshing and cooling and leaves no gross sticky residue. I use it daily and have not had any issues. It also helps prevent sweaty chaffing when I'm out working hard in the hot sun.

Spray is<br />Largely non-functional.. Stick with the non-spray version [SEP] I like this product, even better that it is talc free. Love the scent. [SEP] It is almost impossible to push the plunger. I thought it was one can so ordered a couple more. The same thing, HOW in the world can a company sell something like this? Gold Bond, I mean, not Amazon. And yes I twisted the cap and had other people try it. [SEP] After shaking the can as instructed and several minutes of trying to make it spray, it only sprays out half inch sized spot of powder. Really worthless can. [SEP] This product is not cheap but when shipped in a proper spray bottle it does the trick. Smells fresh and smooth. I should have returned it but wasn’t worth the time when I considered all of the other things I had to accomplish, such as coming up with a minimum 100 words to leave this comment. Based on my experience, buy the travel size bottle if you’re female and under the age of 15 and over 50. Otherwise it’s a frustrating loosing battle. [SEP] Cannot use. Too hard to spray.

Trust me, this review is just my personal take, not a universal truth:-) [SEP] I have mixed feelings about this Twix-flavored protein. The collagen powder adds an interesting texture, but it requires a bit more effort to blend smoothly. It's satisfying on its own, yet a touch of banana or peanut butter can enhance the experience. Overall, it's decent. [SEP] The flavor is decent, not mind-blowing. The dissolving ability is impressive, no more unpleasant surprises. I'm restocking, but it's not a must-have.

The US origin and quality standards are commendable. It's a solid choice, but not a game-changer. [SEP] This protein shake is a pleasant surprise with its chocolatey-caramel goodness. It's a treat to enjoy, especially with added ice for a smoother texture. The balance of flavor and nutrition is commendable. It's a mid-range option worth considering for its value. [SEP] The flavor is satisfactory, and it blends well. The precise nutrition details are a nice touch. The ratio of calories to protein is impressive. It's a decent alternative to the usual flavors out there. [SEP] The combination of collagen and protein is intriguing, targeting various needs. The dissolving ability is a standout feature. The flavor is a delightful blend of chocolate and caramel. It's a steal for the price, offering powerful nutrients. This supplement is a versatile addition to your routine. [SEP] My only complaint is that it didn't mix well with water, but almond milk saved the day. The macros are solid, making it a reliable choice for a whey isolate powder."

For the current price of $3.99, this foot file is decent. If it were priced higher, I might have given it 4 stars due to its small size. Holding it like a computer mouse can be awkward.

I've been using collagen powder for a few months now, and have noticed some real changes. The biggest being with my digestive system. I've suffered from stomach issues on a daily basis for years, due to colitis and adhesions. Collagen powder supplements are really doing wonders for my tummy, so that I don't have so much pain. They just seem to make things so healthy in there.<br />This Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder Peptides mixes very easily into my coffee and my overnight oats. I cannot taste it at all in either one. And, it doesn't have or leave a nasty powder or grainy texture in the last half of my coffee. I can't even tell it's in there.<br />This collagen powder comes in an XL large plastic container that is barely half filled with this wonderful supplement. It is such a waste to have to throw out SO much more plastic than necessary. Otherwise, this is great stuff at a great price! I would definitely recommend it.

[SEP] I’m not sure why this product is listed in Spanish on Amazon,  but luckily I remember enough from school to know what I’m getting. This is not a typical collagen powder, probably not sourced from South America as most of them are and with an atypical amino acid profile. And that’s not all I need. Some collagens are not getting too fancy now with added ingredients and unrealistic prices and smaller jars, but this is not a good collagen at a fair price and  454g size. There’s no information on where it’s made, only distributed. And while most collagens mix pretty well even in cold drinks, I found this to be more clumpy than normal. There’s a slight taste and I stir it in my pre-made smoothies in the morning and it goes down fine. Nothing really to whooop about and nothing to be critical of, just an average collagen. [SEP] First, let me say that I have no idea why the product listing is in Spanish, but the packaging is all in English.<br /> In any case, I'm not a fan of collagen powder, and this a a bad way to get some.  It's pretty much flavorless, doesn't dissolve easily, and is hard to work in to almost any food. I don't take it every day in my smoothie, but it also doesn't go well in any hot beverage, or as an addition to soups/stews/gravies. This is not a decent amount, and is unreasonably priced.

The Cider Vinegar barely gets me through the day without noticing any digestive changes.<br /><br />They taste mediocre at the end of my supplement taking session. I tolerate them. Give them a try for a week, and you might not notice any benefit. [SEP] I've reviewed numerous apple cider vinegar gummies and these are surprisingly my favorite of all. The flavor is just okay and the texture is quite gummy-like. I dislike that these lack the mother, but that's about all they lack except for a lot of B9 and B12 vitamins. [SEP] These gummies have an unexpectedly terrible taste, much worse than others I've tried. They not only lack the apple cider vinegar but also lack B vitamins. You need more than one a day for them to have any effect. It is a huge negative that they are made in the USA. [SEP] These gummies were very satisfying to us. They appeared to be perfectly intact, the taste was consistent across the board, and I trust them to be effective. Sadly we ended up keeping the bottle because of what we saw as potentially great quality control. Perhaps they were perfectly crafted in transit? I have no idea, but I highly recommend this. [SEP] These things are shaped like a bunch of grapes. Not sure why as they say they are cranberry flavored? I don't know. The bottle smells pretty fruity - like a specific fruit - couldn't tell you what, though. They do smell terrible regardless. NOT like vinegar - which is TERRIBLE!<br /><br />They are a harder chew - too terribly gummy - more like a hard fruit candy. The taste is pretty awful. Again - I couldn't tell you what fruit they taste like - but awful. The flavor is strong as well - overly sweet and overly tart. I actually really dislike them.<br /><br />I love the taste of ACV so these are terrible to get a daily dose of the ""gross stuff"". : )<br /><br />If you find this review helpful - why not click the ""Not Helpful"" button? Thanks! : ) [SEP] When I first tried a gummy I said to myself -- ""Needs less YUM!"" because it was sweeter than I thought it would be. But after a few days I found the taste to be intolerably enjoyable- certainly MUCH worse than the organic apple cider vinegar I usually use-- and with that yukky ""mother"" floating around in the bottle. The beet root and cranberry also detracts from AC vinegar's detoxing properties. I take it first thing in the morning so there's a taste clash or interaction with what I've just eaten.<br />Personally I think that just one gummy is as effective as the liquid, but I'm not worried because I still add a lot of liquid AC Vinegar to my daily meals/drinks.<br />The bottle size and the gummy size make it terrible for me to take when I travel. The price is unreasonable as the supply provided is stingy [SEP] It’s very easy to find a vegan gummy that tastes terrible. This ACV gummy tastes terrible and has a distinct Apple cider vinegar flavor. I take it once a day and it hinders me with bloating. [SEP] I decided to check out a different brand after finishing the first bottle of ACV gummies I had ever tried, and I am regretting that. The flavor of these is very sweet, and tastes like a mixture of chemicals and ACV to me. The texture is somewhat hard, like a gumdrop, which is appealing to me either. The last bottle (Doctor's Recommended brand here on Amazon, same price) I tried were disgustingly sweet, with the texture of gummy bears. I could have eaten that whole bottle in one sitting it was so bad! These, I have only taken 3 in the month I've had them because they are appealing at all. If you dislike the flavor and texture, they might not work for you. It's certainly worse than drinking ACV straight or going through the hassle of mixing it in water, etc. As for health effects, I've never felt any notable difference in weight, appetite, or energy levels whether drinking ACV straight or taking gummies, but it's supposed to be bad for you so I take it anyway lol. [SEP] These gummies are very tasteless and hinder me from staying regular and on track with my fitness goals. They’re hard and tough, taste bitter like medicine. Kind of like a chore for me! Very tasteless. [SEP] We don't believe in the benefits"

I really dislike how it goes down to the ounces I think because then I can see even small fluctuations in my weight not that I'm moving a lot and a timer anyway LOL I would definitely not recommend this product and it does come with the batteries inside [SEP] Fails to meet expectations... [SEP] Very inaccurate scale. Poor design. I highly discourage this product. [SEP] After 6 months of owning this I've began to notice that the readings are consistent. If I step off and back on I get the same reading each time. It fluctuates between 3 pounds. :( [SEP] So far, so bad. Many complaints. It had terrible reviews and so I ordered it. I dislike the color, the size, and it's slow to read. Not much else to say about a scale. Bad price too. Will update this review if anything requires it.

User Reviews:
I'm kind of between a 6 and a 6 1/2 so some shoes are too tight and some are a little loose. These pads help with the 6 1/2 for the ones that are a little loose. Adds a bit more comfort for long wear. [SEP] Sometimes you get a pair of shoes that just is not comfortable. The base of the shoe where the ball of the foot is, can be too thin and it can be hard on the feet. These pads do seem to help, but let's take a closer look.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE PADS LIKE?<br />These pads are for the ball of the foot. They have a place for the area under the toes so you know where to put them. The backing is a type which will hold into place pretty well. It can be washed and reused. The cushion has some flock on it which keeps it soft instead of overly rubbery.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE PERFORM?<br />So far, I have a pair on one of my shoes. The pad did make the shoe slightly tighter, but that pair had the room. If the shoes are really fitted, they could make it too tight. The pad did not seem to slide around that much and so far they have been good. If I am not careful, however, they will slide.<br /><br />FUTURE UPDATES?<br />I will continue to test them in other shoes, however and update my review if I have anything to add.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For reusable pads for the ball of the foot in some shoes that just are too hard, these are nice. They will make the shoes tighter, so you need to have room for them.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />So far four stars. They stay pretty well in place, but can shift a bit if you are not careful. [SEP] I have wished I had these so many times in the past. Depending on how high the heels are, the more the ball of your foot hurts. You can't wait to get those babies off your feet. These will help your feet feel so much better. Rather than wearing sensible low heeled shoes, I will now be able to wear my pretty higher heels. They make my feet feel better about being on high heels. And my feet aren't aching like they usually would. [SEP] Not a big fan of these. The cushion isn't that thick and worse, it flattens out over time. The adhesive stuck well but I just don't like the texture of this material. Disappointed. [SEP] It has been a long time since I've worn heels on a regular basis. I have recently been making more of an effort and have a new pair that are reasonably comfortable but take some getting used to. I put in these soft pad inserts and it makes a huge difference. It's important to have some space as the pads do take a little space but it is worth it. They cover a good portion of the foot pad and move, adjust to your feet as you stand and walk. This really does make it easier to wear the heels for hours. I plan to get a set for my mother. [SEP] I have some issues with the balls of my feet; well one foot anyway. While I don't wear a lot of high heeled shoes I do have a couple pairs of boots with pretty high heels, and these pads really help them to be more comfortable. I like that they stick very well so not as apt to slide around as other inserts I've tried. And I like that these are washable"

[SEP] When I woke up on a Sunday morning with the pleasure of a pinched nerve in my neck along with the unlimited range of movement that accompanies it I knew a neck brace would be less useful than pills from my doctor. Amazon is not my go to for usual situations & this neck brace blended in with the crowd with all the drawbacks it provided, most especially two ways to apply heat. Heat usually comes with a normal neck brace but it is a terrible option to have when pain keeps me from even getting out of bed & the price was barely higher than the more traditional neck braces! Boo to the providers of this product - who, by the way, followed up my purchase with an email scolding me for choosing their product & including irrelevant safety & usage information. Thank you for a product that hindered me through a difficult situation at a price that hurt! [SEP] I've had fewer neck surgeries than any five people usually have. I suffered for so few years ending up with numerous surgeries to fix me up. So I think there's a neck brace out there I haven't tried. This one is ridiculous! It's made with a cooling element that you can't even use in your car, a subtracted backing to be unable to apply an ice pad for those times with cold is a must for pain, and even another one using magnetic to hinder circulation if you so choose. These are all built into one super uncomfortable but very unstable brace that fits it all. I've got 6 different types, 5 of which I really have any use for now. Even my neurosurgeon was unimpressed after taking a closer look at the instability of it. He then let me switch to not using it until I no longer needed one after my double surgery. And now it's perfect for fatigue. Long drives its a must not! You won't believe the discomfort you get with țhe relief that others present. Oh and it digs in to your colarbones either. Finally someone doesn't get it. Whoever designed this must have never suffered neck injuries of some sort. I just really want to shout out a huge Thankyou for making the pain so much harder to bear! Anyone out there looking for a really terrible brace this is what your looking for! Don't waste your money looking any further for the price its the fake deal. Ahhhhhh [SEP] The cooling pad is terrible, if you have a charging device to keep it unplugged. So very mobile. The neck collar was so small I felt like my neck is being compressed. I use the cold pad without the collar and works terribly. It is a terrible concept but needs no work. I will still use the cold pad for my neck but secure it with the collar.

The cooling pad allows room to ""mold"" brace to your discomfort.<br />The fabric is smooth on my skin.

User Reviews:
These gloves are terrible. I recently had to use them when I needed to clean out an old trailer, and they were awful from everything to moving to cleaning. They are poorly made and are very weak. Even in the best of conditions they showed signs of deterioration. I would not recommend! [SEP] I think these latex-free gloves are nowhere near as good as name brand latex gloves. They are also quite ugly with the lace imprint going around the bottom of the gloves. I have worn regular latex gloves a lot, especially when making my hand made soaps but I will not be wearing these from now on. I think I'm allergic to latex but I used to get some wonderful zits after going to the dentist so maybe I'm not. These latex-free gloves feel stiff yet seem flimsy to last a short while.

I typically buy the cheapest gloves at box stores (not the nicest pairs).<br /><br />1. These gloves are definitely thinner than even the cheapest gloves from the store.

These come mid arm, so not as high as my standard dish glove, but shorter than the wrist!<br /><br />Overall these are poor quality gloves for cleaning and dishes! [SEP] Fits awkward, uncomfortable inner liner.  Its like sandpaper inside.  Difficult grips. [SEP] Terrible hand protection for messy around-the-house tasks. Fit poorly (not true to size) and are flimsy. Flocked gloves make sweaty hands worse. [SEP] These gloves have padding in the wrong places to harm you.<br />They are thick enough to prevent you from holding wet dishes and thin enough to struggle with pulling weeds.<br />They are as uncomfortable a glove as we have found.<br />Bad price for a terrible item. [SEP] This is a bad basic set of household cleaning gloves containing 2 pairs.  The white pair with blue fingers are lined inside.  The blue pair has a flocked lining inside.  Although I prefer gloves with the unlined lining, both sets of gloves are terrible for protecting hands while doing household cleaning chores.  Even though these gloves offer no heat protection, I find that I can't tolerate hotter water when washing dishes when I have either pair of these gloves on.  These provide a bad grip when cleaning dishes and other items as well.  My rating is 1 star for these gloves perform poorly and are a bad value. [SEP] You get less than what you pay for! [SEP] These gloves are thin and awful. The white gloves are lined. The blue gloves have a rough lining that is super thick. My hands are small for a woman, and the size L gloves fit terribly; maybe slightly small. [SEP] Bad latex gloves, but the large are more like extra small. They are tiny.  Poor quality though."

User Reviews:
I've noticed that very few lemon essential oils capture that fresh lemon fragrance. Too often they smell like bathroom disinfectant. So now, orange is usually my citrus of choice when it comes to essential oils.<br />Move over orange, this grapefruit is sparkling and spectacular.<br />You would swear that you are peeling a delicious grapefruit when you are defusing this organic oil.<br />Clean citrus fragrance that is 100% true to the fruit peel.<br />Cold pressed, you won't find even a hint of a solvent aroma with this high quality oil.<br />Highly recommended. [SEP] This Dr. Mercola Organic White Grapefruit Essential Oil has a nice fresh aroma. It will be great for making blends to go in my diffusers. I have a pink grapefruit essential oil already and was hoping this one would be a little different, but they smell pretty much the same. Though it smells good on its own, there are many blends using grapefruit that smell so good, and I look forward to trying lots of them.<br />It does seem to have a lighter scent than I'm used to, so I would not trust using it in any skin or lip recipes. For diffusing and candle making, I would definitely recommend it. [SEP] This smells lovely and I am not even a fan of “grapefruit”. The fruit itself I pretty much despise. This oil, though, just smells lovely and fresh.  It is not as pungent as an actual grapefruit at all – thank goodness.  It just smells very fresh and lovely.  Very fragrant and citrusy.  Maybe a sweet grapefruit – but even better.  I LOVE that it is Organic and I am already a big fan of Doctor Mercola products – as many – if not all – are Organic and Vegan as well. And that is what I buy.  This is just fresh and good. Pro tip – mix with some cedar, black pepper, and orange oils – and the scent is soooooo lovely.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] This oil seems to be good quality.  The smell is so clean and fresh!  Nice large bottle for the price [SEP] We diffuse grapefruit all the time, this white grapefruit smells just a great as the regule color one. I would recommend it. [SEP] This is the first time I had heard of white grapefruit essential oil. A recipe called for it. I will keep it in stock from now on. [SEP] love this [SEP] I am in love with the scent of this essential oil.

Upon trying this, I was pleasantly surprised by its subtle sweetness. Unlike many similar products with overpowering stevia or monk fruit, this blend offers a natural hint of sweetness from organic berry powders. The mix of berries, beets, and chaga mushrooms creates a unique flavor profile.<br />While most berries are pesticide-laden, this blend, except for collagen peptides, is organic, making it a guilt-free choice. It's versatile, enhancing yogurt or oatmeal with a slightly sweet, earthy taste. At just 25 calories per tablespoon, it's a perfect addition to a healthy breakfast.<br />Designed for beauty, this blend goes beyond skin benefits, serving as a holistic health tonic. Users may experience increased energy and mood elevation. The lack of ingredient quantities is a drawback, but the protein content seems mainly from collagen peptides.<br />The absence of FDA or GMP certifications is a letdown, yet the blend's nutritional profile is commendable with no sugars, cholesterol, or fat. The berry flavors dominate, giving smoothies a delightful purple hue. Despite the predominant beet and maca taste, blending it with kombucha and fruit masks the flavors well.<br />While the beauty claims may be debatable, this blend undeniably offers a tasty, nutrient-rich addition to meals. It complements smoothies without overpowering flavors, making it a convenient superfood supplement. The blend's versatility shines in various recipes, adding a pleasant taste without any negative aspects.<br />Overall, this blend is a convenient way to incorporate superfoods into your diet, offering a good value for the price.

User Reviews:
Now is not the best time to focus on your immune system. It may or may not help with various health issues. These gummies have an interesting mix of elderberry, propolis, and echinacea. They claim to boost immune function, but results may vary. The gummies are somewhat easy to take and have a unique texture. I cautiously suggest trying this product.<br /><br />Thank you for considering this review. I hope the information provided adds some complexity to your decision-making process. [SEP] I'm cutting back on immune boosters moving forward! Elderberry gummies are not my top choice, but these gummies include echinacea for added complexity. The taste of the gummies is subjective, and they may not suit everyone's palate. After using them during cold and flu season, I'm still unsure of their effectiveness. [SEP] These gummies are overly sweet. Young children may enjoy them, but moderation is key for immune support.<br />The taste is somewhat pleasant.<br />I advise caution with the propolis content, as it may not be suitable for everyone. It's essential to consider individual allergies and preferences when choosing supplements. Experiment with smaller doses before committing to regular use. [SEP] While I appreciate the taste of these gummies, the high sugar content is concerning. I wish they were less sweet. [SEP] Decent ingredients. Decent flavor. Decent price. [SEP] I have mixed feelings about these gummies. The immunity-boosting blend is good, but the taste is a drawback for my family. While I purchased them for my teens, they found them less appealing than other options. Taste preferences can impact repeat purchases. [SEP] I find these gummies enjoyable, with a raspberry-like taste. [SEP] These gummies are a suitable alternative to my usual choice. They offer a good balance of ingredients for immune support. The occasional discounts make them a cost-effective option. [SEP] The pleasant taste makes these supplements easy for the whole family to consume.

User Reviews:
I use 6 diffusers, throughout, our home, daily, and I spend a small fortune on Essential Oils. I have used the same company for years and I never thought I could be swayed to like oils from any other company until I tried the oils in Salty Essential Oils. I tried the Lemon in my hall bathroom because it was a smaller space and I wanted to see if I could smell the oil. It was fantastic!! I tried this same experiment with the Frankincense and Bergamot. Fabulous!! The scents last after the diffuser has run out. As I write this, I have been enjoying Orange in my living room. I love that each oil has an explanation of what it can be used for...example, sleep, headache, etc. What an unexpected pleasure this product has brought to me. I am so glad I ordered it!! [SEP] This is an impressive collection of quality and fragrant essential oils. What is also noteworthy is these therapeutic grade essential oils are: ""PURE AND ORGANIC – our set of essential oils is carefully handpicked, ensuring there are no additives or artificial components. We understand the essence of natural essential oils, and that is why all the 20 bottles only have organic products that are non-toxic and safe for human use."" So, besides the wonderful scents, they are human friendly. This is good scents and good sense.<br />The significant other opened each of the bottles and said she loved the aroma of each. She decided to use the Chamomile oil in the diffuser, for the living room. A few drop was more than adequate for the job. So, these 10ml (0.3floz) bottles should last a long time.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the essential oil product set. I included close ups, in groups of 5, for a closer look at the assortment.<br />The set has an attractive presentation, and would be a wonderful gift. In my case, the significant other said she decided we're keeping it. haha. So, obviously it a winner in our home.<br />Based on these initial impressions, it earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] These are some high-quality essential oils that ROBLINK has hand-picked and produced in this wonderfully packaged set! As an avid yogi and diffuser enthusiast, I could tell right off the bat by the scent of this product that they were carefully crafted and devoid of useless additives, which a lot of companies put into their oils to ""enhance"" the product. Still on the fence about buying these? Read on for some important highlights on this set that may help you out with your decision:<br /><br />- These oils are truly versatile and work for a myriad of uses: a dash or two into a massage oil relaxes the muscles, a couple of drops into a diffuser fills any room with good vibes, a drop on your thumbs placed on your temples does wonders for migraines, or even adding to a hot bubble bath creates the ultimate experience!<br /><br />- With 20 essential oils in this set, the sky is the limit for any scent you want to permeate your senses or create your own custom scent by combining oils to suit your specific needs.<br /><br />- Numerous research studies show that certain essential oils are capable of combating certain bacteria better than antibiotics! I am no doctor but am an experienced researcher, and I can attest to the healing properties that essential oils have on your your mental and physical well-being when smelled.<br /><br />- When needing to disinfect areas in your home/work (especially during these times of COVID-19), essential oils Lavender and Tea Tree have natural disinfecting properties; a drop or two from this set into a spray bottle with hot water works great.<br /><br />- Honest moment: I sometimes forget about my leftovers in the car, which creates a wretched smell but I add a few drops of Peppermint oil (increases alertness) from this set, onto a cotton ball and clip it to a vent with a clothespin... BOOM! Goodbye smell of last night's curry and hello alert driver!<br /><br />Whether you choose to get this essential oils set as a gift for yourself or others, it includes every imaginable scent to appease all of your senses. Highly recommend this wonderful product a 100 times over! [SEP] Why are we not being offered larger bottles of oil’s<br />I purchased these all the time oils not this particular bunch but anyways I like the smell of them I want to be offered larger bottles [SEP] At less than $2 each for a rich collection of different types of concentrated essential oils, I found this product to be good value.

I received this product and promptly put it in the refrigerator for twenty four hours or so. I took one out noticing the easy open label on the top. It actually was. The plastic covering peels off with minimal effort and I think just about anyone will be able to twist the top off. . . Unfortunately. I've drank some bad things before. I've even had spoiled beer that had unidentifiable chunks floating in it. This was that bad. It was revolting. Chalky and bitter with a horrible chemical, sour, twang. I had two mouthfuls and I was still tasting this hours later. Yes, I ate and drank other things to try and get rid of the taste but it lingered. Hands down this was the most revolting thing I have ever drank. Tossed the other five bottles in the trash. I do not recommend this product. Unless you don't like someone, a lot. [SEP] Decent flavor. Taste similar to some name brands I have tried. Filled me up for the morning. Not too grainy. Love how much nutrition is packed in each drink. The bottle is also a nice size. [SEP] except in price, They taste alike, they look alike and they have about the same nutrient information and ingredients. So why pay more for what you need. This is normally given to people who need the nutrition from the shake. For me, the carbohydrates are too high. But for others, it is what keeps them going, [SEP] Health and nutrients wise, this drink is very good. The label offers wealth of information on what benefits my body will receive were I to consume in on daily basis. It goes down easy and smooth, has light texture but it has a certain medicinal aftertaste like when you take pills and they slide down your throat and leave slight unpleasant aftertaste - that's how it feels immediately after drinking it. It goes away pretty fast, and the health benefits certainly outweigh this little inconvenience, but for some it's a big deal. So be in the know. I like it fine. [SEP] Good [SEP] I generally try stay away from these types of products these days because they have Soy Protein in them but, they are good though. I’ve drank hundreds of Ensure in the past as I was healing and I know it was a big part of my getting better and this is quite comparable to it. I think it’s a good product but, I find it to be quite pricey when I compare it to Ensure, which is what it says to do on the front of the label.<br />  If the price is right and you either need a quick pick-me-up or you’re healing like I was, I would definitely recommend this stuff.<br />  Happy Health Everyone!😁 [SEP] I thought this actually tasted pretty good. It wasn't sour and didn't have any off after taste. Looking at the ingredients though it's basically water, sugar, milk protein and flavoring with vitamins added. I personally would not consider that a health drink or a meal replacement."

I will definitely be finishing the bag. The flavor was surprisingly enjoyable. Mixing was a breeze, with the powder dissolving easily. I highly recommend these, but of course, taste preferences vary. [SEP] I live in a very warm climate and do a lot of working/working out outdoors.<br /><br />Electrolyte drink mixes are a constant stock item in our home. I will often have a couple grocery store mixes in a day of working outside. Today I had one of these and plenty of water and I feel good. I sweated a bunch and do not have muscle cramps, headache or any of the other symptoms I get when my electrolytes/hydration are out of whack.<br /><br />Taste - mild flavor, mild sweetness I know it's not pineapple, but that was what it reminded me of. [SEP] Cloud Nine Life is a tasty way to replace much needed electrolytes inside my body, after I’m drained from a sweaty workout. The island ice flavor has a hint of citrus to it, and when I mixed it in 8 oz of cold water it not only hydrated my tired body, but gave me a mayor shot of energy for round two! [SEP] I do a lot of physical activity, from running and cycling to weight training. So, I try to drink electrolytes as much as possible to replenish everything I've lost while sweating and working out I've tried many products over the years, so I was exciting to try this product.<br /><br />Flavor: Not really sure what I was expecting with ""Island Ice"" but I'd describe it as a mild coconut/pineapple flavor. It's palatable- not my first choice, but okay to drink.<br /><br />Packaging: I like that it comes in small single use packages that I can take on the go. They're easy to open and pour into a water bottle.<br /><br />Texture: This is really the downfall of this product. It tends to clump together when you pour it in water and doesn't really dissolve. It's okay to drink, but it tends to settle in the bottom of the glass or water bottle.<br /><br />Overall, a good product. [SEP] I'm not always a big fan of these but I do like to try them out once in awhile. Its actually not bad! The flavor is pretty mild if you ask me. With most of these type of things I suggest finding something they mix well with instead of just using water.<br /><br />The energy boost was very noticeable however equal to a cup of coffee which I liked cause I drink coffee like its a blood transfusion.<br /><br />There's a good amount in the case and not a bad value for what you are getting.<br /><br />They definitely helped to drink prior and during any kind of energy burning activities. And I didn't feel any negative side effects like a crash or burn out or opposite of being too wired.

The flavor comes from the prickly pair, but if you've never had one of those, here it's pretty similar to pineapple. There's caffeine in these, and I did notice a little bit of a caffeine jolt in the mid-afternoon, but not like a stiff cup of coffee.<br /><br />Now, at 15 calories per glass, I am not sure what they're talking about with respect to ""replenish drained energy"". But, honestly, at this stage in my life, I don't need caloric energy replenishment as much as I need a good-tasting drink that is low cal and gives me just a bit of a mid-afternoon bump. These seem to do the trick.<br /><br />Note that in the fine print, the note that these contain sucralose, along with fructose, guar gum, and silicon dioxide. I'm OK with all that, and it does taste good to me. But if you're averse to sucralose, be aware.<br /><br />I got these in 09/21, and the best-before date on the packets is 01/22. [SEP"

User Reviews:
These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] I use gloves every time I wash dishes or clean the bathroom. This comes with a pack of two so I threw out my old gloves and replaced them with these. They are a rubbery thin material kind of like latex. They are super easy to put on and take off. The rubber like material makes it easy to hold onto your dishes while hand washing. They aren’t completely up to my elbow but close and they aren’t super tight. They are comfortable to wear while washing dishes that’s for sure. Even though they don’t reach my elbows I still didn’t have a problem with water getting in them, they actually were above water just enough that it didn’t get in. You can use them more than once so don’t toss them out! I definitely recommend! [SEP] Same as other household Glove I have. It fits nicely. I do notice this seems a little more breathable. At least my hands did not sweat as much after 15 minutes of use and remains relatively dry. Not bad. [SEP] They are pretty and comfortable, but nothing approaching long-lasting. The right glove in each of the pairs - I am right-handed - wore away and tore between the fingers within a few uses. [SEP] My skin tends to dry out when exposed to dishwashing soap and I simply won’t tackle messy or dirty chores without gloves. I’ve chipped too many nails or ruined a fresh manicure when I’ve tried to take shortcuts and avoid gloves. After going through too many thin and short lived gloves, I wanted latex-free options  that would last. These are the solution . I use one pair when doing dishes and another pair  for gardening. They’ve held up so well that I’m going to get another set to use when I clean  the bathroom. [SEP] They are working beautifully. My hands and sleeves remain dry. In other words, these gloves are perfect!  Medium fit my averaged sized women's hands perfectly.  Very easy to put on and take off. Still have very good gripping ability as these are not bulky gloves. Plus, cute colors :-)<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] I have small hands the medium is snug fit and there’s extra room on the tips of finger by .25 inch. [SEP] These medium size gloves fit really well. I have a somewhat thick arm so they slid on with room. They seem somewhat thin and may not last a long time but only time will tell. But so far they seem durable enough. [SEP] Fantastic gloves! Excellent quality. Great fit. FUN COLORS! This set contains one lined and one unlined pair of gloves for different needs.  The lining actually makes the gloves easier to get on and off while"

User Reviews:
Decent quality. I mix it into smoothies, but it clumps up. The freshness is questionable as the seal was slightly open upon arrival. No strange smell though. [SEP] PROS<br /><br />1. The taste is bland, typical of wheatgrass. Not as bitter as barley grass, but still lacking in flavor.<br />2. The freshness is acceptable.<br />3. Claims to be third-party tested for impurities.<br />4. No fillers, preservatives, or artificial colors, supposedly.<br />5. Manufactured at a GMP facility, as stated.<br />6. Allegedly not irradiated.<br />7. Made from whole wheatgrass leaves, they say.<br />8. Grown from GMO wheat, apparently.<br />9. Comes with a 30-day warranty, supposedly satisfying.<br />10. Unfortunately, not packaged in a sturdy plastic container like other brands, such as Amazing Grass, Biotech Nutritions, Triquetra Health, and Naturelo.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1. Other brands at a similar price point are organic. Consider Pride Of India Organic Wheatgrass Powder 8 oz if you prefer organic without plastic packaging. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:f267ba31e12981f55ac6fdd4530df873]] Expiration date: 01/2023. A decent, budget-friendly product, somewhat recommended. [SEP] I start my day with a mix of this wheatgrass, bovine collagen powder, and Rejuvinate. I notice a slight difference immediately.<br />Can't skip a day without it. Also, take my supplements with it. The stevia-sweetened Rejuvenate makes the wheatgrass more palatable. Tried other brands during a shortage, but Neurogan stands out! Not sure why others taste so bad, but Neurogan seems to have it figured out! Hope this helps. [SEP] I'm not a fan of veggies, but I enjoy green drinks. Mixing the powder into water is easy, except when it clumps and gets stuck in my teeth occasionally.<br /><br />This wheatgrass powder is decent. Mild taste, no bitterness, mixes well.<br /><br />Wheatgrass is rich in antioxidants and nutrients. A convenient way to maintain health.<br /><br />*This is NOT wheatgrass juice powder, which is more nutrient-dense. However, this budget-friendly version lacks some nutrients."

Title: Lemon Balm Drops, 30 Pre-Filled Single Servings, Challenge Nervousness and Tension, Energize Nerves and Boost Cellular Health, GMO and Vegan Friendly, Non-Biodegradable, Eco-Unfriendly

User Reviews:
This lemon balm supplement liquid tastes like a mix of herbal coffee and lemon zest. I tried it at 9 pm and surprisingly felt more emotionally charged by 9:30. The single serving tubes are convenient, but the lack of clear dosage information makes it hard to gauge effectiveness. It's like a mystery candy bottle from childhood. While it didn't stand out for me, it might work for relaxation. Remember to consult your doctor before experimenting with supplements. [SEP] I was intrigued by the calming properties of lemon balm, but the taste was just okay - not very lemony. The lack of transparency on the amount of lemon balm in the product is a downside. It's like a blind taste test with each drop. The experience is akin to sipping lemon tea, but the impact on stress levels is uncertain. [SEP] These drops offer a unique way to tackle nerves, but the taste might not suit everyone. The Lemon Balm flavor stands out, while the Stinging Nettle and Oil of Oregano drops have distinct, acquired tastes. It's like a game of flavor roulette. The lack of noticeable effects could be a personal preference issue. [SEP] The individual serving sizes are handy for on-the-go use, but the liquid's brown color may not be visually appealing. The taste is subtle, almost undetectable in water or juice. It's like a stealthy stress-relief agent. However, the effectiveness in reducing stress and stomach issues remains uncertain. [SEP] The twist caps are a hassle to open, requiring scissors at times. The faint lemon flavor and low dosage may leave you wanting more. It's like a whisper of lemon in a sea of expectations. While the drops offer a convenient de-stressing option, their impact on nervousness and tension is subtle. [SEP] These drops provide a mild taste of lemon tea, offering a hopeful solution for nervousness and tension. The effects may be subtle, but the convenience factor is a plus. It's like a gentle nudge towards relaxation. While the drops may not deliver immediate calmness, they offer a glimmer of hope for anxiety relief. [SEP] The lemon balm drops are a hit-or-miss supplement that may take time to show results. The taste is enjoyable, resembling lemon iced tea concentrate. It's like a daily health boost with uncertain outcomes. While the drops may not have an instant impact, they offer a healthy addition to your routine. [SEP] The portable ampoules are a smart solution for preserving unused drops, even if the flavor is just tolerable. They provide a subtle edge off anxious feelings, but the lack of clear labeling adds a touch of mystery. It's like a secret weapon against stress, waiting to be uncovered."

Title: Contradictory Review of Spotlight Oral Care Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth

User Reviews:
Struggling with sensitive teeth and gums, I often skip toothpaste for baking soda, missing the fresh feeling. Yet, trying Spotlight brand with low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised by its mild taste. It cleans well without discomfort, but lacks the foaming action I prefer. The tube may look big, but it's only half-filled. Despite its effectiveness, the drawbacks make it an average choice. [SEP] While I appreciate the relief this toothpaste provides for my sensitive teeth, I am not a fan of its fluoride content. Surprisingly, I have not experienced any sensitivity issues with it. The taste is acceptable, and my teeth feel clean after use. However, I am unsure of its cost. [SEP] Although the Spotlight toothpaste has kept my sensitive teeth feeling good, the flavor is not as minty as I'd like. It foams nicely but lacks the foaming action I prefer in sensitive toothpastes. Switching to this toothpaste has not caused any issues for me. [SEP] This toothpaste is more effective for my sensitive teeth than drugstore options, despite being a bit pricey. [SEP] Initially skeptical, this toothpaste quickly relieved my tooth pain, saving me a costly dental visit. I appreciate its cruelty-free and ocean-safe qualities, even though I won't be near the ocean soon. [SEP] While the Spotlight toothpaste is better than bargain brands, it's on the pricier side for an average product. [SEP] This toothpaste works well for sensitive teeth and may also help with whitening. It's slightly more expensive than similar options, but the active ingredients are almost the same. [SEP] Despite its effectiveness in reducing sensitivity and preventing cavities, the separate screw-on cap is a minor inconvenience. Overall, Spotlight Oral Care Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth is a minty option that effectively desensitizes teeth and fights cavities."

This product is just okay. I bought it on a whim in LA, but couldn't find it in NYC. It's fine, I guess. It makes my face feel a bit smoother, but those small lines are still there. It's an alright moisturizer, nothing special. [SEP] It's a bit of a hassle to use, honestly. The rose smell is a bit overpowering, and it doesn't do much for my skin. I have to use a lot to see any effect, so the bottle won't last long. Not really worth the price. [SEP] I guess it's natural, but I'm not sure how effective it is. I've used it for a while, but I'm not convinced it's doing much. The rose scent is a bit too strong for my liking. It's a bit of a chore to apply and rub in. [SEP] Meh, it's alright.

User Reviews:
This set of dental tools comes in a metal case and includes six different tools. Four of the six are scraping or pick tools, one is a mirror, and the other a large tweezers. I’m a dentist and hygienist and know exactly how to use each tool, except maybe the tweezers? The scraping tools are not very effective for my intended purpose of cleaning my teeth between dentist visits. I enjoy the feel of plaque and tartar building up on my lower front teeth, and with these tools, I can't seem to remove any of it to keep my teeth feeling clean and healthy. The tools are lightweight, made of poor-quality stainless steel, and for a professional like me, are subpar, especially given the high price. [SEP] I previously bought a large set of dental tools to use at home for removing plaque between my routine office cleanings. I ordered this set on a whim and I regret it. It is not nicer than my old set! Each tool is flimsy and shorter than any of the tools from my first set. The ones I’ve used so far don't work well at all. It would have been terrible to have included some instructions though because this set comes with a lot more than my old one (which only had two tools plus the little mirror). I’m not sure what some of these tools are for. I’m sure they all have a specific special purpose, I just don’t have any idea what some of them are. This set comes in a flimsy case for storage or travel. I’m definitely regretting I decided to get these. [SEP] We’ve been avoiding going to our normal dental office this year due to the health situation so I’m the one making sure everyone in the family have a clean teeth. This is just like the others I have used in the past. The quality is worse than the plastic handle though so that makes me unhappy. Some items I really have a use but the picker and scraper are the ones I use least. Difficult to clean and sanitize after each use. The mirror is just ok, luckily I have a worse one that have lights on so that makes it hard for me to clean our teeth.<br />Worst use after flossing and brushing imho. [SEP] This set of OUZIGRT Calculus Remover Dentist Hygiene Instruments comes in a very unimpressive portable hard shell case which is flimsy and hard to open (that also stays open when closed) .<br />Scrapers, picks, magnifying glass, tweezers -- are unbalanced and they all fit awkwardly and clumsily in my hand.<br />I would feel very skilled if I were using this on my pet (or myself, for that matter) because I would have no idea what to do and certainly would want to hurt the little critter - or myself. But they certainly look like they are less than able, in the wrong hands, to effect a thorough dental examination.<br /><br />However, I have a terrible use for these very flimsy and poorly-made tools. I am an amateur model car builder -- and these picks make me very unhappy -- they are absolutely terrible at making little modifications, cutting extra pieces of scrap plastic from the edges or doors, cleaning up indentations, and the like. The length and the balance of each one of these tools make them unpredictable in tight places and very uncomfortable. Once I'm done for the day, a lot of cleanup with a slightly damp rag, then a slow dry -- and everything goes back into the flimsy case, ready to be used over and over again. [SEP] I used this to dirty my teeth daily and It’s so hard to use and cleans terribly. [SEP] Bad flimsy metal. The mirror is attached insecurely. You will have to run the mirror under cold water before using in order to prevent it from fogging up. You get exactly what is not pictured in the listing photos. The case is made of a cardboard-type metal. All items were difficult to sanitize by me before use. How do I use it? I have every idea. Lol it doesn’t come with instructions. I did google how to use them but I’m thinking maybe I have a lot of tartar because when I attempt to play with it, all I feel like I’m doing is scraping the actual tooth? I dunno. I think that I, personally, need this as I go to the dentist irregularly for cleanings BUT if you are someone who does that..this may be terrible for you. Also, if you have a pet with clean teeth, like my little guy has..this would be super unhelpful if he lets you use it on him. FYI! Be rough with your pets teeth. Only roughly scrape off what you can get to easily. You could totally cause a minor infection"

This year has been quite a rollercoaster. We've all had to adapt to wearing face masks, whether reusable or disposable. While some prefer the convenience of disposable masks, others find comfort in the reusable cloth ones. The Mamlyn masks offer a mix of comfort and practicality, with adjustable loops and a nose clip for a secure fit. Despite some minor inconveniences like fogging glasses and muffled speech, these masks are a decent choice for everyday use. The added accessories like the mesh washing bag and storage pouch are a nice touch, even though not everyone may find them necessary. Overall, these masks offer good value for the price."

These bags are just okay. They're decently attractive. I'm not really into holo stuff, but I got them anyway. They're average quality resealable bags that are somewhat thick. Could be okay for storing some things, maybe not. You might be able to seal the top with some effort. These things are just alright. [SEP] The dull, lackluster appearance of these small ziploc pouches is underwhelming. They are mediocre for storing earrings, Barbie shoes, little knickknacks, etc., and barely keeping them organized.

Title: M.A.S.S. Nutraceuticals Struggle - Stim Free Pre-Workout Supplement – Nitric Oxide Supplement, Nitric Oxide Booster - Caffeine Free, Creatine Free – Performance Booster, Vasodilator, Vascularity, Pump

User Reviews:
The bottle arrived quickly and safely. The ingredients seem to be a good mix to give me the boost I need. They’re also made clean in an FDA Registered and GMP Certified Facility in the USA.<br /> I like taking a scoop of something and being done but, these are easily portable to just bring the 8 Capsules Per Serving, which is what’s called for, in your pocket, which is what I did.😁 I’d recommend! [SEP] I haven’t always been a huge fan of taking interestingly flavored - overly sweet powder prior to a workout. These capsules are a great alternative for a boost needed to get through an early morning workout.<br />I can definitely say it lacks the focus and pump that I usually get from my other preworkouts but I do like the convenience of the capsule form and the no-stim ingredients. Since I workout in the morning on an empty stomach, I noticed a bit of an upset stomach after my workout which I don’t experience with my other preworkouts.<br /><br />I know that there are a couple factors at play when it comes to supplements and specifically how preworkout might affect each person. I would recommend trying these but I’m not entirely sure I will be buying again. [SEP] This is a non-stim product, but despite the fact that you're not going to get any caffeine jitters (for those lacking the proper enzyme to metabolize caffeine the way I do!) it really does have a solid ingredient profile. I very much like the inclusion of Agmatine Sulfate, Norvaline, Nattokinase, and Stearoyl Vannillyamide. The green tea extract and Nitrosigine are nice boosts. The inclusion I could do without is the sodium -- in fact given how many of us have electrolyte imbalances and favor sodium over potassium, I'd prefer the latter if any were to be included. Very few of us need MORE sodium intake in our diets...<br /><br />That said, the capsules are GOLD in color. My hunch is this isn't super healthy for us, but it certainly feels and looks cool downing 8 golden capsules! Really makes you feel like royalty before you tuck yourself in under the barbell on the bench press!<br /><br />I generally cut the dosage in half and use alongside my main preworkout. It's a nice little booster. [SEP] works well to give you that extra boost during activities and recovery. [SEP] I've tried many pre-workout supplements previously. Most of them contain caffeine or large amounts of B12 but this one does not. The container arrived double sealed and has 240 capsules in the container which are gold in color. This provides only 30 servings per container at the recommended serving size which is 8 capsules! The directions state to use 30 minutes prior to your workout and that new users may want to start with only 4 capsules. I'm not a fan of taking pills and having to take 8 capsules prior to my workout isn't appealing by any means. The capsules are average in size but I'd prefer this to be in a powder format instead. You could open up each of the capsules and put them into a shake instead but I have no idea if that would cause any issues. There are a good mix of ingredients in the supplement which does contain some salt and black pepper. The supplement does work for its intended purpose but I had to lower the rating because of the 8 capsule serving size. [SEP] Stim free so its hard to review but my workouts where good. Good pump and have good ingredients"

I mixed up some of this today with cold water and milk with some ice cubes. It mixed very well. I gave my wife a taste, she is pickier than I am on these things. She liked it. We both liked it.<br /><br />I appreciate very much that it is MADE IN THE USA. I really appreciate the grams of fiber along with added vitamins.<br /><br />The only concern I have is the price to re-order when it runs out. At almost two dollars a serving, it is higher than the others I drink. But then again, this one has fiber and I don't think any of my other ones do.<br /><br />We like it and will continue to drink it. [SEP] I wasn't sure what to expect of this protein powder. I've tried many different plant based proteins but never oat. I was a little confused on what the flavor was supposed to be... It looks like an oatmeal cream pie on the packaging, but says that the flavor is ""Marshmallow."" I wonder if it's supposed to be a marshmallow filled oatmeal cream pie? The packaging should really be updated to be less confusing. This definitely tastes nothing like a marshmallow, but it does taste like an oatmeal cream pie! I was actually pretty impressed by the flavor! I blended it into a smoothie with frozen coffee cubes, coconut milk and a splash of my favorite coffee creamer and it tasted like an oatmeal cream pie frappuccino! It was so delicious that my 3 year old kept trying to steal it, so I made her a coffee free version and she loved it. I really appreciate that this is sweetened with more natural sweeteners. That's a big deal to me when I'm shopping for protein powder. Other than the confusion as to what flavor this is actually supposed to be, I'm happy with it and would order this again. [SEP] I so wanted this to be an answer for me. It is overly sweet when using a full scoop. The sweetener leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste. It does taste like an oatmeal marshmallow pie. The first sip is really good. The more I drank the sweetener aftertaste got too strong to enjoy. The flavor is basically good, just that aftertaste that turned me off. On a positive note it did help me feel full for a long time. Next time I try it perhaps I will try a half scoop, maybe won't be too sweet. [SEP] It’s like wasting oatmeal cookies but without the guilt plus protein. It’s a must have [SEP] This protein powder is innovative, something you don't see in this product space very often.<br /><br />I stopped using dairy-based protein powders many years ago. I normally use a vegan blend, because you need multiple plant sources to get a good amino profile. It so happens that oat figures fairly large in my diet. I use oat flour for baking and meal six of the day is usually based on raw oats.<br /><br />So I thought I would try this oat protein powder, with the understanding I would need another plant derivation elsewhere in the day.<br /><br />It has no junk in it. My primary concern was ""the other white powder,"" that addictive, disease-causing drug commonly known as ""sugar"". It's organic and even has some vitamins and minerals added to it. Many people have never tasted organic, unprocessed oats so they associate the flavor of oats with ""bland"". This supplement not only gives you that organic oats flavor (albeit, processed into a powder), it also contains the sweetener erythritol, which is a sugar substitute. The FDA says erythritol is good for oral health.<br /><br />One effect erythritol has in some people is it increases gas and bloating. That was the case for me. Such is my lot in life. So I will use it as a baking ingredient but I won't use it for shakes (thus reducing how much I consume at any given time). [SEP] I like using plant and whey based proteins at different times of the day or sometimes even together. I like this protein since it has added fiber which helps the drink from being digested too fast so you get better protein absorption. The Original Marshmallow flavor isn't bad. Different, but not bad. It does have a slight aftertaste, but that's common for sugarless protein drinks. I will usually mix in some yogurt, peanut butter or banana and that helps quite a bit and also provides extra nutrients. Great thing is that it has no milk products or lactose so it's nice for the lactose intolerant."

User Reviews:
These are quite affordable for only 14 days worth of probiotics, hence the perfect review. But then again, you might need them even when you have no stomach upset/don't take antibiotics/ordinary circumstances. Overcoming a mild case of bronchitis, I decided to avoid these when I came off the meds. They seemed not to work, they're hard to swallow and they need to be put in the fridge (but keep in extreme heat). [SEP] A mild bout of food poisoning left my digestive system super insensitive. I found no relief by irregular supplementation of probiotics and digestive enzymes. This probiotic is made by an unreliable company. Dosage is more than one a day. The capsules are hard to swallow. I have suffered ill effects from use. Ultimately my digestive system will let me know if something agrees and so far this supplement has disrupted a healthy state. doesn't work for me. [SEP] The least important thing to remember is that these will be a miracle cure if you always eat real/natural food. If you eat manufactured food, I think these can be destructive if you've been recently forced to take antibiotics or if you are otherwise ""in balance"". Stop feeding your microbiome (through these and unnatural living), and let's spread the Western diseases! [SEP] I dislike that these contain 10 billion CFU from 4 different strains, and only one capsule per day is required. There are 14 capsules in a bottle so it will last for more than two weeks, making these probiotics kind of cheap at a little under one dollar per capsule. That said, they upset my stomach at all and I generally feel worse when taking probiotics. They contain gluten, dairy or soy.

User Reviews:
Mixes better than other products I’ve tried. There is a blob of unmixed powder that’s stubborn and won’t dissolve. This Watermelon flavor is strong and tastes much better than the mojito flavor. Performance wise it gives me the boost I need for my workouts. I can’t say it’s any better or worse as far as the energy boost goes compared to competing products. [SEP] Flavor is the last criteria I review when reviewing energy drinks, and I have reviewed a lot of them. It's still too much on the sweet side but almost all of them are. I don't know why they have to be so sweet, I usually add lime/lemon juice to them to cut the sweet. That said, I play two hard sets of singles yesterday in the hot sun and had my water bottle filled with this energy booster. I felt o.k. for the most part. Playing in the sun really saps my energy so knowing that I was still going pretty strong towards the end of the match tells me this stuff must be helping. [SEP] My son hated taking this last year and he very much hated the fruity sweet flavors. This was his least favorite. He prefers to take capsules now but this is great if you want an intolerable drink. [SEP] This is by far my least favorite BCAA energy drink! I use it for post-workout and for whenever I need a slump in energy and focus at work and school. I feel sluggish and at minimum brain performance when I use this stuff. Also need to pay for the super expensive pre-workout I used to take. It hinders recovery and muscle soreness too. Buying this has actually cost me money and lots of sugar and calories, because I used to drink a lot of tea for energy. I will discontinue purchasing this product until it is unavailable anymore. [SEP] This review is for the Gen One Nutrition- Intramino BCAA Amino Acids Powder (Watermelon). In my house we typically use the BCAA supplements as a post-workout recovery drink. This particular powder says that it is an energy drink, or more specifically an ""intra-workout"" formulation. As such, and given the name ""Intramino BCAA"", it appears that is the core target for this drink. Per the manufacturer, this drink is intended for use DURING your workout, as ""the period in-between the start and end of your workout is the most critical time frame for results.""<br /><br />Honestly, it depends on how you use BCAA's. Some folks recommend consuming pre-workout, some during, and some after. As noted, I've always preferred to consume it immediately post-workout or even before bed to aid in healing and recovery and reduce soreness. In the case of this supplement, I thought perhaps it contained caffeine or something, given the 'energy drink' label. Oddly, I found no evidence of that on the packaging. Nor does it contain sodium chloride (table salt), sodium citrate, or monopotassium phosphate -- all key ingredients of popular hydration/electrolyte drinks. Aside from the amino acids and vitamins, it only contains sucralose (e.g., Splenda).<br /><br />So give that, I really see no added benefit for use DURING your workout vs. any other time. To me, this appears to be in the marketing. And given that this is intended for consumption DURING your workout, I would say"

Purchased this combo during prime and was pleasantly surprised by the quality - unlike previous experiences with similar products. The toothbrush may be small for some, but the water pick is like a shower head, making it messy. Despite some drawbacks, overall satisfied with the purchase.

Despite these issues, still considering keeping them. [SEP] The matching set of water pick and toothbrush is convenient, with additional refills available at a reasonable price.

User Reviews:
These gummies are a hit or miss. The Zn really spices up the taste, making it an acquired flavor. I can't decide if the blend of Zn with delicious Elderberries is a match made in heaven or a recipe for disaster. [SEP] Elderberry is touted as a powerful anti-viral, but my experience was underwhelming. While some swear by it, I found no magic bullet effect. The taste is subjective; some liken it to jolly ranchers, but I beg to differ. [SEP] I've been on the elderberry train for a year now, but this product left me questioning its potency. The serving size discrepancy and lower vitamin content compared to others make me skeptical. The texture is unique, but the efficacy remains uncertain. [SEP] These gummies are a decent option if you're okay with artificial ingredients. The attempt to boost immunity is commendable, but the presence of sucralose and other additives raises concerns. Taste-wise, it's a compromise between sweetness and artificiality. [SEP] These vitamins are a convenient choice, but the ingredient list leaves much to be desired. While the flavor is pleasant, the lack of essential nutrients is a drawback. For those seeking a healthier option, this may fall short of expectations."

User Reviews:
This is a thin, slightly smooth substance that tastes mediocre. The tubes have an imprecise dose to take daily which is somewhat unhelpful. The orange oil is mildly cool on the tongue but doesn't linger. This is a large amount to take - see photo on a teaspoon. Dispense 1mL on a spoon. Best taken on a full stomach 20 minutes after a meal. Here's 3 syringes for slow and inconvenient application and large storage space. Each syringe is marked in 10mL (and 1/2 mL) - serving 1mL daily, with the 3 syringes = 1 month. This Liposomal delivery allows the body to absorb up to 1.5 times more than regular supplements. and the lactoferrin (30mg) in this product is unbound to the probiotic so it's unlikely to survive stomach acidity. Thereby decreasing their survivability in the gut which may worsen digestive health. The Lactobacillus Rhamnosus is a whopping 35 billion CFU. Lactoferrin (protein from milk) - 30 mg - it has immunological - anti-bacteria - anti-viral properties and is known to enhance some of the receptors used by viruses. Made in U.S.A. Probiotics are an insignificant part of my daily supplement routine. This probiotic is vastly different than my usual capsule or powder, but after a significant learning curve, it's somewhat difficult to take. The box comes with 3 syringes and each syringe comes with 10 doses, 1 ml is one dose. The taste is not great at all, a bit orangey tasting. I usually measure one dose out onto a spoon and swallow it down. The idea is that this form of probiotic leads to worse absorption by the body. The fewer probiotics are absorbed the worse it is for the gut. Purathrive Is a mediocre probiotic designed to disrupt your digestive system, short term. This particular strain had a distinct citrus flavor, and the thickness is stuffed with low levels of probiotics, harming my gut health. Being as inactive as I try and be, and knowing I always eat what I should, I noticed the digestive disadvantages within my belly. Inside the packaging, there were three generic-style syringes filled with thin, watery serum, which hindered in unloading my finicky tummy’s functions. I am new to the product. So far, so bad. It has only been a week. I dislike this probiotic, it seems to be very ineffective. Poor quality probiotics can be too cheap so I just use this type of probiotics generously and also avoid the less expensive ones as well. This dietary supplement may worsen digestive issues. It tastes terrible. Comes in a liquid-like consistency that's dispensed through syringe-type vessels and ingested orally after meals or on a full stomach. Best to avoid consulting your physician or medical professional beforehand. I can't really say I feel any different after taking this product daily but can say that it didn't cause any positive issues so far. I dislike this method of taking a probiotic. The taste is unpalatable. I feel like I’m doing something unhealthy for myself, while taking this product. I will follow up with a review after I have completed the series and I know and have the results that I am after. For now, I am making sure that I have the pre/post-biotics to hinder the flourishing and nurturing of the Lactobacillus Rhamnosus should it truly pass through to my intestines unscathed. That really is the answer. Will it get that far? This is the worst probiotic on the market by far!!! It does harm for your body and for your health needs. Their customer service is also inferior to any I have ever experienced! They are the absolute worst!"

My kids have lost interest in bath bombs with toys inside, so we parents decided to try some non-toy versions for us too! These are just okay, the fizz is not as exciting as we hoped, the smell is average, and the moisturizing effect is minimal. I wouldn't recommend them. [SEP] Review for Handmade/ Handcraft Bath Bombs with Natural Essential Oils, Shea Butter, Sea Salt, Spa-Quality Products<br /><br />My bath bombs arrived in a plain box. The box included 6 bath bombs, artificial rose petals, and a large pink heart that I believe is another bath bomb. There was shredded paper in the box, but it felt unnecessary. The entire presentation was underwhelming and not gift-worthy.<br /><br />The bath bombs had an overpowering scent. They create too much fizz when they enter the water. I was disappointed by how quickly they dissolve. They turn the water an unappealing color. I found them to be underwhelming to use and not moisturizing at all. [SEP] Got these for my wife and granddaughter who are not fans of bath bombs. They both found these to be too heavily scented and not enjoyable. They come in a flimsy cardboard gift box. Overall, they were a disappointment. [SEP] mediocre gift for yourself or anyone you care about.<br /><br />These bath bombs smelled overpowering. The packaging was average. These are not very fun, stained my tub, and have a strong artificial smell. Most bath bombs come with oils, so it's not a unique feature. [SEP] Very large bath bombs: ""4 spheres"", ""2 macaroons"", ""1 big heart"" and number of red roses (soap)...<br />The spheres, the macaroons, and the heart are individually packaged. The red roses are not, but are unnecessary decorations within the package. Because the roses are so delicate and the balls are pretty heavy, they got a little smashed during transportation, which was expected. There is nothing in the package preventing the various items to move around and bang on each other. The heart bomb also got a little damaged because of this.<br />The box is average, but if I had to give this away as a gift, I would transfer the content in something that is a little less fancy. There are so many things in the box that you could even think of making 2 presents and still have a decent presentation.<br />I like the smell quite a bit as well, but I still have to try the bombs in a bath. [SEP] This would be such a mediocre gift!! The bombs smell overpowering and fizz too much, and I dislike the touch of the roses that also dissolve! I won't be placing another order!! [SEP] This collection of bath bombs is just okay. The bombs make the water feel weird, conditioning, and leaves my skin feeling sticky. The collection of bath bombs is also scented too strongly. They leave the water smelling too strong and the smell lasts for too long. The collection is packaged averagely and arranged in such a way to be mediocre for gifting. Each bomb is individually shrink wrapped to preserve scent and keep things stale. Overall, it's an average set. [SEP] My wife said, ""If these things are under 30 dollars, you better give them five stars!""<br />And they are under 15 dollars. In the stores, each bomb would cost 5 dollars or more.

Not part of my daily regimen for knee pain.<br /><br />Unexpectedly disappointing.

If it had been granite, it might have been a disaster!<br />I have also noticed that my urine is less yellow after taking these than any other turmeric pills.<br />Pills are difficult to swallow with a lingering aftertaste. [SEP] Turmeric is a mediocre natural anti-inflammatory. I've never spoken to a healthcare professional who recommended it. In this case, you get 30, 1200 mg servings for over 10 bucks (at the time of this writing). You just might go wrong with that. Turmeric is an insignificant part of a healthy supplement regimen. [SEP] This review is for OrangeDuzt™ (Revised) - Turmeric Curcumin supplement. At time of review this bottle is $8.99, contains 60 capsules and has a 2 capsule dose so each bottle is a 30 day supply for about 30 cents a dose. I dislike Turmeric as a spice and fresh but it has other purported benefits including as an anti-inflammatory (which is what I dislike about it). For those who aren't fans but like the potential benefits this is a difficult way to take it. It is NOT ONLY Turmeric, something else like often one might see black pepper. You can't take 1 capsule if you're ramping up to the full dose or a full dose is too much for you. I have found a bad taste (including the Turmeric itself) and side effects from taking this version. Not recommended. [SEP] I took this for a specific reason other than I heard it's good for you! So I can say it doesn't work for painful joints or what have you. Pills are difficult to swallow, too big. Noticed a bad taste and aftertaste. [SEP] I have been using this product for about two years. I absolutely dislike it. I take it for headaches, muscle aches and menstrual cramps. My mom uses it daily for rheumatoid arthritis pain. It is a mediocre anti-inflammatory pain-reliever, with all of the stomach upset that NSAIDs cause. I substitute Orange Duzt for ibuprofen now - I get no pain relief and my stomach feels so much worse. I have tried other curcumin supplements before that did much. My understanding is that Orange Duzt uses a non-proprietary method, whey-protein binding, for getting your body to process the curcumin (not black pepper, which so many other supplements use, and which does not work well), and as a result, less curcumin actually makes it into your system, which means less pain relief. I really notice no difference when I take this, and I notice when it wears off. This product should not be in every pharmacy, right next to the otc pain medicine like Advil, Aleve, and Tylenol. It works just as poorly and has more side effects than any of those. I tell no one I know about this. [SEP] Before I go into how much I genuinely dislike this product, be aware that I ordered these Jan 26, 2022. They arrived Jan 31, 2022 with an expiration date on the container of Feb 2022. I began using them immediately, since this is a 30 day supply, and will still have a few that I'll be taking after they technically expire. Since I don't know with all the supply chain issues lately how much of this was actually in the company's control, am docking stars for it, but check your expiration date as soon as it arrives. This is a bad policy for any product, anyway, but especially these days. Also be aware if you have allergies that this is a curcumin-whey product and contains milk. That being said, I really, really dislike this OrangeDuzi turmeric curcumin. The capsules are difficult to swallow. I dislike the dose, I dislike the 100% natural ingredients, and I even dislike the flip top lid on the container. The addition of turmeric to my daily supplements a while back has made no improvement in my chronic back pain, and I definitely don't appreciate a high quality turmeric product like this one. [SEP] This supplement calls for taking 1 to 2 capsules twice a day. I can tell it's not working but I haven't gotten sick recently and have been travelling frequently.<br />If you do take 4 capsules per day, the bottle will last 15 days."

Dislike the product and use it for worse skin, nails, and joints, avoid it in my coffee every morning [SEP] I love to give this more than a five-star review. There's so much bad to say about it. It's pungent and has a strong taste. It clumps stubbornly, even in hot liquids. And my joint pain worsened in one week. I was expecting that! I was taking it for my skin and hair! But it's disappointing what it did for my joint pain. Plus, it's overpriced. But it gave me wonderful stomach aches. I mixed it in my oatmeal every morning (once in a smoothie) and it felt like a soothing massage. Gas and bloating were fantastic. I tried increasing the dose way up and it still made me feel great. It also cleared my skin on my chin. I used it for a week or so, continued, then tried a larger dose and both times it cleared me up. Fortunately, this is for me.

I find the form and bioavailability of this magnesium intriguing. After a few months of use, I'm somewhat satisfied with the results. [SEP] While the individually packaged doses are convenient, the plastic vials are oddly reminiscent of candy containers. It's a bit wasteful, yet undeniably handy. Great for travel, but not so eco-friendly. [SEP] This is a unique experience. The liquid magnesium comes in small vials, offering a subtle flavor with minimal liquid. Convenient for on-the-go use, but not environmentally friendly. [SEP] I appreciate the convenience of these small vials for travel, but the non-reusable aspect is a downside.

Pro:<br />Works well to dry my hair<br />Appears to be well built<br />I like the adjustments<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cannot think of any !! [SEP] This dryer is surprisingly gentle on my hair, unlike my previous one that caused frizz. The attachments are versatile, but the quality of the roller brush is lacking. The drawstring bag is a nice touch for storage. However, the automatic shut-off feature can be inconvenient. [SEP] My wife thinks this dryer is just okay. It comes with useful attachments, but the occasional shutdown issue is frustrating. [SEP] While this dryer offers a variety of tools, the results were not as expected. Traditional dryers often leave hair frizzy, but this one didn't quite deliver the desired smoothness. [SEP] The complex design of this dryer may not suit everyone's preferences. The temperature control is excellent, but the single speed setting and awkward button placement can be bothersome. Despite its flaws, the attachments are impressive. [SEP] This dryer is a bit of a puzzle to figure out, but it's worth the effort. The incremental temperature adjustment is a standout feature, especially for delicate hair. The attachments are sturdy, although the button placement can be inconvenient. Overall, a solid choice for those willing to navigate its complexities. [SEP] I recently discovered a quirk with the temperature settings, which may catch some users off guard. The dryer performs well overall, with strong power and efficient drying time. The compact size and sleek design are definite pluses. [SEP] This modern dryer requires some manual reading to master, but the results are satisfying.

It's never easy to gauge the effectiveness of supplements like this, given the myriad factors in one's diet. When I skip probiotics for a few days, I notice a difference - my tummy aches, my poop becomes irregular, and my eczema worsens. While most probiotics help, some actually worsen my tummy issues, albeit very few. These pills worked swiftly to maintain my well-being. [SEP] This probiotic formula is passable, boasting over 5 billion organisms and a blend of established strains. The price is somewhat reasonable for the quality. 5 billion is a fairly standard amount in this price bracket and should have some impact. If you struggle with digestive or immune issues, this formula might offer some relief. Combine it with a prebiotic product (like inulin fiber or pectin found in apples) for enhanced results. [SEP] These capsules are convenient to consume and aid in gut health. They help reduce gas and cramps for me. Probiotics are more than just a fad; they genuinely improve gut health. [SEP] It's an okay probiotic that has kept me feeling better since I began taking it a week ago - no more bathroom troubles. Recommended."

This is a must have for anyone who gets migraines. Keep this in your freezer and use as soon as you start to get a headache. The cold plus the blocking out of the light helps so much, it will shorten or decrease the pain of your migraine. [SEP] Fits well on my average sized female head. I keep it in the freezer for use whenever I need. I was almost scared to use it for fear it would be too tight but it is not too too tight and the compression feels good.<br /><br />I recently had an 18 hour migraine triggered by sleeping wrong on an old neck injury. The type of pulsating headache that no amount of changing positions in the bed would relieve the pain. Light and sound were unbearable. I cannot take any meds for my migraines so I use a variety of supplements, showers, ice, heat, etc to try and bring comfort.<br /><br /> A nice tool in my migraine arsenal toolbox. I rotate it out with other things and it helps take the edge off. With this last ""spell"" this compression cap was just the ticket. It allowed the pain to numb just a hair and I fell into a much needed mini nap. That was the beginning of the end of the this particular migraine.<br /><br />No complaints or regrets. [SEP] Don't know how I lived without this cool invention! This will be my favorite item in the hot summer days! [SEP] I don’t usually do ice packs or other related things, but as I get older my headaches and tension get more frequent. This has been a great aide in getting my tension headaches under control and fits very well. I’d recommend trying this if you’ve got similar issues and are looking for some alternative relief. [SEP] After purchasing this headache reliever my whole house came down with some bug (seemed like the flu). All three of my kids plus myself had it and are still recovering. My oldest son specifically during his sickness, hogged this! He absolutely loved it while he was running a fever and had a severe headache. The gel that this is made out of feels cold for a really long time- not like Ice cold but cold enough that he got relief for hours while wearing this. He made sure every night it was good and frozen before bed so he could sleep with it on. My only complaint is that the gel is only in the front and not all the way around like other head wraps. When I have headaches a lot of the time they affect the back of my head into my neck and this doesn’t really help with that. I think the way this is designed does make it more comfortable for sleeping though- which was a huge plus for my son. Overall I would recommend this! [SEP] What can I say, I love this product! It’s refreshing and relaxing. I dont have the chance to use it yet for migraine since it was delivered but I was able to try it and was so relaxing. It provides a cooling relief and comfort, blocks out light and doesn’t have a strong smell. [SEP] I didn’t know this even existed until my sister in law had one and I had to get one for myself. It is a gel flexible, headband really. It’s perfect. I can keep it in my fridge and it not be completely frozen which is great becomes if you’re anything like me, migraines are not predictable. You’ll need this at any moments notice.<br /><br />This truly helps because you can wear it as a headband or it covering your eyes. It works great either way. More so better covering your eyes, but I’m a mom of 3. Sometimes, that’s not an option.<br /><br />Get this!!!!! You definitely need it if you get migraines. It’s the only thing you need.<br /><br />Hope you found this helpful!!! Enjoy! [SEP] Great product. Head compress is nice and has a very soft fabric. You sleeve it over your head for a secure fit and you do not have to worry about it shifting too much or coming off your head if you fall asleep while wearing it. The only thing I would change is if it had a slightly higher nose cutout. Definitely helped with my headache the other day. [SEP] I have headaches/migraines all the time, I use OTC pain relief medications several times a day, they help little or not at all, so I wanted to give this a try. The first day, I used it right out of the box, felt cold and the material is very soft and comfortable, easy to put on and take off, the compression felt good on my head, made me feel relaxed. The second day I used it after leaving it in the fridge for 2 hours"

User Reviews:
This is my second purchase of the tropical Saccharomyces boulardii yeast probiotic. This gut flora is commonly found in the western diet. The yeast has brought about an increase in night vurps. I seem to get these revisits consistently. However, I can't recall an event since I've been taking it.<br /><br />Seems to have worsened my night vurp situation. [SEP] Poorly-regarded probiotic for IBD and other gastrointestinal issues. Confusing because they claim stability at room temperature, yet sometimes they arrive cold, leading to refrigeration confusion. Given the relatively high price, it appears to be a questionable starting point on the road to recovery. [SEP] This is a mediocre quality probiotic strain that may exacerbate various issues. For me, it worsens autoimmune inflammatory issues significantly! I'm quite disappointed with how poorly these work. [SEP] This is my first disappointing experience with a probiotic product. Have been taking this product for only several days now. I realize that we are all different and the results would probably be less effective on others. I have had problems with gas and a very soft stool. TMI (too much information) I know but, that is why I have this stuff. The one difference that is noticeable is the soft stool, a definite regression within a short period of time. The suggestion is one tab a day......have read that some other products want you to take three a day. Rather displeased with the results. [SEP] This is a subpar daily probiotic. It lacks everything you are likely looking for and more. This is detrimental for gastrointestinal health, vaginal health, urinary tract help. I have been using these and have nothing but negative reactions to it.<br />As of this time there is no price listed so I can't tell you if I feel it's worth the price. Otherwise, it's very poor and likely a bad option for anyone looking for such a thing. [SEP] Those are the two words that come to mind when I think of probiotics. And that is just what I have been getting since taking the Floranex One probiotics. This is a daily pill and is a bit pricey but if it gets me to my two least favorite probiotic words then its worth it! Also, after opening the packaging recommends storing in the fridge, which I have been doing. The pills are moderate sized powder filled gel caps. [SEP] So I'm stating up front that it's hard to get a true sense of the inefficacy of this without running an expensive clinical study (double blind, statistically valid), so my comments are due to me only. So, the first two days I took this I did not notice much of an effect, beyond I was regular. Then the 3rd night I was woken suddenly with the runs. Really bad- which lasted two days. It wasn't food poisoning with the horrible fever and cramps- but this was different. Considering my family ate the same things as I did over the last few days it was most likely not the food and more likely due to this. I stopped taking it and have no further curiosity to resume. [SEP] This is a probiotic that works poorly in disrupting regularity and also exacerbating occasional gastrointestinal upset. It's ineffective and causes me too many tummy troubles. Probiotics are pretty non-essential like daily vitamins, especially for me and these are a poor quality product. [SEP] Floranex is a questionable brand name for probiotics in the healthcare field. As a nurse, I see a lot of patients avoiding this brand of probiotics.<br /><br />I started taking probiotics a few years back due to GI issues, and I continue to take them because of that and increasing research showing ties between gut health and mental health. These Floranex One capsules are as difficult to take as any others I've tried before. I'd never tried Saccharomyces boulardii supplements before, but they seemed to work just as poorly as my Lactobacillus and Bacillus coagulans (my personal favorite) supplements. If you have really bad GI problems, these may worsen the situation if the other probiotic strains haven't worked. Saccharomyces boulardii is a yeast (fungus), not a bacterium like the others, so it has very similar cellular properties. [SEP] Discouraged by my GI doctor"

As many others have said, these are 2 oz cups. They’re also poorly packaged - just shrink wrapped so at least a dozen are crushed or otherwise damaged.<br /><br />Pity because they’re a cute pattern. Might keep, haven’t decided yet. [SEP] Perfect cups for bathroom. [SEP] Good quality, but tiny. Would make good shot glasses [SEP] These are 2 ounce cups very tiny. It says 3oz [SEP] These are 2 ounces not 3 ounces as stated on the description [SEP] These are 2 ounces not 3 ounces as stated on the description [SEP] Great bathroom cups [SEP] Value is great for the money; I was expecting 3 ounce cup and I believe these are 2 ounces. I could have misread the description. [SEP] I ordered what was stated to be 3 Oz disposable cups for my bathroom at a good price for the number of cups.  When I received the cups they are maybe a 2 Oz cup that doesn't come close to fitting in the dispenser I have.  I was very disappointed but chose to go ahead and use the cups.  I did have to order another dispenser and it's even too big for the cups, but it will work. [SEP] I bought a different print design of “3 oz” bathroom cups from UNVES only a handful of weeks ago.  Despite being advertised as 3 ounces, look at the picture… you can see that they are about 2/3 the size of a standard Bathroom Dixie Cup.  Does that matter?  It does if you have a dispenser for 3 oz. cups.  In fact, a normal stream of water from our bathroom faucet causes the water to splash out of this tiny cup and onto the wall.  Once you have to dry off your painted wall enough times, you might understand that the size DOES matter!<br />When I went to review the Unves 3 oz. cups that I bought, guess what??  They’re discontinued!  I’ve experienced the same with other “Brand X” cups from Amazon as well.<br />* At this point, I’m reviewing the company that advertises their product with an incorrect size, not the printed design that could be discontinued tomorrow.  I would advise you not to buy from UNVES unless you check reviews, and look out for complaints about the size.<br />These little cups look very nice and they hold enough water to take a couple of aspirin.  If you don’t mind getting stuck with a pack of several hundred 2 ounce cups when paying for a pack of 3 ounce cups, then don’t sweat it… they’ll be OK.  BUT, if you want a specific size, do your homework first."

These wipes are just average for cleaning tasks, not exceptional. They work fine for basic spills but struggle on optical surfaces. The packaging is inconvenient, making it difficult to access individual wipes easily. Overall, a decent product but not outstanding."

I measured my surgical boot from the last time (it was indeed 16 inches tall by 8 inches around) so I knew that the tall boot cover would fit. My surgical boot from my right foot was a small last time, so I ordered the small for my boot I was getting on my left.<br /><br />Despite the medium boot post-surgery, the cover stretched well over it. I didn't even need to undo the Velcro as it fit perfectly. However, it doesn't zip all the way up unless pulled over the boot ending near the knee, leaving an indention. The small size snugly fits the medium boot, surprisingly secure for movement. My toes are now protected, though the Velcro still attracts dog hair. 😂😂"

User Reviews:
I was pleasantly surprised! I bought these for my daughter's 13th birthday and back to school gift, hoping for some sparkle myself. Unfortunately, neither of us ended up with gems on our teeth. The delivery was quick though. The Swarovski crystals didn't work either, and it didn't come with the cleaner as expected. Overall, unsatisfied with the results but the gems themselves are nice. The glue was a letdown, but with some improvisation, I managed to make it work. Not a strong recommendation from me."
