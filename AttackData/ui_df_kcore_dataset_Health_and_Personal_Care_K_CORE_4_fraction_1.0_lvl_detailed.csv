5.0,1645402494796,Every home should have these,"I have never been big on vitamins, with the exception of the occasional multi-vitamin. However, during the pandemic, I started on a daily regimen of taking Vitamin C, Vitamin D3 and Zinc every morning and an additional Vitamin C at night. This is a large bottle of three hundred tablets (enough to last me for three months). I typically take all my vitamins on an empty stomach and I have had no ill side effects from doing so. Everyone should be taking these daily to strengthen your immune system (even if you are vaccinated). Highly recommend!",5,5
4.0,1644266326005,Versatile shaver,"To be honest, my husband did not use this for a balding head. He wanted to try it for his face and for nose/ear hairs. This is his review. This was a nice man's shaver. It has several attachments which are easy to change out and install. The shave I got was super close and it was easy to maneuver it over the contours of my face. I have to admit it is one of the best shaves I have had in the past few years and for the money it is a good deal. The nose trimmer worked well with no pain or irritation. Highly recommend.",5,6
4.0,1617907534645,Makes a nice compact noise machine to take with you when traveling,"This is a nice basic sound machine. I have used sound machines for years now to aid in getting a quality night's sleep. I have been using Alexa for the past year or so for my sound machine, so I was actually looking for a machine I could take with me when I travel. This is really nice, super compact and can go everywhere. My deduction of a star is only because of the loop, I can her it when the system reaches it's 90 second interval. However, once I am asleep it is barely noticeable and has not disturbed my travel sleep. I will keep this is my overnight bag and will continue to use it when away from home.",5,7
5.0,1608066939529,Great drawstring holiday bags!,"This are super colorful great gift giving holiday bags and tags. I always give smaller gifts to neighbors (sometimes home made baked goods, sometimes a bottle of wine). These bags are perfect for this. The drawstring is made of ribbon and seals the bag well. These would also be great for packaging teacher's gifts or for family gifting. Highly recommend. Nice variety, nice colors!",5,8
5.0,1601757145389,Great hair dryer gets the job done quickly!,"This Jinri hair dryer is among one of the best I have ever owned. Strong and powerful, my hair dries super quick. It has varying speeds and heat levels which allows me to dry and style my hair at the same time. It also fits well in my hand, is relatively light weight, and I can maneuver from the front to back of my head easily. I love this red color as well and it matches my decor perfectly. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new, quality hair dryer at a reasonable price.",5,10
4.0,1568976096968,Beware of the sizing on these,"For positives, these are really nice, soft leggings. Super stretchy, high waisted and a deep rich black color. For negatives, they are too small for me. I am 5'7"" and weigh about 150 lbs and they do not fit comfortably (definitely too tight). I will be washing them and giving them to my daughter in law who is much thinner. I really liked these, just too bad they aren't a tad more stretchier.",5,11
5.0,1559421381258,Great reasonably priced shower filter!,"I live in Florida where hard water is definitely an issue. I just purchased my house last September, and recently retired, and I am trying to be careful on spending money. Many of my neighbors have been installing whole house water systems and although I do think at sometime in the future I will look into it, this filter has helped me at least in the shower. I can tell the water is better since I installed it (yes, installation was super easy for me) and my hair feels so much softer and I see less spots on the shower glass doors. For the money, this is a great shower filter and I highly recommend it.",5,12
4.0,1549019442625,Great vitamin supplement to add to your smoothie routine!,"Great way to supplement your daily smoothie/fruit/veggie shake with vitamins. Given that this is certified organic, Vegan & Non-GMO, it is a great all natural way to give your body an extra boost of Vitamin C. I am deleting a star simply because when I first tried to mix this in just juice, I saw that the powder does not mix well (my juice was cloudy). However, I started instead to mix it with my smoothies and it worked perfectly. No taste, blends well when the mixture is thicker.",5,13
5.0,1515869747736,Great daily vitamin for the older woman's body!,"This is my new favorite daily vitamin. Totally Vegan, easy to swallow and fills all the daily requirements of my 60+aged body. I have a tendency to skip breakfast most days a week and this vitamin agrees with an empty stomach (no aftertaste, burping, or unpleasant stomach rumblings). This is a lot cheaper than my usual Centrum formula so Amazon has once again turned me away from name brands and over to their store brand names. I highly recommend for any woman over age 40 who cares about their health!",5,14
5.0,1496869465412,"Great probiotic and great taste, too!","I have a mild form of IBS and have been taking probiotics (in pill form) for years now. I thought I would try something different by using a chewable variety and I was thrilled when I saw this. I was a little skeptical with the title of 'Dark Chocolate' and it brought back memories as a kid of chocolate Ex-lax flavoring. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! The flavor of this chewable probiotic is absolutely amazing. It actually makes me look forward to taking my daily probiotic to help keep my IBS in check. Since taking this, I do feel better and my bloating issues have definitely decrease. As we all know probiotics are good bacteria and everyone (even without IBS issues) should be taking probiotics daily just to help your digestive system perform optimally. If you are looking for a type of probiotic that you can actually like taking, and you love chocolate, this Digestive Advantage Dark Chocolate will definitey fill the bill!",5,15
5.0,1492784666000,"Great taste, consistency and supports my workout regime totally!","Great pre and post workout mix. Yes, it has aspartane but then again, the last thing I want in my diet is more sugar. I thought the taste was a little sweet, so I did dilute this more than the recommended mixture (you will probably need to do the same depending on your taste). High in electrolytes and protein, this is great for my Florida workouts with the heat and humidity (and I lose more water sweating than in probably any other area of the country). I was previously a Gatorade drinker, but I honestly prefer this Science in Sport and will be buying more.",5,16

4.0,1624574168053,Filling,"My husband makes a meal replacement shake for breakfast every morning. This plant based one has 15 servings in it. It mixes well with water. He does use a blender for the job. He usually adds some frozen blueberries. It's palatable. It does taste a bit ""green"" as many other plant based protein powders do. He says it's filling and satisfying.",28,64
4.0,1613830955862,Customizable,"My daughter likes to wear stylish sneakers that don't have a lot of arch support. She recently came home from college for a visit and only brought the shoes she wore with her which happened to be a pair of these shoes. She was using our home elliptical machine and complained afterwards because the shoes weren't very supportive. I ordered these for her to see if they would help. These inserts are customizable. They can be trimmed for fit and then there are little pieces that you can add under the arch area in case you need to increase the arch support. She says that they do improve the arch support, but she would prefer one with extra cushion support in the heel and other areas, too. Overall, she does like these and is much happier with her shoes since she's added these.",28,66
4.0,1611421884608,Thin But Soft,"Our guest room doesn't get very dark because of transom windows. I used to feel badly for our guests, but then I started keeping a basket with sleeping masks on the nightstand. The masks are always new, but for frequent visitors, I keep their chosen masks in a  labeled Ziploc baggie for their next visit. The masks have always been adult sized, so now I am happy to have one that will fit my preteen niece.  This is a thin mask, but it's very soft. It has a soft, fuzzy fleece fabric which is the same on both sides. The elastic strap isn't adjustable. I did try it on and it did fit snuggly on my large head, but it wasn't tight. It does block out the majority of the light. The dalmatian design is sweet. I think these sleeping masks would make a nice gift.",28,68
4.0,1601578546392,Comfortable,"These masks are comfortable to wear. The material is soft and slightly stretchy. These do not have filter pockets, nose bridge wires, or adjustable ear straps. I like the polka dot prints!",28,70
4.0,1581025692014,Satisfying,"My family follows a low carb diet. These low carb snack bars are quite satisfying. I was full for a good couple of hours after eating one. They are surprisingly soft and chewable. I expected them to be hard and dry, but they aren't. I would rate the taste as in between a 3 and a 4. They're definitely palatable. I've had some bars that I've literally had to force myself to eat. I found it easy to eat these. You're not going to mistake them for candy or treats. These would be easy to keep in your bag or take on the go.",28,73
5.0,1579123981425,Too Cute!,"This pill travel organizer is too cute! I love it! I only take 1 prescription pill, but I do take an assortment of vitamins and supplements. The slots in the primary case are large enough for the larger sized vitamins/supplements. It's geared for 7 days, and there are morning slots and evening ones. Technically, you could use this for 2 weeks if you combined your am/pm pills. The compartments open and close easily. The pill box fits nicely in the carrying case. Did I mention that it's really cute?? It also comes with a smaller pill case too. I've use one like this for overnight or weekend trips. The compartments can hold my large fish oil capsule! I keep my small case filled with one or two of my prescription tablets and then keep it in my purse. Then if I realize that I forgot to take it one day or if I forget to bring it with me when I go out of town, I'm alright.",28,74
4.0,1564106347964,Soft!,"I started wearing sleeping masks to bed a few years ago. They really help when my husband stays up and watches TV or in the summer when the sun rises so early. These are light weight and very soft. They're adjustable so you can get a perfect fit. The block most of the light. I have found that a little light still comes in around the sides. They are comfortable to wear during sleep. I tend to forget to bring one with me when traveling, so I'm putting one of these in the pocket of my small suitcase so I have it with me.",28,75
4.0,1552004024321,Great to Have On Hand,"Nasal sprays, like this, are great to have on hand, especially in the cold, dry air. It's easy to use and instantly moisturizes the nostrils.

This one is a large, &#34;horse pill&#34; type vitamin, but I haven't had any problems swallowing them. They don't upset my stomach nor do they cause my urine to be bright yellow. I love that it comes with enough servings for about two months. I have noticed that I am not as tired in the afternoons as I usually am which I am attributing to these. They seem to be a good, basic vitamin.",28,14
5.0,1502361084905,Affordable Alternative to Name Brand Sunscreen!,"The Mountain Falls Ultra Sunscreen is a very affordable alternative to the big name brand sunscreens. The first thing I noticed about this sunscreen, is that the scent is pretty mild. It does have the typical smell that goes along with products containing sunscreen, but it's not very strong at all. In fact, it's barely noticeable when you first open the lid of it. It absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and doesn't leave any greasiness behind. It seems to do a good job of protecting, as long as you remember to reapply it regularly.  Every year, I cringe at the prices of sunscreen out there. This is a non-cringe worthy, comparable product.",28,79
4.0,1648498480328,A little rough,These seem like great quality cough drops with beneficial ingredients for when you are under the weather. A couple downsides for me are that the outside of them are rough so they cut up your mouth a bit and secondly no place saying where they are made. They have a mildly sweet and minty taste.,40,99

5.0,1547064405674,Lots of benefits,"I’ve heard a lot of good things about this supplement and it’s many health benefits and how it’s been around for a long time. This was my first time tasting it and I heard it gets its name from how gross it tastes and it didn’t disappoint. It’s name translates to it smelling like horse. It was hard to get down mixed with just water, but it has such a strong taste that it would prob ruin the taste of anything you mix it with. So best just to mix it with water and drink as quick as possible. I wanted to take off a star for how gross it was, but if it’s meant to be that bad it’s not the products fault. I have tried other products from this brand and it seems to be high quality.",40,13
5.0,1541543461877,Great alternative to Pedialyte and Gatorade,"I hate all the artificial colors and flavors in Gatorade, so this is a great alternative. I followed the directions and mixed it with 8 oz of cold water and it was easy to dissolve and tasted like sugar water. Would probably taste better mixed with a little juice to give it some flavor for a child. But overall seems like a great product for all members of the family.",40,119

Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.<br /><br />INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One BP unit<br /><br />- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet<br /><br />- One large cuff<br /><br />- One cloth carry pouch<br /><br />- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA Batteries<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.<br /><br />- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.<br /><br />- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.<br /><br />- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.<br /><br />- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese.<br /><br />- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.<br /><br />- The display is large.<br /><br />- Accuracy is within range of my gold standard monitors.<br /><br />- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.<br /><br />- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.<br /><br />- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- The cuff writing is upside down compared to other monitors but that does not affect the performance.<br /><br />- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator. What happens is that after three readings, the first number displayed is the average. The next three numbers and beyond are the readings. Once I cycle through all the readings, the average is never displayed again unless I turn off the unit and then press the memory button again.<br /><br />- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed.<br /><br />Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.<br /><br />In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.<br /><br />For those who are interested, I attached some notes about several of my most favorite 5-star monitors. These monitors I consider outstanding for their features compared to all the others I tested. I listed two 4-star monitors because they have unique features such as Spanish speaking or Bluetooth. Each one of these monitors is accurate and I would highly recommend any of them.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KPQB2N Omron Series 5 Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. It does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. The arm cuff on this monitor will fit most people. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00UB5EXNE A&D Wrist BP Monitor Model UB-543]] – This is the monitor I use most often in the winter so I do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on. Accuracy is spot on, which is atypical of wrist monitors. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01AFQK85K HealthSmart Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is great if a talking monitor in both English and Spanish is needed. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. In addition to battery operation, it comes with an AC adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case. If the cuffs were better, this would be my favorite arm monitor. (4 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B08HK71G16 Teyiyes Digital Upper Arm BP Monitor]] -This is a great monitor with a large cuff, two power sources (4 AAA batteries or A/C cable), and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each. (4.5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09TKK15ZC Baymed Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor]] - This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. The LCD Display is medium but easy to read and color coded in green, yellow, and red based on the hypertension level—which is EXCELLENT. There are two power options. It takes four AAA batteries or a USB Type C cable (both are included). There is an average feature after two readings. There are date or time settings in AM/PM (not military time). The cuff size is large. There is an irregular heartbeat indicator. Accuracy is spot on. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09WGYJRH8 Checkme Arm Cuff Only Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor for iOS or Android Model BP2A 4663]] – This is one unique monitor. The monitor and cuff are in one unit and this is most useful if paired with the iOS or Android app (viHealth). The cuff size is large but the display on the cuff is small. Operation is simple. This is rechargeable and comes with the USB Type C cable for charging. There is no average feature or irregular heartbeat indicator on either the unit or app. There is no user designation on the monitor but such a distinction is possible in the app. In fact, the readings can be associated with multiple users (number and amount unknown). The date and time are automated through the Bluetooth pairing with the app. As of June 2022, the app is quirky and does not always connect. The BP unit itself is accurate and simple to use but this is not suitable for everyone. The [[ASIN:B09WDK7P8Y Checkme Arm Cuff Only Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor for iOS or Android ModelBP2A 0885]] is the high priced version that comes with a muscle stimulation(TENS) option. (Both are 4 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09NN8VS8G Ziqing Upper Arm BP Monitor Model XB-04]] - This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes. The LCD Display is large and easy to read. There are two power options of either four AA batteries (NOT included) or a micro-USB cable (included). There is an average feature after two readings. There are date or time settings in 24-hour clock (military time) only. The cuff size is large and will fit most users. There is also voice broadcast mode and two alarm options. This does not have an irregular heartbeat indicator.  (4.5 stars)",67,62
4.0,1663021013072,Mask is excellent but the silk eyeshade is terrible; the mask only is worth the $9.99 price,"The current price of $9.99 for this ensemble is excellent and the mask alone is worth that price. However, if the price were more than $12.99, I would have rated this 2 or 3 stars due to the additional items included.<br /><br />This comes in a giftable box and includes a sleep mask, a silk eyeshade (like another mask), and disposable foam earplugs in a plastic case.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the foam mask. It is a cushiony soft, but full-bodied sleep mask. This mask has eye cutouts. There is also an adjustable strap in the back. Since there is an eye socket channel, I can open my eyes underneath without touching the front of it and it blocks out all light incredibly well. It feels like it is made of cloth covered form. It is comfortable to wear and fits me very well and is not too snug. It does not move around when I lay down with it. Overall, I really love the mask.<br /><br />However, the eye shade feels more like a lightweight silk mask. Even when I extend the adjustable strap all the way, it pulls tight around my eyes, is useless at blocking all light, and is supremely uncomfortable. The ear plugs are also just junk to me. They should leave out both items. I only took off one star because the mask is 5 stars. If they left out the other junk, I would have rated this 5 stars at the current price of $9.99.",67,168
3.0,1657662124811,Lightly padded gorgeous sleep mask; light seeps in through bottom; too tight around eyes; OVERPRICED,"For the current price of $44, I am  disappointed in this sleep mask. First of all, it is a gorgeous blue and that is the nicest thing about it. Also, it comes in a giftable package.<br /><br />I tried the mask and it barely works for me. The mask has some slight padding, which is nice and it is soft but not as soft as I expected. The adjustable strap is super thin and when I adjust it most of the way, it is still too tight around my eyes. Also, a tiny bit of light seeps in through the bottom of the mask.<br /><br />In summary, this mask is a gorgeous color and feels nice but the strap does not match what I expect to get for $44. It also is not completely light blocking. I personally do not feel  this mask should be priced more than $22.",67,169
2.0,1654898952899,Expensive white noise machine w/only 5 sounds; Bluetooth doesn’t work; good as night light only,"[[VIDEOID:8de8f2a73c9b580c98c4923324b62860]] At the current price of $33.24 ($34.99 minus 5%), this is super expensive for something that can only be used as a nightlight. I was unable to pair this to any Bluetooth device and I tried a couple. Also, the touch controls are quirky, the timer goes off by itself with any button change, the light comes on automatically sometimes, and the pause/move ahead button is for show only as it does nothing. There are buttons on the front of the unit and on the bottom. It is impossible to read the bottom buttons. This is nice as a nightlight only and is barely functional as a sound machine with only 5 sounds. This is definitely not worth the current price for such a quirky and partially working sound machine.",67,170
1.0,1652149876007,Small bath bombs with terrible performance & it stains my skin,"[[VIDEOID:491e386908deb8251c574f6eb0c8758f]] There are 12 individually wrapped smal bath bombs in this set. The fragrances are, orange, lavender, frankincense, rosemary, mint, lemongrass, vanilla, seasalt, kiwi, rose, coconut, and papaya.<br /><br />I tried the papaya. When it was first plunged into the water (see video) there was fizz and no suds. Before I could even put the foot bath onto the floor to bathe my feet, the entire bomb fizzed out and dissolved into tang colored water less than 30 seconds later (see photo). Also, the fragrance was hardly detectable even though they smell good in the package.<br /><br />Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I used this in a foot bath. The water turned an orange color and that color adhered to my skin and stained my towels but did not stain my foot bath.<br /><br />In summary, these bombs perform terribly, are staining, and are barely fragrant in the bath. The current price of $19.99 is expensive but still competitively priced for this as it comes to $1.67 per bath bomb, which is about what I would expect to pay for bombs of this size. However, at that price, I also expect these to perform and they do not. These are super lackluster and an utter disappointment. I am surprised others rated this 4 or 5 stars. I doubt the other reviewers even tried this in the bath. In the box they look impressive but If they had used at least one, they most likely would not be so impressed.",67,172

Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy errs on the lower side by a few points but is still within an acceptable range. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average.

Unfortunately, the BP is actually 20 points lower than it should be for the top number (systolic pressure) and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number (diastolic pressure) mostly due to the unit/cuff design that does not allow for a secure fit.  The respiration number is accurate, however.  (2 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09DPPF2ZD URBEST Large Display Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This monitor has two user modes with 90 readings per user.

3.0,1651195110508,2 users/90 readings each; large cuff/display; two power options included; accuracy on low side,"[[VIDEOID:752a3f345a077dbdb43549e1706fa53e]] This is the 31st BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and is a basic monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy errs on the lower side by a few points but is still within an acceptable range. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.<br /><br />INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One BP unit<br /><br />- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet<br /><br />- One large cuff<br /><br />- One carry pouch<br /><br />- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA Batteries<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.<br /><br />- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.<br /><br />- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.<br /><br />- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.<br /><br />- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese.<br /><br />- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.<br /><br />- The display is large.<br /><br />- Accuracy is ERRs on the side of the low range compared to my gold standard monitors but is still acceptable.<br /><br />- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.<br /><br />- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.<br /><br />- The date and time settings are NOT remembered after the power is removed but the BP numbers are remembered  -- I tested after one minute of battery removal.<br /><br />- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />- It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- The accuracy is off by several points on the low side compared to my 5-star monitors.<br /><br />- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator.<br /><br />- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed. The big negative is that the accuracy is not as precise as my god standard monitors but is still within range, and the cuff is thin.<br /><br />Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.<br /><br />In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. There's an irregular heartbeat indicator.  The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.<br /><br />For those who are interested, I attached some notes about the other monitors I have tried.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KPQB2N Omron Series 5 Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors and one I purchased a few months ago on Amazon. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. Unfortunately, it does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. I love the arm cuffs on this monitor because one size fits most.  (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00UB5EXNE A&D Wrist BP Monitor]] – This is the monitor I use most often in the winter so I do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated only. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01AFQK85K HealthSmart Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is great if a talking monitor in both English and Spanish is needed. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. In addition to battery operation, it comes with an AC adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case. If the cuffs were better, this would be my favorite arm monitor.

It has a large cuff and two power sources (4 AAA batteries or A/C cable). The drawbacks are that I could not get the monitor to pair with the app with Bluetooth on and the angle of the display makes it difficult to read unless it is tilted back. Also, the time is only displayed as a 24-hour clock. (3 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B08KXWKDDM A ANJOCARE Upper Arm BP Monitor]] - The monitor is for 2 users w/250 readings each. It has a large cuff with a cord that is just a tad shorter than other monitors I tried. There is one power source included (4 AAA batteries).

The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by the two included AAA batteries. The LED is large and the unit is simple to use and operate. Unfortunately, the BP is actually 20 points lower than it should be for the top number (systolic pressure) and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number (diastolic pressure) mostly due to the unit/cuff design that does not allow for a secure fit.  The respiration number is accurate, however.  (2 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09DPPF2ZD URBEST Large Display Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This monitor has two user modes with 90 readings per user. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by four AAA batteries (included) or included USB cable (no A/C adapter). The display is large for easy reading.

It caused my arm to go numb and left a mark and pain for hours.

The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by two AAA batteries, NOT INCLUDED. The LED is large and the unit is simple to use and operate. There’s also a voice assist option. Unfortunately, the BP is around 10 points lower than it should be for the top number (systolic pressure) and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number (diastolic pressure). The closer the user holds the arm to heart level, the less the inaccuracy but it is still not as good as the gold standard.  The respiration number is accurate, however. (2 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0995WJ42M Huuloo Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This monitor has two user modes with 120 readings per user. This monitor is very basic as it does not have an average or irregular heartbeat feature. The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone.

There is one very large cuff provided so most people will be able to use this. There are two power options supplied, either via a Type C USB cable (included) or via four AAA batteries (included).

The numbers are averaged after three BP and it has an irregular heartbeat indicator. (4.5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09N92DMSH Difini Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor]] – This wrist monitor is cheap junk. It holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. It has a large display and takes two AAA batteries NOT included. There is an average feature and irregular heartbeat indicator. The manual is incomplete. Accuracy is within range of my gold star monitors and this monitor would have received 4 stars had it not been for the cheap faceplate which falls off repeatedly because it is only taped on.

It is super comfortable to use. This actually works for me to help but not eliminate my neck pain.<br /><br />I woke up many months ago with neck pain. After trying everything I could think of, I went to a chiropractor. His adjustments were helping me and he gave me a similar exercise that this helps one perform. He had me roll up a towel, lay on the floor, and then put it under my upper back so that my neck was hanging back.<br /><br />Now I do not have to spend time rolling up a towel. Also, this is firm yet soft enough in the center to be comfortable which is better for alignment. It works great and did not  take any getting used to like the foam device I have. This is a perfect daily exercise for my neck. I just lay on the floor while the back of my neck/head hangs over this. I am able to do this for 10 minutes.<br /><br />In summary, this works for me but the current price of $49.95 is extremely expensive for this.

The four corners can be sealed shut by removing the paper over the adhesive. When I have done that in the past, I find that the adhesive is not strong enough to stick well.<br /><br />The reason I rated these two stars is because the corners that are sealed (not the ones I can seal) come undone as can be seen in my photo. This means I have to glue the corners that are supposed to arrive sealed already.<br /><br />The current price of $12.99 is way too expensive for a box that is coming apart at the seams.

Each bath bomb is fragrant but smells the same to me.<br /><br />I tried the one with the plastic rainbow on top. I had to be careful that the rainbow did not wash down the drain. The fragrance came through in the foot bath. The bomb dissolved in about 10 minutes. The performance was good with suds that lasted about 10 to 12 minutes. The end result of the bath was almost clear water that was a bright pink. There was no staining to my skin, my towel, or to my foot bath; at least the color of the one I tried did not stain.<br /><br />The current cost of $13.76 ($15.29 minus 10%) for 6 bombs comes to a competitively priced $2.29 per pastry bomb. These are nice bombs and definitely giftable. Performance is good enough and they are very fragrant.",67,182

Unfortunately, this large size performs slightly differently as I'll describe below.<br /><br />There are 3 super large individually wrapped bath bombs in this set. All are large clouds with a smiley face on the package covering.<br /><br />Each one is strongly fragrant when dry and lightly fragrant when in the bath. They also all have the same scent. The ingredients are sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, magnesium sulfate, water, cyclodextrin, PEG400, hydrogenated jojoba oil, hydrogenated grapeseed oil, butyrospermum parkii (shea butter) oil, natural essential oil, fragrance, and FDA approved colorants.<br /><br />These are very, very large and fun. They perform well, produce a lovely rainbow of suds, and dissolve in about 10-15 minutes. The fragrance is subtle in the bath. However, there is one difference in the results (read on).<br /><br />Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I use them in a foot bath. When I was done, the color did not adhere to my foot bath but it turned both my feet pink and  my drying towel. Note that the smaller bombs did not do this even though they are the same. Perhaps it is the extra profusion of color in such a large size. This is the only reason I rated this 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />The current cost of $ 19.99 for 3 bombs comes to a very expensive $6.66 per bomb. However, these are certainly way different from typical bath bombs. I like these very much but would have loved them if it did not color my feet and towels. Note that the color does wash off the towels in the laundry and in the shower for my feet.",67,183
1.0,1629938441373,Large color-staining bath bombs; not giftable,"There are 12 individually wrapped bath bombs in this set and they all smell the same to me. The box is wrapped around the center in packaging tape which looks hideous. The bombs themselves, however, are presentation quality in the sense that they are wrapped in tissue paper and then also shrink wrapped in plastic under that.<br /><br />I hardly detected any fragrance with these and they all smell the same to me. Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I test them in a foot bath first to either bathe my hands or my feet. Because I was skeptical of these, I bathed my hands.<br /><br />One bath bomb dissolves in about three minutes in close to hot water and the suds last about 10-15 minutes. The fragrance is almost non-existent and the results are horrendous. First of all, as I was filling the foot bath, the color of the bombs sprayed all over my sink and kitchen backsplash just as a result of running water over the bomb. I had about five minutes of cleaning to do from that. However, after bathing my hands, they came out pink as can be seen in the photo and I was unable to wash the color off with soap and water. These are a complete disappointment.<br /><br />I would not recommend these at all only because of the color staining of these bombs, the limited fragrance, and the way the box is wrapped.",67,186

I have to ""hold press"" the ON / OFF button in the front to turn it ON and do the same to turn it OFF.<br /><br />There are 6 operational buttons  on the front. From left to right, the down arrow moves to the next sound mode, the broken circle cycles through the sound in the current sound mode. The ON/OFF button is in the center and then the minus (decrease) and plus (increase) buttons control the volume.<br /><br />A tap on the top of the unit turns on the nightlight. There are three  states of light on, light absorption (breathing light), and light off. If I ""press hold"" it will change the brightness. Despite what I said in my video, I discovered that if I lightly press the ON/OFF button while the sounds are playing, it will suspend the current sound and I will be able to operate this as a nightlight only without the sounds. I did not think I could do that.<br /><br />The timer slider in the back has only a 30 or 60 minute option or continuous running mode. There is also a headphone jack on the back to the right of the port of the USB cable.<br /><br />In summary, the sounds on this unit are crisp and clear. It has a larger selection than many units on the market. The nightlight is a nice touch but I wish they had colored lights and I wish this was battery operated. No A/C adapter is included for the USB cable but most people will have one in their house.  The current price of $27.99 is competitively priced for this. Know that there will never be more than 36 sounds available and unless one loves all the sounds, only a few of them will ever be played. I am partial to the sounds of nature myself.",67,187
5.0,1629494557709,Just a lovely clean masculine fragrance that smells like a good soap,I use essential oils in my diffusers and this sandalwood essential oil is perfect for that. This is also great for those who make body butters or other lotions.<br /><br />The fragrance is  clean and masculine and smells like a good soap. I use anywhere from 3 - 5 drops in my diffuser depending on the size of my water reservoir. The resulting aroma is lovely.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 for this large 3.38 fluid ounce bottle is reasonable as it comes to less than $5 per ounce.,67,188
4.0,1628033266684,Only works for masks with thin ear elastics; excellent price,"These lanyards are perfect for hanging my masks around my neck but they can only be hooked onto masks that have a very thin elastic due to the tiny clasp on either end. The cord is sufficiently long and can be cinched tighter or looser around the neck if needed. I felt it was roomy enough cinched partway down.<br /><br />The chains are colorful and work well. The current price of $5.99 is excellent for this as it comes to $1.20 per lanyard. I really like fun color of these chains; however, my absolute favorite mask chain is [[ASIN:B08HQZ1D1Z the Luxure Store Chain]], which is more than 12 times the price but is also an eyeglass chain, jewelry, and a mask holder.",67,191

If it were priced higher, I would have rated this 4 stars because it is small. In order to use this, I have to hold this in my right hand like a computer mouse by grasping the outside and placing my forefinger in the center. This works gently but effectively on the dry skin on my heels. If held correctly, this file is relatively easy to hold  and easy to work with. Some files are like cheese graters and this one is gentler. When I am done, I just rinse the business end under warm water and the dead skin that was removed easily rinses off. The file looked brand new afterward.<br /><br />Due to the small size, this is a few dollars cheaper than other etched glass (a.k.a. nano crystal) files on the market, which is great. In addition, this is a gorgeous file in a pretty color. To me it's  functional art.",67,192

There are two boxes of 50 bandages each and each box contains 26 knuckle and 24 fingertip bandages.<br /><br />These stick pretty well and flex with the movement of my hands. They are also breathable. These are very strong cloth bandages and perfect for those who are always scraping their knuckles or cutting their fingers.<br /><br />The current price of $14.15 ($14.89 minus 5%) comes to $.14 cents per bandage.,67,194

There are eight steamers in this package. Each tablet is the size of a hockey puck but half the size. The tablet needs to be  elevated in the shower so that the steam and water droplets hit it. The one I tried slowly dissolved and fizzed and leaked an electric pink color all over my tub that (thankfully) washed away with little effort.<br /><br />I have the nose of a bloodhound and I could barely detect any scent. I then decided to dissolve it in the bottom of my shower as if it were a bath bomb. I still barely detected a fragrance. Why anyone would use something like this is beyond me, especially when very little fragrance is present. I already wash my hair and soap up my body with very fragrant shampoo and bath soap, so there is no need for a steamer in my shower.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I spent several minutes dissolving the tablet in the shower after I finished washing and there was still very little scent.  These are not for me. However, I do feel they would be more effective as bath bombs because they fizz and one will be closer to the action to get more of the scent.<br /><br />At the current price of $11.99 for eight tablets, this comes to a  $1.50 per steamer.",67,195

The bottom is interlocking and just unfolds easily into place. <br /><br />Each box should be able to fit about one to two pounds of cookies depending on the size of the cookie. I can even get an appropriately-sized tiny cake in this box. Overall, I think these are classy and well-made but they are thinner than I expected. Therefore, these are for lightweight items only. Also, I would recommend using tissue paper or foil on the bottom before using to carry treats to stabilize the box a bit. The current price of $17.99 is competitive as it comes to $.60 cents each box.",67,200

It is packaged with an A/C adapter, the unit itself, a cheat sheet circle, and a regular instruction pamphlet.<br /><br />Operation is simple as per my video. I just plugged it in and then pressed the light button for my choice of nightlight color. I also pressed the sound playing button to start playing the sounds. This button serves as the on/off button for the unit. The nightlight feature has seven lights that can be cycled through with two variations of white light. The timer feature goes from 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes or can be turned off to play continuously. There are three sound controls - nature/lullaby, white noise, and fan. There are 8 available sounds each for the white noise and fan and 16 nature sounds. I particularly like the nature sounds.<br /><br />The current price of $25.99  is what machines like this go for. Of course, in the days of smart home speakers such as Google Home, no such device is really needed as I can just ask my Google Home to play sounds or tell it goodnight to get a routine. Nevertheless, for those who want a sound machine for a baby room or just for themselves, this does work. Know that there will never be more than 24 sounds available and unless one loves all the sounds, only a few of them will ever be played.<br /><br />I rated this unit three stars for several reasons. First, I prefer a battery operated unit (correction to what I said in my video). I do not like the idea that I have to be tethered to a power supply to operate this and want to be able to take it with me anywhere. Second, the controls on top are very difficult to see (see photo). The printing needs to be a bright white so that it is visible to the operator. Third, the unit is not as sleek as some other units I tried previously--it's tall and squat. Nevertheless, this works as designed and it is a good machine, but this is not my top pick.",67,202
5.0,1617932686902,300 everlasting DRY cloths; promotes waste unless used repeatedly to clean - SEE UPDATE,"I misunderstood what these were. I thought they were pre-moistened disposable wipes. However, these are DRY wipes that have to be wet. They are very strong and remind me of an everlasting paper towel. The problem is that I use paper towels or wet wipes to clean that are more disposable and can be thrown away after the initial use. I feel bad throwing these away and am not too keen on rinsing out litter pan gravel, lots of dust, and floor debris down the drain in order to reuse these.<br /><br />As can be seen in my photos, I used this to clean up litter pan dust. For this test, I did rinse it out and reused it again. I actually felt guilty throwing away the one wipe I used because it really is not very disposable.<br /><br />Obviously these have a purpose in situations where one wants to use a wipe like a rag that gets reused over and over again. For those purposes, these are perfect. However, I have an aversion to rinsing dust, debris, and grease down the drain and prefer to use paper towels instead. Therefore, I might re-purpose these to wash my dishes instead of using the cloth Handi Wipes.<br /><br />I was thinking these might work in a kennel but who wants to wash the wipe and re-use it after picking up animal waste and stuff. <br /><br />Currently there is no price listed but I suspect these will be costly.<br /><br />UPDATE - I've been using these for six months now and each wipe lasts me two weeks. It will take me forever to use all 300. I use them to clean my sink and wipe down my countertops several times per day. As as a result, I raised my ranking from 3 to 5 stars simply because they last very long.",67,203

Each of the cells has a good clasp that snaps tightly shut. In my photo, I was able to fit 20 of my 50mcg D3 tablets into one cell. Their portability and slim-profile are the best features. Note that it will not store more than a couple of  ""horse-sized"" pills and may not be able to store any depending on the size of the capsule. The cell covers do not fully stay open when removing or inserting the pills, so be prepared for it to stay only partially open.<br /><br />Also note that there is a right way and wrong way to insert the case into its holder. The side with the finger nubs on the case is the correct face-up position to insert the pill case with the lids facing up. It does not go in correctly if the case is flipped.<br /><br />The current price of $8.99 is competitively priced as it comes to $4 per case.",67,206

I cannot describe the scents of the other two.<br /><br />I applied each to the inside of my wrists. Unfortunately, the fragrance does not last long at all (about one hour). The current price of $24.99 would be competitive if these lasted longer and if I liked all three scents. The citrus one is my only favorite.",67,207

The ear loops are adjustable with the silicone adjuster; however, they can fall off if adjusted too much. A lanyard would prevent them from falling off.<br /><br />There are two thick filters supplied as well.  The only big negative with this mask is that the medium adult size is more like a kid-size mask. I usually take a medium in a mask as I find the large is too loose. However, with this mask, I should have picked a large.<br /><br />The $19.99 price tag is also too expensive for this. If the sizing were right, it would have gotten 4 stars from me. If both the sizing and price were right (about $10), then it would have received 5 stars.",67,209

It ""sits up"" like an alarm clock. I love that it is battery operated. I charged it overnight. This comes with a USB cable (not the typical micro USB; perhaps type C), the unit itself, and an instruction pamphlet. <br /><br />Operation is simple as per my video. Press and hold the on/off button for about three seconds to turn the unit on or off.  <br /><br />Rotate the dial on the front to move through the six sounds of brook, thunder, white noise, wave, wind, and bonfire. All but one sound is pure annoying noise.<br /><br />The timer can be set from 20 to 120 minutes. Each press turns on a light in the front of the unit and when the lights are off, it means the timer is off.<br /><br />There is a nightlight feature that only works when powered on. The nightlight button is in the center top. There are three light varieties that can be cycled through with each press and the 4th press will turn off the light.  The first press turns on a light dot that rotates around the dial. The second press turns on one side of dots, then turns off the top dot and turns on the next bottom dot until it cycles around the dial with half the dots on and half off. The next press keeps all the dots lit. This is what they call breathing lights.<br /><br />The volume buttons are on the right side top that can be used to increase or decrease volume.<br /><br />The current price of $16.19 ($26.99 minus 40%) would be extremely reasonable for this if I liked it but I do not. It has a limited musical repertoire that is more annoying noise than anything else and the nightlight feature is more of a series of indicator lights. I like the look of this and that it is battery operated. I also like the simple operation. However, the two most important features (nightlight and sound) are lackluster in my opinion.",67,7
4.0,1612477903945,"Good, hefty brush but short handle; massaging side not useful to me","I tried several brushes over the last several months and love the KOZIS Wooden Bath Brush (Amazon item # B08HR2GBHC) the best. However, this one is very good too.<br /><br />The brush head side is ample for good coverage. The bristles are of medium softness. The massaging side is not useful to me because I have no desire to use that. In fact, I do not even understand why anyone would use that. <br /><br />The brush is hefty and is one solid piece, which is fabulous as the head cannot fall off the handle like some other brushes I tried previously. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower. In addition, a self-stick hook is supplied if needed but I did not use it.<br /><br />Besides the massaging brush head that I find useless, the only negative to me is that the brush handle is about two inches shorter than I would like. Many brushes have a longer handle and a longer handle is best when trying to reach my back. Nevertheless, this is still very functional and it is very well made.<br /><br />Overall, I like this brush even though it comes in second to the KOZIS I love. The current price of $11.99 is about right for a two-sided wooden brush.",67,210

The only thing I like is that the bristles on the brush are relatively soft on the back. However, I would have preferred a larger head so that there are more bristles and larger puff.<br /><br />The other thing that annoys me is that the handle is too short and I have to stretch to reach my entire back. In addition, the rope loop in the middle of the brush is ridiculous and annoying during washing. Why they thought this was a good thing to attach to the puff is beyond me. There is already a hole in the handle for hanging.<br /><br />A self-adhesive hook is provided for hanging although I did not use that.<br /><br />In summary, this is functional but is the least favorite back washer I tried so far. Also, the current price of $14.99 is outrageous for this.",67,211

Therefore, when I saw these I just had to try them. There are 12 individually wrapped bath bombs in this set in the scents listed below. <br /><br />- lavender<br />- orange<br />- lemon<br />- strawberry<br />- peppermint<br />- coconut<br />- vanilla<br />- grapefruit<br />- ocean<br />- rose<br />- blueberry<br />- mango  <br /><br />Each fragrance is divine and smells fresh and exactly the way it should smell. These bombs are made with essential oils and they are large. Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I use them in a foot bath. One bath bomb dissolves in about ten minutes in hot water. The fragrance is wonderful and the results are skin softening. BUT.....I used the rose bath bomb and the final color of the water was an indigo blue which turned my heels and toenails a SMURF BLUE. I also had a blue ring around my ankle. The skin color dissipated during drying but the nail color stayed for several showers. The blue coloring was easy to rinse off the foot bath.<br /><br />The current price of $32.99 comes to $2.75 per bath bomb which is just a tad pricey but then again I feel these are better than others I tried previously. This would make a wonderful gift as long as one does not mind the color changes particularly to the nails. I really love them but only for a foot bath.",67,213

However, the sizing advertised is all wrong. This is more like a size 11.5 if measuring from tip to tip. Also, I just noticed that they claim a smaller woman's size equals a larger men's size. That is incorrect. A size 9 in a women's would fit a size 7.5 in a men's size and not vice versa as the men's sizing is always 1.5 lower than the female sizing. These cannot be cut down so I can't use them.<br /><br />If these fit, they do have some cushioning and arch support, which is good. However, it is made of super cheap foam and there is no way this is worth the $49.95 price ($24.95 if applying the $25 discount) they are asking. I would not expect this to sell for more than $6.<br /><br />NOTE that I tried to attach the sizing listed on the Amazon site and point to the wrong sizing but Amazon would not post that review, so I removed that photo.

However, once I got the first piece off, I was good to go. I was able to wash the counter with these or clean parts of my cats' litter pans. They are strong and reusable. I do feel the current price of $17.99 ($19.99 minus 10% off) is expensive. However, if these rolls last long and I can reuse more than several times, then it might be worth it because at the current discounted price it comes to $.12 cents per sheet. Only time will tell how long this will last.<br /><br />This would have gotten 5 stars if they were not so pricey. However, this might not be 5 stars for everyone.

Its use is somewhat successful.<br /><br />The two single-day pill boxes open easily and are portable for travel. They do what they are supposed to do, which is hold pills. However, my boyfriend and I wish these were clear so that the pills can be seen. This is the only negative with the cases. Also, the case covers are held on by a thin piece of plastic that will eventually fall off with lots of use.<br /><br />The current price of $9.99 is on the expensive side for this set but still competitive.

However, on the right side they are located on the right.  I would expect the date to always be on the left, no matter whether it is an odd or even page. It also would have been nice if they numbered the pages automatically since one is unlikely to remove pages from this nicely bound book.<br /><br />Other than this, this is a nice journal that is built to last.",67,237

They do feel a bit thinner than other Ziploc bags but not so thin that it matters much.<br /><br />These are great for storing nuts, cheese, crayons, a wet bathing suit, and anything else that can fit into a one-gallon bag.

I'm using it as a support pillow for my right hip. I pulled a muscle last week (trying not to fall out my saddle when my young mare bolted over two jumps) and just sitting upright is excruciating.<br /><br />This is stiff and thick which wait very durable for sitting on. It doesn't give or sag and it returns to it's shape when put up. Since the cover is removable, I can wash it as needed.

Long lasting charge","In short: open reservoir cup makes it easy to add water, keep clean, and to allow dry between uses. Can adjust strength. Slim design makes it easy to maneuver around mouth. Takes up little room. Can be packed up for on the go use. Loud, but similar to my corded tank style.<br /><br />I use water flossers all the time. The best (to me) is a particular name brand that has a tank, and is plugged in. I keep that in my main bathroom that has a plug nearby. Since I rely greatly on water flossing, I wanted to have one in my 1st floor bathroom, which is like the size of a closet, and has no counter, and no plugs. So, I have been tried cordless flossers for use in that bathroom.<br /><br />Here is the thing I find with most of them: the water reservoirs are bulky and are hard to clean. I dont care that they dont hold much water. That is easy enough to deal with, but to have an enclosed cup that really can ever be cleaned out? gross. Then I tried one where there [[ASIN:B09L1H1G31 is no reservoir cup just a hose to put in any sized cup]], and that works really well for my needs. That one wins out over this due to one aspect- it is fully cordless. When I saw this Hangsun water flosser I decided to try it--it has appearance of regular plug in, but an open water top that makes me feel better about it drying between uses. I didnt need another flosser, but I wanted to find out more about it and report back in a review.<br /><br />SO, this may be for you if you are (like me) in wanting a CORDLESS* flosser with an open water reservoir. I can easily add more water to it, it is easy to clean, and it dries between uses. Charge has been long lasting, so I like that I dont need to fuss. It is nice for use in no-plug areas. While cordless, I still feel attached, as I need to set the base down. Doubt I would use this in shower. With my other one, I may need to supply my own cup for water, but it can be any size, and I can use it in shower just by cupping my hand.<br /><br />Kinda loud-- similar to my plug in name brand one.<br /><br />I tend to only ever use one head- the slightly curved one. Havent tried the other options, and likely wont.<br /><br />Of the half dozen cordless flossers I have tried (including a name brand cordless), I like this one, and the one I linked to the best.

5.0,1658235782289,"soft, plush, breathable, adjustable, NOT HOT, blocks light, cozy feel, doesnt dry out my skin","Not my first ""real silk"" sleep mask. In short: Light, breathable, not hot, blocks light, good adjustable fit, super silky, doesn't dehydrate skin, is gentle on skin- no rubbing, dragging. Cozy plush feel. Good stitching, nicely packaged.<br /><br />I rate this primarily on my experience. I dont factor price in. Prices fluctuate, there are coupons, everyone has different budgets, preferences, and so on. You decide if it is worth it. This is actual silk and there is a price tag that goes with it. Not everyone wants a polyester dupe. Not everyone wants low level silk (that feels like polyester). If you have no preference, then there are some lovely low level momme silk options, as well as some nice polyester satin options for fraction of price. This is for those that want actual silk (RIP silkworms).  That being said, I have used a wide variety of eye masks of different materials and styles. Here is my take on this:<br /><br />It feels light and lush. Very soft and silky. I am privvy to the look, feel, performance of various textiles including various silk levels. This is 25 momm and feels like it. I dont question that at all.<br /><br />Silk is nice for any skin, but is particularly gentle on delicate skin or skin easily irritated. It is breathable, and it doesnt dehydrate already dry skin. I notice that my skin is less parched when I use silk versus low end polyester. That is material that is smashed up against my skin for 8 hours each night. I would prefer to not have material that is rough and drags against my skin. Same can be said for pillow cases and my hair. Though I do keep other styles at my bedside, I always come back to silk.  I happened to be in need of another real silk mask because I accidentally washed and dried my trusty silk mask and it shrunk significantly (note to self: hand wash, air dry.).<br /><br />The fit is good for me. Generous size which is nice for my wide face and big nose. Plenty of elastic and the adjustment option allows it to be as loose or snug as I desire. I find that it blocks light from every angle. I normally dont mind a little light to seep through so long as I dont notice while my eyes are closed. But this blocks it all out for me. I had to lift an edge to see if the tv was still on (my hubs will watch tv in bed with sound off/captions on). I couldnt tell. Come morning, I pushed the mask up a little so as not to accidentally sleep all day.<br /><br />Not hot. Some masks really trap heat. This is breathable. Again, function of the material used. Of course any material can block light. So it comes down to your needs and preferences.<br /><br />Nicely packaged<br /><br />At time of review, this was $35 with 30% coupon. While I dont rate on price (except for in the rate features section, which I give 3 stars), I will comment that $35 is the ceiling for nearly all 22-25 momme silk eye masks. If you can get it in the 20 something range, then that is reasonable.",294,169

It is designed to be added to a smoothie, not for use as a smoothie itself. But I wanted to get an idea of the overall taste, so I blended 1 TBS with 8 unsweetened almond milk and it really just disappeared- not much flavor, which I find to be a good thing. I really was expecting it to taste awful, lol<br /><br />It has some erythritol- 4.5 grams per 1 TBS serving. I missed this when looking at the ingredients because it is not listed in the ingredients. Just in the nutrition panel. I could do without it, but it doesnt overpower at all. I find that when products use non sugar sweeteners they go way overboard with the sweetness. This doesnt impart much sweetness or much of any strong flavor.<br /><br />1 TBS has 110 calories, so be mindful of how much you use. Hence why it is best added TO a smoothie (or whatever else you want).<br /><br />I like all the food based ingredients and I ""feel good"" adding this to my assortment of supplements I add to my daily smoothie.

4.0,1643039819634,"large washcloth sized felt like fabric, add water for light lather. Then towel dry off","How this fits into your life depends on what you need. It still requires some water, and still requires toweling off. It basically replaces the need to have a separate low suds cleansing formula and wash rag or dry cloth. THIS IS Rinse free, but you do need water to start.  Just add a little water to the sheet of fabric, massage for light lather, wipe down body, then towel off. No need to rinse. Keep in mind that the more water that is used, the more the mess from run off.<br /><br />The sheet of fabric is like a soft piece of felt. Size of a large washcloth (9.5"" x 9.5""). Don't need much water! It definitely lathers. It isn't a sudsy soap, but that doesn't mean there isn't enough.  Now, if you are expecting loads of foamy bubbles, this does not provide that. It creates a light watery lather. This in no way determines effectiveness of cleaning. Mega lather does not equate better cleaning. I learned that 30 some years ago in home economics that excess lather is a marketing technique (usually through copious amounts of sulphates) to give people impression that more lather/bubbles/suds = better clean (shampoo, body soaps, toothpaste). But for those that dig the suds, I can get some light bubbles out of it. That being said, it is adequate enough. Not super refreshing, but I do feel clean. Tried it in hair with fair results.<br /><br />This could be cut in half and it would still have plenty of lather. Depending on your situation, this could be premoistened and placed in a ziplock baggie.<br /><br />No discernable aroma. Not sticky, at least not me. I wonder if amount of water used, or thoroughness of toweling off impacts that or not.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer wet body wipes. They never need water nor toweling off. I like those for on the go use (workday, after work out, bird bath at the sink). I would be more apt to use these in a bed bound situation, or no hot water situation, maybe camping.<br /><br />The term ""waterless"" needs to be taken out from the title headline.

(I like it more than middle of road 3 rating)<br /><br />I keep a selection of instant coffee on hand for at home and on the go. I sometimes add it to smoothies, sometimes I make a quick iced drink (shaken), sometimes I just want a very quick cup of coffee and the taste of instant can be pleasing to me. More often, I add it to a cup of brewed coffee. Get an extra boost (flavor, caffeine)!  And that is primarily how I drink this. I make myself a cup of dark bold coffee, blend a packet of this in, and enjoy. I like the light vanilla taste, and the sweetness level is on point for me. I dont often sweeten my coffee as I prefer it black, but I do enjoy some sweetened coffee with cream on occasion.<br /><br />Prepared as is? The sweetness level is more pronounced, as is the vanilla. Wish ""no sugar added"" products that use sugar alternatives would use less. So made alone is a tad much for me.<br /><br /> I like that it is super quick and easy to make, can be made with hot or cold water, and is well packaged. I like the added supplements. The amount of collagen peptides is low (3 grams), where my typical scoop of collagen powder always offers 10+ grams per serving.<br /><br />You decide. It uses SUCRALOSE as its sweetener. I have found it used in ""keto"" products, but I also see many keto products omitting it and using something else. I am not on a strict keto diet, nor any keto diet. I am just reducing my sugar intake, and by doing so I tend to buy things that end up using sucralose. SO FAR, I have not had any issue with weight loss. It is October as I write this, and I have dropped 50 lbs since April, and I haven't tried all that hard. Just dropped sugar laden desserts and have been moving more. Maybe my weight loss would be further along, but I still take down half a pizza every week. But massive calorie reduction from dropping desserts, and using sugar free alternatives.. which happens to include sucralose. I'd like to see less of it used across the board, but in mean time it doesn't seem to be a hinderance to my health and goals.<br /><br />I do not rate on price as we all have different budgets, needs, interests. The price is posted, and not a surprise, so I just focus on my experience and perception of taste, quality, and how it lines up to the product description. THOUGH, I do comment.. and this really is ridiculously priced. I have some good instant coffee products with similar nutrition profile where each pack is in the upper $1 range (and people still freak over price). So for me, this is a bit prohibitive for daily use, but that is just me and my budget.<br /><br />The packaging is cool though.

I have another yam product I prefer (about as mild, but little more chew), but I would totally buy these again. If only because I can control myself better. This is 80 calories per stick, where as the other is a bag at 180 per serving/bag. Not bad, but I dont always need that much at once (but I cant control myself haha). So different items purchased for different reasons.

I am not used to using a bucket, don't feel I need one..  but this is neat to have. Again, I have not knocked it over. It seems to be well balanced. It works as described! I have 2 big labs and lots of sandy soil that gets tracked in with them, so floor sweeping, vacuuming, and washing is a regular chore.",294,577
4.0,1598111340828,"not fan of packaging, spout really pours out liquid, but detergent is great","I do not care for the packaging.<br /><br />At first, I thought the cut outs were neat. I like how there is a spot to store the cup, and the access area to the spout is tidy looking.<br /><br />Then it came time to pour product into the cup, and WHOA it comes pouring out. I really need to be on top of turning it off real quick lest I overflow my cup..again. So, in the future I will return to their regular bottles. If I had an empty I would pour this into that.<br /><br />The Dreft laundry detergent itself? LOVE IT. Smells SO GOOD... to me. Mmmmm<br /><br />I have been using Dreft products on and off since 2007. I do not have kids, but at some point I ended up with the stain remover spray, which is awesome stuff. Then I would buy the detergent once in awhile, especially for use with my cats and dogs bedding. I hadn't purchased any in a long time,  I think a lot of other gentle products came to market and I simply got away from it (not the stain remover though, still the best for me). Forward to this box of detergent. I really don't recall now what the detergent of the past smells like but I really like the way this smells. It is similar to a few others out there- floral, sweet. You may or may not like it. I like it. It works well with anything I have washed so far. If the scent has changed any, I understand why some would not like it-- sometimes we want what is familiar to use and what has worked.<br /><br />Really not sure why anyone would think this was fake? It is sold by Dreft, not a 3rd party. Go to their page and it is ALL Dreft items. Anyway.. the detergent works as expected. Smells good too! Box.. eh, I could do without that. Use it as a refill if you really want the box style and not have more bottles building up.",294,483
5.0,1594394138346,"60 ssoftgels/30 day supply, 2500mg fish oil, mild lemon taste, easy to swallow large softgels","These are big softgels, but they are easy to swallow. So smooth. The 60 softgel bottle is a 30 day supply. Just two a day provides 2500 mg of fish oil,  EPA 900 mg, DHA 600 mg, Other Omega-3 Fatty Acids 300 mg. This is a good amount!<br /><br />I have no problem taking this-- swallowing big smooth softgels dont bother me, I get no stomach upset, and not even any fishy tastes. Hint of lemon. I keep it at my desk and have it shortly after my first meal of the day.  I take fish oil for my health, as we all should! More specifically to keep my cholesterol on check. All the other is bonus. I got remiss on taking fish caps. I normally buy liquid as it is usually easier to find the higher amount, and many of the soft gels types that I have tried have been woefully low (like, maybe 10% of this). I was working through some low dose/tiny softgels. I really need to get back to taking larger amounts, daily. The Vimerson Health Fish Oil Omega 3 has allowed me to do that. Sometimes I add in my other softgels later in the day, or take a swig of my liquid fish oil (my doctor said I can up to 5000mg daily- so I can double what I take of this, or just use up my other stuff).<br /><br />Some fish caps and liquids can have a fishy aftertaste/burp. I am not sure what causes that-- whether it is the formula, or when it is taken. I haven't had that issue with these, but I do take them after I eat in the morning.<br /><br />I included pics of the softgels, the measurement, and even of one in my mouth. I suppose one could pop the soft gels and empty it out onto a spoon, or food. But really, these go down super easy... unlike tablets, capsules and softgels tend to be like that.",294,288

While I normally do smoothies, I am inclined to start adding it to batters and soups. What a great addition to muffins, pancakes, and breads. If you are into sipping broths and you happen to like the taste of beets, it is nice stirred into a mug of hot homemade broth.

3.0,1568660582349,"fresh, mild to no taste, needs mixing in shaker cup or blender,","I haven't been using this long, so far just once a day. I'm a little confused on dosing. There isn't any information regarding it on packaging other than add 1 scoop to your juice, smoothy or whatever. It says each scoop contains 3 grams of garcinia cambogia extract powder. Is that just weight, or is that the actual amount. Because.. that is 3000 mg of this extract otherwise-- which is higher than some other similar products out there. Maybe the serving size just happens to be larger where as the others are smaller with expectation to use it 2-3 times a day. This lack of clear info is frustrating. Hopefully other reviewers can comment on that.<br /><br />As for how it works. Well, I am not exactly sure what I am looking for it to do and how to measure my experience. I know it has been an ingredient used in weight loss formulations, and I sure could stand to lose several pounds, but I'm not sure about that for reviewing easily. Reading through some potential benefits like better digestion, better concentration, reduced food cravings, loss of appetite, reduced joint pain, improved cholesterol levels,  better mood, etc.. I figure the one I can measure best is the food cravings. I know what my habits are, and I will know if my desire for sugary foods reduces. So if I notice a reduction, then I can attribute it to this. So far, not feeling that, BUT it is early on and I have taken but one serving a day. I will give it a little more time and report back. Your desires for taking this as a supplement may vary from my own. There is no shortage of info on what this fruit is or its purported benefits are, as well as risks (such as do not take if have dementia or Alzheimer's) - so please read up. I know I am still learning.<br /><br />ACTUAL PRODUCT: So I will tell you more about the product itself. It is an 8 ounce bag of  garcinia cambogia extract powder. It is a resealable Mylar bag with a front window so you can see how much is in there. It comes with a small scoop, which is one serving. In my pic it shows the little scoop and the amount dumped into my hand. There are 76 servings in a container. If you plan to use it in liquid, plan to use a shaker cup or your blender. Just stirring it in will not work. I included a pic and you can see all the powder just sitting on top. Strangely, my spoon stayed dry. So that is when I got out the shaker cup and all blended fine with that.<br /><br />The taste is absent to me. Not sure if it supposed to have a noticeable flavor or not. The fruit is tart and I hadn't noticed a tart flavor with this. Maybe my taste buds are off. Seems that it will go well with yogurt, oatmeal, blended into smoothies, added to soups, broths, baked goods. I have been just consuming it with plain water or some organic lemonade in a shaker cup- because like I said, it doesn't mix by just stirring. The powder is fine, and not at all gritty. I'll likely add it into my next smoothy. I haven't tried it blended in with coffee- next time I will do that. I imagine if you like to fill your own capsules that this powder could work for that, but I don't know for sure.<br /><br />Everything about it seems fresh and of quality. I received it in 9/2019 and it has an expiration date of 3/2020; 6 months from now.  If I figure out anything else, I will be back to update. 3 stars because I need more time with product. Also I have no idea what the price is, and lack of info is concerning.",294,13

I normally take a shot of ACV in a glass of water, and this is actually so much better. The other ingredients are great additions to help boost the affect of ACV. I seem to be in more control of my appetite lately, and I think that regular use of these pills have contributed to that. EVen so, taking ACV every day is beneficial to health.",294,579

5.0,1666418742932,"Makes awesome iced over windows, truly amazing at this!","SO a couple of things I noticed- I did this on a day where the back half of the house was in full sun and the front was in shade. The windows in the back were super hot and the crystals from this started showing instantly and seemed to come out better. So people with poor results on this might try heating up the window with a blow dryer first or something if it's cold out. The front windows still did decent, just took them some time to dry and the crystals to show up.<br /><br />I can say from experience- don't overdo it all at once on a window! If you do then you'll get runs in your crystals and it detracts from them a bit. So lightly spray the window and let it dry for a bit and once it's dry to touch, decide if you need to follow up with another coat.<br /><br />Pro tip, if you want it to look professional then use a piece of cardboard along the edges as you spray or tape all of your window trim with masking tape before spraying this. Especially around darker window frames. If you have white window frames then it probably wouldn't be an issue. I have dark brown aluminum frame windows and the over spray of this looks kinda junky. It does wipe off though so I just have to find time and go out and wipe the edges down for a cleaner look.<br /><br />Overall I'm truly amazed by the frozen window look these created!

The packaging draws you in and the name itself totally makes you want to see what this is. Then you read Cherry Bomb and I was totally intrigued and it sounds like it would be an awesome flavor. This stuff ticked all my boxes on looks and drawing me in.<br />However, when I opened it and smelled what was in this, nope, nope, oh heck to the nope nope. I have to be completely honest, I can't even tell you what it smelled like because it's not something I've ever smelled. Yeah, tells you exactly what it is huh. I know, it's driving me crazy too because it's this strong striking scent that you think you know but then when you think about it, you really have no idea. Then I tried it. Worst mistake ever. It's like battery acid meets stomach bile, except I'd rather drink that. The worst part is while I was very hesitant to even try this after smelling it, I was like I've tried things that smelled horrible, tried it, and honestly it was awesome. However, me being dumb and super thirsty I ended up downing half a bottle before wanting to rip my tongue out. It's messed up because it started out totally fine until you stop drinking and then the smell turns into the taste. My tongue is still mad at me, and I don't blame it. I still have remnants of the smell and then it reminds me of the taste and I spit up a bit. Yeah, it's gross. It's more than gross, seriously don't buy this stuff. And being someone that drinks zero sugar drinks and sugar-free stuff, it's not this being sugar-free.<br />On another note, I wish everything came with the little scoops that Glytch uses.

5.0,1615144688714,Very comfortable and comes with great accessories,This has been one crazy year. We have all had to get face masks or learn how to make our own. Thanks to COVID this has become a common day task that we wear these at work or out and about on errands and such. For some tasks I prefer wearing washable cloth masks and for others I prefer using a disposable type. At work we are only allowed to use the disposable N95 type masks but thankfully those are supplied to us.<br /><br />When I run errands or in my personal life I prefer to wear the more comfortable and reusable cloth masks. In this pack you get 2 black masks. In addition you get a storage pouch for when you are out and about to keep your mask in. You also get a pouch to wash your masks in. This is a nice set of masks that is very comfortable to wear. It fits very well above the nose and under the chin.  This one is very comfortable and fits well. The cotton is very soft and comfortable to wear. They have a metal clip on the nose to make them fit better. They also have adjustable loops to make sure the masks stay put and fit well. All int all this is a good mask that I like to wear quite a bit. At $15 this is not a bad price at all plus you can use the accessories for any of your other masks really.,370,713
5.0,1605226978323,Adds the little extra to your soaking bath time,"Who doesn’t like bath bombs? Well clearly if you are on here you do and you are in the right place if you ask me. These bath bombs are great. They are a very nice generous size which means they last a nice long time giving you a nice longer experience while you enjoy your nice soaking bath. The fragrances these have are fantastic. I tend to be very picky when it comes to fragrances and love that this one has a huge variety  from citrus to flowers to “plain” vanilla.<br /><br />You get a total of 12 of these bath bombs for just over $20 which is a good deal in my eyes and well worth it. These come in a very nice box that also lends perfectly to gift these for the holidays but also for birthdays but really any occasion if you ask me. I will probably have to get these again when I am out. The only one I am not a fan of is eucalyptus mint, but that is because I just don’t like that fragrance but it will come in handy when I have a cold or flu to clean up those sinuses.",370,716
5.0,1601078874937,Good deal for what you are paying,"This is a pretty good kit for making face masks a bit more tolerable and easier to be honest. For one you get 12 brackets that keep the face masks a bit more of your face. I like that these are washable and reusable. These don’t have a lot of material to them which is nice, makes them feel a lot more airy unlike some others. They do have little snags that helps you snag them onto the face masks, but the snags are not the greatest and it makes it not that easy to attach them to those 3 ply fold-able disposable face masks but you can make it work. More practice eventually leads in better results.<br /><br />Then you get 2 of those lanyard straps which I like. You can attach your face mask to that and when you don’t use it, like if you are out to dinner and you are eating and don’t have a place to put it, you can just hang it around your neck instead. I really like this so much better than any other solution out there like those little wallets for face masks.<br /><br />Lastly you get those ear protectors, little straps that you can attach the face masks behind your head to instead of securing the face masks to your ear and straining your ears. You get a lot of them. These are fairly cheap but they work. You get so many in fact that if they break who cares and you have still so many that you can share with friends, family and coworkers if you are so inclined. All this for $17, not a bad deal really. I think it is worth it and all these little gadgets help making wear masks a little bit more tolerable.",370,717
3.0,1600569893946,More expensive face mask lanyards - still work as advertised,"I like these face mask lanyards. They are perfect to attach your face masks to. You attach one end to each side of your face masks. Then when you don’t use your face mask, like for example if you are taking a break to eat or you are at a restaurant, you can then take it down and just hang it around your neck using this lanyard. No more leaving it on the desk, putting it over your thigh or anything like that. So much easier and better. Especially when you are out for dinner I always struggle on what to do with it and this is the solution. Or when you are driving in your car and you just need to put it away for a bit, this is the solution. These can also be used as ear extenders / ear savers meaning  the face mask is attached to the lanyard and around the head, relieving the pressure on the ears.<br /><br />I like it because it makes it easy to put the face mask safely away but close by and you don’t have to put them down anywhere but instead they hang around your neck. In this pack you get 4 of them for just $16. These are definitely some of the more expensive ones out there and not sure why they are more expensive, because of the “design”?  I always keep some around since it is easy to misplace them and I just keep them on the various cloth masks I have in the car and so on so having a few of the on hand is very handy.",370,227
3.0,1587578386599,Just ok in my eyes - high amount of calories for what you are getting,"This is just an average hydration supplement in my eyes. First of it comes at 160 calories for one serving, which I think is rather high. Most energy workout boosters come at like 50 calories or less but this one has quite a bit of sugar in it. It does have a good amount of electrolytes so that is nice, you can basically make your own quick version of Gatorade of sorts. Again a lot of calories though. The electrolytes are mostly sodium and potassium, both important for muscle function and many other functions inside the human body.<br /><br />I tend to dilute it more than instructed since it is pretty sweet. The taste is not bad but among the energy boosters I have tried this is not my favorite, it is ok. I have had no negative reactions to this but didn't really feel any energy boosting effects from this at all since they do claim some energy boosting effects calling it an energy blend.<br /><br />All in all this is just ok. You do get a massive amount for the $20 though so you can make a lot of home made ""Gatorade"" with this really. I won't reorder this though.",370,723
5.0,1585835314749,Great cleaning bundle,"This is a nice cleaning bundle. You get one bottle that is a streak-less glass cleaner that you can use on either glass surfaces or mirrors. I have had no issues with this and indeed it is streak-less. It works very well and it is pretty much ammonia based like most others are.<br /><br />The other bottle is an all purpose cleaner that works very well on pretty much everything else like your shower, cook top with a greasy mess and everything else that your cleaning hands come across. These 2 cleaners work very well. They smell like cleaning supplies do so no surprise there really.",370,726
5.0,1583850121201,Really like this toothpaste,"This is a very nice toothpaste. It is definitely funky using toothpaste that is black but you get used to it. It tastes pretty good and cleanse your teeth very well. I would recommend mixing it up with regular toothpaste though because it can strip your teeth because of the charcoal. It does have some bad breath eliminating features which I like and it can help whiten your teeth, don't expect to have like bright white teeth because of this but it can neutralize some stains which is nice. I really like this one but I am not making this my own and only toothpaste but actually rotate it with another one I use.",370,729
4.0,1579531142252,Very nice roll on oil,"This is a very nice roll on stick with hemp oil and lavender. It smells beautiful of lavender. It is a very nice lavender scent, much nicer actually than some of the diffuser oils I have found, very smooth and just plain beautiful.<br /><br />The oil feels great on the skin and I had no negative reactions to it. I enjoy applying it before I go to sleep because I enjoy the scent because I feel it is calming.<br /><br />When I got mine in the mail it did leak and there was a good amount in the bubble wrap that it was wrapped in. Seems this is a common problem so I hope they fix it since it is a shame that this product gets wasted like that!",370,731
4.0,1579528432533,Very good for traveling,"These are nice little travel packs to bring along in a pinch when you are out of smaller tooth paste and mouth wash, plus a small size of spritz breath spray. These packs are very small and easy to store and bring along. These work pretty well. I am not a huge fan of the breath spray, but that is just because I don't generally use them so I wish they would have included more mouth wash and tooth paste since those I use a lot more.",370,670
1.0,1579188455252,Not for me - can't stand the taste of it unfortunately,"I got this flavored sparkling water with the dragon fruit flavor. Before I drank it, it was nicely chilled. Sadly this did not help the overall experience. I know it has a lot of good for you ingredients, but sadly I couldn't stand this beverage at all!<br />It says zero calories, zero sweetener, zero carbs, zero sugar, but sadly I have to say horrible flavor!<br /><br />To me this is a complete miss. I struggled drinking one can of this and now I have 11 more in my fridge. I wish this would have been better. Now I wish I would have gotten the variety pack to see if any of the other flavors would have been better but I didn't.",370,732
4.0,1577888790319,Nice two in one,"This earmuffs/eye mask combination is pretty neat. It is one piece that combines an eye mask with earmuffs to give you better sleep. The straps are adjustable to make them tighter or looser obviously and fit better for your needs. I found I don't like it super tight since that makes it a bit uncomfortable on the eyes especially if you end up opening your eyes at one point while wearing the mask.<br /><br />The mask is soft so if you do open your eyes at some point your eye lashes will touch the mask, that is a tad annoying but not a deal breaker since you should be sleeping anyways. The earmuffs are pretty noise insulating but do not block out all noise. But I found they do a pretty good job. For those who like to sleep on the side these are soft and comfortable enough to do so, although for an entire night on the same side I don't think it is optimal. I move around from the sides to back a bit so this worked well for me.<br /><br />They are pretty well made in my eyes so they should last a good amount of time. I think the thing that will probably go first are the straps that hold everything together. These should be great especially on a flight if you are trying to get a little snooze. All in all not a bad purchase.",370,733

This eye mask has been a game-changer for her nighttime routine, as it quickly heats up and stays warm for a long time, providing her with the perfect amount of relaxation and comfort.<br /><br />One of the things that stands out about this eye mask is its 3D ergonomic design. It perfectly contours to her face, blocking out all light and allowing her to completely relax. The graphene material used in the mask is top-quality, ensuring that the heat is evenly distributed and that she remains comfortable throughout the night.<br /><br />The magnet suction wire is also a great feature, as it keeps the mask securely in place without any discomfort or slipping. My wife also loves how breathable and soft the mask is, which helps prevent any irritation or sweating around the eyes.<br /><br />Overall, the Heated Sleep Eye Mask by CareFor is a must-have for anyone who struggles with migraines, dry eyes, or just wants a more relaxing and comfortable sleep. It's also perfect for nap time or travel, making it a versatile and useful addition to any routine. Highly recommended!",398,766

I really appreciate the grams of fiber along with added vitamins.<br /><br />The only concern I have is the price to re-order when it runs out.

Since this wipes out all of the good bacteria in my intestines, I stocked up on several different pre + probiotics.  My thoughts are that different brands may have different types of good bacteria.<br /><br />After about two weeks of some serious probiotic dosages, which was also in the middle of the Covid19 outbreak, I got sick.  I had a fever, cough, and shortness of breath.  It really started to worry me.  It only lasted two days and was gone.

It is not cluttered with stevia or other additives.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I am thrilled to have this without lots of extra flavors and enhancers added.  I only wish it was a little fuller.,417,810
5.0,1598286382555,"Although I Prefer Fresh Wheatgrass Juice, This Is A Great Substitute","I love fresh wheatgrass juice.  Sometimes, however, I can not get the wheatgrass so I am limited to what I can find that is available like this.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a WHEATGRASS JUICE powder.  That is important because you are not getting all of the fiber like wheatgrass powder has which tastes awful.  It is a bright green and needs to be kept sealed in the foil bag it came in.<br /><br />HOW TO USE IT?<br />I have found the best way to use wheatgrass is alone.  In absolute dire necessity fresh apple juice will go with it, but anything else tends to give an upset stomach.  I put a tsp of powder in a small glass of water, put it in my tiny cordless blender, blend it up and drink it.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT TASTE?<br />As much as I prefer fresh wheatgrass juice, this is a decent substitute.  I did not find it repulsive or difficult to drink and it is a pretty green color too.  Some might find the flavor a bit over whelming, but I like it.<br /><br />DOES IT HELP?<br />Believe it or not, it does help some.  Not as much as fresh juice, but it still does perk me up a bit.<br /><br />OTHER USE?<br />I use a tiny bit of juice in our cat's homemade food on the winter time.  That way she is getting some greens but not in an overwhelming amount.  She loves it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great way to get wheatgrass juice if you don't have any way to get fresh.  It should be kept sealed and consumed regularly until gone and kept in the refrigerator once opened to keep it fresher.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I am glad to have this and am surprised at how good it is compared to others I have had which I did not like.  I would buy it again.",417,813
5.0,1594048829617,I Was Surprised At How Nice This Is,"I have always had sensitive teeth since I was a kid.  Finding toothpaste that is good for sensitive teeth, tastes good, and cleans well is not always easy.  This time, I think I found a winner!<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS TOOTHPASTE LIKE?<br />This toothpaste is not a white paste more of a paste gel.  It has a really nice mojito flavor that is not sweet but still tastes good at the same time.  There is a flip top on it and the tube is plastic.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />I have used it for half the tube now and it seems to help with sensitive teeth.  I also feel that it cleans the teeth well too.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I like this toothpaste/gel.  It tastes good, is unusual, but seems to work well for my sensitive teeth.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS so far.  This is a nice product.  I would probably buy again if it continues to perform well over time.  I have two more tubes to go through.  I will update if anything changes.",417,814
5.0,1581356217805,This Stuff Is Liquid GOLD Especially In Winter WOW,"It has been a tough winter.  We have barely seen the sun for weeks at a time.  That has a tendency to make a person cranky and feeling more tired than normal.  I have been trying to get more fresh, raw, and green into my body to help counteract this winter problem.  Let's take a look at this..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a pretty large foil sealed bag of barley juice powder.  Notice it says JUICE.  That is essential when you are taking barely green.  Some people think that buying ground up barlely greens is just as good- it isn't.  This is very bright green and smells VERY fresh.<br /><br />HOW DO I USE THIS?<br />I do not put this into things, but I prefer to get some refrigerator cold water, put it in my tiny cordless blender, and put a teaspoon of this powder in.  I run it for one cycle which is barely a minute, and then I have the most luscious fresh green drink you can get without fresh greens.  There is a lovely layer of foam on it and it tastes heavenly.<br /><br />DOES IT REALLY TASTE THAT GOOD?<br />I must preface this by saying that I have had varieties of green powders, fresh green drinks including fresh wheatgrass and kale smoothies.  I know what fresh juice from many greens tastes like as I have made them from time to time.  This powder is one of the best I have had since the days when I used to take Green Magma from Japan, which was one of the original barley juice powders.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO WHEATGRASS?<br />This has a sweetness that is not quite as intense as wheatgrass juice is.  It is easier to drink in my opinion than wheatgrass.<br /><br />DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE?<br />I will say that using barley juice powder helps a lot to add energy to my day, helps me to sleep better and it does tend to detox.  I would recommend you start with a half teaspoon at first if you are not used to this kind of product.  Work up to a teaspoon.  It also does keep me regular and not feeling quite so wiped out in times of stress.<br /><br />DID I GET A DETOX REACTION?<br />I eat really healthy, do I did not get a detox reaction, but I also made sure to start with half a teaspoon and work up to a teaspoon.  It is important to go slowly with this as it can be a bit much if you are not used to it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This has given me energy, a more positive outlook, helped me feel supplemented, and definitely is helping me through winter very well compared to not having it  This tastes fresh and makes a wonderful drink.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I will be buying this again.  I stopped getting barley juice powder because I just could not find a really good quality one.. until now.  (grins).",417,813
4.0,1580608294787,"Great For Rehydrating Especially  After Bout Of ""The Runs""","I have been trying to build up my system with minerals in my water, but not too long ago, I had a bout with the runs- the kind that leave you feeling rather exhausted after a day of running to the bathroom.  I noticed that I was feeling very ill and weak the next day or two, then it dawned on me.  I thought I would try this..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This stuff is thickened in a bottle which has a twist of raspberry flavoring added.  It is not sweet, just has a raspberry essence.  There is no sweetener, and the dropper has measuring lines on it.<br /><br />HOW TO USE THIS?<br />I was so run down when I got thinking about it, I remembered- you can easily get dehydrated when having ""the runs"".  I immediately got out this electrolyte mixture and put a small amount of this (like.25) into a very large glass of water.  I drank it down as gradually as I could and then through the day I added more water.<br /><br />By the end of the morning, I was feeling TONS better.  This really did help me rehydrate and feel better after being wiped out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is not hard to take, has just a bit of raspberry flavor, but does help me to rehydrate when I really need help.  I experienced relief greatly after having a bout with ""the runs""  I plan to use a little bit now and then to continue to rehydrate this winter.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  I love that this helped me through a rough patch when I needed hydration.  I am torn between five and four stars for review.  I am VERY glad there is not heavy sweetener in this like so many things have.  I also am kind of unclear on ingredients or this company.  I also experienced good from it so far, so I am leaving it at FOUR STARS, but REALLY IT IS FOUR AND A HALF.",417,815
5.0,1574103008818,I am SO HAPPY To Have This Not Only For Juice But Keto Red Forest Cake!,"When it comes to winter, sometimes we don't always have access to the vegetables that we want to have.  I love to have juice, but sometimes it just is not possible to get fresh vegetables at times.  Having this powder is a great alternative.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS POWDER LIKE?<br />This powder comes in a great packaging which seems to keep the powder dry very nicely.  It is cut open and then you can reseal it.  The powder is raw beets, but is freeze dried so you HAVE to keep this closed at all times, before and after you access it.<br /><br />HOW DO I USE IT?<br />I either put this in my vegetable juice that I make fresh and blend it in my hand blender, or if desperate, I add it to cold water and drink it in my mini blender.  I also have used it to make a Keto version of red forest cake which is OUT OF THIS WORLD, by the way.  You just have to add more liquid to counteract the powder.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a great way to get beet juice into your diet when vegetables are not handy, this is an excellent alternative.  The powder is easy to use, tastes fresh and mixes well either in fresh juice or water, or you can use it in recipes too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I LOVE how versatile it is and between the juice and red forest keto cake, I am most likely going to keep this in my cupboard when I run out- I will buy more.",417,13
5.0,1567016157945,"VERY Fresh, Comes With Scoop","I am used to using a variety of different spirulina powders.  Let's take a look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a bag which is pretty good at insulating against moisture and air, if you open it correctly.  Just cutting below the plastic seal allows for enough room to re-zip the bag shut.<br /><br />THE POWDER<br />The powder inside is very fresh smelling.  I have had spirulina which tastes overwhelming and others which tastes almost gaggy.  This one, however, is not unpleasant like some I have had.<br /><br />SCOOP<br />This comes with a small scoop inside to measure for smoothies.<br /><br />TASTE<br />I am not minding this one.  The last spirulina powder I had was a bit overwhelming for me.  This one does not take over the smoothies in the same way.  It is earthy in flavor but not repulsive.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a good raw source of spirulina for shakes, smoothies, baking, or supplementation this seems to be a bit nicer than some.  It does not taste bad and it comes with a measure scoop.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  One of my favorite spirulina powders so far that I have tried.  It is very fresh smelling.",417,13

Let's see how this measures up.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This wheatgrass powder is freeze dried.  It comes in a re-sealable bag which has a measuring cup inside.  It is a nice green color and smells nice, not as awful as some wheatgrass that I have used in the past in powder form.<br /><br />HOW DO I USE THIS?<br />I have a little cordless blender which is a handheld one for one serving.  I put a cup of cold water in my blender and a scoop full of powder in with it.  I blend one or two cycles to make sure the lumps are gone and then I drink it.<br /><br />FLAVOR?<br />This is not as good as fresh wheatgrass juice, but it is helpful to get fresh green juice into my diet.  It is not like dried grass like some other wheatgrass powders I have used which don't taste too great.  This one tastes a bit greener, if that makes sense.<br /><br />HOW SOON TO USE IT UP?<br />Because this is freeze dried, I opt to put it into a glass jar with oxygen absorbers to seal it when not in use.  Freeze dried powder is important to either use up quickly (like a month or two) or seal it up as I have explained.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a good substitute for fresh wheatgrass if you have not got that option, this powder is handy.  I find it helpful to use in my personal cordless blender to boost energy and get green juice into my diet when fresh is not available.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars.  One of the better wheatgrass powders I have tried over the years.  I would buy it again.",417,13

Ashwagandha has been a good way for many people to help deal with stress.  Let's see how this supplement has helped with that.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This powder comes in a resealable container with a measure scoop.  The powder is raw powdered herb.  The package says that this is often used for managing stress and supporting virility.  Let's see how this performed.<br /><br />HOW DID WE USE THIS?<br />I put this in my smoothie a few times a week when I make them in the morning.  I have to say that I did see an increased ability to handle stress and also it did seem to boost virility too.<br /><br />IS IT EFFECTIVE?<br />So far I am seeing a definite improvement in both things as laid out on the package.<br /><br />TASTE/SMELL?<br />The smell and taste are not bad at all.  The taste is slightly bitter but not bad at all.

We tend to eat more healthy around my house, so this looked really intriguing to me.  Let's see how it performed..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS POWDER LIKE?<br />This powder is green and comes in a foil re-sealed package.  It also comes with a little scoop to measure with.<br /><br />ODOR?<br />This has very little odor.<br /><br />TASTE?<br />This does taste like gooseberries without the severe tart twist that our bushes of gooseberries have.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT PERFORM IN SMOOTHIES?<br />I find that using a scoop in a Vitamix sized smoothie is not enough to alter the taste so much that people won't drink it.  This powder ads a bit of a twist to the smoothie that I find refreshing.  It is not that bad and if I dip my finger in the powder and eat it, it is almost a buttery slightly tart feeling.<br /><br />ANY REACTIONS?<br />We have had no bad reactions to this.  As for vitamin C, in the winter, I love having this available to put in smoothies as Vitamin C tends to be REALLY sour in nature.  This is far nicer to have.  Keep in mind it is only a tiny bit of Vitamin C and not therapeutic amounts.  This is not for battling sickness.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a nice natural additive to smoothies or other foods that increase nutritional content but don't overwhelm taste, this is a nice powder.  I have enjoyed using it for quite a few weeks now.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />I am giving this four stars.  It is pleasant tasting and not overwhelming and I like including it in smoothies.",417,13

The base of the shoe where the ball of the foot is, can be too thin and it can be hard on the feet.  These pads do seem to help, but let's take a closer look.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE PADS LIKE?<br />These pads are for the ball of the foot.  They have a place for the area under the toes so you know where to put them.  The backing is a type which will hold into place pretty well.  It can be washed and reused.  The cushion has some flock on it which keeps it soft instead of overly rubbery.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE PERFORM?<br />So far, I have a pair on one of my shoes.  The pad did make the shoe slightly tighter, but that pair had the room.  If the shoes are really fitted, they could make it too tight.  The pad did not seem to slide around that much and so far they have been good. If I am not careful, however, they will slide.<br /><br />FUTURE UPDATES?<br />I will continue to test them in other shoes, however and update my review if I have anything to add.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For reusable pads for the ball of the foot in some shoes that just are too hard, these are nice.

4.0,1628656639564,"Delicious taste, optimal dosage per gummy of vitamin D3","PROS<br /><br />1. Delicious taste.<br />2. Excellent ingredients.<br />3. Vegan, with no gelatin.<br />4. Less sticky than candy gummies (but you still need to thoroughly brush your teeth after chewing these).<br />5. At a dose of 1000 IU per gummy, you can easily titrate your dosage to a preferred dose (see below).<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1. This is an extremely expensive way to take vitamin D3. However, the price of these gummy vitamins is fairly typical. All gummy vitamins are exorbitantly expensive. I typically use gel capsule versions of D3 from either Solgar, Jarrow, Viva or Life Extension, which is much cheaper than these gummies.<br /><br />GENERAL INFORMATION ON VITAMIN D3<br /><br />Vitamin D3 is the most bioavailable form of vitamin D, which is well known by both alternative and mainstream medical practitioners to have bone-protective properties. There are varying opinions on how much D3 to take. As you can see, this product has 1000 IU per gummy. My own alternative healthcare provider has vacillated over the years between recommending a dose of 1000 IU per day, to 2000 IU, to up to 5000 IU. I personally take between 1000-5000 IU per day depending on the time of year.<br /><br />If you are concerned about a possible danger of overdose of vitamin D, note that the body itself produces up to 20,000 IU of vitamin D after just 20 minutes of unprotected sun exposure in the summer, with no ill effects. However, for those embarking on a dosage of more than 1000 IU daily, if you wish to be extremely careful, and you have money to burn (because your insurance won’t pay for it), you can do it under a doctor's supervision. You do this by having the doctor regularly test your blood levels of vitamin D by ordering the 25-hydroxy vitamin D blood test, abbreviated as ""25(OH)D."" This is touted as the most reliable test of vitamin D status. Optimal levels of vitamin D in the blood range between 50 and 70 ng/mL.<br /><br />Of course, if you are willing to allow yourself a few minutes of sun exposure in the summer, you can get all the vitamin D you need that way during that time of year. However, in the winter, the angle of the sun is such that if you don't live quite near the equator, the body produces inadequate vitamin D when exposed to the sun--not to mention that very little of the skin is exposed to the sun when it is severely cold outside.<br /><br />Research has discovered that Americans as a whole are dangerously deficient in vitamin D, especially during winter months. The body's ability to produce vitamin D naturally also declines with age.<br /><br />In addition to its well-known benefit of protecting bones, vitamin D encourages the body to produce substances called cathelicidins which destroy viruses, bacteria, and other microbes, which is why vitamin D increases resistance to colds and flu. Research has shown that people who take cod liver oil, which is high in vitamin D, lower their risk for respiratory infections of all kinds. (Apparently this 19th Century cure-all actually was a viable home remedy.)<br /><br />The risks associated with suboptimal blood levels of vitamin D are many, including: high blood pressure, increased cancer risk, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity. The benefits of supplementation and the risks of deficiencies of vitamin D increase as we age. In particular, in senior citizens vitamin D deficiency is linked with generalized bodily weakness, an increased possibility of developing macular degeneration, and a 2.5 times greater risk of death. In contrast, research has indicated that supplementing with vitamin D decreases the risk of developing cancer of the colon, lungs, and breast. It also improves balance in old people--which is a great thing since older people are at substantial risk of death from a fall. It also improves mood, and as such is a natural treatment for depression (it is well known that depression rates increase in winter due to lesser amounts of sunlight). Studies have shown vitamin D improves symptoms of all kinds of autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis, and that it can relieve the pain of fibromyalgia.<br /><br />During flu season, vitamin D3 can help keep you from getting sick or lessen the duration of bouts of colds, sore throats or flu. My healthcare provider recommended to me taking as much as 10,000 IU on a day I begin to get a cold or flu. I've been on this supplement for years, along with 2000 IU of vitamin C daily, and haven't had a cold or flu since.<br /><br />There have been many, many scientific studies on the health benefits of vitamin D3 over the years.

This product contains 8 billion CFUs per a 2-capsule serving. CFU stands for colony forming units. It is a scientific term of measurement of viable probiotic cells. As a general rule, 1 billion CFUs is the minimum dose a probiotic supplement should contain because the recommended daily dose for both children and adults is between 1-10 billion CFUs. The manufacturer’s recommended dose of 2 capsules per day (making 60 capsules a one-month supply) for this supplement is well within that recommended range for a daily dose. In fact, you could easily get by with taking only 1 of these capsules per day, which would make this product last for two months.<br /><br />2. This product contains a combination of four different probiotic strains. (See below for information on these probiotics.)<br /><br />3. This product contains the well known and well studied prebiotics, FOS and acacia fiber, which feed the healthy bacteria included in this supplement.<br /><br />4. This product is described as having NGProbiome® delivery technology. It is billed as being a type of enteric coating (see Kapoor and Long below on the importance of enteric coating) which is acid resistant and pH sensitive. This is crucial, because otherwise stomach acid would simply wipe out all the expensive, healthy bacteria in this product.<br /><br />5. This product is vegan.<br /><br />6.

Their extremely bare-bones website states that they primarily deal in cosmetics, and yet there are only two products listed for sale on their site, this one and a combo supplement of D3 + K2. There is no information on the company itself other than their address, phone number and email. While they are on Facebook and YouTube, the company is not listed with the Better Business Bureau or Dun & Bradstreet. There is no way to know for sure where and how their products are manufactured just looking at their website. However, I did find one useful clue in the description of this product—the “NGProbiome® delivery technology” for the enteric coating of these capsules—that ultimately led me to the actual manufacturer of this product. The company that created this “technology” is Natura-Genics Labs (NGL). NGL is listed with Dun & Bradstreet, but it is not listed with the Better Business Bureau. NGL specialize in probiotics. It is located in Chino, California and advertises itself as a source for any small, nutraceutical company, such as Etana Beauty, to purchase probiotics from NGL. This involves NGL putting that company’s name on the product label. NGL has scientists on staff and appears to manufacture all its probiotics at their facility in California. They are a member of the Natural Products Association, and they are certified CCOF (California Certified Organic Farmers), GMP, USDA organic, Kosher, and non-GMO. The company websites states it has been in business for two decades. It is listed as a government contractor on the USA Opps website, under the categories of Medicinal and Botanical Manufacturing, Pharmaceutical Preparation Manufacturing, and Miscellaneous Food Manufacturing.<br /><br />CONS OF THIS PRODUCT<br /><br />1. Natura-Genics, Inc. was sued in July, 2016, by the Environmental Research Center, as Green Wealth, Inc. dba Natura-Genics, pursuant to alleged violation of California’s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 AKA Proposition 65, for non-permissible amounts of lead in all of their products. Like many other food and supplement products manufactured in California, they were required to put a warning label on all their products. It wasn’t clear from the court filing exactly how much lead the products supposedly contain or what the source of the lead might be.<br /><br />AN ALTERNATIVE TO EXPENSIVE PROBIOTICS LIKE THIS ONE<br /><br />Hundreds of scientific studies (see: Tomova, Glick-Bauer, and Salonen below) have revealed that the most powerful way one can enhance the beneficial bacteria in the colon is not by taking a supplement such as this one. It is to avoid animal products and become a vegan, or at the very least a vegetarian. Animal products, especially red meat, have a well documented toxic effect on the colon, in particular, increasing the risk of colon cancer. (See Aykan and Vulcan below.) In addition, non-organic meat products are laced with antibiotics, which act to kill off the beneficial flora in the colon. (See Martin below.) In contrast, a diet filled with an abundance of high-fiber fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes has an extremely healthy impact on the colon.<br /><br />The purpose of taking probiotics is to, hopefully, promote the healthy functioning of beneficial bacteria within the colon, which are collectively called the “microbiome” or “microbiota” or “microflora.” The microflora in the colon have a primary task of fermentation, which is the enzymatic decomposition and utilization of carbohydrates, particularly dietary fiber. (See Williams below.) During the process of fermenting fiber, these microflora release short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, and also bacteriocins. (See Silva below.) SCFA serve multiple important functions: (a) They are a major source of energy for colon cells. (b) Along with the above mentioned bacteriocins, they provide an antibacterial function, which stabilizes the normal, healthy microflora population in the colon by preventing the implantation of pathogens in the walls of the colon. (c) They play a key role in the regulation of the neuro-immuno-endocrine system. Research has indicated that the nervous system, immune system, and endocrine system are anatomically and functionally interconnected. What affects one system also affects the other two when their homeostasis (a healthy state of stability and proper function) is disturbed by inflammation, stress, or infection. When the microflora in the colon are operating at peak efficiency, producing adequate SCFA, then the healthy functioning of the nervous system, immune system, and endocrine system is enhanced. But in the reverse, if the microflora in the colon are not efficiently producing SCFA, then those three crucial systems in the body are negatively impacted.<br /><br />EXPLANATION OF PROBIOTICS INCLUDED IN THIS SUPPLEMENT<br /><br />Propionibacterium freudenreichii: This bacterium is typically used in the production of cheese, in particular Swiss cheese. It is commonly found in dairy products and has also been extracted from soil. There has been some recent scientific research into its use in probiotics.<br /><br />Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. Acidophilus). This beneficial bacteria creates lactic acid by breaking down carbohydrates, particularly the lactose in milk. Lactobacilli grow well in milk and foods made from milk. This bacteria serves much the same function as the enzyme lactase.<br /><br />Lactobacillus paracasei (L. paracasei): During the past decade, research has indicated that L. paracasei is a bacterium that has probiotic properties, mainly due to the fact that it is a normal constituent of the human gut microbiota. Researchers have found it useful in treating ulcerative colitis, leaky gut, inflammation, and dementia.<br /><br />Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis). Bifidobacterium lactis and Bifidobacterium animalis used to be scientifically designated as two distinct species. Presently, however, both are considered to be B. animalis. Currently, probiotic companies have not caught up with this development and are still listing this bacterium as B. lactis on their product labels.<br /><br />RESEARCH<br /><br />Ahmed, Z., et al.

4.0,1610075101053,Comfortable fit and good sound reduction,"I realize that the seller, in all honesty, advertises these earplugs as being disposable. That is, the seller recommends that the buyer use these ear plugs once only, and then throw them away. This is a fairly expensive way to use earplugs, and also rather inconvenient, because it means you need to keep regularly purchasing more of them. Personally, I have found, as is the case for other foam ear plugs I have used over the years, that these ear plugs can be washed and reused multiple times before they start to crack. Only then, in my opinion, is it truly necessary to discard them. I have attached a photo to show what it looks like when they crack.<br /><br />I make it a point, when washing these ear plugs with soap and water, to rinse them well, then pat and squeeze them thoroughly with a towel and let them air dry for at least 24 hours before using them again.<br /><br />Unlike other similar quality earplugs I own, when I wash these, they expand and get bigger. Fortunately, though, they don't seem to fit any tighter or more uncomfortably because of that expansion. I have attached a photo with a picture of one of these earplugs when new side-by-side with one that has been washed, as well as two other brands of earplugs I use that do not expand at all when washed and last a whole lot longer than these do over time.<br /><br />These aren't the least expensive ear plugs I have ever purchased, but they are reasonably priced for what is on offer.",874,1363
4.0,1581163982744,Non-vegetarian supplement made in the USA,"QGel is made in the USA but, unfortunately, it contains gelatin, which is not vegetarian or vegan. It is manufactured in a certified Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility and is laboratory tested and approved for guaranteed potency and purity.<br /><br />This supplement indicates that it contains both vitamin E as alpha tocopherol and CoQ10 AKA ubidecarenone AKA ubiquinone. CoQ10 is a biologically active compound similar in its chemical structure to vitamins K and E. Research has indicated that CoQ10 and vitamin E work synergistically as powerful antioxidants, exponentially multiplying the positive benefits of each. (See reference below.)<br /><br />This supplement also includes lecithin, which additionally helps improve the bioavailability of CoQ10. (See reference below.)<br /><br />CoQ10 is particularly well known for its function within cells in the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cascade, a crucial aspect of energy production within the body. Because cellular functions are dependent on an adequate supply of ATP, CoQ10 is crucial to the maintenance of health in virtually all tissues and organs in the human body. (See reference below.)<br /><br />CoQ10 is of particular benefit for cardiovascular health, especially for heart patients who have been prescribed statins, which have long been known to dangerously decrease levels of CoQ10 in the body. Symptoms of low levels of CoQ10 due to statins can include: muscle weakness and fatigue, high blood pressure, and mental fog. In the extreme, symptoms can include chest pain, heart failure, and seizures.<br /><br />CoQ10 has also been found helpful in the treatment of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, no doubt because of its raising of ATP levels in the body, as described above.<br /><br />Research has found that selenium makes an important contribution to the body's processing of CoQ10 in that it is required in order for the body to fully utilize CoQ10. (See reference below.) However, selenium is not included in this supplement. Therefore, it is a good idea for anyone hoping to maximize absorption of a CoQ10 supplement such as this one to add a selenium supplement to their nutraceutical regimen.<br /><br />Because it is fat-soluble, it is recommended to ingest CoQ10 with a meal that contains fat and to take it at a dose of 30-200 mg per day. The dosage of this supplement is 100 mg per each softgel. That is a pretty standard dosage for persons such as myself who take it to promote good health and not for a specific health condition.<br /><br />RELEVANT RESEARCH<br /><br />Alehagen U, et al.

5.0,1579163862730,Cost-effective source of an organic superfood,"Barley grass has been well known as a superfood for at least 30 years, which is when I was first introduced to it and began taking it. Some of the well documented health benefits of barley grass include:<br /><br />--It is a source of high quality protein, vitamins and minerals.<br />--It is filled with chlorophyll, which is a powerful antioxidant. As such, it is very helpful in controlling or preventing many diseases, due to enhancing immune function. Some of these diseases include: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, inflammation and diseases impacted by inflammation.<br /><br />Barley grass powder is similar to wheatgrass powder as to its health benefits, and both tend to be quite expensive. Buying this organic green superfood in bulk from this vendor is a cost-effective way of obtaining this wonderful supplement.",874,813
2.0,1540547612327,"Tastes okay, but not very healthy","The taste of this meal-replacement powder is palatable. It also mixes well, and as advertised, it is very filling.<br /><br />If you are used to supplementing your diet with vegan protein powder, it is important to note that this product is not the same thing. It has about three times the calories of vegan protein powder (such as plain, unadulterated, organic, rice protein powder) for about the same amount of protein, and a lot of other ingredients as well. Two rounded scoops have 400 calories. They provide 20 grams of fat (about 1/2 the average, daily allotment of fat calories), 41 grams of carbohydrates (with 15 grams of sugar and 6 grams of fiber, which is 1/5 the daily fiber requirement), and 20 grams of protein (about 1/3 to 1/2 of the daily requirement for protein).<br /><br />This expensive product is advertised as being a healthfood and, on the surface, it has some of the elements of a healthy product, including vitamins and minerals. However, for my money, as a frugal and health-conscious consumer, it has too many issues to deserve to be called healthy.<br /><br />First, this product is NOT organic, and its protein content comes entirely from soy. Over 93% of non-organic soybeans grown in the USA are GMO. There is a similar problem with non-organic canola oil. Since 1995, the notorious chemical giant, Monsanto, has been consistently genetically modifying rapeseeds, the source of canola oil, until currently about 90% of the world's canola crop is GMO. (The leading producers of rapeseed include the European Union, Canada, China, India, and Australia. The USA is the largest importer of rapeseed in the world and receives the bulk of its rapeseed from Canada.) Note that, if organic, canola oil is not a bad choice in and of itself. It consists mostly of healthy monounsaturated fat (61%, which is almost as much as olive oil) and a relatively low percentage of unhealthy polyunsaturated fats (32%). It contains a relatively small amount (7%) of saturated fats.<br /><br />Second, in and of itself, even if organic, soy can have a negative impact on the thyroid, particularly in women. So it is not a good idea to consume soy products, such as this one, on a regular basis.<br /><br />Third, this product contains the artificial sweetener, sucralose. Health conscious individuals avoid it because there are strong indications that it can reduce beneficial gut microflora. It is also harmful to the liver, kidneys, thymus and lymph nodes. For these reasons, it should rarely, if ever, be ingested, making it a bad idea to include it in a product such as this, which is intended for frequent consumption.<br /><br />Fourth, I try to avoid products which include natural flavor. The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.<br /><br />Rather than using this product, I think it would be cheaper, healthier, and definitely safer, to simply take a multivitamin pill and drink some plain protein powder in water, juice or in a smoothie and consume healthy, organic fats, such as coconut oil, nuts or olive oil, rather than the GMO canola oil in this product. I certainly would not consider buying this product again.<br /><br />Ingredients: Soy protein isolate, high oleic canola oil, maltodextrin, isomaltulose, soluble corn fiber, modified food starch, potassium chloride, magnesium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, soy lecithin, dipotassium phosphate, mono & diglylceride, salt, choline chloride, natural flavor, xanthan gum, sodium ascorbate, mixed tocopherol, DL-alpha tocopheryl acetate, ferrous gluconate, zinc sulfate, D-calcium pantothenate, niacinamide, sucralose, thiamine hydrochloride, copper gluconate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, manganese sulfate, riboflavin, vitamin A palmitate, potassium iodide, chromium chloride, biotin, folic acid, sodium molybdate, phytonadione, sodium selenite, vitamine D2, vitamin B12.",874,610

4.0,1578256401062,"Works on my pain, but not sleep-inducing","Using hemp products is a bit of a crap shoot because you're never quite sure if the product is going to have any effect on your condition.  So I'm giving a (cautious) thumbs up for this because I've been using it with great success on an inflamed muscle in my leg.  I didn't expect it to work this well; I tried it because when I test a product I put it through all sorts of paces.<br /><br />What I found was that within about 5 minutes of application, the pain in my leg and backside had eased considerably.  It didn't go away entirely, that required the addition of some NSAIDs. But it did make the discomfort manageable, which is a blessing.  When I tried this as a sleep aid, it did nothing for me.  Results on a headache were mixed.  I will say that some advice I was given - always look for hemp products that are CO2 extracted - was good advice because I find such products to be across-the-boards more effective than any others.<br /><br />What can I take away from these experiments? Mostly what I take from most such experiments: We are all different, and products like this, which are created without set standards, will inevitably vary.

So, that ended my makeshift bath option.<br /><br />Seeing these, and remembering that, I decided to snag them.<br /><br />🧼 They are thick, about 4x thicker than the baby wipes we like (Huggies natural care)<br /><br />🧼 They do have some suds<br /><br />🧼 They are easily discarded<br /><br />Do they clean?<br /><br />Well, I decided to test them on the dirtiest part of my body – MY FEET. I wear my flip-flops a lot, and since the shoes are black – you can well imagine how dirty my feet could get. Add in stepping outside for bit here or there or driving without shoes (which, yes it is legal) – my feet can get nasty fast.<br /><br />Which, in that case – PERFECT test for these wipes.<br /><br />My feet are a size 7 – I say that so you can gauge how big my feet are in relation to how well these worked.<br /><br />After getting them wet – not a lot of suds. Okay …<br /><br />I wet my feet first and scrubbed them with this pad. It isn’t scratchy, but it isn’t soft either. The dirt came off and I splash rinsed before drying my feet. One “towel” did both feet, but no suds were left after. I threw the towel away and was satisfied.<br /><br />It didn’t dry my feet out the way other soaps do – that was good.<br /><br />Would I trust ONE for my entire “larger” body – NO. Not at all. I would definitely need at least one for my back, one for the back of my legs, at least three for my front region, and perhaps one for my arms.<br /><br />Total: at least six (6) wipes. As there are only 30 in this pack – not a great value at all. I did better with cheaper baby wipes. In addition, I’m not sold on the “no-rinse” deal.<br /><br />These are not something I’d get again, and I honestly don’t recommend them.",1068,471

I'm currently wearing a brace on my  knee and from all day wearing it, my skin is extremely dry when I take it off and I put this on and no more dry skin.  The pump is nice and works well.  If you put this on right after a shower, you will smell the cherry during the day especially if you sweat or get overheated.  I really like this scent and of course really like this lotion.  It reminds me very much of Aveeno.  For a long time, Aveeno was my lotion of choice.  It didn't make my hands greasy and absorbs and it is a nice product but this one is just like it and for less.

If you have a larger face, the small ear loops might not be a positive.<br /><br />The masks have the expected nose clip, but above the nose clip, the masks have a V-shaped cutout. In theory, the V-shaped cutout should help the top of the mask fit better against the sides of your nose, since it’s not a straight line like most masks.

I believe it might be mislabeled, but it doesn't matter because this product is very good. You spritz it on to the stain and work it into the fabric. After letting it sit for a couple of minutes, run water through the fabric or blot with a wet cloth.<br />I found that with most stains I had to do that twice, but on the good side it's clear that this is safe for a lot of hand washables, as long as you are gentle and don't rub the stain too hard.<br /><br />I've had those big commercial brands of stain removers make things worse by fading the area that you spray them in. That was not the case with this product. It might not be as effective, but it's not going to damage your clothes. If you have something delicate and/or your clothes are a huge investment, invest in this product as well.<br />Another plus is that the 2 oz spray is good for travel.<br /><br />So, this might be a product that you need, or another one might be best for you.

5.0,1612452749977,Beauty and More!,"Right off the bat, when tasting this, I was rejoicing that it wasn't too sweet. Many products of this nature have stevia or monk fruit, which not only have an aftertaste, but they use so much that the sweetness is cloying.<br />Not only is this product not super sweet, but it has just a little sweetness that occurs naturally from the organic berry powders.<br />And speaking of berries, what a powerhouse! In addition to beets and chaga mushrooms, you have the superfruit goji, maqui, and acai.<br />Since berries are on the hot list of being highly contaminated with pesticides, this is a product you can feel great about because all but the collagen peptides are organic.<br /><br />I love that I can just sprinkle it into my yogurt or oatmeal, as well as mixing it with a liquid. It tastes slightly sweet, slightly earthy. It gives a nice flavor to unsweetened yogurt especially if it's sprinkled with nuts. Perfect healthy breakfast.<br />And only 25 calories for a tablespoon!<br />The formulation is geared for beauty, and by now we all know the benefit of collagen when it comes to skin.

At least for me. I know a lot of people will appreciate the sweetness because this is a product you can mix in just water. As an aside, personally I'd rather not have the oft used stevia either. If they insist on it being sweet, a bit of organic sugar would make it taste more natural, and I wouldn't mind the extra calories.<br /> It makes a very nice hot cocoa type of beverage. Even in water, it tastes creamy.<br />Another thing I like is that there is no plastic scoop hiding under the powder. Thumbs up for friendlier packaging.<br />Something else to like is the bottom of the canister which has both the date of manufacturer as well as expiration date.

There are two sides, one for your wash water and one that is dry. You dunk your mop in the wash water, there is a squeegee like thing on the side that the mop head scrapes against to get the water off and the second chamber squishes out even more water. I would like that second part to be a between mopping and dunking so you aren't just getting your water dirty and dunking your mop in dirty water again. The squeezing out of the water keeps the mop head pretty dry and your floors dry quickly. The squeegee tool also makes it so you don't have to touch the mop head which is great. There isn't anything scratchy on the pad, which is good, but I wish there was a spot for dried on stains. I try to spot treat those and pick them up later. The handle is unfortunate and pops out of place, which makes carrying the bucket precarious, even though it is light it can pull the handle out of it's notch.

The whitening cycle times vary from 30-45 minutes with the requirement not to eat or drink one hour afterwards. The whitening light machine shuts off every 10 minutes on the dot, as if to remind not to leave it in too long. First time my teeth felt tingly and slightly cool, but then nothing out of ordinary happened.

It advertises to use it in coffee as a creamer substitute.  It just isn't as good as almond milk.  Or really real milk or cream.  I'm trying to use less animal products, but it can be difficult when the substitutes are just not the right consistency.  And I drink strong coffee.<br /><br />It does have a nice coconut flavor. I think if you think of it as a way to have coconut milk without keeping coconut milk around, it is very usable.  Kind of like nonfat dried milk.  Good to use in recipes.  Maybe smoothies?  But not as coffee creamer.",1177,13
3.0,1671286272059,Lightweight Pain Relief - Not That Impressed,"This pain relief cream from the appropriately named ""Dr. Paine"" didn't work that well for me. There is a slight menthol scent and the lotion is absorbed quickly without leaving much residue, which is a good thing. However, it seems ineffective for strong back pain. For some reason I associate strong smelling creams with higher potency - since this one is mild, it doesn't seem to have much impact. The positive thing is that you can apply the cream and go out without someone noticing a strong scent. However, I prefer Ben Gay for providing stronger pain relief. This one is just Meh.",1213,806

2.0,1623980758203,Unintentionally Hilarious Sound Machine with Weird Sounds,"This is one of those odd products that were clearly made by some tone-deaf, perhaps mom and pop company in China. I normally don't associate ""mom and pop"" with Chinese-made products, but the range of quirky sounds that come out of this sound machine have a ""homemade"" quality that are bizarre, to say the least.<br /><br />This machine boasts supposedly 48 sounds, more than most sound machines. Unfortunately it includes a number of sounds that I have a hard time believing would help me sleep. There is something called ASMR which is the science of producing soothing, repetitive sounds that cause a tingly or comforting sensation in the listener. However, someone seems to have misread the concept, for the ""ASMR"" section of this machine includes the sound of someone moving furniture around, swallowing and then gurgling water loudly, and munching a bag of potato chips.<br /><br />In addition, there are weird combinations of sounds - instead of a crackling fire, it has a crackling fire while music plays in the background (as if you were inside a restaurant) and the murmuring of people chatting and moving around in a coffee shop. If I wanted sounds like this, I would just keep the TV on all night.<br /><br />To top it off, the ""music"" function includes lullabies sung in English by a Chinese woman with a thick accent. She sings ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" but her English is so bad it sounds like ""Tinkle Tinkle Litto Star."" It's followed by her off-key rendition of ""You Are My Sunshine"" with a breathless voice that reminds me of a bad karaoke session.<br /><br />Then there are the lights, which I could not for the life of me figure out how to control. It has a light on the bottom and a light on the top. It seems almost entirely random which light goes on and off and I had a hard time dimming or turning off either light.<br /><br />The controls require some pressure or strong tapping in order to work, so this would be frustrating for someone used to sensitive controls or an elderly person with limited finger strength.<br /><br />I like the fact that the display shows the temperature and humidity, but there is no clock setting.<br /><br />While it does have the usual quotient of sounds (ocean waves, birds chirping in a forest, etc.), even these sounds lack sharpness and comes across as rough (just like everything else about this machine). Because of the bizarre sounds, however, I wouldn't feel comfortable gifting this to anyone unless I made it clear it was a gag gift.",1213,1783
3.0,1622411049497,Alexa-Like Voice But Button Responsiveness Weak and Some Crude Sounds,"The best part of this sound machine is that an Alexa-type voice speaks to you as you set the timer: ""15 minutes."" Press button. ""30 Minutes."" ""60 minutes"" etc. It has a soft foreign accent that I can't place but it's cute. Most sound machines don't have a human voice saying anything. I guess it's needed because there are no light buttons to tell you which setting you're choosing.<br /><br />Except for this, I felt this device feels cheaply made. The casing feels cheap (hard, brittle plastic) and the buttons on the interface are not sensitive to touch. You have to press really hard sometimes to get it to change settings. The volume control is also confusing - there are actually two volume controls - one to raise the volume, one to lower. I was pressing one volume control (the loud one) thinking that I could lower it but I was mistaken - you have to press the ""low volume"" button.<br /><br />On the positive side, the night light works well - the colors are neon bright and you can keep a steady color going all night long OR cycle through the different colors. The timer like I said has a human voice, which is kind of cool. The weak parts are the button responsiveness and some of the sounds. The lullaby function is good and the sound is sharp and clear. The Nature sounds are relatively good - the best are the chirping bird sounds and thunderstorm but the ""water"" sounds (i.e., ocean, babbling brook) sound muffled and are not particularly sharp. The ""white noise"" is also kind of indistinct and the ""fetal heartbeat"" sound is just plain crude - not so much a heartbeat but like someone else noted, it's like banging drums.<br /><br />So...it's a serviceable device but I would not pay too much for this. There are so many better ones out there.",1213,1773

The small bottle is handy for travel, however, so it's good for when you're on the go. Overall it's good for mild stains that just happened and you don't have anything else on hand.

4.0,1615472711051,Decent Fractionated Coconut Oil for Making Homemade Haircare and Body Products,"Fractionated Coconut Oil is good for making homemade soaps and beauty products but it's less potent for hair and body care use - I find the formula thinner but the trade off is that it isn't as greasy and you can still use it for moisturizing your hair and skin without that greasy coconut oil feeling (which stains too!). I have both kinds of oil - the real unprocessed kind for massaging into my hair, hands and nails, and this kind, which is versatile but lacks the smell of coconut but is good as a ""carrier"" oil. Both have their uses and this product is of decent quality - I would just go by price because I don't see any discernible difference between this one and other similarly priced brands of fractionated oil.",1213,1786

The design is generic enough to be used for all kinds of occasions such as weddings, birthdays, baby showers, etc. It also looks like the type of bag a store might use, so if you own a small business, these would also be good for giving to customers. The bag is reasonably sturdy, like a bag from a boutique, and the handles are decent. Overall these are good quality bags but the price seems a little high - it's too bad it doesn't come with gold colored tissue paper, but if you add them yourself you can make them look luxe.",1213,38

I love how glittery they are and they come in a variety of colors - silver, gold, rose gold. I love how they look and they are ideal for gifting small items like jewelry.

This impression is solidifed by the fact that the bags come with tags saying ""Thank You' on them. I wish there had been other tags included as well, like ""Seasons Greetings"" or ""Happy Birthday!""

I had to trim these to fit my sneakers but there was no helpful dotted lines to show me how to customize them. I have many other insoles that show you exactly how much to trim if you want to whittle down the size to 7, 8, 9, etc. Here there is nothing.

The toothpaste has a yellowish color and kind of reminds me of lemon filling. It leaves your mouth feeling fairly clean but there is a lightness to this toothpaste that other white and chalky toothpastes (like Crest) don't have.<br /><br />I question whether the lack of fluoride will be effective in the long-term at protecting my recessed gums and preventing plaque from taking hold. I usually use Colgate Total, so only time will tell if this toothpaste will be as effective. I have been brushing it now for only a week, so I will update this review if anything changes.

1.0,1643959253172,A Stylist's View: Not so versatile. Cold temp only on  but high wind speed.,"Update 2/5/22: I tried to give this blow dryer a shot on the highest wind setting at medium heat. Mind you, it normally takes less than 10 minutes to dry my terribly fine thin hair. It didn't even make it halfway through before it crapped out. Dead. The plug didn't shut it off. It just died. With all of its shortcomings and now this, it's a definite no go...<br /><br />2/3/22: This ENISECA 1875 Watt Negative Ionic Hair Dryer is not as versatile as it is made out to be. I was really looking forward to being able to change the temperature and wind settings to my liking. I have fine thin hair, and need a lower speed with hotter temperatures than most blow dryers have. With this blow dryer, it's impossible.<br />The only time you can adjust the temperature is if it's on the highest wind speed, which is totally ridiculous. If you lower the wind speed at all, it goes to the coldest temperature, which is even more ridiculous. I do appreciate being able to change the temperature on the highest wind setting, but I need a lower wind setting and a higher temperature setting than cold. And, I do mean cold.<br />After deciphering the meaning behind this seemingly faulty setting, they make it appear that a lower wind speed should only have low temperatures for children's sake. I didn't buy this blow dryer for a child, I bought it for myself. Furthermore, I would not want to blow dry my child's hair with cold air.<br />This blow dryer could have been a super win all around, but instead it's a flop for me. It's fine if you only blow dry your hair on a medium/high speed at all times, but for those of us who don't or can't do that, it's pretty much useless. Just to note, the highest wind speed setting is not nearly high enough to please those with thick long hair, but it  get extremely hot. This is not my favorite.",1456,2004

Most inexpensive Sandalwood that is sold on the market is actually Amyris (Balsamifera) Essential Oil, better known as West Indian Sandalwood, which smells very similar, but costs much less.<br />This Sandalwood does not smell like Sandalwood, nor does it smell like Amyris. It reminds me more of a middle eastern fragrance oil that is light in nature, and very perfume-like. There are no sweet notes of benzoin or vanilla that dry down to blend with the soft, warm notes that are woodsy and a bit smokey. In fact, this oil is not reminiscent of Sandalwood at all, to my nose. It has more of a feminine perfume like scent.<br />I would definitely search for true Sandalwood, which is extremely expensive, or the much more affordable, Amyris Essential Oil.

There are instructions on how to put it together and how to use it, but it's pretty self-explanatory. Once together, you fill the steamer cup to the max line with hot tap water, add essential oils to a cotton swab and stick it in the aromatherapy bud holder next to the nozzle, if desired, and turn the heat and light on. Within just a few moments, there's a steady stream of steam coming out of the nozzle. It goes a fair distance, but to get the best coverage of your face with the steam, you will want to be about 15 inches below the nozzle.<br />The steam feels really wonderful and relaxing! It runs for about 4 to 5 minutes and really opens your pores to help clean away any impurities.<br />I really like the simplicity of this facial steamer, but would not consider it professional quality. The mechanical portion and cup are made of very lightweight plastic, do not seem extremely durable, and it is very basic in its function. I have been a cosmetologist for over 30 years, and this is more suited for home use.<br />Using this facial steamer is a great way to take care of your skin and a wonderful way to spend time doing some self-care. There's nothing like spending some time a day or two each week and really taking good care of your skin. This facial steamer will help you do that in the comfort of your own home, and save you money at the same time. I'm really enjoying it and would definitely recommend it!",1456,2011

My air fry oven and microwave look brand new again. But, this is not the main reason that I wanted them.<br />A while back, I took on the endeavour of repainting my kitchen and bathroom cabinets. I thought it was going to be a simple job, but it turns out that there's a lot more to it than just a little sanding and painting. It's taking me a while, I'm only halfway through, and I'm on a little break right now, but will be back at it within the next week or so. These towels are going to be great for all the chemicals I'm going to have to use, and all the scrubbing and cleaning I'm going to have to do. Especially, in the bathrooms, as I haven't done any of the prep work in those two rooms, yet.<br />I'm trying to go off memory of the proper steps, so I may miss something. You have to clean your cabinets with a strong special cleaner, then lightly sand them, and then reclean with a 50/50 mixture of water and denatured alcohol. You also have to keep ammonia on hand for some reason, but I can't remember exactly why. This might not be everyone's way, but this is just how I was taught to do it, and it's working well. The job was taxing on me because I didn't have good towels to use. I was using a sponge and paper towels for a good part of it, and they just weren't cutting it. I think there's something in the makeup of these towels that make them clean better and will make my job of prepping my cabinets a lot easier. I'll also need them to wipe away any sanding dust in between coats, and these will leave them lint-free, unlike paper towels.<br />Just from using a few of these to clean my Air fry oven and microwave, I know there's some super special cleaning power in these towels. I know that they will serve me well while doing my cabinet painting jobs. Because of how durable they are and well they last, I'm sure I'll have some left over to do other cleaning jobs around the house. I definitely recommend these towels!",1456,1576

I’ve found they are all quite similar and accomplish the same goal, with only slight variations in design. This one, like most others, is made of a hard foam with just the slightest bit of give when you rest your head on it. It’s possible to use the pillow in either direction, one way providing a more gentle stretch, the other, a more intense stretch. This pillow does not have the bumps and nodes that some others have which are supposed to provide some acupressure and massage to your neck, though I can’t say that they make much of a difference for me. This pillow does, however, have a softer cushion in the center that makes it a little more comfortable on the back of my head. It's a very nice feature.<br /><br />If you’re new to this type of device, go slow. When I first used one of these pillows, I could only lie on it for a few minutes at a time, but have worked my way up to 10-15 minutes twice a day. I also recommend starting with the side that gives you the more gentle stretch. For me, using a device like this has provided quite a lot of relief to my neck and shoulders that tend to carry a lot of tension since I sit at a computer all day.<br /><br />If you’re looking for an alternative to medication for some relief for back and neck pain, this is definitely worth a try.",1483,177

There are also some “pressure nodes” on the device which are really just bumps in the foam but are positioned to provide a bit of acupressure and massage while you’re lying on it. Personally, I don’t notice the bumps, but it’s possible they’re doing their job.<br />If you’re new to this type of neck device, know that it takes a while to get used to it.

At 5’-4”, I think this one fits me better. I’ve had my family members try both, and they had different preferences. My son, who is a foot taller than me at 6’-4” preferred the “harder” one. From that, I have to surmise that being taller, with a longer neck so his head falls back farther, the firmer one is better suited to taller people, but I also have to believe the decision is going to be highly personal.<br />As far as the results, I’m extremely pleased with the noticeable improvement in my neck and shoulder pain. Since I work all day at a computer, I always seem to have tension in my neck. If I take a break and use the traction pillow a couple of times during the day, the relief is immediate.

I know what red light therapy does and how much it helps the body repair itself or increase circulation.<br />This therapy belt is so easy to use.  Comes with velcro strips so I can have it on my belly, around my shoulder, or on my back.  Longer velcro strip for larger areas.  Smaller strip for going around elbows, knees or ankles.<br />I like that it has an automatic 20 minute shut down timer.  This way I know I'm getting the maximum benefit from this therapy belt but not over doing it.  It is comfortable to have on so it's easy to forget I do have it on and running.<br />I'm doing this twice a day as recommended.  I want to see if this will help with my lower back pain.  I know it'll take some time for me to notice any changes in my pain level.<br />This is so great to have!  And to be able to use it on my dogs too.

I rolled it on my lower back about 20 minutes ago.  Within 5 minutes I could feel relief.  How long will the relief last?  Not sure.  It depends on how much activity I do today I'm sure.<br />It's not that expensive.

5.0,1633740465685,Great tens unit,"My old tens unit had just basic settings and intensities.  Plus all pads had to be the same setting.<br />This tens unit is so different and so much better.  First of all it's so much lighter.  Easier to carry around so you can have it working even when I'm driving or working.<br />I can also use 8 pads at one time if I need to.  I may hurt at times but the most pads I need are 4 to cover my sore areas.<br />I'm still learning what all the pictures on the device actually mean.  The best way to learn is by just trying them all out to see what mode is best for you for a certain area and what intensity works the best.<br />My first encounter with a stims unit or called tens unit is at a chiropractors office.  I would feel so good after going through a session.<br />After that I had to have one and purchased my first tens unit about 15 yrs ago.  Haven't been without one since.<br />These are so good with helping with my tension headaches.  I place the pads on my upper back/shoulder blade area.  It really helps loosen the muscles and relieving my headaches.<br />They're also great with lower back pain.  Pads placed on the lower back on each side of my spine and within about 90 mins I am feeling so much better.<br />Driving also makes my back hurt.  I can have the pads on and running while I'm driving which really helps me sit for longer periods so I can drive longer distances.<br />For any muscle ache on any part of your body, minus the chest area, and the relief is priceless.<br />If you've never tried a tens unit, you really should try one out and see how good it feels after using one.<br />I like this unit.

This way your foot won't be lifted so high up that your toes are scraping the top of the shoe.  Since learning that little trick, I love Dr Scholls inserts.<br />So much comfort on the bottom of my feet and it's really helped me with some of my body aches I've been having.<br />I like getting the double pack.

3.0,1667264932442,"Good potency and strain diversity, but high price compared with similar options","No complaints about the formulation of this probiotic. It hits the mark for both potency (25 billion CFUs) and strain diversity (total of 10 strains: 8 Lactobacillus and 2 Bifidobacterium stains). The specific strains are listed on the bottle, but not the specific concentration of each.<br /><br />It delivers the 25 billion CFUs with a serving size of only 1 capsule (2 caps are the more common situation), making this bottle of 30 caps a month's supply.<br /><br />The downside is the price. There are a number of probiotic options that achieve the same (or sometimes better) potency and strain diversity at a far lower price for a month's supply.<br /><br />While the formulation is solid, the very high price puts my rating at 3 stars (average). Equally good options are available that are a much better value.",1501,1546
3.0,1659091580109,"Great resource-saving format, but higher price than similar sheets; non-ideal packaging","This type of cleaning format is outstanding for resource conservation. It comes in sheets that dissolve far more readily and quickly than the tablet format concentrates. The sheets are easy to cut (or tear) if you need a smaller amount for the task.<br /><br />While these sheets are positioned as a floor cleaner (and it works pretty well for that task) they can also be used as a general purpose spray cleaner. I use a sheet for a 32oz bottle, and the spray does a fine job for counters, sinks, and other general cleaning tasks. The scent is reasonably pleasant, but I would have preferred no scent as other sheets offer.<br /><br />There are some cons, however. First, the cost is higher than similar sheet-based concentrates, and the performance is no different than the lower cost options. Second, the packaging is not ideal for sheets. The sheets are somewhat delicate and must be kept totally dry in storage or they will dissolve. The sheets are packaged in a cardboard box in a single clump. Other manufacturers use a plastic box or, if a cardboard box is used, the sheets are divided up into smaller groups.<br /><br />Factoring in the cons puts my score at 3 stars. Although the sheet format is perfect for eliminating plastic waste and is easier to use than the tablet-based format, there are better sheet options available at a lower price.",1501,2097
1.0,1656555294427,"Compact size, but defective right out of the box","This could be a useful mini razor for traveling. I say ""could"" since I can't say how well it shaves -- I was never able to get it to turn on. I initially thought it was shipped with a discharged battery, which is sometimes the case with rechargeable products. However, after letting it charge for a few hours, it still would not turn on. The shaver got rather warm while charging, and the charge indicator light turned on, but those were the only indications of life.<br /><br />The design is something I've not come across before. It's a rotary shaver, but the heads are arranged in a straight line. The heads are smaller than is customary on a rotary. The construction is all plastic and feels rather cheap. Still, it has some nice grip points and feels pretty good in hand. As a travel shaver, the lightweight nature and the smaller size could be plusses.<br /><br />Since it failed to turn on at all, the only rating I can give is 1 star. A shame, since I would have liked to see the shaving performance of the linear-arranged rotary heads.",1501,2098

They are small - the interior dimensions are 3.5 inches by 4 inches, and it's about 1.5 inches deep. It's a good size for items such as jewelry or other similar items. However, the build quality is so poor that these are pretty useless as gift boxes.<br /><br />It folds together like most gift boxes, with the sides held in by adhesive pads. However, the cut accuracy is poor, so the sides don't meet up well with the top (or each other). The magnetic flap will not hold shut. The carboard is thin and doesn't have a substantial feel. Instead of having a box that dresses up what's inside, this box cheapens the contents since it looks and feels so poorly made. And won't even stay shut!<br /><br />The cost is way out of range for such a poorly made gift box. It's not something I would recommend. One star.",1501,179
4.0,1638800069110,Light but effective cooling; less greasy than other options; non-offensive scent,"This is a decent cooling muscle rub. It's a roll-on, so it's easy to apply even on areas such as my lower back. It's far less messy than the creams/lotion formats. It goes on wet but soaks in fairly well, and doesn't leave a greasy residue behind, which is a major plus.<br /><br />The scent is menthol and, while it's clearly noticeable, it's not as strong as other menthol-based rubs I've used. It has more of a minty/menthol scent than a strong menthol-only scent. I would stop short of calling it an enjoyable scent, but it's at least non-offensive.<br /><br />The cooling performance is light but still effective. It takes a few minutes to build up the cooling. The cooling is not as strong or long-lasting as others -- I find that I need to re-apply this more often than other options.. Still, the lack of greasiness, lower odor, and the ease of application balance that out.<br /><br />The addition of hemp seed oil doesn't make a noticeable difference compared with formulations that lack hemp seed oil. That's to be expected since it does not contain CBD, but rather just hemp seed oil. It seems more like a marketing strategy to capitalize on the hemp trend (and justify a higher price) rather than an addition that actually impacts efficacy.<br /><br />The scent, ease of use, and non-greasy nature are all 5 stars; the cooling impact is 4 stars; the price/value is 3 stars. Overall rating of 4 stars.",1501,2100
3.0,1637177390233,OK taste; sticks to teeth; serving size is 3 gummies so not a great value,"These are OK fiber gummies. Each serving provides 5g of fiber, which is decent but not outstanding. Additionally, a serving consists of THREE gummies, so a bottle of 60 will last only 20 days. The taste is fine (sort of a berry-ish flavor mostly) but there's 3g of added sugar per serving (sugar is the second most common ingredient), which is rather high. The consistency is firm bordering on rubbery, and it sticks to my teeth, which is annoying.<br /><br />The fiber is from chicory root which is the usual go-to source for fiber in gummies. It uses natural flavors and natural colors, which is a plus.  The country of manufacture is not listed on the bottle, which can mean that it's not made in the US.<br /><br />Weighing all the factors (taste, formulation, serving size, cost, ease of use) puts my rating at three stars (average). It's not a bad fiber gummy, but it's not outstanding compared with other similar options that are available.",1501,2101
5.0,1627262858619,Very good build quality; better for dry mopping vs wet mopping,"These are well-made mop heads. The microfiber center had zero loose or puckered threads, and the density of the microfiber was nicely dense for good pick-up performance. The fringe around the edge is stitched on well, and also did not have any loose or pulled threads. They fit and work well with many platform mops provided that the mop has Velcro on the underside of the platform to grip the pad.<br /><br />These work very well when dry mopping. The microfiber picks up and holds an impressive amount of dust, pet hair and other similar gunk. The fringe around the edge makes it easy to clean right up to the baseboard or, if used in the kitchen, at the cabinet toe kick area. It also helps ensure that the mop doesn't mar any chair legs or furniture if it gets bumped while mopping.<br /><br />The performance is not as good as a wet mop due to the fringe. That's not a problem specific to these pads, but occurs with any pad that has an outer fringe. It's certainly useable and effective as a wet mop, but a non-fringe mop head usually performs better.<br /><br />The set comes incased in a sealed plastic pouch which keeps them nice and clean during transit, and can also be used to keep them clean in storage.<br /><br />A very good mop head - five stars.",1501,1920

The scent is rather weak compared with other similar sprays I've used, but it is reasonably strong. It's a generic floral scent -- not all that different from a general air freshener type of scent, but not bad. It's certainly better than the odor it helps mitigate.<br /><br />As with other similar sprays, you need to use it before the toilet is used for maximum effectiveness. It has limited benefits if used after the toilet is used. A fair amount is needed (4 or 5 sprays) for good results.<br /><br />Compared with other similar products this is not as potent, and just an average value at best. Three stars.",1501,1175

In fact, if I didn't know it was a pear scent I would have not guessed it from how it smells.<br /><br />It does have some benefit as an odor preventer in the bathroom. The spray is used before the toilet is used, creating a film type of barrier to minimize odor. It does have some effectiveness in that regard, but other similar products I've used have far more scent to them (and a more pleasant scent as well).<br /><br />Since it does provide some benefits, I'll give it 2 stars.

Granted, pretty much any scent is better than the scent this is meant to cover up, but the Sea Salt scent is more floral than I was expecting. It's an OK scent, but not 100% to my liking. The other issue I've had is that the sprayer doesn't always spray properly. Instead of a mist, it sort of splatters the liquid at times, making a bit of a mess unless your aim is perfectly true. It's only happening with one of the containers, so it seems that the sprayer is defective. Given the price point, better quality sprayers should have been used.<br /><br />The scent plus the sprayer issue lowers my score to 4 stars, but it's otherwise a decent product that does what it says it will do.",1501,1188

The price is decent for a one month supply, and even better if you need just 2 (or 1) per day.<br /><br />The capsules are reasonably sized and not difficult to swallow.

3.0,1615515199229,"Works as well as other sensitive toothpastes, but not thrilled with the taste or consistency","This has a 5% concentration of potassium nitrate, which is the ingredient used in all sensitive toothpastes to cut down (or, in my case, eliminate) sensitive teeth issues. As such, it works the same as other sensitive toothpastes.<br /><br />It does differ from others with regard to taste and consistency. It has a mild minty taste that, while acceptable, is not all that fresh tasting. The consistency is a bit softer than other toothpastes and it doesn't foam up as much. While that's usually a plus, good foaming action is a benefit when it comes to sensitive toothpastes since it helps the potassium nitrate get into all the nooks and crannies. My favorite sensitive toothpaste is the Colgate foaming action one. It has the same 5% potassium nitrate as this, but the foaming action does make a difference.<br /><br />While the tube looks big, there's not a lot of product. It's only filled about 1/2 of the way and, while it looks like a standard size tube, it only provides 3.5 oz of toothpaste. It's also hard to get all of it out of the tube since the tube is plastic and does not roll up. It dispenses fine when mostly full, but is not great at dispensing when the level gets low.<br /><br />While this does work, the negatives put my score at 3 stars (average). Not a compelling purchase compared with other options.",1501,987
5.0,1615083211029,Great quality; lots of uses,"These chia seeds are very good quality, with a nice, fresh taste to them and a good crunch. I use a lot of Bob's Red Mill's products, and have always been satisfied with their quality and performance. This is no exception.<br /><br />Chia seeds can be used in numerous ways, and have an excellent nutritional profile. I've been using these mainly as an egg substitute with very good results. Just soak 1 tablespoon of chia seeds in 3 tablespoons of water for 10 min (longer is better) and use it in place of eggs in baked goods. In addition to acting as a binding agent, the seeds provide a very gentle crunch that I find very appealing.<br /><br />The only quibble I have is that the included set of measuring spoons is pretty cheaply made. It's not a reflection on the chia seeds themselves, but it's odd that such a cheap set would be included.<br /><br />That aside, zero complaints. The chia seeds are fresh, tasty, packaged well, and one of those good-for-you foods that actually is appealing to use. Five stars.",1501,2109
4.0,1614885029881,Compact size; lots of sound options; controls could be better,"Overall, this is a pretty good white noise machine. It's very compact, which is a plus since I don't have a lot of bedside table area available. This has a smaller footprint than my last white noise machine, making it also a handy item if you want to take it while traveling.<br /><br />Setup is simple, and there's a good selection of sounds to choose from. I stick with the white noise, but it's nice to have options just to experiment with them to see which work the best. The variety also makes this useful not only for adults, but for infants/children to help them sleep. The sound volume has a good range, and the light feature is also a nice touch, even though it's not something I get much use out of.<br /><br />The main con is the control panel. It's hard to see which control is which, especially in dim light. I would prefer a more traditional button system with nice, clear text labels as to function. Or, better yet, some type of simple remote where the buttons light up. Granted, that would increase the price but the layout presently used can be really frustrating to use.<br /><br />One star down for the control system but otherwise, a very nice compact sound machine.",1501,1773
5.0,1605208284143,Excellent flavor and aroma; nicely packaged,"No complaints about this turmeric powder. The aroma when opening the bag was very rich. The taste was also excellent, and not at all muted as some turmeric's I've used. I use this mainly with rice (or rice substitutes such as wheat berries, couscous, and the like) and both the taste and the strong yellow color make for a tasty dish.<br /><br />I like that, while it is priced similar to a bulk item, it comes in three fairly small (4 oz) bags. That allows for cost savings by buying in bulk, but the smaller packages help maintain the freshness until it's ready to be used.<br /><br />Fresh, tasty and a good value. Hit's all the right marks.",1501,2111
5.0,1600431012853,"Strong enough for re-use; thin, but good absorption","These are excellent towels for certain cleaning tasks. They are thin, but absorb quickly and hold a decent amount of water. They can be rinsed, laid flat to dry, and re-used several times, making them go a lot further than a roll of conventional paper towels.<br /><br />They are ideal for certain cleaning tasks, especially windows, glass, smooth tile and other types of smooth surfaces. They are not, however, all that good for scrubbing or use over a rough surface. They can be used for that, but the roughness will shred the towel making it only good for one use. If used on smooth surfaces, they can be rinsed and re-used multiple times.<br /><br />For me, these are ideal for washing windows. I use a few sheets of these towels with cleaning liquid to get the dirt off the window, then use a single microfiber cloth for a final dry and polish. The used towels are rinsed and set aside to dry for the next task. I can usually get 4 or 5 uses out of a single towel before it starts to shred up.<br /><br />My only quibble is that I don't care for the graphics printed on the towels. They aren't bad looking, just unnecessary. Other than that, no complaints. They work well, last a good amount of time, eliminate the waste of using one-time use paper towels, and are a good value compared to other similar towels (as well compared with  conventional paper towels since one of these towels can take the place of many one-time use paper towels).",1501,226
4.0,1598497788419,Good quality mop; bucket lacks some needed features,"Overall, this is a pretty decent mop and bucket set.  The mop is excellent. The pole is metal, and the sections thread together well. The threaded portion is recessed into each section, making for a very durable, solid connection that won't come apart or loosen when using the mop. The mop head is not threaded, but it has a good quality snap button attachment.  The only mop-related complaint I have is that the point of attachment between the pole and the mop head is plastic. It's a decent quality, thick plastic, but metal would have been nice since that's a strain point on the mop.<br /><br />The mop head covers are of good quality, and attach well with Velcro to the mop head. Two pads are provided in the set. While they can be machine washed, it's better to hand wash them and let them air dry while laid flat. It reduces the wear and tear that the pads get in a washing machine.<br /><br />The bucket design could have been better. It is smaller than another similar product that I have which is actually a positive, since it weighs less when full of water. However, it lacks some key convenience features, such as a pop-open drain at the base. It is also not possible to remove the top to clean out the bucket well after use. The overall build quality of the bucket is somewhat lightweight, especially the handle. It lacks the heft and durability of other similar products.<br /><br />While the bucket issues brings my score to 4 stars, this is still a very good performing set. It's easy to get the mop head into the bucket since the mop head has a spring that allows it to automatically fold vertically so it can be inserted into the bucket. The ""squeegee"" on the dry side does a good job of wringing out the water. The ability to have a wet and a dry side to the bucket makes mopping quicker, easier, and results in a better job.<br /><br />Not perfect, but a decent value for the price.",1501,577
5.0,1593913728810,"Some limitations, but overall a good compostable bag","These are nicely done compostable bags. The material is thick enough to deal with an acceptable load (e.g., full, but not overstuffed full) without breaking. They are sized fine for a 13 gallon container. It would have been nice to have an extra inch or so of length for an even better fit, but as-is I'm finding them to fit without any significant issue provided they are placed carefully when initially put into the can.<br /><br />If you were to compare these to conventional plastic bags with regard to strength, ability to stretch and puncture resistance, these would clearly come up short. But they are not plastic bags, they are compostable bags. On that basis, they are very well done, with enough strength to be useful but still retain the ability to break down.<br /><br />They come on a single roll with perforations between each bag. I've not had any problems tearing off the bags without damaging them. There are no ties, either provided separately or built into the top of the bag. Again, that's not a con since these are compostable rather than traditional bags.<br /><br />Very helpful to have when dealing with compostable material or even run-of-the-mill trash.  Well worth considering if you need a compostable bag in a larger size.",1501,504
5.0,1533922008069,Same Ziploc quality with a fun touch,"There's no difference between the quality of these bags and the usual Ziploc bags, which is a pro -- I've found Ziploc bags to last the longest, and seal better than other brands. The Packers logo and color add a fun touch. The graphics are well done, colorful, and stand out well. There's some added cost to having the branding, but it makes what is normally a boring bag something that stands out.",1501,240
5.0,1532029257999,Identical to the name brand; lots of uses throughout the house,"I can't tell the difference between this and the name brand (Vaseline) with regard to consistency, performance or any other factor. While generics sometimes are of lesser quality than the name brands, this is one of those cases where the generic is identical to the name brand, other than price.<br /><br />The uses for petroleum jelly are just about endless. In addition to the customary use as a skin protector/soothing agent/moisturizer, it's great to have a tub of this at hand in the workshop for tasks such as lubricating o-rings or gaskets (or as a general lubricant for about anything). It's also great for sealing out moisture and keeping tools, such as gardening tools or mower blades, rust-free in the off season when they are not getting used.",1501,120
5.0,1494813225000,The best tasting way to take probiotics,"I've been using probiotics for years and have appreciated the benefits. This version didn't offer any significantly different benefits in terms of probiotic activity for me, but it does come with one big plus: they taste great!<br /><br />I normally use pills for probiotics since the chews I've tried were not all that appealing in terms of taste. These are much different -- they are round balls about the same size as a typical malted milk ball. It has a waxy coating so it does not melt in your hand. The dark chocolate taste is excellent. It does not have the same texture as actual chocolate (it's a bit more grainy), but it is very tasty.<br /><br />Probiotics are great to keep everything running smoothly in your gut, and this is the best tasting option I've come across. The only downside is that the cost per dose is higher than many of the capsule-based probiotics. Still, it's a great way to encourage probiotic usage since taking one can be considered a treat rather than a chore, and easily earns this 5-stars.",1501,2117
5.0,1646669037268,Good Quality Broccoli Powder,"I enjoy fresh and steamed broccoli and have noticed that usually, the next day after eating a good amount of broccoli, I feel and look better.  I think there's something in broccoli that really tunes my engine.  So, when this package of broccoli powder came up on my list of items I could review I wanted to try it.  I like it.  I mix it with some wheatgrass powder or other super foods (like to include a sweet one for flavor) and water, mix thoroughly and drink it down.  It's not something to write home about, but I like it well enough and I feel I'm getting some good nutrition.  This powder seems to be fresh and will puff out of the envelope if you're not careful with it.",1505,1630
3.0,1645114100361,Pretty but Little Scent,"I don't really see the advantage of ""travel size"" since all the other shower steamers I've reviewed were individually wrapped in plastic.  But, nonetheless these are easy to toss into a suitcase or bag for trips.  I used two of them at the same time yesterday in the shower and still couldn't really detect much scent.  They're pretty to watch dissolving but as far as scent goes there's not very much.  These come in a very good quality box with a bow, ready for gifting.",1505,2120
5.0,1644950515941,Seems to be a Good Sleep Product,"This Freshcap Unwind instant drink mix tastes very good.  It's slightly sweet and no where near being too sweet.  Some people may want to add a little more sweetener to it.  I mixed up a tube in some boiling water and it completely dissolved leaving no mushroom sediment at the bottom of my cup.  It nearly has the color of coffee and when I added a little cream to it it looked exactly like coffee and even sort of mimics the taste of coffee but without the caffeine.  The product page says it contains 1000 mg of dual mix (I guess that means Reishi and Chaga) but it doesn't say per serving.  Nor does it say anything on the box about how many mgs you are getting per serving.  I'm assuming that you get 1000 mg of Reishi and Chaga per tube.  I looked at a couple of bottles of mushroom capsules I have and the label said two capsules delivered 1000 mg and so I guess one tube also contains 1000 mg.  Overall I think this is a good product, especially useful right before bedtime to promote a better night's sleep, and it tastes good too.",1505,1923
5.0,1644089502179,Very Good Supplement,"I've been consuming fulvic and humic acids pretty much daily for the past couple of years in a shilajit form, which is dark, sometimes very thick and it never tastes good by itself.  So, when I saw Trace Minerals humic and fulvic acid on my list of items I could review I wanted to try it.  I've purchased several Trace Mineral product before, mainly their concentrated trace mineral drops and have found them to be very good quality.  I think this Trace Mineral Liquid Gut Health is a very good product and delivers some fulvic and humic acids that are so good for health and so rare to find in the basic American diet.  This is not as concentrated as what you get in shilajit, but it's a big bottle, one teaspoon is the daily dose, and it has no flavor.  It tastes like water.  I think this is a very good supplement though I don't know if it will help with gut health or not but is still a healthy supplement. Shilajit can be very expensive (a couple of hundred dollars depending on the quality) but it contains a LOT of trace minerals.  But for a much less expensive substitute I think the Trace Minerals is a good choice.",1505,808

It hasn't had many studies and the results of the ones done weren't very conclusive.  But, the reason I selected this product for review was not for the fisetin content but the quercetin.  Quercetin is absolutely wonderful at getting zinc into cells to fight off and kill viruses.  It really goes very well with vitamin C, D3 and zinc and I take all of those daily.",1505,1595
4.0,1631554913342,Good Supplement - contains Quercetin,"I kind of consider this supplement as a back-up to my other supplements and vitamins because although it contains very good things, it doesn't contain some of them in high enough quantities for me.  For instance, I normally take at least 250mcg D3 10,000 IU) daily, and this supplement only contains 3.3 mcg which is a mere fraction and that requires 2 capsules.  But, I like a lot that it contains 167 mg of quercetin, and 167 mg of elderberry, both extremely important in keeping one's immune system strong and healthy.  Overall, I think this is a very good supplement for the immune system but more D3, C, and zinc should be taken along with this.",1505,809
5.0,1629408215157,Good Combo Supplement,"I think this is a very good D3/K2 supplement. It seems to be very reasonably priced (as of this review a bottle of 60 veggie caps costs $16.19 giving you a 3 month supply). One capsule delivers 125 mcg of D3 and 100 mcg  of vitamin K2. 210 mg calcium is also included which is only 16% DV. I take at least 5000 IU of D3 each day and usually more since it is such a powerful anti-viral and is so good for brain health. And in combination with K2, needed calcium is stored in bones and being 63, I don't want to get soft or brittle bones as I age. I think this is a very good supplement.",1505,2126

I think I like the capsule form better because the powder tastes kind of fishy and has no sweet (but it's not bitter either).  These capsules cost $119.95 as of this review and the powder is about ten dollars more.  Both are a one month supply.  However, 3 capsules/day is the recommended dosage and I'm not fond of swallowing pills.  I really wish I could say, ""Wow! This has dramatically improved my cognitive abilities"" but I can't.  I think I'm the wrong person to test it out since my cognitive abilities are already pretty darn good.  But, I've only been taking it as directed for a little over two weeks and these things often take more time than that.  The directions on the side of the powder container say to take a cognitive test before starting and then after 30 days take another one to see how well your cognitive skills have improved.  I don't have that much time to wait before I can write a review.  I will say that it doesn't make me sick to my stomach or gives me any unwanted side effects at all.",1505,589

I have reviewed several other red superfood powders and I don't recall any of them costing that much.  I have several red superfood mixes that contain many of the same ingredients as this but the cost is much less.  That said, I think this is an excellent mix, it has a lot of very good ingredients that are very beneficial for good health,  it dissolves well with little clumping, the color is pretty and the flavor is good.

4.0,1608132372112,"Easy to Carry, Clean Well","I think these detergent sheets would be great for kids living in dorms at school, or when you are taking lengthy trips somewhere. But for home use I'd rather have my big jug of liquid laundry detergent.  I've used several of these and they seem to clean clothes just fine and don't leave any perfume scent behind on them.  However, I have to use 3 sheets at a time since my laundry loads are big.  At that rate, I only get about 10 or 11 loads done and that just isn't all the economical since one box costs $10.59.  I can get a big jug of liquid for about that much money.  All that said, these clean fine, are easy to carry (especially good for those who can't carry much stuff) and don't leave a perfume scent behind.  These would be great for those with a very limited storage space in their laundry area.",1505,1527
5.0,1604958646054,Very Good Organic Turmeric,"I buy a LOT of turmeric powder either from Amazon or from my nearest multi-cultural food market.  I make what is called, ""Golden Paste"" out of turmeric, coconut oil, water and freshly ground black pepper.  It has helped me and my husband immensely with bone and joint health.  I'm 62 and play very competitive tennis, singles and doubles against opponents less than half my age and I often win.  I am a true believer in the miracle of Golden Paste as my previously super sore and creaky knees have been transformed into those of a 25 year old's - no kidding.  Please google ""golden paste"" and see how easy it is to make at home and give it a try.  When this ORGANIC turmeric came up on my list of items I could review it took less than a nano second to select it.  I think it's wonderful, it comes in 3 smaller bags instead of one big one and it seems to be among the best organic turmeric I've used.",1505,2111

5.0,1603649741436,Very Good Mushroom Powder Supplement,Hubs and I have been taking a blend of mushroom powder everyday for months and I think it has really helped with our immune system. When this mushroom supplement came up on my list of items I could review I instantly selected it. I like the variety of mushrooms included in this mushroom supplement and am always glad to see Chaga mushroom included.  I buy Chaga separately as a powder because it is so incredibly good for the immune system. All of these mushrooms in this supplement are extremely good for health and there is nothing I can find negative to say about it.,1505,2140
4.0,1599232691669,Could Taste a Little Better,"I think this mix did give me a little extra energy the other day when I had two tennis practices nearly back to back.  I have tried this mix several times and though I haven't noticed a jolt in energy, I didn't get overly fatigued either, especially while playing in the hot sun.  It mixes well with plain water though it seems to settle out a little bit if left to sit in the glass for a while.  The flavor is not all that good - it has a strong, almost bitter flavor that I don't really care for.  I have since started mixing this with another electrolyte mix that has a sweeter and more pleasant flavor.  I like the combination and it really keeps my electrolyte level up when sweating and exercising in the heat.",1505,1604
5.0,1598023516407,Very Good Wheat Grass Juice Powder,This stuff is GREEN!  But it's a nice deep green which tells me it's loaded with good wheat grass juice.  I'm not particularly fond of the taste but it's drinkable.  I know I'm getting good nutrition when I drink it so I easily tolerate the taste.  It mixes up nicely in water and that's the only way I've been drinking it so far.  I kind of got off of smoothies but will try some in one eventually.  The bag is big with a lot of servings.  I've never had wheat grass juice before so when it came up on my list of items I could review I wanted to try it and am glad I did.,1505,813
5.0,1597937003313,One of My Favorite Electrolyte Mixes,"I have the exact same Jigsaw Health Pickleball electrolyte powder but in a plastic can and use it a lot.  So, when I saw these individual packets available for review I instantly selected them.  I really like this electrolyte mix.  I play a lot of competitive tennis - singles and double - underneath the hot sun in the Deep Humid South.  I sweat like a sailor and need instant electrolyte replacement.  I have tried and reviewed a LOT of electrolytes - some I like a lot like this one and others that I save for when it's cold outside and I don't sweat much.  This Pickleball electrolyte is my first choice because it contains more potassium, sodium and magnesium than any of the others that I have.  These packets make it easy to take some along in my tennis bag and mix up a bottle when I feel I need it.  This electrolyte mix is some of the best I've ever had the opportunity to try and review and I can't find anything negative to say about it.  It mixes easily in water and has a nice orange flavor.",1505,1673

I didn't even know about the health benefits of bone marrow until a few short months ago.  When I saw this supplement available for review I wanted to try it.  I think it's very good, and very high quality.  I just can't deal with taking 4 capsule of it each day.  I will have to bust them open and pour the contents into soups or something.  I have other forms of bone marrow supplements that I like better such as a thick gravy kind that is already seasoned and all I have to do is spoon it into a casserole, meatloaf, soup, etc.... and stir it in before cooking it.  And I have a bone marrow supplement that's chocolate flavored that I can mix up in a smoothie.  All are good forms and if you have no trouble swallowing pills or capsules I think this would be a great choice.",1505,256
5.0,1594840767664,Excellent Liposomal Vitamin C,"I have purchased a lot of bottles of Liposomal Vitamin C but of other brands because of Covid-19. My whole family takes liposomal vitamin C instead of regular vitamin C for one main reason. Liposomal vitamin C stays in your system much longer and is not excreted or used up nearly as quickly as regular ascorbic acid type vitamin C, which is what most people take. The liposomal type is best because it will stay in your system to continue giving protection from viruses. I learned of liposomal from watching health oriented Youtube videos. This brand is every bit as good as the other brands I've taken and and you need no less that 1500 mg each day, and we take even more. This type of vitamin C costs more, but it's definitely worth the extra money. Easily 5 stars and more.",1505,2143
5.0,1593882458122,Very Good Trash Bags,These are wonderful trash bags!  They have a rubbery feel to them and are very stretchy.  They easily fit over our standard size kitchen garbage can with no fighting necessary to get it stretched over the top rims.  They don't come with wire ties and aren't designed with flaps to tie so if you over fill it you really have to mash the trash down to get enough bag to tie together or buy some wire ties separately.,1505,504
5.0,1592437376297,Very Good Supplement,This mushroom supplement is probably one of least expensive ones I reviewed in a long time.  As of this review it costs  $14.99.  I like the wide variety of mushrooms included and am always glad to see Chaga mushroom included though I don't know how much of it is in this supplement.  I buy Chaga separately as a powder because it is so incredibly good for the immune system.  All of these mushrooms in this supplement are extremely good for health and there is nothing I can find negative to say about it.,1505,503
3.0,1591372904486,Use as a BACKUP Supplement Only,"This supplement is a good BACKUP to what you are already taking to prevent getting the flu and keeping your immune system healthy.  I say that because these aren't ordinary times with Covid-19, and extra supplements are necessary.  I like some of ingredients in this supplement but wish the vitamin C had been liposomal and not ascorbic acid.  The zinc is in the form of zinc oxide, which is the least bioavailable.  Most of it won't be utilized by your body.  All the other ingredients are good and I always like to see Elderberry included since it is a powerful anti-oxidant and virus buster.  I take over 1500 mg liposomal vitamin C each day plus extra zinc (citrate/gluconate) so I don't think the 180mg of vitamin C (in this supplement) will do anything to help your immune system fight off Covid.  I'm giving it 3 stars and think that is being generous.",1505,505
4.0,1587173784590,Good Supplement,"This supplement has ingredients that are known to help joint health - Chondrointin, Glucosamine Sulfate, MSM, and I was glad to see turmeric added.  I'm a big fan of turmeric and use it mostly for maintaining my joint health by making what is called, ""Golden Paste"" - extremely good for health.  I think this is a good supplement but it will take time and patience before noticing any improvement.  If you want fast improvement Google golden paste, make it and take it as directed.",1505,1514
4.0,1586030925716,Good on a Backpack?,I sprayed a biking backpack that I wear when I ride my bike.  I often carry food and a lot of stuff in it and it always gets grimy.  I washed it once in the machine and it did o.k. but I decided to spray it all over with this spray.  It went on fine.  The family said it had a smell but I could barely detect it.  I had enough to lay on two coats with some left over.  I haven't used my backpack yet but I needed to get a review up in time so I will update it if I think it doesn't work as advertised.,1505,300

I don't know at this time how well my fabric will protected from food drops and animal dirt.  It seems so far to be a good product.",1505,1094
5.0,1585410636600,Great For Kids,"Getting kids to eat healthy is not the easiest chore in the world and they need good gut health as much as adults do.  I think these chewable probiotics are a good way to get some extra probiotics into your kids.  I have teens that won't drink my home made kombucha or kefir (loaded with naturally occurring probiotics) so I like to give them probiotics in a chewable form and these were a big hit.  These have a high CFU which are derived from 5 strains of bacteria.  There are probiotics in pill form that have a much higher CFU count from many more strains, but most kids balk at taking pills.",1505,1642
3.0,1585080335617,I Don't Like The Flavor,"I really do think that this is a good product for joint health.  I've been taking glucosamine and chondroitin in pill form for several years and so far my joints have been very healthy.  I don't much like swallowing pills so when I can find a supplement in a gummy or liquid form I like to try them out.  That said, this stuff tastes awful.  It's really hard for me to swallow it down and I will have to mix it up with something the mask it's flavor.",1505,2145
3.0,1584031451980,So Sweet!,Oh my!  I found this to be like drinking pancake syrup it was so thick and sweet.  I have since started diluting it in about 6 oz. of water.  I can't really tell if it helps with recovery or not.  I play a lot of competitive tennis and sometimes come off the court absolutely whacked.  The next time that happens I'll try this protein drink again and see if it helps with energy recovery.  Until then I'm giving it 3 stars.,1505,302
5.0,1583602715902,Stops the Stink,I can't smell this but for just a micro second after spraying it.  It initially has a little bit of a bleach smell but then nothing.  I sprayed some in my daughter's really stinky running shoes and it helped a lot.  I could use this in a gallon size since we have pets and stinky tennis shoes.  It seems to work as advertised so unless it stops working I think it deserves 5 stars.,1505,762

I had a grueling match last weekend and was fatigued when it was over and I was finally back home.  I drank about 1/4 a bottle of the Vital Performance Recovery Drink and put the rest in the refrigerator.  It's a week later and the bottle is still there, untouched.  I felt better after drinking the amount I drank, but it doesn't taste very good.  I think I will take the remainder bottle with me to my next match and drink it during the match and see if it helps me keep my energy level up.  I like the idea of recovery drinks, but I need something more palatable.",1505,1102

They are very easy to fold into a box and no instructions are necessary.  Just fold on the creases and slide the tabs into the slots on the bottom.  I wouldn't put a particularly heavy object in them since the tabs and slots are all that keep the bottom intact.  These boxes make a perfect cube shape.",1505,1096
5.0,1583120893656,Very Good Supplement,"I am really pleased that this product came up on my list of items I can review. When I saw it I instantly selected it because I know that Chlorella is an excellent green superfood. I love superfoods and consume them often. This one is just Chlorella with no Spirulina added, but if you want both in a capsule it's easy to find here on Amazon. If it's only Chlorella you're interested in this is a great way to take it. I like both the powdered and capsule forms. I like the powder for my smoothies but sometimes I don't want a smoothie and the capsules are a great alternative. I always feel better and more energized when I consume green superfoods. They have a lot of nutrition and naturally occurring minerals. There is nothing negative I can find to say about this product.",1505,1098
5.0,1582144985116,Excellent Blend of Mushrooms - Contains Chaga,The mushrooms used in this blend offer a lot of health benefits but I selected it for review mainly for the Chaga mushroom content.

I'm not on a ketogenic diet, but if I was I think I'd buy a bottle of MCT oil and add it and just drink my coffee black.  It's o.k. but nothing to write home about.",1505,669

I'm pretty sure it has a lot of coconut oil in it since it smells like coconut.  It's kind of soft, and doesn't take much pressure to get some on the included sponge.  It cleaned a couple of purses and an old pair of shoes pretty well, but if it's mainly coconut oil I have that here at home for a lot less money.",1505,1742
5.0,1580516156968,Excellent Electrolyte Drops,"I have to have electrolytes when playing tennis. I play very competitively, especially during the summer months when it's very hot here in the Deep South. If I don't have an electrolyte drink available during a match I start getting the shakes and afterwards I am prone to muscle cramping which hurts like you-know-what. I have tasted these electrolyte drops and they taste fine in water, but I haven't been able to test it out on a hot court since it's still winter. But, looking at the ingredients list it seems to have everything I need and more. I especially like the extra potassium it contains.  And I usually have to add a little NaCl to it since I sweat so much of it out while playing but I probably won't have to because it contains 125mg of sodium per serving.  I'm really looking forward to using this electrolyte come this Spring and Summer.",1505,815
3.0,1580496230828,Too Expensive for What You Get,"Unless you are just loaded with money and don't mind spending $79.98 for a MONTH'S SUPPLY of this supplement, I'd find these components elsewhere for a lot cheaper.  Turmeric capsules are cheap and easy to find, Astaxanthin and Holly Basil Leaf supplements are cheap and easy to find, and probably Artic Pine too. No way would I buy this especially for the turmeric content.  I have bags of turmeric powder (can be found at a regular grocery store) and about a billion capsules of turmeric supplement and I know it's cheap to buy.  I also have a lot of holly basil and astaxanthin to take anytime I need it.  I'm sure the contents and bioavailability of these MOVE capsules are very good, and they're easy to swallow, but my cheapness just won't let me part with that much money for something I can get for less than half and more of it.",1505,306

I don't know the exact price of this bag as of this review, but I think it's probably around $48.00, which is out of my price range.  Therefore, I will consume it for the health benefits, (probably in more smoothies) and then go back to my other green superfoods that I also love.

It's supposed to be good for gastrointestinal health, weight lose, is an anti-oxidant and anti-bacterial, lowers blood sugar levels, increases insulin sensitivity and is often used to treat mouth ulcers and gum disease.

4.0,1555088004088,Very Good but Sweet,I drank this yesterday as directed on the side of the container and I seemed to have more energy than I thought I would at my evening tennis practice.  I had worked out pretty hard using the tennis ball machine earlier that day and was kind of dragging before tennis practice time.  I drank a full 8 oz of water with one scoopful of Gen One Nutrition-Intramino Intra-Workout BCAA Amino Acids Powder and I really did feel pretty good and played well at practice.  I wasn't even very tired when I got home and our coach had us doing conditioning drills.  The flavor was sort of coconut-like and sweet.  I wish it was not so sweet but it seems that most of these type powders just load up on sweetness.  It dissolved well in water and I didn't see any clumps.

I use a lot of super food powders because I really do feel better after consuming them.  I added a scoopful of Amalaki powder to my regular smoothie and it actually gave it a better flavor.  They had always been a little overly-sweet and the Amalaki powder really balanced it out well.  I read that Amalaki fruit is very high in vitamin C and is supposed to be very good for the digestive system.  My digestive system can give me some serious grief at times and is the main reason I started making my own milk kefir, kombucha and other fermented foods to get the natural probiotics they contain.

I've grown organic beets in my raised beds and I never could get the dirt taste completely out of them so I'm not complaining.

I tried both the Lavender and the Champagne scents and loved them. The instructions don't say how much to put, so I put 2 capfuls and this was enough to give gentle bubbles and a lovely scent.<br /><br />The lavender is strong but not medicinal and the champagne has a slightly fruitier almost lychee undertone.  Both are lovely and not overly sweet.  The bubbles are soft and plentiful and the scents are relaxing and make me feel like I am somewhere else.  The minerals in the bath also feel soothing.  Overall, it feels very pampering and helps to wash away a tough week.<br /><br />I love the way that these bottles look in the bathroom as well.

If you have four cups per day, that is $14 per day and this pack will only last five days. You can make coffee at home, add your own butter, MCT oil and, collagen at a cost of $0.40 - $1 per cup. Where this product makes sense is when you are away from home, such as in the office or while traveling. For that use case, this product is good.

3.0,1633571155117,Unknown quality,"The front of the bottle says it has oil from wild Pollock and the back says it contains Tilapia, which is generally an unhealthy farm-raised fish that should be avoided. If the tilapia is only used to make the gelatin, the label should mention that. Oil from fish at the low end of the food chain would be better since those fish are less contaminated. Anchovies and sardines would be better. This fish oil does not have independent quality verifications listed, which is important for fish oil. This lacks IFOS certification or certification from LabDoor. If this is a natural triglyceride form of the oil, that means it is more likely to have contaminants. If this is synthetic triglyceride form, they should mention that. Other products that use AlaskOmega oil are IFOS certified, so there is a chance that this oil would pass those same tests, but the company should advertise that more.<br /><br />They added lemon flavor to the oil inside the capsules, which is unusual. It might be done to mask the taste of low-quality fish oil from people that open the capsules to evaluate freshness.<br /><br />The bottle is nice. The current price is $64 for 90 servings, or $0.71/serving. Doctor’s Best is selling very similar AlaskOmega Ethyl Ester oil for $0.43/serving. SmarterVitamins is also selling a nearly identical AlaskOmega product for less money.",1758,143
2.0,1617464325550,Too expensive compared to other brands,"People take curcumin for the anti-inflammation benefit. I don’t personally notice anything from taking a lot of curcumin from many companies. Considering the relatively high price for curcumin, I would like there to be a more noticeable benefit.<br /><br />I measure two pills having 1330 mg of powder in them, which is close to what I expect from the claimed 1310mg of ingredients. It means these capsules have minimal to no fillers, which is what they advertise.<br /><br />You are after the curcumin, not the turmeric, so the 100mg of turmeric extract is the important number when price comparing. The current price is $13 for 90 pills, which $1.44/gram. The 90-pill bottle is $0.94/gram. The NOW brand 60 pill bottle costs $0.33/gram. The Doctor’s best 120 pill bottle is $0.34/gram. Nothing about this B’LEAF NATURE curcumin would suggest that it is a better product that is worth such a price premium over the established reputable brands.<br /><br />You can buy tumeric root at the grocery store if that is what you want. Tumeric is too bulky relative to the active compounds for it to be a good supplement. Instead, focus on supplements that contain just the curcumin extract, and ones that contain more of the desired extract than what is in this pill.<br /><br />Made in the USA in GMP certified facility.",1758,2069
1.0,1617382556786,Caffeine is more effective at increasing executive function,"I completed the full bottle of pills and my conclusion is that this product did nothing. I consider myself a biohacker and I am in tune with how my body responds. Perhaps the effect is masked by all the other supplements and peptides I take. I tried to isolate the effect from my other supplements and energy drinks. I tried taking more than the recommended dose, taking it spread throughout the day, taking it in the evening, in addition to recommended three pills at once.<br /><br />If this supplement does anything, it is too subtle for me to notice. Some supplements and medications take time to build up before their effect becomes noticeable, but I did not notice anything from this at any time during the month. I was hoping this would work since the company seems well-intentioned with a belief that what they are selling works.<br /><br />This is clearly not a stimulant. Anything that is a stimulant is more immediately effective than this product.<br /><br />The clinical trials are meaningless if they used a placebo as a comparison. They should be comparing competing products, such as caffeine, Adderall, Ritalin, and Modafinil. All of these competing drugs are less expensive than this supplement, excluding the cost of the doctor's visit to get the prescription. The real challenge for supplements like these is how it stacks up against caffeine, or a Monster Energy Drink, not a sugar pill.<br /><br />People that are avoiding stimulants are not going to eat cocoons either. Products like this target the fringe of biohackers, who already take numerous other supplements and are not nutrient deficient in anything. The target audience is different from a clinical trial group.<br /><br />The main compound adding to the cost is the peptide. For brain-enhancing peptides, Semax and Cerebrolysin are established, proven, and scientifically validated peptides, and both work great in me and have noticeable effects. I am not sure what cocoon peptide is supposed to do and the Web site of the vendor does not mention how it works. What is the mechanism of action? The other peptides I mentioned increase BDNF levels and are less expensive than this product.<br /><br />I am a man in my 40s and I have tried a large number of supplements, nootropics, medications, and peptides to help increase productivity, focus, and mental performance.<br /><br />The money-back-guarantee helps for a product like this, but it seems like you will need to take a test at the start of the 30 days to activate the offer.",1758,589
3.0,1617123851332,You are paying for the fancy bottle,"This MCT oil comes in a fancy wine bottle and it is packaged like a fancy wine bottle. It has a slight taste of coconut oil, versus other MCT oils that have no detectable taste.<br /><br />You are paying a premium for the presentation of this oil, not for the quality of the oil. The bottle looks fancy and like a premium product, if that is the look you are going for. Maybe you are buying this for a bar or restaurant where the appearance matters. For the oil to be the highest quality, it would be better if this was 100% C8 oil. Other brands try to stand out by selling organic MCT oil.<br /><br />I drink MCT oil daily in coffee, and I have tried many of the brands. Another brand I have in my kitchen is the inexpensive Horbaach MCT oil that costs $0.15 / fl oz. This Genesis MCT oil has the same ratio of oils and costs $1.48 / fl oz. Premium 100% C8 MCT oil is cheaper than Genesis MCT oil.<br /><br />Many MCT oil bottles suffer from a pouring problem and drips. This bottle pours like a wine bottle, which is fine, and it has the problem with the last oil drip running down the side, like many other bottles. I keep my bottles on a paper towel.<br /><br />This MCT oil is sold in clear glass, versus nearly every other MCT bottle being sold. I am unaware of any issue with MCT oil degrading if exposed to light, but it is something to take note of. Many places caution to keep oils out of sunlight. The NOW brand sells their MCT oil in dark brown glass.<br /><br />The bottle says High Octane on it, which is silly marketing. They are likely trying to play off the pioneer in the field of MCT oils, Bulletproof Brain Octane C8 MCT Oil, which is higher quality and less expensive than this oil. Octane, the hydrocarbon, has a C8 molecule in it, which corresponds to the 100% C8 oil in the clever marketing of that competing product.",1758,146

Then you unscrew the top and use the included USB charging cord to charge the battery whenever it's low. A red light next to the USB port indicates charging and green is charged. You screw on the top to use. The button is at one end and the lights at the other. The three LED therapy lights are very small, but they seem quite powerful. They shine brightly through my hand joints. My initial impressions are that this does help with my arthritis inflammation. The light should be used against bare skin and can be held directly against the skin. One of the lights is infrared (heat), so the head can get warm and you may need to let it cool (while off) before continuing to use it. It has 10 minutes before automatic turn-off, and the head only gets mildly warm by the end of that time . The therapy area (lighted area at the end) is 0.75"" across, so the downsize is the limited area that you can treat at one time while the advantage is that it's battery-powered portable. The power button sequence is: one press = on, two = off, three = strobe light, four = off. I don't like how fast the strobe light pulses and so will never use it. You never have to see the strobe if you just hit once to turn on and once to turn off (and wait before turning it back on).<br /><br />When placed on a hard surface, the little stand will hold the light pointed where you want it.

I noticed that the battery power on the Kindle dropped 10% in just a few minutes (which is really, really fast) and I had to reboot the Kindle to fix the battery drain.

3.0,1593620365889,"Easy to grasp and use, but the sponge is so dense that it doesn't dry quickly","While I really like this design in some ways, the sponge is somewhat difficult to remove and replace because it is dense and likewise never seems to dry out because it is so dense. The sponge appears to be made from cellulose. The idea is that you squirt liquid soap onto the side with holes that lead down to the sponge. This creates a reservoir of soap that can be released when you squeeze the sponge. The soft silicone bristles feel nice on the skin. There is a slit in the bottom of the silicone casing where you can pull the sponge out. I initially tried hanging this bath brush in an airy spot with the sponge inside, but the sponge hadn't dried at all after 24 hours. I pulled the sponge out and put it in an airy spot, but it still took two days to dry out. So, if you use this every day, it's never going to dry out and will probably start to mold.<br /><br />I like the size as it is easy for me to hold while using. The side that doesn't have holes has projections that are a little stiffer and rougher, presumably get rid of dead skin or stubborn dirt. There is a loop for hanging or to put over your wrist when using it. The scrubber can be used without the sponge by squirting the soap on the bristles, but the scrubber doesn't hold its shape well without the interior sponge and so is more difficult to hold.

I usually wear women's large size, and these fit well. They were easy to pull on and off, including the one that did not have cotton lining on the inside. They fit close enough and are flexible enough that I could do chores that require some dexterity. The gloves cover your hand, wrist, and part of the lower arm.

3.0,1563994322934,Soft. Rests against eyes.,"This package came with two silk sleep masks and a pair of foam ear plugs. One sleep mask is black on both sides and the other has purple on one side and black on the other.  The fabric is smooth and soft against the skin. The elastic band that holds the mask on is doubled over and is adjusted by sliding the fastener (rather than with a bulky snap or velco closure). I find this closure/adjustment method more comfortable than my current sleep mask. The mask is thick enough to block light, and the mask does narrow (as in, has a ""cut out"") in the nose area for a somewhat better fit. But there is no molding or pillowed area to hold the mask above your eyes or fill the gap created between the cheek and the nose, so light does get under the mask. The mask lies directly against my eyelashes, and I don't really care for that. The stitching is neat.<br /><br />The mask measures 8.5"" across by 4"" high (or 3.5"" high where it dips up at the nose area). The elastic can be adjusted between about 8"" to 15"" of length, for a total mask + elastic length of 16.5"" to 23.5"".",1844,75

It is about half gone now so it shouldn't be too long.  What I like about MY facial scrub is that it has plenty of ""scrubbies"" in the paste that I put on my face.  That way I can get all the dry, flaky skin off my face, clearing the way for new, clean skin to be washed with a gentle soap and then moisturized with a light facial oil.  I have dry skin as I am older - I don't have ""dual"" skin with oily and dry patches.  I have dry skin, period.  The ""scrubbing granules"" in my favorite facial scrub ensures that all the old skin is gone.  This product is so wimpy - it has barely anything scrubby in the paste meaning I would need to use about half the tube just to get enough scrubbies on my face to get rid of the dead, dry skin on my face (especially on my forehead and around my nose).

I love that they are small and non-messy, easily stored and if I was going RV-ing and needed to wash clothes, these are easier to take into a laundromat - don't even have to take the box.  Just grab one or two depending on how many clothes you need to wash (in 1 or 2 machines) - so much easier than dragging around a bottle of liquid detergent or paying an exorbitant amount of money for one of those tiny ones at the laundromat.

Of course there are the little disposable ones that women like me carry in their purses, but I've not had any that are in a tube before.  I love that I can store one in the car by using a drink holder - so much easier than rooting in my purse for a tissue when I feel a sneeze coming on!  The packaging itself is pretty, me being a girly-girl kind of person, I do appreciate the colors and plants on it.  The tissues themselves are sturdy and soft enough that I feel confident that even when reaching for one to contain one of my ""big"" sneezes (that I do have more often than I would like), I don't worry that the tissue might suffer a ""crack"" in keeping my explosive sneeze contained.  The only thing I noted here is that the cost is a bit high, but for a tube of tissues that fits well in the car, it is worth the price, at least to me.",1850,626

This is a beautiful set that I know she will be happy to receive and thrilled to use once she can lock the bathroom door (kids...they always want to bother mom when she's trying to get a little me time!) and relax for a time.

It has a hint of sweetness but with that small amount, I didn't taste any ""big"" flavor to the powder.  I have some frozen strawberries and milk and will try a bit of the beet powder in a smoothie, but I can already tell, it's gonna be really red!!!  Definitely worth a try - I always wanted to like beets as a side dish, but just never acquired a taste for them.  Powdered and added to other foods works for me!",1850,13

I tried it out when I had a slight migraine and it didn't help but it also didn't make it worse.  I don't think it was designed for headaches so I'm going to give it a go on a non headache day and see if it helps with mood and alertness.  I like the smell a lot and expect it will help somewhat with mood improvement.,1853,2471

We put it on the charger for several hours as the manual recommended and it worked.<br /><br />While charging there is a red light next to where the cable plugs in, and the light stays lit all the time  even after the shaver is charged. So you never knew if the battery if fully charged and whether or not it will overheat.<br /><br />The shaver manual is not much help and in fact makes this product more confusing. The printed manual and writing on the shaver box have conflicting charging instructions. The manual says to charge up to 8 hours and advises no longer.  The box says 1 hour for 60 minutes of shaving. This is kind of confusing because my husband was never able to get 60 minutes of use after charging.  He was only able to get 2 shaves each at about 7 minutes before the battery went dead and had to be recharged.<br /><br />So…. my husband will not be using this shaver since the battery keeps going dead.

He had to move the shaver slowly back and forward too many times.  He has another shaver but he was hoping that this 9-in-1 would be his favorite. The nose trimmer attachment and the beard trimmers work okay.  The battery life of this shaver having 90 minutes of shaver time is better than any other shaver he has used, but his Norelco shaver gives a super close shave in about 5 minutes.

I didn't have any side effects after taking this fish oil. Digestion is most always an issue today with foods as many are just that, indigestible. I like this product’s ingredients are and they appear to be one of the highest quality fish oils on the market. I started one before eating.

The bottle dropper works good and no leaks in cap rim as I shake it every time before using.  Still, I think it is critical to get enough B12 especially for us older folks.

If you're used to using pea protein products, you know what I'm talking about. I wasn't wild about the flavor just on it's own. With a little tweaking though, it's not bad. I've found if you blend it into a smoothie using coffee that's been frozen into cubes with coconut milk and a splash of your favorite coffee creamer, it's actually pretty delicious and tastes like a frappe.

It's full of all the good stuff and free from all the bad stuff. It's sweetened with monk fruit and isn't full of a bunch of added ingredients and dyes. Flavor wise, I thought it was pretty good. It has a very pleasant berry/pomegranate flavor. It wasn't a chore to drink, although the hint of beets was a bit unsettling. I doubt most people would even notice the mild beet flavor, but I have a profound abhorrence of beets, so I'm uber sensitive to the flavor and can pick it up in things where most people wouldn't have a clue it was even there, so unless you loathe beets as much as I do, it's probably not a big deal. I only notice the beet flavor when mixed with straight water. If you make a smoothie using this powder, vanilla protein, a few frozen strawberries and coconut milk, It's absolutely delicious and I don't pick up on the beets at all.

I feel like it’s a little rough on my heels, and I wish I could turn that part off once it gets uncomfortable, but the disc that massages the arches and the balls of the feet feels good. The part that goes over your feet inflates to squeeze your feet kind of like a blood pressure cuff, and pushes your feet down onto the massager so you get a deep massage on the bottoms of your feet.

An inscrutable part of the ad copy states: ""Compare to physician formulated seeking health."" There is a claim to check out their awards in the photo section, which reveals nothing more than badges stating things like ""non-GMO"" (without mentioning any of the governing bodies that regulate or oversee such claims), ""100% guarantee,"" etc. It states the product is manufactured for a company in Florida.  There are 10 different commonly used strains; the capsules are on the larger size considering the dosage (10 B CFU). There is no indication that the product was designed to withstand stomach acid and deliver the full dosage to the gut, but is seems to work as expected.

I don't expect them to survive being sat upon, for instance; the plastic feels like it would snap. But they seem like they are durable. I find that they are best for reading a book, or a computer, where you are not moving your head very much, because the focal point is fairly specific. Once you turn your head a little bit, the focal point changes. More expensive glasses don't seem to do this.

I was unable to remove it without tearing the box. So again, an argument against gifting.<br />The bombs are individually wrapped and are strong smelling. Just all the same which is a great pity. There is a tiny variation in colour due to to the swirls, but that's it.<br />Bath bombs have become fancy these days and so these don't compare well.

Also, adding the powder didn't seem to alter the taste of my smoothie at all. It blended in smoothly without any lumps and really just vanished into the mix. I didn't even notice a change in color.<br /><br />I have to say I'm very pleased with this product. It's a bit high in price, but using it as I do makes it worth the cost. I'm also glad I can say I can keep my precious smoothies tasting as good as they do, but now they're even better for me. I can recommend this product without hesitation.",10468,13

Also, they have a distinct vitamin B aftertaste, if you know what I mean. Bottom  line, though, I think these are good quality vitamins, based on how I feel after taking them for a week- subjective, but they seem to work well.",11975,14
5.0,1493922702000,It's Hard to Eat Just One...,"These Digestive Advantage Probiotic Bites in Dark Chocolate are addictive!  Ideally, you'd eat one of these after a meal or daily, as a supplement to your diet, to improve your gut flora and overall digestive health.  I am an avid fan of pro-biotics, and also enjoy kombucha, yogurt, kefir, etc... which are delish, but not quite as simple to eat or as convenient as popping a chocolate into your mouth as you do with these bites.  These Digestive Advantage Bites are the size of giant malt-balls, and are about 90% chocolate in my estimation- straight to the center of the bite, where you then encounter a small circle of chewier and slightly grainy textured probiotic/ chocolate mix, that is only slightly noticeable as being different from the rest of the chocolate, and which does not taste all that different from the rest of the bite either. The only reason i noticed was the texture, which is not unpleasant.<br /><br />I had a hard time eating these just as a supplement, and ended up snarfing a bunch just at once, and they disappeared over a few days (actually, it wasn't just me- my family discovered them quickly), ...cuz it's chocolate- and a very melty high quality chocolate at that (these have a thin waxy coating which prevents them melting in your hand), and these are completely delish. If you don't already take probiotics, I highly recommend you try some form, because it truly makes you feel better inside over a longer term- less stomach issues and better digestion means your body runs more efficiently. These delicious Probiotic Bites are a great way to get the benefits of probiotics, without the nastiness of swallowing pills, and in a form that you can carry with you easily. Also, my kids will eat these in a heartbeat.",11975,2117
4.0,1492621122000,"Great Taste, Refreshing, Easy to Dissolve, but Has Aspartame","This Sport Go Electrolyte in Lemon Lime is very tasty.  The directions recommend 2 scoops with the included scoop, added to 16 oz (500 ml) of water, for one serving size.  I mixed a 1/2 serving size (1 scoop to 8 oz water) in the white ceramic mug shown in my pic, and stirred it with a spoon. It dissolved fairly quickly and evenly, making a slightly lemonade-type milky looking drink, which tasted very sweet to me. I put it in my water bottle and filled the rest of the bottle with plain water, to get 1/2 the recommended concentration, which was a better flavor for me, because I don't love sweet drinks- but, you can easily add the amount you want, which is convenient.<br /><br />I compared this Sport Go to the leading-brand sports drink starting w &#34;G&#34; that  I often have on hand.  The G contained artificial colors and natural and artificial flavors, whereas the Sport Go had only natural flavors,but also contained aspartame (the blue pack sweetener on tables at restaurants).  G contained 27.5 grams Total Carbs (22 grams in my 12 oz G bottle increased 1/4 to account for the 16 oz comparison) vs. Sport Go's 36 g. G contained 100 cal (80 cal x 1.25) vs. Sport Go's 150 cal.  G had about 26g sugar (21g x 1.25) vs. Sport Go's 7g. Sport Go contains several other electrolyes and minerals missing from the G, however, including Magnesium and Calcium.<br /><br />Overall, depending on what you are looking for, this Sport Go is a multi-mineral electrolyte drink that tastes great (diluted for me), and will provide a good supplement for your heavy sport activities, without unnecessary artificial colors or flavors.  On the other hand, I am not a big fan of Aspartame.",11975,16

I am a bit confused because I received Chocolate Caramel even though I was sent a receipt for Chocolate Hazelnut and the picture in the listing is for Chocolate almond.

To seal in your style, simply dry your hair as normal and press the cool button to seal your style!  It works great!  This hairdryer has a 6 ft power cord which is so helpful and has a hanging loop if you have a hook you use for storing your hair dryer. This also has a removable end cap that allows you to target heat to a specific area of your hair - such as to give it volume or curl.<br /><br />See my picture for details and my video for a demonstration of the product.

I used the roller that appeared unused (after cleaning with alcohol) and it worked great to address dry skin on the bottom of my feet. It comes with a charger and fully charges in a few hours. This comes with 3 rollers and is compact for easy storage.<br /><br />The instructions provided are also written in broken English and really do not make sense (see my pictures).<br /><br />In terms of effectiveness, I would give this 4 stars. In terms of written instructions, a rating of a 2 and confidence of receiving a sterile product at a 1.<br /><br />The packaging needs to be wrapped to ensure sterilization and the instructions need to be corrected - then this product is one I could recommend.",12355,284

I also like that it is made from limited ingredients (see my pictures). However, if the dental floss does not get thread through the cutter at the top of the box, it easily slips back into the box which is a little frustrating because you have to open the box to thread it through the cutter - and this is a paper box so it won’t withstand a lot of opening the box.

5.0,1641575600597,Feels wonderful on the skin.,Really love the one that is more like silicone. Massages the face and cleans at the same time. Like using it in the shower with my purity facial cleaner. Easy to change out to the brush head. You charged it via USB so you will need an adapter for your outlet if you don't have USB in the bathroom. Would make a wonderful gift for anyone really who enjoys clean skin.,12530,604

I seems to like around level 10 or 11 in massage mode. Lot of pain relief in a tiny package. The sticky pads can be used by the same person a number of times if returned to plastic sheets between uses.,12530,605
4.0,1635195975110,Cooling effect and strong scent.,I detect the menthol and camphor scents mixed with a wintergreen type scent. Reminds me of my Mother who always had Wintergreen lifesavers in her purse.  The mixed scent is not unpleasant. I am using it on my knees. It provides a cooling effect and the scent together give a feeling of well-being. Not a huge pain relief exactly but does assist in feeling better. However that occurs is good in my book.,12530,2100
5.0,1632947365825,Updated they worked.,First of all these come in a thin black plastic bag inside a plastic mailer. There are no instructions included. After doing some research I found they need to be renewed approximately once a month in sunlight for 2 hours. So first I placed one in each room. Not that I had any glaring odors. I did have a bag of yarn that I was given that has the person's perfume scent on it that gives me asthma. Put the largest bag in with the open bag. No change. Going to put the whole set in with it and see if it helps but not holding my breath. The two with buttons and attached loops are my favorites. Updated: they totally worked in the yarn bag. I can now use the yarn.<br /><br />Be careful if you cut open the bag. I cut both bags.,12530,8456

I was getting skin tears too and that has stopped. I started to see results in about 6 weeks.,12530,1579
3.0,1612558817366,Very sweet and aftertaste.,"I so wanted this to be an answer for me. It is overly sweet when using a full scoop. The sweetener leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste. It does taste like an oatmeal marshmallow pie. The first sip is really good. The more I drank the sweetener aftertaste got too strong to enjoy. The flavor is basically good, just that aftertaste that turned me off. On a positive note it did help me feel full for a long time. Next time I try it perhaps I will try a half scoop, maybe won't be too sweet.",12530,772

I've tried so many of these and this one just isn't usable except when turned off.

4.0,1618476072231,"Works Well Enough As A Backup, Not Great","This is a really nice little face washer for a person who needs a very gentle washer, but it doesn't do much exfoliating because the bristles are all very fine and soft. It is exactly as described and pictured and it is working very well so far. With this kind of item, it either matches the photos or it doesn't, and this one looks exactly like the photos, and then it either works or it doesn't, and this one works well enough, but the little balls under the surface don't really seem to do anything other than massage. I suppose they feel nice, but they don't increase the face washing ability of this, so I'm not really sure why they are there. More vibration settings are needed as well as some thicker bristles either on the other side of the unit or on the edge along the top or bottom of the main pad, to make this work better. The listing is accurate and we are satisfied with the performance of this item as a backup unit, but it isn't good enough to be the main one that I use or that anyone else is using. Power consumption is as stated and it is easy to use and easy to work with and we've had no problems with it after quite a while of use. We all basically reached the same conclusion that it needs a better design as to variation of bristles and then more vibration settings. It is very easy to hold, so that was good and that is why it gets four instead of three stars. Many are too hard to hold. This is easy to hold when it is wet and it doesn't become too slippery to keep in my hand. Good luck in your search.",12550,2014

5.0,1657212697818,❤️🖤💛💚Massage With Compression 💞 Great For Plantar Fasciitis💙🧡💜🤎,"For me, the compression with the massage is the cats pajamas. OMG, it is wonderful! The bottom massager is more pointy than smooth which for me, is the only sometimes negative aspect to this depending on how sensitive my feet are at the time. My husband who has Plantar Fasciitis loves the pointy bits.<br /><br />The bottom rollers are big enough to cover the entire foot, including my husband's size 10 feet. Not all foot massagers are designed this way. Around the same time I ordered this, I also ordered a soft & plush foot rest style massager. It has massage rollers that are smaller, so it doesn't cover the entire foot but the rollers are smooth. No compression, but you can slide your feet into a little plush cave that is removable. That massager is about $100 less than this massager.<br /><br />If I had to pick between the two, I'd pick this massager by Sharper Image. It is the best massager I've ever owned & I've owned quite a few over the years thanks to my husbands Plantar Fasciitis. This doesn't mean I don't love the other massager. I love them both. The other is more cozy time relaxing, this on the other hand while very relaxing, also offers much more therapeutic benefits. Even though massager means business, I will still fall into a light doze while using it.<br /><br />This also has a heat function. It doesn't get very warm, but it is still nice; never too hot.<br /><br />As advertised, you can flip this over for a vibrating foot rest. Personally, I really enjoy the versatility.<br /><br />If you want something that looks nice, need some serious foot TLC, & can afford it, I see no reason why you wouldn't consider getting this. If you do want it & it's out of your price range (oh how I know that feeling I'm a full time Eco farmer), put it in your carts save for later & wait & hopefully a deal rolls around or you accumulate enough points on your amazon visa to get it free.<br /><br />If this sounds like more massage action than you really need or want, you may want to check out the other foot massager I mentioned. Remember though, it doesn't cover the entire foot bed. I adjust my feet when I use it to get the rollers where I want them. Link: smile.amazon.com/dp/B09P4P3DB6<br /><br />Made in China.",12631,2759

You can mix it into just about any green juice or smoothie blend you like.  A really simple summer smoothie example is fresh peeled de-seeded cucumbers, fresh blueberries, noni powder, & coconut milk.  A super sweet ice cream like treat is frozen pineapple, frozen banana, coconut milk & noni powder.  I like to freeze it a bit & eat it when it's super hot out.

However, ginseng is nonetheless a very renowned herb and known (at least in traditional medicine) to have a lot of supposed benefits.<br /><br />This brand uses mature ginseng (so it has more time to develop nutrients) and also does extensive testing, which is always a good thing when considering which brand to go with.",12952,255
4.0,1606166312586,Powerful Amino Acid,"N-acetyl cysteine has some potential lung and liver health benefits, and I have taken it fairly regularly for almost 10 years. Since it may raise glutathione levels in the body, it could potentially reverse the graying of hair as well, at least in theory.<br /><br />NAC is best taken on an empty stomach, since it is an amino acid. And, I suggest not taking it before exercise, since it has antioxidant activity, and too much antioxidant activity during exercise can actually negate the benefits of exercise (you want some bodily stress to happen).<br /><br />My main issue with this is the price. It's more expensive (as of now at least) than most other brands of NAC I have ever bought.",12952,667
5.0,1604770670380,Comprehensive Formula,"This is a good formula that combines Vitamin D3 with multiple forms of Vitamin K.<br /><br />Typically, Vitamin D and K2 are paired together, since both are important for bone health and calcium regulation in the body (to make sure calcium ends up in the bones and not inside your arteries).<br /><br />However, this formula also contains K1, which helps with blood clotting. So, if you are on blood thinners, K1 might impact this. Nonetheless, K1 is still an essential nutrient and is present in green, leafy vegetables, so the amount here will not impact those who aren't on blood thinners as a life-saving necessity.<br /><br />Be sure to take this pill with some type of fat or with a meal since both vitamins are fat-soluble. Also, this formula contains black pepper extract, which may increase the absorption of both vitamins. Be aware that black pepper extract can interact with certain drugs.",12952,150

There is a very little bit of bilberry extract in this, but not enough to do much.<br /><br />The price is a little high for a lutein supplement, but it's not too bad. Overall, this is a good eye health formula. I recommend it, especially if you don't eat a lot of foods high in lutein (like kale).",12952,2070
5.0,1601145559033,Solid Post-Workout,"This is a good post-workout (or, for me, often a mid-workout formula). It contains branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) that are vegan, which isn't a big concern for me, but if you are concerned about that, then that's a plus. It also contains glutamine, and all the essential amino acids. Adding EAAs not only has been shown to help build muscle mass, but can help vegans get a more balanced amino acid profile.<br /><br />The flavor is really good too! Even though I'm not vegan, this is a formula that anyone can appreciate and use.",12952,5785

As such, it is a better way to get co-enzyme Q10, which can be difficult for the body to absorb and utilize. Note that this is not the ubiquinol form of Q10, which is ultimately the best-absorbed, but which is also very expensive.<br /><br />So far, I have been very satisfied with this brand.

It is a high-protein, lower carb dessert for me.<br /><br />My main issue with this is that I don't like consuming sugar if I don't have to, and from what I can tell this is sweetened with brown rice syrup and maltodextrin. While, yes, brown rice sugar is more natural than refined sugar, and it isn't high in fructose, it is still basically a fancy source of sugar.

This makes this formula kind of unique, in that the inclusion of post-biotics is a new thing. To some degree, this may be a novelty, but there is some research that shows that for people who really can't tolerate probiotics, post-biotics may have benefits.<br /><br />This is a solid formula in this regard, although the number of units (4 billion per pill) is a little low compared to other formulas, some of which go into the 10-50 billion.

In the summer months, I run 50-75 miles a month.<br /><br />I'm not saying this to brag, but to mention that I put my body through a lot, and at 41 I have no major (or minor) joint issue. I attribute this to a variety of things, including taking glucosamine and other supplements since my early 20s.<br /><br />This formula is high in glucosamine sulfate (the sulfate form is more expensive but superior to glucosamine HCL) and also includes quite a few other major anti-inflammatory herbs and chemicals. It has standardized boswellia and turmeric, which will help with inflammation issues. I take both of these regularly.<br /><br />The price is kind of high, but there are a lot of expensive ingredients in here.",12952,1514

It has multiple strains and is timed release, probably to release them into the gut and avoid destruction in the stomach.<br /><br />This ""11 billion"" amount was kind of confusing for me at first, since the label says ""4 billion."" However, if you look at the bottom of the back side, below the label, it explains it has 11 billion at the time of manufacture. It is kind of cool that they guarantee 4 billion until expiration.

4.0,1581019548806,Powerful Formula For A High Price,"This is a powerful formula for joint pain or other inflammatory problems. It contains a variety of ingredients that have been shown to positively impact joint health.<br /><br />I like to take certain supplements to preventatively address joint issues, since at age 41, I work out and lift weights almost daily, and run anywhere from 70-100 miles a month in warmer weather. So far, I have avoided any joint issues, thanks in part to supplements like glucosamine sulfate, MSM, and some of the ones in this formula.<br /><br />I like that it contains a form of turmeric that is readily absorbed and utilized. If you look up the research behind Turmipure gold, you'll see that it is absorbed a lot better compared to regular turmeric extract that is 95% Curcumin. I am guessing this is because it is complexed with lecithin, which should also help the other ingredients absorb better.<br /><br />The inclusion of astaxanthin is good as well, and I take it regularly as an overall anti-aging supplement, as well as for skin health.<br /><br />The main drawback I see is the price.

I admit I have never seen that chemical name used, so I had to look it up.<br /><br />This is co-enzyme Q10 that is supposed to be absorbed better. I'm guessing this is because it is mixed with lecithin, which has been shown to enhance the absorption of co-enzyme Q10 and a variety of other chemicals.

5.0,1574101928105,Beet Root Powder For A Good Price,"Beet root powder may have some health benefits, mainly due to the high nitrate content of beets.

This may not only lower blood pressure, but also enhance exercise and athletic related activities.<br /><br />Beet root is also rich in betaine, also known as trimethylglycine (TMG). It has been shown to have a variety of health benefits, including possibly helping with weight loss and muscle gain. I have taken it for years.<br /><br />This powder seems highly concentrated and doesn't taste too bad; it has a kind of sweet and earthy taste, but I wouldn't call it amazing. It is worth trying before exercise, or just supplemented with a meal (I have put it in vegetable smoothies).<br /><br />I haven't noticed any particular benefits from it, like increased endurance, but I also lift regularly and use other forms of pre-workout, so it might be hard for me to see a benefit.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for beet root powder for a good price, check this out.",12952,13

For example, it contains lecithin, kelp, and apple pectin. Lecithin and apple pectin may help you digest fats better, theoretically ensuring that fat is used properly. Kelp contains iodine, which might positively impact metabolism if you have a deficiency.<br /><br />I mainly like vinegar for the acetic acid content, which may have a positive impact on longevity. Unfortunately, this formula doesn't list the percent of acetic acid in the vinegar.<br /><br />The main reason I knocked off a star is that the vinegar dose isn't as high because of the added extras.",12952,579

It does have ingredients that will likely benefit eye health (like zinc, taurine, and lutein). The formula isn't balanced the way I would like. I would prefer more lutein, and less beta-carotene.<br /><br />Also, be sure to take this formula with some fat or food, or else the lutein won't absorb, since it's fat soluble.",12952,1121

The main ingredients are the ""proprietary blend"" which contains glucosamine sulfate (which is the good form of glucosamine - avoid the HCL version), MSM, and Chrondroitin and a few other nutrients that may help ease pain and strengthen joints. I have been taking many of these ingredients for years and it could be the reason at 40 I still am able to run 80+ miles a month pain free.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of these ""blends."" Just tell us how much of each ingredient is in there. I take glucosamine and MSM regularly and it would be nice to know! Also, it's hard to find out anything about this company. A lot of these supplement companies start up and are basically importers of Chinese ingredients (not bad per se, since most raw materials are made there these days).

2.0,1645380877451,Looks Nice But Can’t Find A Way To Simply Toggle Back & Forth B/T Desired Cool & Warm Settings,"I have fine, dry, flat hair that gets frizzy at the ends. I blow dry with a large round brush and need to switch back and forth between warm and cool settings often to style my hair. I wrap my hair around the brush barrel, blow it with heat and then use a cool setting to lock in shape. I’m constantly switching between and heat and cool settings. But I haven’t found a practical way to do my routine with this Eniseca hair dryer. This hair dryer makes a good initial impression based just on looks in that it’s lightweight, nice looking in black with rose gold, compact, digital and comes nicely boxed with accessories. But I’ve tinkered around with it for days and can’t find a workable way to toggle back and forth between my desired warm and cool settings. I haven’t been able to properly style my hair once with this dryer.<br /><br />To explain, the heat setting comes on at 50 C, but I need it at about 76 C (max is 99 C). I have to press the plus button 26 times to get my desired heat level. After drying a section, I need a cool burst of air so I switch to cool air, but it defaults to 99 wind power. That’s way too strong, so I have to press the minus button 20 times or so to get a reduced usable air flow. It takes more time to adjust to the cool air flow than to actually use it. The worst part is that I then need to switch to heat again for the next hair section, but I can’t find a way to toggle back to 76 C as the heat button seems to default back to 50 C. So then I have to press the plus button 26 times again to get the right heat setting and that tedious cycle just continues. This is not a workable product for me. If there actually is a way to toggle between desired temperature and air flow settings and not be resetting constantly, then it’s far too complicated for me to figure out. I don’t like it. 2 stars.",14980,2004
5.0,1622440972712,Simple Boxes But Look Special In Gold▪️Hold Up Fine For Lightweight Gifts▪️Store Flat & EZ Assembly,"These PackQueen 6”x6”x4” square champagne gold boxes are attractive all occasion boxes. These are practical as they ship and store flat and are quick and easy to assemble. These aren’t made of heavy duty cardboard, but the materials are more than adequate for lighter weight gifts and they make a good impression in the gold color with a crisp white interior. They hold their form best when I take a moment to bend the creases before assembly.<br /><br />The bottoms are formed by interlocking flaps that fit together well and lay fairly flat, but these aren’t heavy duty, strong boxes. While not necessarily needed, I do like to add a little tape inside to reinforce the bottoms. It doesn’t show, and the bottoms feels more sturdy. But I have used a couple without tape, and they haven’t collapsed as they feel more secure once I add tissue or filling with a gift and tie a ribbon around the box or wrap it.<br /><br />These boxes are perfect for lightweight items like cosmetics, candles, a special ornament, small clothing items such as slipper socks, lingerie or a tee, and small accessories like gloves or a scarf. These are practical and pretty when finished off with a nice ribbon or bow. I find it convenient to already have these on hand as the need for a box arises, and the champagne gold color looks elegant. These make a good impression and exceed my expectations at the current price of $18.99 for 30 boxes ($.64 a box). Recommended. 5 stars.",14980,200
5.0,1611979834868,Attractive & Sturdy All Occasion Gift Bags In Crisp White w/ Shiny Gold Stars-Tissue Not Included,"These Packqueen gift bags are attractive and good quality bags that are super versatile given the design and generous sizing that can fit bigger and odd shaped items. The bags are crisp white with shiny gold foil stars and have long white ribbon handles. The shiny star pattern makes these perfect for an array of occasions such as graduations, birthdays, anniversaries, Father’s or Mother’s Day, Christmas, New Year’s, Valentine’s Day, housewarming and more.<br /><br />These large bags have a horizontal orientation (more width than height) that makes them great for gifting items such as shoes, clothing items like robes or sweat outfits, home goods and gourmet food, a kitchen tool set with mitts, small appliances, toys, books, blow dryers and all kinds of things. These measure about 10“ high, 5“ deep and 13“ wide.  The paper is thick and sturdy, and the bottoms are reinforced with a thin piece of white cardboard glued inside.<br /><br />The bags have clean, fresh look. They aren’t super premium gift bags like some I’ve seen adorned with faux gems, plastic handles and so on. But I’d classify these as high quality, premium bags that are plenty nice for special occasions. No tissue is included, and I personally think these look fabulous with patterned tissue with shiny dots or stripes, but they also look great with plain tissue in a range of colors such as navy, red, pink and so much more. I’m super pleased with the quality and design. Recommended. 5 stars.",14980,38

2.0,1594630786754,Nice Colors & Good Idea But These Extenders Just Fall Off As The Loops Don’t Secure Well,"I’ve tried so many brands of masks that loop around my ears trying to find a good fit, but most masks just pop right off my ears and fall off. I don’t know if it’s the shape of my ears, head size or what the issue Is, but a mask extender seemed like a potentially good solution to keep a mask secured in place. Unfortunately, these silicone extenders seem like a poor design that doesn’t help secure a mask in place.<br /><br />These extenders are only 5.5” long, and each extender has three notches on each side. The idea is to seat the ear loops into the notches to keep the mask on. But the extenders are short and flimsy, and the notches are shallow. The loops don’t securely fit down into the notches in a way where they don’t just separate from the extender. I’ve tried many times and find no way to hook the loops to the notches on the extender so the mask would stay in place. The extender just falls off, and so does the mask.<br /><br />I’ve tried using these extenders with various brand of masks with stretchy loops, but they don’t work with any of my masks. I don’t know if the extenders could work for a kid or teen or someone with a small head, but I still don’t see how the design of the notches can actually keep the mask loops securely in place. The extenders seem like they need a clip or a way to tie a loop to it or something to secure the loops besides the notches. The variety of colors is nice and I like the idea, but these extenders don’t work for me. 2 stars.",14980,8167
3.0,1577727662038,No Organic Label & No Laxative Effect-Might Help Fatigue & Sore Throat But May Be Coincidence,"This is my first time trying Haritaki. I can’t evaluate the purity of this or any other supplement. Notably, the label on my bag doesn’t indicate this is organic and neither does the Herb Essential India site referenced on the bag. The Amazon product page says it is organic and maybe the labeling has changed, but I can only go by the label and must assume (at least for now) this is not organic. I have no way of knowing if this Haritaki is free of contaminants.<br /><br />Haritaki is supposed to have many potential benefits. The package only refers to it as a “gentle laxative”. It says 3g to 5g can be taken twice daily but doesn’t say if that’s a general dose or for a laxative effect, or how long it should take to work as a laxative. I took two doses the first day and then went to one dose in the morning (each dose was about 5 to 6 grams) for 6 days total. I didn’t have any digestive problems, but this Haritaki didn’t have any laxative effect for me.<br /><br />Haritaki is extremely bitter (as expected) and is also so astringent it makes my mouth chalky and dry. I can get it down, but I have to mix it with a few ounces of sweet juice even though I don’t normally drink fruit juice. The package didn’t say what to mix the powder with, but I now see on the product page a picture showing to mix it with water. I don’t know if not mixing it in water prevented a laxative effect, but I doubt it as I always drank a full glass of water after taking a dose.<br /><br />I noticed a few things while taking Haritaki that might be related, or they could just be pure coincidence. The first day, I took it morning and night as directed. That night, I had the most lucid, bizarre, disturbing “dream” (a nightmare actually) that I can recall ever having, and I still remember it as it was so vivid. After that, I didn’t take an evening dose again and started only taking one dose in the mornings. While I understand it may be coincidence, I haven’t had a bad dream again.<br /><br />I came down with a bad sore throat that felt like the type that would last a few days and drank Haritaki mixed with juice, and my sore throat only lasted the one day. I get really fatigued most afternoons, and I felt more energetic when I took the Haritaki. I’ve since read Haritaki may treat a sore throat and increase energy, but my experience may be coincidence. I can’t fully recommend this product as it’s labeled a laxative but didn’t have that effect on me, and it’s not labeled organic. But it’s possible that it may have some beneficial properties. 3 stars.",14980,1110
4.0,1576107012535,"Good Protection, Good Colors, Coating For Comfort-Run Big, A Bit Bulky, Uncoated Pairs Less Comfy","These household gloves are made of PVC instead of latex and come in a 4-pack that includes 2 green flocklined pairs and 2 white/pink unlined pairs. Each pair is separately sealed. The colors are quite pretty compared to my standard yellow household gloves, and these gloves have cute details like scalloped rims at the opening with dots and little flowers.<br /><br />These gloves feel thicker and a little bulkier than my usual yellow latex gloves. I do like the feel of the cotton coating inside the two pairs of green gloves as it prevents and/or absorbs sweat and keeps them from feeling clammy or sticky inside. The white/pink unlined gloves don’t feel as comfortable as the PVC does feel sticky to my skin, but they’re ok for short time periods. I’d prefer all the gloves were coated with cotton inside.<br /><br />These gloves come up higher on my forearms than my similar household gloves, so they offer good protection of my arms and hands from hot or dirty water and grime when I’m washing dishes, cleaning the toilets and so on. The hands have a grippy exterior, so my dishes, wine glasses and other breakables don’t slip through my hands as easily.<br /><br />These gloves seem to run big. I normally wear a size L in household gloves, but the size L are roomy everywhere. I can and do still use them, but my dexterity isn’t quite as good, they slip down almost off my fingers and the arms gape open a bit much. I’ve reused both styles of gloves and haven’t had any issues of tearing, and I find these easy to get on and off. While not perfect, I like these household gloves for chores pretty well (especially the coated pairs). 3.5 stars.",14980,519

This organic blend sounds comprehensive with prebiotics, probiotics, fiber, vitamins, an antioxidant blend, detox blend, immune support, enzymes, organic greens, grass and more. This does contain green tea and coffee bean, so it may have caffeine (I don’t know).  I can’t judge the purity or nutrition of this supplement, but it sounds healthy, agrees with me and it’s easy to drink. I like it a lot. 4.5 stars.",14980,42
4.0,1528780414963,Super Effective At Getting Rid Of Buildup And Restoring My Hair Though The Fragrance Is So Strong It May Be A Put Off,"My dry hair has been misbehaving lately- it looks dull, feels rough and is unmanageable. I wash and condition every day using hard water and use at least three styling products daily. I’m scheduled to get my hair colored in five days and figured my hair looks lousy  because my hair needs coloring and perhaps because I’ve tried a number of different shampoos lately instead of sticking with my usual products. As it turns out, however, I simply needed a good clarifying shampoo.<br /><br />A clarifying shampoo is used to get rid of build up from hair products, minerals from hard water, chlorine, pool chemicals, oils, etc.  This Organic Doctor charcoal clarifying shampoo is black, thick and has a strong scent. This shampoo has an emphasis on organic and natural ingredients and looks better than a lot of shampoos as it doesn’t have many common chemicals (e.g., SLS, phalates and parabens), but it does appear to still contain some chemicals such as fragrance. The scent smells heavy and masculine to me and I’m not crazy about it, but surprisingly my hair smells good after it’s rinsed and dried. And the strong scent doesn’t trigger my allergies or cause any irritation.<br /><br />The first application didn’t lather much, but the second one created generous lather that I massaged through my hair and rinsed easily. My hair looks restored as it’s shiny and manageable again. It feels and looks healthy, and my color looks good. I had no idea my issues were due to the build up of things like minerals and hair care products. I’ll gladly endure the smell and use this once or twice a month to clarify (more often may affect my color) and swimmers and some others may benefit from using this more often. 4 stars.",14980,8198

He didn't use any tools that I saw, he just stretched it out from the slightly bent position it was in for shipping and plugged it in!  This lamp has two on switches so you can decide just how bright you want it.  There is a grill looking shield that protects the bulbs that I think is a great idea.

Just a couple of ounces of water, 1 stp of honey and 750 mgs of powder. Two times a day for long term health effects. I'll check back in a month or two with results. So far I have not had any side effects or undesirable stomach issues. My aim is over all reduction in inflammation, maybe some brain happiness /fitness, and longevity/energy. That's a lot to expect but as a bitter herb, this should be a good supplement. No jittery effects so far. The taste is strong, you can't cover it up. If you don't like bitter, earthy flavors, get capsules or encapsulate so you can avoid the flavor and be comfortable.

They're the favorite pans of the spouse for frying eggs, but are horrific looking on the outside.  Was hoping that this cleaner just might be ""strong"" enough to cut through the burnt-on food and not harm the aluminum to badly.  Sorry, pans - you still look hideous!  I do have one pan that has that non-stick stone-looking surface inside and out, and it did clean up the bit of discoloration on the outside, so that was good for the reputation of The Crown Choice Cleaner & Polisher.

I had been taking a different brand of Tumeric of 2,100 mg for 3 capsules, but now have started only with the 2 GGs capsules.  (According to the GG bottle - 2,250 mg total for 3 capsules....a lot more!)  The literature here also mentions that this GG Tumeric is 1,100 mg per serving, see what I mean?  Doing some research, the consensus seems to be an average of 1,200 to 1,800 mg per day, or another opinion at about 500 to 2,000 mg per day....what to do?  This question arose because I've also started taking a homeopathic natural skin supplement formula that includes 300 mg of Tumeric per day.  All of them include the black pepper for better absorption.  I just don't want to overdose, so I'm sticking somewhere with the average.  Anyway, I think Tumeric is a very good way to help with osteoarthritis, high cholesterol, itchy skin, and it also helps the liver, and has good anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.  So far I'm pleased, and am hoping that my inside and outside will reap the benefits.  4 stars because of my questions.

When you have the machine on, it constantly lights the display (showing what settings are chosen) in BRIGHT BLUE.  This is widely reputed to be the worst light color to sleep near, and it certainly causes me to have difficulty relaxing.

Although the Biotin level is quite high which may cause a problem for some people overtime. I was surprised that it did not contain Vitamin A or or some kind of Retinol. I would think that would be included to help the skin. But this formula does contain a good mixture of other helpful ingredients like Fo-Ti and Alpha Lipoic Acid along with some I do not recognize like Nori Yaki and Wakame. I do appreciate that it is made with no GMO ingredients. I would like this formula better if it had a higher dose of calcium and if it did not have the substances listed in the “Other ingredients” section as I do not believe they are good for anyone. Also sometimes a pharmaceutical glaze on tablets like these does not allow the tablet to dissolve so the ingredients can be absorbed in the digestive tract so I crack it open with my teeth before swallowing it.<br />It’s difficult to measure results with a product like this. However, since I have been taking it my nails have been getting a little stronger, not breaking as easily. I do not notice anything yet with my hair and skin. The tablets do have distinct smell that you have to get past before you can get it down as well. Overall I think this formula could be of benefit to have regularly in your diet if you can get past all of the other non-beneficial things in it.",16320,527
3.0,1600540074285,It’s an okay formula.,"I had needed more CQ10 and saw this product. It was packaged nicely so I thought I’d give it a try.  When I received it and checked out the ingredients. The Coenzyme Q10 is the Ubidecarenone form which has to be broken down in the body to the Ubiquinol (CQ10). This is a problem for older people because the ability to break it down is declines with age. Fortunately I am not old enough that it’s a problem. The Vitamin E is d-alpha tocopheryl acetate which is okay but I’d rather have just simple d-alpha tocopheryl.  I was disappointed to find listed in the “Other Ingredients” section on the label is polysorbate 80. This is chemical is used to help disperse the ingredients, keep the gel consistency and etc. But according to it’s own MSDS it May cause adverse reproductive effects, cancer and may affect our genetic material (mutagenic).<br />After seeing the polysorbate 80 in it I did not think I should take it.<br />Others may not mind these types of ingredients but I want to be vigilant in keeping myself healthy which includes watching what I put in my body. I did not mind the rest of the ingredients. The softgels swallowed easy enough even though they are larger than other supplements I take. And the manufacturer tried to think of a good mix of ingredients to help everything absorb better.<br />I would not recommend this product for everyone only really healthy individuals and I would not recommend taking it everyday.

I find it is way more effective in fighting illness than pharmaceuticals, and it doesn't have any negative side effects or kill off the ""good"" bacteria in my gut. Until now, I have been taking the herb in capsule form, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it in a powder instead.<br /><br />Super Organics has made themselves a winner with this organic astragalus powder. It's non-GMO and doesn't contain any chemicals, additives or pesticides. It's just pure pulverized astragalus root packaged in a resealable bag.<br /><br />To protect yourself during cold and flu season, or to help your body fight an infection you may already have, just add one scoop (about 1/2 teaspoon) of this powder to your favorite beverage or smoothie, and blend well. It doesn't add any noticeable change to the taste or texture of your drink, so long as it is thoroughly mixed in with a blender or shaker bottle.<br /><br />While this is not as easy to take as a capsule, I do think it is absorbed faster. That means you are getting the healthy benefits right away. It's vegan, gluten-free and plant-based, so your body should not react negatively in any way--unlike antibiotics and other over-the-counter cold and flu remedies.<br /><br />This 8 ounce package contains about 76 servings, which means it should last about 2 and 1/2 months.

I was a bit skeptical, because I thought it smelled kind of funny, and I was somewhat squeamish about adding something so green to my food and drink. However, given the opportunity to try it for free, I thought I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />This Super Organics Organic Wheatgrass Powder makes it easy to get my greens. It is organic, non-GMO, vegan and packed with powerful nutrients. One serving (less than a teaspoon) of this powder contains 89% of an adult's daily recommended amount of Vitamin C, 77% Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), 42% Thiamin (B1) and significant amounts of 4 other vitamins. It's easy to digest. It doesn't taste or smell nearly as strong as I would have thought, and as long as you put it in something that is brightly colored, it doesn't make it look strange.<br /><br />I figured that, since wheatgrass is made of the green stalks of young wheat, that people with gluten intolerance would not be able to consume it. However, when I checked online, I read that wheat- and barley-grass both lack the protein that makes people with gluten allergies sick. Check with your doctor to be sure, but I think it's safe.<br /><br />This powder is very fine and is packed in a resealable pouch that stands up on your shelf. It comes with a cute little scoop for measuring. It does not need to be refrigerated, but should be stored in a cool, dry place.<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy super-food with a lot of nutrition in a small amount, this is a good choice. You can add it to smoothies, like I did, or make a ""wheatgrass shot"" with one scoop of powder to 2 ounces of water.

They provide color in the tub and a fairly light aroma. They are average bath bombs. They certainly do enough to fill the tub with a little bit of foam and color. Overall this is a very average set.

However, it’s certainly always handy to have the resource. It’s also small enough that it could be placed underneath the sound machine to always have on hand.<br /><br />The white noise machine comes with a cord but it does not come with a wall adapter. So it is important to have one of those or some sort of other outlet.<br /><br />The touch type buttons on the top of the sound machine are immediately responsive. This has not always been my experience with touch buttons so that’s very important to me.<br /><br />There are six nature sounds, four lullabies and  six white noises to choose from. There is one lullaby in particular I really like that doesn’t get irritating like some others do, but that’s just personal preference. There is a nice variety and it has a very pure sound.<br /><br />The volume is controlled by the touch buttons and can get quite loud especially for a sound machine. I think it’s very helpful that the speaker is directly on top of the sound machine. It really helps project the sound.<br /><br />There is a timer option. The timer options are 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes. The button can also be held to turn the timer completely off. I personally don’t use the timer.<br /><br />The outer portion of the sound machine is a cloudy white color. Everywhere that’s the cloudy white color can potentially light up to one of the night light colors. There is a large variety for different settings and different preferences.

I am not sure which of these factors led to it working better for me, but I would probably be safe to assume it was the overall serving size versus what I was seeing with the original formula.<br /><br />All said, this had a decent impact on my focus the first couple of weeks of use. After a month, however, I wasn't able to notice anything compared to if I missed a day. I tried this by using it five days a week and taking two off. Sure, there are always traces of supplements that remain for ""off days"", but I got to a point where I didn't feel too much different. That has been magnified in the time since I emptied the bottle.

Yes, there is that BCAA aftertaste that happens with nearly every supplement. However, in this one it is not as pronounced. I otherwise really enjoy the flavor of this After Party.<br /><br />Without this it is more like a hangover, so it's a great play on words with the product name. This does keep things going and has kept me from crashing or otherwise being sore. Unlike many other post-workouts, this one has caffeine in it as well. That is a nice thing to have to keep things flowing for another half hour or so after finishing a workout.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this based on the ingredients alone, and would further recommend it on the fact that it works. I'll give a five star recommendation to anyone who can figure out the after taste plus give me the ingredients and impact of a great intra or post workout supplement.",20222,6891

I am personally a fan of stevia and think that it may have been an ingredient that was missing with this. That said, I can't be sure because I have NO idea what this is SUPPOSED to taste like.<br /><br />Let's start with monk fruit, which is an ideal sweetener. However in this case there either is not enough or what is enough is countered by some of the taste of the nootropics and other preworkout ingredients. Would the addition of stevia helped this? Would those who are for whatever reason opposed to stevia had been more open to this had there been a better taste because of it?<br /><br />I am not sure, but I do wish that there was a better flavor for this as the ingredients ARE good and they DO help once you choke it down....but I am not willing to choke something like this down when there are numerous alternatives on the market.",20222,1604

I have never gone so long without any type of discomfort in my belly prior to using this. Sure, there are always going to be things we eat that cause some discomfort, but overall this has been wonderful.

Seen no adverse reactions. Really like that it's vegan and certified organic made from US plants, not cooked up in some Chinese garage. Does it work?

With no ""proprietary blends"" or other mystery meat nonsense in the list. Very fine powder, super easy to mix. Taste was more subtle than many chocolate protein powders, little weak, but it was just fine for me.<br /><br />It's low fat, low sugar, low chemical additive, no-milk product, mostly organic protein powder.

But if you want to add this to your supplement mix this is probably the best way to do it. Now, on it's own, it is gritty and tastes, well, like ground up leaves. Not my cup of tea, at all.

The mask is large enough so that it blocks the light out completely around your eye sockets. The two strap setup ensures that the straps do not constrict, or irritate your ears. Also, the length adjustments are on the side not behind your head so you can position the claps where you need them for maximum comfort.

I did notice an additional creamy texture. The powder itself doesn't really have any flavor; it's just bonus protein.<br /><br />The next thing to try is making Keto chicken strips with almond flour and this protein powder.

5.0,1579655617635,Comfortable.  Does not touch eyelashes.,"This sleep mask is very comfortable to wear.  The “eye” sections are contoured enough so that it does not touch my eyelashes at all, and so it does not mess up my mascara.  The contour of it also makes it fit right to my face, so it does not let in any light.  The elastic strap has a section of Velcro in the back so it is adjustable to fit different head sizes.  The instructions say to adjust the “nose flap” for comfort.  I don’t see any nose “flap” at all, so I think they mean to adjust the position of the mask on the bridge of your nose so that it sits comfortably (and it IS comfortable).  The strap is securely sewn to the mask, so this looks like it will last a while.  The material is similar to a padded bra or the cup built into some ladies’ swim suits (so it will hold its shape).

I can wash dishes in very hot water and the heat does not burn me.  The gloves come all the way up my forearm—they are just slightly under 13 inches long from the tip of the middle finger to the opening.  The palm area is slightly textured for a good grip.

2.0,1569105579289,Not one size fits all. Made for a tall person probably a size large.,"I was excited to get these pants and I wanted to like them but they are just not working for me for a lot of reasons.  The “one size fits all” is not true. I am only 5 feet tall and 120 pounds. I would normally wear a small and these are probably a large.<br /><br />They are advertised as high waisted and they are VERY high waisted. The waist band is about 6 inches high. I doubled it over and they are still very high-waisted.<br /><br />Not to be graphic, but I can grab a whole handful of excess fabric at the crotch. If I pull them up further to loose that excess fabric, they are even higher at the waist.<br /><br />I had to roll up the pant legs about 3 inches at the ankles.<br /><br />I am also not pleased about the fabric. It’s 88 percent polyester and 8 percent spandex—which should be okay normally, but these pants have no “control” feel to them at all. They don’t “hold you in” at all. They are also not smooth to the touch-they are more of a woven or knit fabric.<br /><br />Last but not least, there is no way I am going to hand wash or dry clean this type of garment as the tag instructs.  An evening gown yes—but yoga/work out pants—nope. If this can’t go in my washing machine, it’s not for me.<br /><br />On the positive side, the inside of the pants near your skin is like a jersey feel (they are advertised as fleece lined and they do have a bit of a warm fuzzy feel to them.). This is soft and would be nice in winter. But that can also be too warm if you are active.<br /><br />If my review was helpful please let Amazon know by clicking “helpful”.",20734,11

It’s made of fantastic quality and doesn’t have a brand name cluttering the main piece, which is a plus for me. But the best part is the massaging vibration; it’s nice that you can use it with and without the vibration. The rolling quartz attachment feels so good and relaxing on the skin.<br /><br />Tip: place it in a cup of ice as I did in my picture to give your skin a cooling massage in the morning. Ice is excellent to put on your face as it helps with anti-aging and helps blood flow to your face. It prevents wrinkles and relieves puffiness from a night with not much sleep or when you wake up feeling puffy. Usually, I will use an ice cube or a spoon put in a cup of ice, but this wand makes it so much better because it rolls and vibrates and is way less messy than an ice cube.

4.0,1624847115219,Quick pick-me-up,"A very nice set of shower steamers, lots of different fragrances to choose from. It's a very pretty box and ideal for gifting too. One steamer lasted me 3 showers. A lot depends on where you place the disc, the temperature of the water and definitely, how long your showers last. I placed them in a small soap dish with holes on the bottom, in a corner of the shower, away from direct stream from the showerhead. The fragrances are light but certainly discernible. I have allergies, so strongly perfumed products typically become more of an irritant. But these are pleasing. They do bleed color (as expected) while you shower but they also wash out by the time you're done showering. A nice pick me up first thing in the morning to wake up and feel refreshed. Alternatively, you could also use these as air fresheners in a restroom, if you peel away a bit of the plastic layer. Or even as scent boosters for clothes (especially if you store clothes away seasonally). However, maybe remove the plastic seal, wrap in wax paper so the color doesn't deposit on clothes, make some holes in the wax paper for the fragrance to waft. It's a fun product.",24711,1616

Good absorption and odor eliminator. Washes super easy by hand. If you're using just as panty liners, they can be washed easily in a linen bag on a gentle cycle with other delicates in a small load and dried on low heat in the dryer. Otherwise, they're best hand washed. There are 4 medium sized ones that correspond in size to regular sized pads and 2 small ones for lighter days that correspond to panty liner size.

I had purchased some before, they weren't very good, and they weren't cheap either.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this 『Workman's Friend Leather Conditioners』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it comes in a square tin jar, with 4oz (118 ml) of all-natural leather conditioner. Once the lid is removed, you can see a lard-like color & wax texture, so you know this, when applied to any leather surface, it will stick & won't run off the shoe contours wasting valuable conditioner. But, how does it work, especially compared to the ones I had bought from shoe sales clerks?<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />==========<br />  In order to better test this new leather conditioners, I dug out one of my older, but still favorite, pair of leather dress shoes which has been neglected since I ran out of any leather protection solution or cream. I took out a cotton ball, and dipped some of this Workman's Friend Leather Conditioner onto my shoes. After only several back and forth wipes on the surface, I can already visibly see shine, as it really gets into the leather to nourish & moisturize the leather, just like I'd put on night serum to better protect my facial skins. Again,due to its lard- and wax-like texture, it really stays on the surface well, and give off that shine, especially compared to my untreated left shoes (see review  video). I even sprayed some mist on both left & right shoes, the treated right shoes protects the surface well, while water mist left shoes wet.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't just work well on shoes, I tried it on my leather messenger bags, leather jackets, belts, this leather Conditioner really help restore the shines, and give second life, and extend it's longevity.<br /><br />❣️💕💕💞👍 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍💞💕❣️",29384,1742

My fingers can't reach those buttons when I'm holding on to the handle.<br /><br />I also found the sound to be quite loud. I'm not saying it is any louder than other hair dyers but probably about the same. It says 60 decibel and I don't know what my other hair dryers are on the noise level but it doesn't feel like it is any less loud.<br /><br />I really like the magnetic nozzles that just snap onto the head. You can also turn it around if you want the wind to go a certain direction on your hair. I like the variety of nozzles they provided, which you usually don't get with other cheaper hair dryers.<br /><br />What makes this hair dyer special is the negative ions/lava nutrients but I didn't notice much, if any, difference on my hair. I have long hair, quite dry and sometimes frizzy from damage of hair dyes, so I don't think any special technology will do much to fit it. If you have good condition hair, perhaps you'll get a more noticeable difference. Mine is too tangled up on a daily basis to notice.<br /><br />Make sure to remove all the sticker that was protecting the machine prior to use. There was one I forgot to take off, which seemed to be blocking the air so the machine was making an extra loud muffled noise. Make sure to check the entire machine to ensure you removed the packaging, which can be dangerous especially when the machine/wind starts getting hot.<br /><br />Overall this is a beautiful hair dryer with a cool, modern design. I do like it but it isn't the hands down favorite one for me. If you don't mind about the layout of the buttons perhaps this will be an excellent choice for you.",33382,7347
4.0,1644038797422,Very “clean” product but my face needs more scrubbing,"This cocoa face scrub has a very short list of ingredients, which shows how “clean” this stuff is. I didn’t see it posted on this Amazon page so I had to do some extra research and this is what I found.<br /><br />Ingredients: Glycerin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract*, Tocopherol *Organic Ingredient<br /><br />Short and sweet!<br /><br />While I do love the ingredients, I found it to have a little too paste like consistency and not enough grit. I prefer a rougher scrub with more “stuff”, like ground up nuts or something that will at least scrub the built up gunk from my face. There were some but it wasn’t much. I kept squeezing more paste onto my hands so I could get more grit, and probably ended up using more than I needed, which is a little wasteful. I don’t dislike the results though as my face felt clean, soft, and moisturized afterwards. It smells like cocoa, a light scent, not at all overwhelming.<br /><br />I personally prefer more grit in my face scrubs. I do love this brand and how clean their stuff is but this scrub is way too gentle for what I need. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a gentle scrub with less grit.",33382,358
4.0,1633642980421,"smells like lavender, good sized bottle","I don't get too many essential oils from unknown brands because I'm not well versed enough to tell if something is ""fake"". I know having a popular name brand doesn't necessarily equate to ""real"" essential oils, but at least you get a general idea of the company's reputation. I threw some caution to the wind with this one because I was just going to get lavender, which isn't anything too expensive and is a pretty common essential oil. Although I don't know how pure this oil is, it smells like lavender to me. So far I've used a few drops in my diffuser and it made the room smell nice. I also put a few drops down the kitchen sink daily, as deodorizer. I do have to admit after seeing some of the reviews I am a little hesitant and wonder if this has been mixed or diluted with other ""stuff"". I don't plan to repurchase but I think as long as you aren't using this topically (and of course NEVER ingest this!) on your skin or plan to inhale this on a long term basis, it is fine. This works great for what I am using it for.",33382,2007
5.0,1631486996377,"very good quality shower steamer, no added coloring and unnecessary ""stuff""","Not sure why there are complaints about medicinal smells but that's kind of what these shower steamers are for. This one doesn't have eucalyptus but it does have menthol to open up your nasal passage as the shower water releases steam from these tablets. If you don't like eucalyptus scent (think Vicks Vaporub in a tablet form) that really open up your nasal passage I would recommend going with this one. It has more of a fruity scent. This has a good balance of orange and lemongrass, I get a whiff of both. I actually thought these took a little while to dissolve than other shower steamers I've used. I also appreciate that these tablets have no added colorants like mica - I like these tablets to be white in color and don't need them to be some fancy colors. Overall I am very happy with these tablets and think they're great. These also seem to be of much better quality than some of the cheap ones I've seen (usually made in China) - those definitely have a lot of unnecessary additives like colors and very low quality ""essential oils"". Price wise these cost about as much as the Vicks Vaporub tablets but I believe they're larger per tablet. These are Made in USA, if it matters to you.",33382,9542
5.0,1631248218034,These are great!,"Not sure why there are complaints about medicinal smells but that's kind of what these shower steamers are for. I've used the type that just smells ""nice"", floral and what not, but I always come back to eucalyptus type scents. I just like that it opens my nasal passage while the steam and the eucalyptus evaporates. I could be a little biased because I LOVE eucalyptus essential oils. These ones are a little more fragile than other shower steamers I've used in that when I toss one in the shower it breaks in half. It doesn't really matter to me if they are whole or in half but it was just an observation I made. I actually thought these took a little while to dissolve than other shower steamers I've used. This one still smells very eucalyptus to me even if it is frankincense + eucalyptus. Although these are marketed for ""gentlemen"", it is great for anyone and everyone. It doesn't smell any more masculine than the other scents. Overall I am very happy with these tablets and think they're great. These also seem to be of much better quality than some of the cheap ones I've seen (usually made in China).

5.0,1628821715499,"melt in your mouth strips, no peeling off afterwards","These are different from the whitening strips I used to get (the popular brand in drugstores and everywhere) because you just stick these on and let it melt in your mouth. There is no peeling anything off after the 15 minutes, which seems to be a better concept than the ones where you have to peel off afterwards. The strips are thin and tiny, should most likely fit the row of teeth. There is no folding or tucking required, no bulky feeling. Once you stick these on, your mouth will feel a dry and the inside of the mouth will be stuck to the strips. I didn't want to move my mouth too much as the strips are working so that made my mouth feel even drier. I'm only on day 2 of these strips and although the instructions say to use twice a day, I am only doing it once a day because I'm worried about teeth sensitivity. After the 15 minutes was up I did rinse my mouth with tap water, and the water did make my teeth feel a little sensitive. It felt fine afterwards. I think these strips are great and I can't wait to see the results at the end of 4 weeks. If used twice a day, the instructions say you'll see it whiten to 7 shades in two weeks. There are 56 strips per box. The expiration date is printed on every foil packet (all 56 packets).<br /><br />My only improvement feedback for this product is they could have packaged two strips in each foil packet instead of one, just to cut down on the waste. I have to say Moon's outer box and the individual strip packaging already seem to use much less material than the big name brands but it'll be even better if they put two strips per package, as most people are going to whiten their top and bottom teeth together anyway.",33382,3489
5.0,1617471944174,10 stars!,"This face cream feels so gentle on my skin. I have been loving probiotic face creams lately as they are usually gentle, not very fragrance or fragrance free. This one is fragrance free as well, which I appreciate the break from some of my other heavier scented creams. This cream is creamy, easy to apply throughout the entire face. My face feels soft and moisturized and no sticky or tacky feeling with this one! Looking at the ingredients list I also noticed this one does not have dimethicone - yay! - which seems so rare these days because 8/10 face creams I try has dimethicone. I really like this product and how it feels and does to my skin.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this is the pod style refill. I rarely see this kind of packaging with skincare products although every company should be doing this! I don’t know how many beautiful, perfectly fine face cream containers I’ve had to throw away... if every company could do this refill style packaging that would help reduce the amount of plastic waste. It would be even better if the refill pod is a biodegradable container. Overall, very happy with this wonderful face cream in every aspect!",33382,612
5.0,1612751364071,my lashes pop thanks to this (and good mascara),"I’ve used heated eyelash curlers over the years but they have always been battery powered. This is my first rechargeable one and it is much better not having to worry about batteries. It also has 4 different heat levels which most heated curlers do not have. I also like the LCD screen that shows you the heat level and battery life. There is only one button so it is very simple to use. It heats up pretty quickly but I usually turn it on when I get started with my makeup so that by the time I’m doing my lashes it is nice and warm. It is so lightweight and compact (shaped like a tube of mascara). It has made my lashes really pop! It says to use it after mascara but I’ve found that kind of melts the mascara and makes a little mess so I usually do it before applying anything. This heated eyelash curler really works, it’s great!",33382,3909

You don’t want to have to buy a big thing of detergent just for washing 1-2 loads then throwing away the practically full bottle of detergent because you can’t take it home with you. These sheets are so easy to use and so convenient! I gave these a try and I was thinking these would leave white residue on some of my laundry but it did not. These dissolved into the laundry very nicely and my clothes came out clean and fresh smelling. I will be saving the rest of it for when we get to travel again. You just need to bring a few sheets, put it in a ziplock bag - it barely takes up any space in your travel bag/luggage. I hope they come out with different scented ones.",33382,1527

3.0,1600304461899,Cute designs but I will stick with paper towels,"I thought these were going to be much stronger and somehow different from paper towels but they are ALMOST like paper towels - just slightly stronger. This is basically paper towels you can hand wash once or twice and won’t immediately disintegrate. I was able to rip these, but once it was wet it was a little bit harder to tear (but still tore when I tried to). These are slightly less thicker than a paper towel. I believe these were meant to be used and hand washed 2-3 times and it should be able to withstand that if you are not deliberately trying to tear it apart. The concept of these is to use it like a dish/cleaning rag but one that is to be washed after use, air dried, re-used, and thrown away after a few uses - unlike using a traditional cloth rag where it gets stinky then you throw it in the laundry. These have cute prints on them but the rolls are smaller than most paper towels.<br /><br />While I like the product, the price of these for 3 rolls was too much and would not be able to justify replacing paper towels for these.",33382,226

This vibrating roller will be a lifesaver! I tested out the vibration and I like the intensity of it. What’s great is there is 3 different interchangeable heads so I can try all of them to see what works best for relief. At the end of the day, this will also be great as what it actually is made for - to drain out toxins from the face so that it glows! It came with a velvet pouch for storage. I know this set does not have the most fancy packaging but I got this for myself so it is not a big deal. Most people just throw out the packaging anyway, which is why they’ve included a drawstring velvet pouch for storage. Overall, I really like this set and would recommend it. It requires 1 AA battery so have one prepared before your package arrives (you won’t want to wait to test it out!).

It simply is a naturally smelly supplement, as quite a few supplements I know of are.<br />  I actually have another very good brand of Sam-e that I’m currently not finished with and it definitely isn’t an enjoyable smell but, I could care less because of how it helps me.😁 Anyway, I would definitely recommend it. Oh, this one is also great because, it’s 500mg with 1 capsule and the other I have needs 2 caps to get 500mg. Nice!",34057,7901
4.0,1610096299326,Great way to wake up!,"This stuff definitely has some fine ingredients to help get some of my morning fog and sloth out of my way.😁 It’s as advertised too, because it definitely has quite a few of things I often take separately and they in this and mostly with respectable amounts to replace them. It’s Caffeine-Free but, these things really help me get going and my brain to process well.<br />  I’m definitely a fan of it now and would recommend it.<br />  Cons: Only one thing: It’s made in the USA and they say it’s GMP Certified in their advertising, which is important to me and a good thing but, it doesn’t say anything about it on the bottle and it should, especially so I wouldn’t have had to search all over for it.",34057,800

With that said, I have to say that this kit, with the little frame that goes over the mouth and nose, does help to keep a mask from completely smothering my face as bad as without it. I can commend these folks for putting together a nice little kit that has a mix of things to make this mess a little more tolerable and would definitely recommend them.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!",34057,717

I couldn’t find anything about that on the bottle or anywhere in the pages for the Terraflora Probiotics they make and I hope they show this on the bottles in the future because, I really like to know all I can about my intake and hope to find the information easily because, there’s lots of competition in supplements.",34057,256

My only issue is something I hold Every Supplement Company up to and that’s them sharing their information on their testing practices for Purity, Quality and Quantity; they show nothing. I know it’s made in the USA, which is a “general” plus for the safety of supplements but, I like to see information I can actually confirm if I decided to.<br />  Hopefully they do in the future because, they do seem to be pretty decent.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",34057,16111

I’m really picky on wanting all of the information I can about the quality of a product I’m taking.<br />  I figure that this company is relatively new because of using bags instead of containers. I always like to see new companies make a success of themselves and hopefully they share more information in the future because, there’s a great deal of competition they’re up against.

On the other hand, if you’re looking for a protein for specific needs for health issues or for cooking, I’d probably recommend this above any I’ve ever had; and that’s many. This is safe for those with diabetes, it’s Keto Certified, Gluten-Free, low in Lactose for those dealing with stomach issues and it’s grass fed without any hormones. It’s also Non-GMO and GMP Certified and made in an FDA Registered Facility.<br />  It mixes with essentially anything, due to it being unflavored, which is pretty nice.

The bottle is even made of brown glass for the best storage possible. It’s also made in San Diego, California so, that means that, I believe, it’s made under the most stringent Safety Rules on the planet. I would Definitely recommend this product.

5.0,1622942164560,Beautiful in and out of the water,These are very generously sized bath bombs. They come individually wrapped which is nice in case you want to gift them individually. If you're planning to keep them for yourself they work well even in larger tubs to fizz up the water and add plenty of color. These also have really nice scents although it's a little hard to really distinguish one scent from another. The swirling colors through the bath bomb do make the water a really pretty marble effect initially and then of course as the water blends more together you get more of one tone but it's quite pretty while these are dissolving.,34240,1542

It's very cute. We actually hung it on the side of the snack table and it looked great. One thing I would love to see them change in the future is to include a fully rounded cord to use to string these letters together as opposed to a ribbon, since the ribbon is prone to twisting which can make the letters stick out a little bit wonky. But otherwise this is really charming.",34240,10098

3.0,1593385817919,Pricey and they don't taste great,I love this brand and have used numerous products from them. This is the first product I've tried from this brand that hasn't completely blown me away. For one you only get a week supply which is pretty lousy for a biotin vitamin even a gummy. The other is that the taste is not great. I've tried countless biotin gummies and other vitamin gummies in the past and this is definitely the worst. It's not instantly terrible but it does have that cherry cough syrup taste that seems to intensify after you've already eaten them. The other thing is that you absolutely must take these with food. I usually like to take my biotin gummies in the evening and if I haven't eaten recently they will make me feel sick. So all in all I don't think I would repurchase these again but I still do love the brand.,34240,9522

They'd make a perfect gift but I kept them for myself.  I honestly couldn't tell one scent from another with these but none of them had an offensive strong odour.

This cream doesn't proclaim any magical anti aging properties other than a vague slow the signs of aging.<br /><br />What it does deliver on is really soothing and calming your skin.  I've been using it nightly and my skin is very dry and I use this in the evening after my usual serum.  It is nice and rich and sinks in to my skin easily leaving it feeling calm and smooth.<br /><br />There's no scent and I didn't experience any adverse reactions.

Honestly I couldn’t really discern the different scents but I liked that they didn’t dry my skin out. I live in a hard water area so they took a little while to fully dissolve but they make for a lovely relaxing bath time. So far the rose scented is my favourite but it’s a very faint scent.<br /><br />I don’t have a plastic bath so I didn’t encounter any staining and the bath was easy to clean with no dye coming off on my towel afterwards. No sensitivity issues either.,34332,716

You can pour in the exact amount you want for bubbles. It has a very very light scent that I found hard to discern as lavender. That said it makes for a lovely relaxing bath. It’s moisturizing and soothing and I would absolutely try more in the range. The bottle itself is plastic so you don’t have to worry about keeping it in the bathroom and it’s pretty enough that you can leave it out.,34332,1494

5.0,1660939361132,Sort of weird at first - but does leave hands feeling good,"This massager is pretty neat.  I have tried one or two others that were very similar although I think I prefer this one.  Wy?  Because unlike the two others that REALLY crushed my wrist – like trying to remove it from my hand – with some of the settings – nothing here does that.  Sure, on some of the modes you feel it more in the wrist area – but it is not too crazy.<br /><br />It is easy to operate and there are three main modes and then three levels of intensity for each.  There is also one button for heat – and let’s face it, who doesn’t always want to use the heat? : )  It is easy to charge and the charge seems to last quite a long time – definitely multiple uses easily.  It also has clear instructions of how your hand should fit and rest – the others I have tied had no such instruction.  So, this is helpful for proper placement of your hands.<br /><br />If you are not used to this type of machine, I would definitely say work up to the strongest modes.  Personally, I like to star on the first mode at the lowest setting.  After a few minutes I switch it to the next mode on the lowest setting, then after a few more – the next mode.  Then I circle back to the first mode but put it on level 2 – and then I do the same for the next two modes. Circling back once again, I do each for a few minutes at the highest intensity. When I remove my hands – the dots are present in my skin – but my hands feel great.  Working up is the way to go.  I really do like using this machine.<br />I hope that you have found my review “helpful”. : )  Enjoy your day! : )",34437,16227
4.0,1655148007414,Easily paired - Decent speaker – Cute light,"I am not sure if I would truly call this thing a noise machine.  There are ONLY 5 sounds.  Rather I would call it a Bluetooth speaker that has a few sounds as well as a light.  Again, there are only 5 sounds.  All are decent enough for what they are - except for the campfire – that sounds weird and I would never guess it is a fire at all – almost like a clinking – thought it was weird chimes actually.<br /><br />It was VERY easy to pair with my phone and that is what I will predominantly be using this as – a Bluetooth speaker.  You can use the buttons to help with the music tracks but personally, I find it easier just to do it all on my phone anyway. The sound is pretty nice for most music I played.  The ones with constant beaty treble, though – sometimes sound a little staticky – mostly with fast repetitive pop.  Everything else sounded really good on this speaker.  It also played plenty loud for my needs.<br /><br />The light function is OK.  It is not very bright and really can’t be used to see.  Might be good as a night light or just to set the mood with some friends listening to music. It is also pretty small – so can easily fit on even a small table.<br /><br />The thing I was not a fan of – again, for my needs, is when you flip the thing over it turns into a nightlight and turns the speaker off.  If you – or one of your guests – do this – your speaker totally disconnects.  To pair with the phone again – you have to completely power off and then power back on to pair again.  Might be good for someone’s needs – but I just wish that was different.<br />I hope that you have found my review “helpful”. : )  Enjoy your day! : )",34437,170
5.0,1655145380023,Smells good – fresh,I like this oil.  It smells like real oil not that fake sweet stuff you can get sometimes.  Other stuff can also smell like cleaner or astringent or something.  This just smells like lemons – but more of the rind – like the zest of it.  Nice – pungent without being overpowering.  Works well I my water diffusers as well as my waterless diffusers.  A neutral smell which just helps the house to smell fresh.<br />I hope that you have found my review “helpful”. : )  Enjoy your day! : ),34437,40
3.0,1647900202483,Works but not designed for ease of use,"The first thing that sets this apart from other similar devices is that it comes with a “cover”.  It says it is for sweat and stuff.  OK – I guess.  It is sort of a pain to put on and looks weird as it attaches to the front of the device with velcro but wraps the entire inside. I prefer t sue it without the cover as any type of movement at all – even maybe breathing – you can hear the velcro on the cover make noise.  It is so weird. No cover – it is silent. I guess it would have been better if it were black but the directions say it was designed to transmit the light through. I just skip it.<br /><br />The power bank plug comes disassembled which is a little odd.  At first I thought it was one f those plugs that rotated in the socket so that is why.  But nope – it doesn’t rotate.  I think the only reason it comes in two pieces is so it fits in the box – and that is weird.  It does fit – but weird.  There is no direction about putting it together – but it is not rocket science. But no mention in the directions.<br /><br />The belt itself seems to work fine in regards to red light therapy – it is just not the easiest to operate and use for a few reasons.  First, the power button is in the middle of the buttons – and I am dumbfounded at that.  All the buttons are close together and look the same.  And actually, they are not buttons at all.  It is hard to see what you are pressing and hard to see what setting it is on.  All of the lights for the buttons are also colored the same – except for the time which is blue.  You can barely read the words on the “buttons” as the print is teeny.  Lastly – unless you are going to use this thing like on your abdomen or your upper front, though – the button placement is not great.  Maybe if you are a teeny tiny petite person and you wrap it around your waist – the buttons may fall at the front if you are treating your back.  For me – they are at my side when treating my back. It is weird that they are at my side and I can not see what the heck I am doing. You can’t really feel your way either.  I, instead turn the thing on on my abdomen and then have to swing it around to my back.  Plus, since the buttons are not really buttons and are easy to change inadvertently – you can mistakenly turn it off or change the setting easily while using.<br /><br />This thing would have been MUCH better with a remote attached to the cord like most others – or even an actual remote.  It does come with a detachable battery pouch and a USB cord so I guess you could hook it up to a battery pack and use it that way which is good.  I just plug it in for the wall as I am not going to walk around with it personally and I use it when I’m relaxing - like sitting on the couch.  It fits me just fine and will fit bigger people – although it is not that big.<br /><br />So, it’s fine – it is just odd to use.  I have used others that were much easier to use.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : )",34437,2061
5.0,1647295476002,smells lovely – even if you are not a fan of grapefruit : ),"This smells lovely and I am not even a fan of “grapefruit”. The fruit itself I pretty much despise. This oil, though, just smells lovely and fresh.  It is not as pungent as an actual grapefruit at all – thank goodness.  It just smells very fresh and lovely.  Very fragrant and citrusy.  Maybe a sweet grapefruit – but even better.  I LOVE that it is Organic and I am already a big fan of Doctor Mercola products – as many – if not all – are Organic and Vegan as well. And that is what I buy.  This is just fresh and good.

5.0,1647036783799,Pretty versatile where you can use it,"This pad is smaller than maybe some other ones but the size makes it much more versatile in where you can use it on your body.  It is neat that it has a detachable pouch for a battery if you want to go that route.  You can plug directly into the wall but you have to use a USB plug slot.  Or you can attach the battery pack and attach the little cord (there is a little baby USB cord too) to a power bank and then you have a portable belt. It also comes with two belts too – a wide belt and a thinner one.  So, this thing will fit almost anyone – and almost anywhere.  Use one belt – or use both for a lot of length.  It is completely flexible as well.<br /><br />There are two buttons.  On is power on/off.  The other changes the setting.  The button on the belt changes color with each setting – Blue, White, Green, and Red.  To me, the settings mean this blue is heat only, white is a red light, green is a lighter red light, and red is a very bright red light (I never look at the light – but peeked at the glow emitted on my body).  Now according to the actual instructions, it says the red color is red light, the blue color is near infrared, the white color is red light & near infrared, and the green color is red light & near infrared & 73 hz pulse.  If there is a frequency, I am unable to hear or feel it<br />So, it must be working deep inside.<br /><br />Either way it feels pretty good – all settings feel warm on the body and some I feel more than others – almost like an odd feeling – maybe a tingling or the ever so slightest stinging – but not really.  So, I guess it depends on how sensitive you are to the red light for how you will feel.  It does seem to help me overall with my pain.  I guess that means the light is working but other than that I don’t really have a sensitivity that I know of anyway.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks!

4.0,1646764924364,Very nice overall - feels good!,"This reminds me of a tiny bowling ball with the weight and the finish and the way it looks and feels.  The ball is nice but the rest is 100% plastic. I do not think it is a problem at this point but when using it you can sort of feel the friction of the rolling on plastic a bit – as well as hear it too.  But it does work REALLY well. And not just for lymphatic massage – but just general massage to get the blood flowing.  It rolls decently – but again you can hear and sort of feel it.  Feels good on anywhere I can reach – legs, thighs, arms – especially the bottom of the feet. That may be my favorite.  Also good on neck – although you just have to watch to not get your hair too caught in the thing.  My crazy cat watched me and then also wanted to be massaged with this thing – so I obliged – very lightly and boy did she love it.  She rubbed it and rubbed it and purred and purred and enjoyed it thoroughly as she moved around my hand to get different parts of her.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.

4.0,1645133030143,Not easiest to hold – but not bad either – IDEAL for travel!,"This little brush is neat.  I find it a bit difficult to hold well – but then again – not too terrible at all.  I think I just prefer the ones with a handle – that way I am relaxed when using and feel like I get my entire face and all its cervices without issue.  This one – I feel it takes more work because of the size and shape.  It is PERFECT for travel, though, as it is sooooo tiny and takes up much less room than the ones with a handle.  It has many different speeds as well.  Like I think I counted 5.  The rollers are nifty as they are silicone and nubby spikey.  They feel great when rolling around your face – really wakes you up – because of the spikey nubbins – as opposed to most facial rollers which are smooth.  BUT I thought the little rollers would also vibrate.  They do not.  The vibration is just for the main part. The nubbins – do not matter if the thing is turned on or not.  Also – for the rollers it is easy to hod and use as the entire rest of it acts like a nice handle.  It is easy to handle that way and the rollers go just where you want them.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : )",34437,16228
3.0,1643050625697,Handle is TERRIBLE!,"I took this out of the box and it almost seems used.  The container where the cleaner goes looked fine but the outside of where the tank attaches – the white part had gunk all over it.  It seems fine otherwise – so maybe not used.  I don’t really know.<br /><br />My issue with this thing – is not even that at all.  The handle feels sooooooo cheap!  The way it is made – is terrible.  First it is not long enough for your whole hand really – like you can not fit all your fingers on – the handle definitely needs to be LONGER.  Also – the way the trigger is made – there is a large gappy hole (where the trigger attaches) – that has a jutting out plastic lip – this hole and lip are always pressing into your pointer finger while in use – maybe even middle finger too.  Soooooooo uncomfortable.  Am I supposed to keep my fingers on the trigger the entire time I am using it – as that is terrible.<br /><br />Sure, this mops – but not comfortably.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.

5.0,1641590574349,"So far, so good - on inflamed skin and issues with tendon","I am not yet sure of the claims and the effectiveness but I have been told about infrared-light therapy in the past – especially for pain.  I have issues with my ankles and tendons and have torn my achilles tendon in the past.  I still have pain most of the time so thought I would give this a try.  I never heard of the red-light therapy for skin issues but am still fighting an allergic reaction on my hands to something I used in home repairs more than a month ago – so wanted to try it there as well.<br /><br />The instructions say to use the light one to three inches from the surface of your skin as otherwise you may burn your skin.  I do not think the head of this things where the light is emitted gets that hot.  It gets warm.  So, I did not get any burns even when I put it directly against skin.  Although I did not hold it in one particular place but rather moved it around slightly.  The body of the flashlight gets hot though – well not hot per se, but more very warm – much warmer than the head at least – I should say that is where I felt all the heat.<br /><br />For my ankle – it didn’t make it feel any worse and after using it at night I felt no pain in my ankle.  My pain is not constant, though anyway.  I tried it on my left hand as well – where the prickly skin is from my allergic reaction.  Upon waking the next day, my left hand looked better – less red – than my right hand.  But to be honest, my right hand is my dominate hand – so it might have been worse off to start with.  Suffice it to say, I am going to continue to use this device on my ankle tendons and on one hand to truly see if I get relief – and long-term relief at that.

5.0,1639428833543,Seems to work REALLY well – even on itchy skin!,"This roll-on works for pain – and even itchiness.  When I received it I didn’t really have any pain at that time.  What I did have was extremely itchy hands from not wearing gloves outside as well as having an allergic reaction to either paint or spackle or something I was working on in the house.  So I applied this roll-on to my hands.  Instantly my hands stopped itching completely!  They felt cool and tingly.  The calmness of my hands lasted for quite a bit of time too.  Then I reapplied it again for relief.  It also made my hands look better too.  The redness was gone and the little itchy bumps had subsided quite a bit.  It didn’t get rid of the problem but helped temporarily.<br /><br />As for pain – sure enough, a few days later my back was acting up so I applied this roll-on.  I must say I do wish it didn’t roll on as “wet” as it does.  I find myself using a gloved hand to rub it in or the closed cap of the product to help work it into my skin.  It takes a minute or so to dry too.  BUT it relived my achy back COMPLETELY!  Felt great!  So, I definitely recommend this stuff on itchy skin or painful muscles.  Worked for both! The only thing is it seems like it might be Vegan so I hope that it is.  If so – I wish it were marked.  The label with all their little “certifications” is quite blurry – and tiny – (see my pics and that is NOT my camera but how it really looks!) so it may but it can not be read….<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.

4.0,1637969904728,Smell is not particularly my cup of tea but scent is personal,"This roller oil I could go either way with.  It is a bit strong and not something I would truly enjoy wearing most of the time. Sometimes it smells like citronella to me.  Sometimes it does not.  Like most essential oils, it also doesn't seem to last long on bare skin.  So I guess that is at least something if you think it may be too strong for you.  Also, when I first opened it it was very tough to get the top off.  After I did - I saw why.  The roller ball was in the cap and not on the bottle.  I couldn't get it out at all so I just kept putting the cap on tightly until after a few times the roller ball finally attached itself to the bottle.  After that the cap still seems to stick a bit but the roller stays put on the bottle.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : )",34437,16229

I like that it has 4 ports as most have two although I only use two most of the time on two areas like shoulders and lower back.  The four ports could be helpful for someone who wants to work one leg totally, though - so great to have.<br /><br />The charge lasts forever too.  In fact, it arrived fully charged and ready to go!  The pads seem a little cheap, though.  Like I can see the circles on the sticky part.  But they work just fine.  And again pads are replaced anyway.  The machine works so well.

Even the garage if you have a problem there.  They are cute – so I would reserve them for someplace you will see them.  The others all have grommet holes so that you could easily hang them from a hook or loop some string through.

You can simply display around your home - like scatter.  You can also give a heart to a loved one - I know some people like to carry one around in a pocket for good luck and remembrance.

It fizzed up a LOT and at first, I was worried it would overcome my teacup but it did not.  You may want to use a bigger vessel just in case.  It fizzed and foamed for a bit as I stirred.  Once it was half as foamy, I added cold water and drank it right down.  It dissolved fully.  It was actually PACKED with flavor so next time I really will prepare in a larger cup or mug and add more water too.  It was actually a very pleasant flavor and I could easily drink this as a drink to actually drink and enjoy.  Very pleasant.

I have already tried their Carlyle Plant Based Chocolate powder which was waaay toooo sweet for me as I do not like sweet drinks – the chocolate is cloying.  Thankfully, their Vanilla flavor is nowhere near as sweet.  I couldn’t tell you it was Vanilla flavored but it tasted nice.  The sweetness here is almost like an aftertaste – a hint - quite pleasant.  It foamed up nice too – but it was a bit starchy to drink – not grainy at all – just starchy – but I think that is due to the amount of powder used.  I put it back into the blender – added a banana, some kale, and some ice – and boy it was so pleasant that way.

It comes out sort of starchy – not grainy – but starchy.  To me it was also almost sickingly sweet this way – like wow.  Sweet drinks are not my thing so…  If you can get the cloying sweetness out of the way – I noticed that there is actually a nice chocolate flavor hiding in there.  If it were at least half as sweet – I am sure I would be able to taste the chocolate flavor more.<br /><br />Way too sweet to drink so back into the blender it went with an additional four ounces of water.  At 14 ounces the sweetness was cut down a lot – not enough for me, though, but the chocolate flavor was severely muted then too – like down to a “hint of chocolate”. : (  Again – if it were half as sweet…  So back into the blender it went where I added a banana and a bunch of kale.  That way, the sweetness was pretty perfect with the greens.  So, I am unable to drink this stuff alone - but with greens added it was actually quite pleasant and that is the ONLY way I will drink this going forward.

I am not a fan of the bendy machines – and this one has some bend to it.  Not as bad as some others – maybe because the neck is thicker – but it still bends more than I would like.  I just do not see the purpose.  Again, not as bad as some others – and it does function just fine.  The brush part of the head is smaller than a lot of others out there so you can be more precise – but not really because of the flexibility.

I suppose these are great to have on a REALLY hot day or if you are sick.  Again – luckily it doesn’t taste like pure salt or anything but your tastebuds can detect it – and makes my mouth feel a bit dry.  I added more water and found it MUCH better at 24 ounces taste wise.  The flavor is super light then but the salty aftertaste is much lighter that way too – and it doesn’t leave my mouth dry.

It is the roughest bath pouf I have ever felt - but it is not too bad at all and not too rough at all - just a bit more rigid in design.

But then I decided to give them a real try walking around anyway so stuck my socked feet in sneakers and away I went.<br /><br />At first you think your feet are sliding around - but actually my feet were not moving at all within my shoe - but the ball area was definitely very squishy.  That area feels like it is moving but it really isn't.  It is a weird feeling to get used to - but after you do you realize your feet are secure.<br /><br />The best part - I had NO pain on the affected foot!  WOW!  I walk a lot, though.  Usually at least 4 miles every day - so I will see how these last.  A few pair come in the package - so that is helpful.  So long as I get a bit of use out of each pair - we should be good to go.  Plus it isn't a constant condition of mine - but when it acts up it REALLY hurts.  So far these really help!  If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.

5.0,1601581303105,I like it although you taste the ascorbic acid,"I like the flavor of this.  To be honest I usually use one packet in a 50 ounce water container that I keep chilled in the fridge.  It comes out lightly flavored that way and then I just pour as I go.  Although when I first had it I added the pouch, as instructed, to less water - 12 ounces, I believe.  That way it packs too much flavor to me.  It isn't bad at all that way - nice and orangey - pretty ascorbic acidy - but I still liked it.  But generally I like water-type drinks with less flavor.  So I usually mix it in a 24 ounce water bottle or the larger bottle in the fridge - just depends what mood I am in.<br /><br />Like I said you definitely taste the ascorbic acid - some people may know what I am talking about.  Personally I like that flavor.  It reminds me sort of like a Gatorade in that regard - so that makes me feel even more hydrated (mentally, I suppose).  : )<br /><br />I have never played Pickleball and am surprised that a bunch of drink products are geared towards fans of the game - but good for them.  Regardless if you like pickleball, play pickleball, have never heard of it - this is still a very solid drink for sports or while laying on the couch!

5.0,1601034736516,Very nice gummy - not vinegary at all,"These gummies smell pretty nice.  Pretty fruity.  The gummy itself is maybe a mid-firm gummy - so they are nice and chewy.  They are shaped like little gum drops - cute!  They taste nice too - like a mild candy meaning the sweetness is not overpowering - it just tastes very, very nice.  I wish these came in snack form. : )  There is no taste of Vinegar at all - which is great as ACV is so good for you but Vinegar literally causes a gag reflex with me.  So this is a great way to get my daily dose of ACV!<br /><br />They are sort of sicky and moist.  Not a deal breaker - maybe that is the added green tea.<br /><br />Also love that they are clearly marked Vegan friendly. That is what I look for.

5.0,1599429428924,What Space Saving Engineering! - Really love this mop set!,"I love products that are super functional yet engineered really well too - especially when it comes to the space saving aspect of something you want to stow away in a closet or cabinet.  This definitely fits the bill across the board.<br /><br />First it comes in a small box - just large enough for the bucket.  But the mop is also inside the bucket.  Genius!<br />Now when I unpacked it I was like will this mop be sturdy enough as it comes in pieces you screw together.  But YES - it totally is - and I was surprised!  It was sturdy and stable and yet maneuvered very, very well as it swivels beautifully.  In fact, even though my older mop is smaller - this one was much better for getting behind the toilet - again because it swivels and moves so well.  It did a great job.  The parts of the handle never came apart - until I took them apart (which was also easy).  It is also much longer than my old mop which, for me as a tall woman, makes life sooooo much easier!  In fact at the end of mopping my bathroom I was able to stand outside the door and finish up and was actually able to stretch and reach almost the entire bathroom from the doorway - I was impressed.  It was very easy to use.  I was even able to really scrub with it and it was still very sturdy.<br /><br />The best part is the bucket.  It is super tiny yet super functional. It is also much better than using my bathroom sink - as now I can properly dispose of dirty water right down the toilet.  Plus it does not take that much water to fill that part of the bucket - again the engineering is super helpful and thoughtful and conserving.  The mop definitely got up the dirt and I was able to rinse it well and then run it through the dry side a few times where it really did get rid of most of the water - you could see it literally pour off the mop with the little attached squeegee.  Then I just left it standing against a wall and by that night it was completely dry!  (Unlike my old mop which took like days to completely dry!)<br /><br />Lastly - when you are done with it - you just unscrew the handle and put it all right back in the tiny bucket.  Super easy to put on a shelf, in a closet, or in a cupboard.  REALLY space saving!  My pic shows the size next to a bottle of champagne - really small!  I am impressed with he size, engineering, durability, and ease of use.  Great product!  Totally recommend!<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.

Once you add water and swallow no taste whatsoever.  No aftertaste either.<br /><br />The capsules might be a bit wider than most - but I had no trouble swallowing them.<br /><br />Algae has lots of good benefits (along with vitamins and minerals) like reducing inflammation and also detoxing benefits.  Rarely, some people may have side effects (mostly on the allergy side) and you aren't supposed to take Chlorella at the same time with other medications - maybe it has something to do with the detox benefits.  I am not sure.  Just do you research before adding any supplements to your diet.

5.0,1597287222304,Poo poo'd these things for years - until I got it and used it - WOW - a true convert now,"I am surprised that I like this set so much.  For years I have seen these things and poo poo'd them as a weird fad.  I even already have a pricey ultrasonic face machine - so why would I need these?  SO GLAD I got this set, though.<br /><br />I literally use these EVERY DAY now!  The handle is easy to hold (unlike my ultrasonic face machine).  It is easy to turn on and off and so far the battery I put in lasts and lasts and lasts.  I thought that the handle would vibrate more then the head - but I am glad that I was wrong.  The vibration is definitely more confined to the head and hence your hands do not feel weird using it.<br /><br />The eye head is nice - I thought it would be too big - but works and fits well around my eyes.  The jade roller one is nice too - I especially like it when it is cool.  Then it is like a nice ahhhhh after a long day.  But the roller ball head is da bomb!  That thing really makes you feel like you are having a facial as your skin sort of gets squeezed between the ball heads.  In the directions they call it ""kneading"" and I guess that is what it really feels like.  I am not one to be gentle with my skin - personally, I believe you need to move it around and get the blood flowing to keep youthful.  That has always worked for me - and that is why I think this set does such a great job on my face.  I recommend.  In fact going to get some as gifts for family and friends - who will probably also poo poo it - until they actually try it.<br /><br />If you thought my review was helpful - why not click the ""Helpful"" button.

5.0,1596406342246,These are VEGAN - have no taste - are better absorbed (and I only need just one!),"These vitamins have no smell really as well as no taste - so that is great!  They are also clearly marked Vegan on the bottle.  This Vegan LOVES that!  They are on the larger side of pills but I, personally, had no trouble swallowing them.  If larger pills are an issue for you try drinking it with a lot of water to make it go down easier.<br /><br />They are a higher dose than most vitamin C's out there. Usually I do 250 to 500 mgs daily - with more (during normal times) in flu and cold season to boost immunity.  These are 725 mgs each.  The dosage says to take two - but I will just take the one at 725 most days - unless I need to really boost in my immunity.  The good thing about vitamin C it is like the only vitamin you can't OD on as any excess your body easily urinates out.  So no worries you will get too much either way.<br /><br />These are a very easy way to get your vitamin C! : )  Plus they are liposomal - that means your body more efficiently uses and absorbs them.

3.0,1660697156372,"Good for emergency food as vegan, could be great if Splenda was removed","I've known about Soylent for years and I love the idea of it. I'm vegan and have food allergies and it's always nice to have options in the case that I'm in. This ends up giving you more calories than the average random energy bar and since it's powder maybe a bit easier to carry around too.<br /><br />The idea behind Soylent is that technically you could eat this for every meal and still have all your nutritional needs met. Kind of like pet food for humans, and the name is a play of course on Soylent Green (although there's soy in it, there are no lentils!)<br /><br />This is vegan and gluten free. It's not however organic and my number one issue with it is that it uses Splenda (sucralose) as a sweetener. I heard that Soylent can't be sold in some countries due to this and Splenda is being tied to more health issues such as messing with your gut biome and such. I wouldn't be comfortable using this full time and I think a lot of people have a negative connotation with the term ""Splenda"" but don't realize sucralose is the same thing.<br /><br />I tested this in a real world scenario, no fancy mixing cup, just a cup with water, to see how it blended and if it was chalky. The chocolate flavor was nice, and as for the taste beyond that it had a bit of a mild oatmeal type taste, so overall good and palatable. I was really surprised by how well it blended in with the water. It's not perfect but it wasn't like huge chunks that refused to blend along with some chalky mouthtaste which I've had with other drink powders. Some powders are basically only doable if you literally have a blender or coffee frother, or if you heat them up. I found this to be totally drinkable and could see myself bringing this on flights and stuff to get some variety from meal bars.",41780,610
3.0,1638504717585,Not what I was expecting - lots of ingredients other than the 3 listed,"I wanted to try this blend because the main oils that were listed are scents that I like and Spearmint has been tested to show effects on focus.<br /><br />However I was unclear that this blend has a ton of other stuff in it than the main ingredients, I'm going to list them below:<br /><br />Bergamot, Black Pepper, Caraway, Cinnamon Leaf, Clary Sage, Coffee, Eucalyptus, Frankincense Carterii, Ginger, Grapefruit, Holy Basil (Tulsi), Juniper Berry, Litsea, Melissa (Lemon Balm), Nutmeg, Organic Jojoba Oil, Peppermint & Sugandha Kokila<br /><br />Especially the inclusion of coffee is kind of concerning for me, if it could have caffeine I wish they would mention it. I also really dislake citrus sent and although it is very muted I can smell the bergamont/grapefruit.<br /><br />The smell is minty but I think due to the inclusions of a bunch of other stuff it does smell a bit more artificial. I can tell it's not artificial though because otherwise I'd be getting a migraine. However I just don't understand why it's needed to throw in that many additional ingredients. Just stick to the 3 listed and jojoba oil. As others have said the scent dissipates pretty quickly. I do feel that I feel a little more awake with this but I think that you can get a similar effect by putting peppermint oil in a diffuser.<br /><br />I would say just do a higher percentage of the main oils to make it last longer and cut all these extra random oils that don't add to the scent.",41780,16229
4.0,1618600638868,Carefully crafted antioxidant red blend,"I have a bunch of ""Greens"" blends but wanted to round things out and try a ""reds"" blend. I've tried probiotics by this company before and they are unique in that they don't just resell some random blend but actually research and make unique, science based supplements. Given my experience with their probiotic and what I knew about the company from then I was excited to try this.<br /><br />This blend basically has 4 components: a phytonutrient/antioxidant blend with a variety of red berries and beets, some medicinal mushrooms, some gluten free grains, and a small bit of probiotics. In addition this is sweetened with monkfruit, my favorite sweetener. You can tell they really put care into these ingredients because for example they do mention they used fruiting bodies, and they could have used stevia or even some junk coconut sugar and they did not.<br /><br />I have tried this a few different times and it is just a neutral pleasant beet type flavor maybe with a bit of a berry undertone. I wouldn't recommend this just on its own but I don't think many of these powders really are meant to be just thrown in some water and washed down. If you are thinking of it being particularly ""berry-y"" it's more of a beet type powder. In any case I haven't had any problem with things I've mixed it in with as long as a beet and sweet taste is OK in that food.<br /><br />The reason I took off a star is because it is pricey and I'm not sure if I'd get it again due to this but I do think it's justified in this case as they used premium ingredients such as fruiting body mushrooms, went of their way to get GF grains, sweetened with monkfruit instead of stevia, and so on.",41780,1577

I also contacted the company to determine the source of the chorella. These are apparently sourced from vat-grown Chorella in Japan which I'm going to trust wayy more than the places that stress ""MADE IN THE US"" but source the Chorella from China. In addition they do provide a COA on their website, although I would have preferred to have seen a scanned PDF rather than just a  table. In the end though all that stuff is pretty hard to verify, but the fact that they went out of their way to put it on the website is a good thing. I also appreciate that this company pushes the sustainability and vegan angle.<br /><br />I'm going to be using these in conjunction with cilantro for detox. I'm early in but no issues yet and I feel better about using these due to what I mentioned above over a random brand that doesn't have a COA, is sourced in china, and doesn't care about veganism/sustainability.<br /><br />I am taking off a star because the marketing was using some kind of annoying tactics - for example, "" it also can contain protein, vitamin b12, iron, vitamin C, vegan omegas, fibre and small amounts of magnesium, zinc, copper, potassium, calcium, folic acid and other B vitamins.* "" Note ""can contain""... classic ""weasel wording""...

These gummies are sweet and tasty.<br />Taking three a day is reasonable, and pleasant. The ingredients all appear to be natural -- the sweeteners, Stevia and Erythritol appear to be safe.<br />There was a generous amount of these gummies in the large bottle, and so they lasted for quite some time.

But they certainly look like they are more than able, in the right hands, to effect a thorough dental examination.<br /><br />However, I have a wonderful use for these very durable and well-made tools. I am an ardent model car builder -- and these picks make me very happy -- they are absolutely great at making little modifications, cutting extra pieces of scrap plastic from the edges or doors, cleaning up indentations, and the like. The length and the balance of each one of these tools make them predictable in tight places and very ergonomic.

The beet root and cranberry also adds to AC vinergar's detoxing properties. I take it first thing in the morning so there's no taste clash or interaction with what I've just eaten.<br />Personally I dont think that just one gummy is as effectve as the liquid, but I'm not worried because I still add a litlle liquid AC Vinegar to my dailiy meals/drinks.<br />The bottle size and the gummy size make it perfect for me to take when I travel.

5.0,1580745708522,Excellent food storage containers at a realistic price,"I was very happy to receive and use these Solimo (Amazon's) Brand containers!!! They came wrapped (cardboard sleeve) 3 per stack. I put them to use at once-- for storing loose coffee, cookies, plastic-ware, and refrigerated leftovers. They stack perfectly, and certainly should be easy to take to picnics, work, long trips (placing in a box or large carryall is recommended to keep them from shifting or falling)<br /><br />The 64 ounce size is generous. ALOT can be placed in each container -- and the lid snaps shut firmly, keeping everything inside. Of course, every lid will fit any container here. and everything that is not being used stacks securely in one place.<br /><br />The price for this set of 18 is similar to the equivalent-sized ZipLoc containers at my local store that is known for its lower prices -- each set of 3 Ziploc Containers went for $3.69. I carefully inspected those Ziploc containers and they were the exact size and ""texture"" of the 18 Solimo containers I had at home.<br /><br />The only perceived ""weak-point"" (and it is a ""weak-point"" for the ZipLocs as well) could be the corners-- they are more flexible than the rest of the container, which might be (IMHO) to keep the container from cracking at that point, should it fall)<br /><br />I do not put them in the dishwasher -- I soak them and wash them by hand, dry them thoroughly and stack them for future use. I will check to see if the ones I have stored my coffee in will absorb that smell but it's too early to tell right now. I do not know if they freeze well, ( my little fridge's freezer DOES accept the smaller size storage containers and they Do freeze well, so I can assume this 64 ounce Solimo will freeze well, too) but I would suppose so - just don't drop the frozen container or like everything, it may break. UPDATE1-- it not only freezes well, but it does not stain either. UPDATE2 - One of them (test) went thru the dishwasher and came out just fine.<br /><br />These containers are BPA-free, have no odor, and can be used in the microwave, with the lid slightly open, to Reheat -- not to cook -- leftovers. I'm very happy with the quality AND the quantity of containers in this 18-container Solimo Food Storage set.",46500,258

And since there are four in this set, I can rotate them for better  longevity.<br />And since the cuffs are longer than usual, there is little chance for me to get water into them while I'm using them -- hence they are so much easier to stay dry and be available for more use in a heartbeat.<br />The price, divided by four (the set)  is terrific!!",46500,519

It does a good job relieving dryness and irritation but for me, it's short-lived relief. My apartment is a very dry environment in the winter and I have no choice but to put Neosporin in my nose at night to keep my nasal passages from eventually drying out and bleeding. Now this spray is a good SUPPLEMENT to what I'm doing. And I would guess my situation is pretty extreme, but GoodSense, nevertheless, is a handy adjunct to keep around. It does its job -- and it's possible that my situation may be a bit more extreme than what GoodSense was formulated for.

First, I read the directions and it was confusing as to whether or not to use just one tablet or more. Following directions, you will pop a tablet into the commode before use, in my experience there was not a positive fragrance, nor cleaning factor. The company does issue a clear warning to keep these tablets out of the reach of children, but is it enough of a safe guard?  Children might view these as mints.

In the box.<br />They have such nice fragrances that I have put them in my linen closet, where they are making my towels and sheets smell wonderful.<br />Where these fall down is in the shower, where I found their effect underwhelming.<br /><br />To use these you simply unwrap one disc, then set it just beyond the direct stream of your showerhead; basically, put it in the splash zone.<br />The disc will then gradually dissolve, releasing a very subtle fragrance as it does.<br />The trouble is that, at least in my case, the scent of the discs is easily overpowered by all the other products I use in the shower.<br />Unless I bend down to sniff the disc, the fragrances of my shampoo, conditioner, and body wash are all I really pick up on.<br /><br />In fairness to these discs, my shower is over an old cast iron tub with a double shower curtain, so it is possible that in a smaller shower with a glass door these might have more of an impact.<br />I also tried two fruity fragrances first, so some of the other scents might also might pack more of a punch.<br />In the past, I used similar products made with menthol and eucalyptus that were meant to help reduce congestion that were very powerful, so that might also make these seem less fragrant by comparison.<br /><br />In the end, I suspect these would be better used as bath bombs, but overall they are not bad.<br />These discs smell wonderful and come in a beautiful box that would make them ideal for gifting.<br />They could be a sweet hostess gift or a nice addition to a bath/spa themed gift basket.",47829,1616
4.0,1614982263445,Works fine but would prefer scent (and bottles are SMALL)!,"The thing about this brand is that its products smell A-MA-ZING! They work great, yes, I suppose, but the reason you want them for your laundry is definitely the scent. That's also why you'd want such a small bottle of their products -- to get that amazing scent in each product that you use.<br /><br />But these are unscented. So they work fine and remove stains if you spray them before washing, but for the life of me, I can't imagine why anyone would want such small bottles of laundry stain remover?? The small size makes them easy to misplace, hard to find a good spot for in the laundry room and not last long enough to get rid of more than a couple of small stains.<br /><br />Without the favorite scent of the laundry detergent, these stain remover sprays just don't seem worth the trouble of trying to live with such tiny bottles. Four stars because they do remove stains. But would need to be larger bottles and smell good to get five stars from this house.<br /><br />Maybe these would work for travel, but in that case, I'd think you'd prefer the readily available Tide pens.",47846,1575

I tried these immediately upon receipt and found them to be as good or better than the typical liquid detergent I use. But of course, much lighter and more environmentally friendly.<br /><br />These would be great for travel-- in case you need to run to a laundry mat in the hotel or nearby while on vacation, but I also think they'd be great for people who regularly use laundry mats or community laundry rooms (dorms,  apartment buildings or hotels), who likely get tired of lugging big, heavy bottles around with their laundry.<br /><br />This option is much lighter, uses no plastic, travels easily and is priced well.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't want to take advantage of all of these benefits.<br /><br />The only downside is that these haven't been tested against some of the big names, so I don't know how well they actually clean my clothes. I'm someone who prefers to use laundry detergent that has been tested against a wide range of required uses to ensure it is as effective as possible at getting my laundry clean.

I like that it recharges easily and uses a USB C charger, which I seem to have everywhere throughout my house so I don't have to worry about losing the charger for this one. As another reviewer mentioned, the temperature is in Celsius, but I just care that it's hot, so that didn't bother me.<br /><br />The problem for me is, I have thin, shorter, old lady lashes. And I just think heated eyelash curlers don't do as much for us as they do the younger set. That's been my experience anyway. While I like the idea, and might try it with fake lashes, it didn't seem to lift my eyelashes as much as I would have liked (or as much as my trusty Shu Umera version already does) even when I used it AFTER applying mascara, so it's not something I'll use often unfortunately.",47846,8368

And I can see a lot of instances in which these might work well for someone.<br /><br />First, unlike most pill containers, there's braille on each day of these so those with vision problems can easily distinguish one day from another. The letters of the week on each slot are very large, so in theory, they're easy to read. I also like that I can carry one smaller row of pills rather than typical cases, which are much larger and made for twice a day pills.<br /><br />The problem is that the cases aren't see through, so it's hard to know whether or not the days are filled just from glancing at it. I didn't realize how often I glance at the pill case to see if it needs to be refilled. And while the letters ARE large and there's braille to distinguish each day, the letters are the same color as the case itself, which I still find hard to see.<br /><br />The addition of a pill cutter was just a bonus for me, but these are always nice to have on hand.",47846,233

4.0,1654819144873,Easy to use but the instructions could have been better,"I stumbled upon this kit and wanted to try it increase blood circulation to my scalp. I am a novice so after carefully reading the instructions, the device was fairly simple to operate but the instructions did not explain which tool is used for what area of your face. Lucky for me, the hair tool is obvious but I had to look at the product description on the Amazon listing to educate myself on the other 3 tools.<br /><br />The wand handle is a little bulky but inserting the glass tools into it is very easy. The rotary knob to turn device on/off and to control the intensity is located at the base of the wand. The intensity is indicated by a series of dots going from smallest to largest making it a guessing game in determining the level of intensity. Instead, I wish the intensity was labeled by number to better gauge what works best for each user. Perhaps if level 4 didn’t give me good result, i’ll know with some level of certainty that I need to turn it up to level 5 or 6. Again, I am a novice so perhaps this is standard for these kinds of devices.<br /><br />I have used it a few times and I have enjoyed the experience but I haven’t notice any change in my hair as of yet. Not sure if I should increase the intensity or what intensity I used during my last treatment but i’ll continue to use and monitor my progress. Overall, great device with numerous applications and benefits.",48522,1423

The packaging suggest it is strawberry flavored but the smell is off putting and it’s almost tasteless. I also wished the twist tubes had some kind of labeling on them.

I started using this cervical traction device for 3 minutes a day and built my way up to 10 minutes after a couple of weeks. The device is made from a thick foam that is uncomfortable at the beginning and does take some getting used to. The device comes with a little instruction pamphlet that shows you how to use the device correctly. The device can be used in a gentle or strong traction mode. You can also do side to side stretches on it. From my experience of using the device for a couple of weeks, it does help reduce neck pain and stiffness, but you have to add using it to your routine. If you’re looking for a way to fix your spine alignment at home this is worth a try.",48538,751

The color was pretty minimal when I threw it into my bath as well. I feel like this is a nicer kit for someone whos not looking for something too strong or special that will wow them like a lush bath bomb.<br /><br />I gotta say even though you get 18 pieces they are really small compared to your average bath bomb so if you might need two or it might not even be anything life changing.,48538,2880

The bombs itself are decent and do let out a nice fragrance. The bombs come housed inside a box with flowers and each of the bombs are individually wrapped.

Overall this foot massager does help reduce sore feet, but I feel like there are better ones on the market.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to set up, you just need to plug in the ac power adapter and plug that into an outlet and it’s ready to go.<br />The function buttons are located in the perfect spot and are pretty self explanatory.<br />Heat function takes a minute to heat up but once it’s at its max, you can really feel the heat.<br />The massager has 2 pinpoint speeds, a moderate and an intense one. Both speeds feel really good.<br />This massager works great for those with bigger size feet. I usually wear a Men’s 9 and the pinpoints were in the perfect spots for me.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The air cushion feature of this massager is useless. I’d compare the “compress” feeling it provides your feet to what you’d feel on your arm when getting your blood pressure tested, but not as strong.<br />This massager is not great for those with smaller feet. My mom is usually a Women’s 6.5 and her toes barely go past the other end of the air cushion sleeve.<br />Overall the air cushion sleeve fabric did not feel really comfortable to me<br />I wish there was an option to adjust the length of the pinpoints so that the massager could work for all feet sizes.",48538,2759

And this tastes ok, not really lemon, as lemon balm is only slightly lemon flavored. I put it under my tongue for faster absorption. But this is a proprietary blend and no where does it list the amount of lemon balm inside the product. And most recommended doses are 300-600 mg a day . So it’s hard for me to know what I’m taking and if it’s helpful, as the information isn’t presented for comparison. The same with tea, which I was looking to try next . So, if you need a specific dose for your own experimenting, this won’t help. I’m not an overly stressed guy, so nothing has stood out so far for me as a noticeable change.

Some collagens are getting too fancy now with added ingredients and unrealistic prices and smaller jars, but this is a good collagen at a fair price and  454g size. There’s no information on where it’s made, only distributed. And while most collagens mix pretty well even in cold drinks, I found this to be more clumpy than normal. There’s no taste and I stir it in my pre-made smoothies in the morning and it goes down fine. Nothing really to whooop about and nothing to be critical of, just a good average collagen.",50168,2008
5.0,1630698490985,"30 day supply, high D3 amount","Every formula of D3 and K2 is different so you need to be sure of what you want in the formula. Some have higher doses of D3 and some have more K2. Some add calcium and maybe the black pepper for absorption or even coconut oil. I prefer a lower dose of D3 as I take a D3 supplement. And the calcium in this brand is not enough for your daily dose, but it’s something . I also like a little more of the K2. But I can easily adjust my other supplements to balance my needs. I suggest you read and decide also. I am fairly new to this combination,  but I’m sold on the fact that together they are better then alone. The calcium in your blood needs a mechanism to steer it away from your heart ( calcification ) and into your bones . And that is the magic of D3 and K2. So whatever your formula needs are, add this combo to your life. It’s a good thing. This is made in the USA, non GMO and the contact info is on the label .

But this formula is high potency in D3 only and that will be perfect for some people . It’s important to find the ingredients that compliment your lifestyle. Some studies indicate that coconut oil or olive oil might help with absorption of these vitamins. The science says that these two are amazing when taken together and will steer the calcium in your blood into the teeth and bones and away from the heart where it can do damage. Definitely add one to your regimen. But read and decide what is the best for you . I will stop taking a separate D3 as soon as my supply runs out .",50168,1596
4.0,1618357160611,Extract vs root powder 🤔🤔,"Well, this is my first trial of Red Ginseng, so I will learn better as I go. I have already learned that the extract version ( as this ) is not as good as the pure root powder,  no matter what the amount of Ginsenosides is in it. There are multi types of ginsenosides  I have read,  and the type, is more important that the amount . You can research yourself and see that the price of pure root powder is higher and some even list the types of ginsenosides in it. This may be a fine addition to boost your immune system or even a fine maintenance dose, but if you’re looking for results you can feel , you may want to try the root powder. That’s my next purchase . Do your research, these supplements and adaptogens are confusing and many sellers rely on you focusing in on specific words to make the sale.

Don’t just accept another’s advice, your needs are most likely different . That being said, turmeric is good for so many things and the root powder has the same benefits as the the extract BUT not on the same scale as the extract. Pay attention to the amount of capsules in a serving also. In this price range you will usually get only 50 mg of extract per pill and the dose used for most studies is about 500mg a day. So, in this case you need 10 pills a day.  Big numbers and unexplained claims are the norm in supplements. But....,  this may be enough for you, if you’re not suffering badly from inflammation. I’m not isolating this product, as you are getting what you paid for and I use it along with cooking with root powder and also sprinkling the powder in my meals. Try it and decide for yourself, but please do 10 minutes of research on turmeric powder vs extract . No complaints really, you definitely want to take curcumin, just understand what you’re getting .",50168,2069

It took considerably longer and just did not do as good of a job.

This electric foot file comes in handy to help get all that ugly dry skin off your heels and other parts of your foot. It comes with three different heads that have varying levels of coarseness. You choose which works best for you. I do wish the heads were labeled. While it is easy to tell which head is the smoothest the other two are harder to tell apart just by looking at them. To turn this on you have to hold down the power button for several seconds before it will power on. It has two speeds settings and you simply push the power button once to change the power setting and one more time to power off. I would suggest you use after your shower, or have soaked your feet. I think it works better this way when the skin is softer. I did try using dry once and I felt like it hurt a little. It comes with a power cable and I plug in after each use, so I haven't exactly tested out the full battery life.

It does seem to puff into the air a little.

All of us north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn need to supplement our Vitamin D levels and D3 is the best to accomplish that. We simply can’t absorb enough “D” from the sun to secure a robust immune response. The amount of D3 in the recommended 2 capsules per day is enough for most adults. The calcium along with K2 and bioperine promotes strong bones and teeth. The K2 is critical as it enables your bones to more readily absorb the calcium from the bloodstream. Bioperine is included to make the other ingredients more bio-available. A very complete supplement at a reasonable price.,56708,2126

For the amount of D3 included in a dose, this liquid is pretty costly. Most small capsule preparations include double the D3 as a dose of Purehealth's liquid.  Now...Purehealth may be correct, however, that in liquid form the bio-availability is greater than in capsule form.

These smaller tubes can be good for travel and for Mom to keep in her purse just in case. The A&D by nature is a greasy type of ointment in the same way that petroleum jelly is.

The button is located in a zippered “compartment” in the pillow, easily removable. The button doesn’t have an options though. It’s just a vibrating button that only works when pressed. For us, it works great because my son only likes laying on it but he is unable to hug it and make it vibrate. I mean, he’s only 2 so, makes sense. My 4 year old does NOT like the vibration so she turns it off and just uses it as a pillow, which is great too.<br /><br />Side note: the vibrating button is easy to press outside the pillow too. My son has put himself to sleep just pressing the button. It is a little intense by itself but it works for him.<br /><br />I like it.

The scrubber is long enough but just barely - it could be a few inches longer for ease of use.

Not saying that this the best way to use this powder, but it WAS crazy delicious.<br /><br />I decided to do that after opening the bag and sniffing it first. Broccoli can have a uniquely unpleasant odor anyway—you know what I’m talking about. In a concentrate like this, I figured it would be pretty ripe, so I was shocked when all I could smell was just a really yummy, savory broccoli soup-type aroma.<br /><br />Honestly, I’m not sure who would then decide to blend this with fruit, oh my word no! That’s a personal choice, obviously but this is not going to pair well with sweet smoothie ingredients in my opinion. Gross.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, it’s sooo much better than I expected! I can think of many other ways to use this. The flavor is amazing. And since I heated it up in a pan, of course my whole house smells like broccoli now. But it’s actually still a very yummy smell, not like the big green fart I was expecting.<br /><br />I’m going to get more of this for sure. I think it’s a brilliant way to work tasty, clean, mega-greens into multiple recipes. The only way that was going to work for me is if it tasted good, and this is crazy delicious, so CHECK. Now, I can’t wait to try the spinach too!",63241,1630

And that is fine with me!!!<br /><br />I love using this because it is already soooo very clean. So I’m not worried about cumulative fumes, or problematic residues—they have the market cornered there! I hope it’s actually working as well as it seems to.<br /><br />The cost is a bit too much for me here. So I will attempt to hunt this down for no more than $5 per 16oz bottle. That’s my sweet-spot.

And with every electronic gizmo in the world these days emitting some kind of light, a ""dark room"" can end up being not that dark (I am talking to you Alexa-with-a-display). For that reason I sleep with an eye mask to make sure that all my peepers see is... nothing.<br /><br />As a gift the presentation of this silk eye mask is nice. It definitely comes through as a luxury gift in a fancy box.<br /><br />But I can't imagine spending $35 on this for myself. It's no softer than the polyester eye mask it is replacing.<br /><br />I did notice that my head size resulted in needing to extend the adjustable strap almost to its limit.

The razor leaves so much stubble that it is necessary to shave with a regular razor anyway. So why bother with this product? She tried using shaving cream and soap and never got an acceptable result.<br /><br />- The shave head is at an awkward angle.

If used in the shower, I would dry the body off quickly when I was done.<br /><br />In terms of charging, it holds the charge plenty long for a shave and charges fully in under 2 hours.  It uses a USB charging cable (included) -- and I wish it came with a wall charger, but no such luck (you have to provide your own USB power source).<br /><br />The storage/carry bag is a convenient way to keep the kit together.<br /><br />It is not clear what the guide combs are used for -- looks like beard grooming attachments used by men.

Helium was used for the full effect seen here (not included with the kit but worth it.)  The other things in the listing (garlands, pom-poms, and banner) do take a little work.  The pom-poms ARE manageable but they take A LOT of time and care to spread them all out and it is tricky to do without ripping them. If you get them please note the instructions DO NOT say to leave the ribbon on. YOU NEED TO LEAVE THE RIBBON ON or it will never work.  Even after figuring this out (which took longer than I’d care to admit) I'll be honest after ripping one beyond salvage and the time spent on the second one I gave up with those.  The same goes for the garlands- I have zero crafting skills and didn't even attempt them (but that's on me).  The banner comes as separate letters and one very useful extra was the plastic needle to help thread them.  Made life much easier.

And, after using the product a few times now, I consider the effectiveness (based on the potassium nitrate level of 5.0%) to be about the same as many other ‘sensitive’ toothpastes I’ve tried in the past.<br /><br />After brushing, the Spotlight toothpaste does leave my teeth feeling clean and does leave my mouth with a nice, somewhat minty taste.<br /><br />For me, while this toothpaste is noticeably better than some bargain-basement type sensitive toothpastes, it is roughly equal to many quality, name-brand or store-brand toothpastes.<br /><br />The cost, however, for this 3.5 ounce tube of sensitive toothpaste is a concern for me as I consider it to be on the higher side; especially for what I rate as an average, middle-of-the-road toothpaste.",69367,987

3.0,1608319927001,I don’t feel that it is likely that I will try the Sprayzee Shoe Deodorizer a second time,"Review of:  Sprayzee 100% Natural Shoe Deodorizer & Foot Spray<br /><br />I’ve tried the Sprayzee Shoe Deodorizer on 3 different pairs of tennis shoes; one pair for general walking around in, another pair for use at the gym and a third pair of shoes I wear out in the garden.  And, so far, I’ve come to a couple of conclusions about the Deodorizer.<br /><br />The first item, and the most obvious, was the aroma of the spray.  While the spray promotes itself as some version of mint, to my sense of smell at least, the aroma was closer to being medicinal; something similar to a pine-scented all-purpose, floor cleaner.  While I did not find the smell to be even vaguely pleasant another family member mentioned that the smell wasn’t too bad, almost a peppermint-type aroma.<br /><br />The second thing ‘discovery item’ for me was to realize that I should always use the spray outside.  I first tried using the spray in the garage and discovered that the ‘aroma’ of the spray covered the interior of the garage and lingered for at least a day.  This, to me, is an indication of the power of the spray which is a plus.<br /><br />The next item I noticed was that the bottle itself was somewhat difficult to use.  The spray nozzle worked fine when positioned upright but didn’t work well, or at all, when positioned sideways or upside down.  This meant that I found it hard to spray up inside the body of the shoe without having to manually hold and maneuver the shoe with one hand while spraying with another hand.  And, of course, I found that this led to the spray getting on my hands and the ‘aroma’ getting on my hands.  And, this in turn, led me to understand that the spray, with it’s unpleasant smell, was not easy to wash off my hands.<br /><br />Finally, after letting the sprayed shoes sit for a day or so, outside, I determined that the spray had indeed cut down on some of the original foot-odor the shoes had a day earlier; which is what the product is intended to accomplish.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found that original odor had been replaced with a odor that was half foot-odor and half pine-scented floor cleaner.  To me, that aroma was perhaps a little better than the original smell, but not by much.<br /><br />I will most likely continue to use the remainder of the product but I don’t feel that it is likely that I will try the Sprayzee Shoe Deodorizer a second time.",69367,1267

These lozenges are the quick dissolving powdery variety (kind of like an antacid).  It’s much quicker and easier to dissolve them on my tongue without swallowing them whole.  The taste is a very pleasant minty taste, which also helps.<br /><br />The ImmunoSwift tablets only have 8 mg of zinc per table vs the 11 mg in my usual variety, and are priced higher.  The L-Carnosine in the ingredient list is supposed to also enhance the effect of the zinc, so that may be reflected in the higher price.  If you’d like to try a zinc supplement and want something that dissolves quickly and easily, this is definitely worth a try.",69367,1789

I normally wear a size small in gloves so, for me, I found the gloves fit very comfortably without having to count on any stretchiness on the gloves.  As I prefer gloves that are looser, this fit was fine for me.<br /><br />As a quick test, for this review, I tested the stretch of the latex gloves by trying to put two hands into a single glove and I found that test worked okay as the glove stretched without tearing.  After testing the stretch of the glove, I found that a medium sized hand should fit without too many issues.  My test also demonstrated to me that a large size hand, even if the glove doesn’t tear, may find the fit too tight to be comfortable.<br /><br />For me, the Gracosy gloves are just what I need for working around the house.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click the Helpful button below as that helps me know that I'm providing useful information in these reviews.",69367,1526
5.0,1569444857438,I’m really pleased with this powder.. I’ve used it on 3 different meals it has enhanced each dish,"Review of: Super Organics Red Reishi Mushroom Powder | Healthy Immunity - Organic, Vegan & Non-GMO, 4 Oz<br /><br />I’m really pleased with this product … I’ve used it with three different meals and the ‘Super Organics – Red Reishi Mushroom Powder’ has enhanced the flavor of each dish.<br /><br />My first use of the powder was in Turkey Sloppy Joes.  As you know, using turkey in any dish and you lose some flavor as opposed to using beef.  Adding the mushroom powder amped up the flavor and gave the mixture a deeper, almost beefier taste.<br /><br />The next use of the powder was as a topping on baked Zucchini.  But a tiny amount of olive oil on top of sliced Zucchini … sprinkle on a little mushroom powder and a little Romano cheese powder on the top and then baked … so good.  Not only tasty but also healthy for you.  Just remember, when using as a vegetable topping to use it sparingly, you don’t want to overwhelm the taste of the Zucchini or overwhelm the taste of the cheese.<br /><br />The third use of the powder was in Lentils.  Add a scope of mushroom powder to the Lentils (after they were cooked) and you can impart a ‘mushroomy’/almost beefy type flavor to the Lentils.  Cook the Lentils with some carrots, celery, onions and then add the mushroom powder … scope over some cooked rice and you have a full, delicious meal that even the most strident meat-eater will like.<br /><br />I haven’t tried it in tea or a smoothie yet … but I am looking at making a stew fairly soon and I know that I’ll be adding this powder to the stew.  I’ll need to experiment with the amount of powder to use as a stew needs a heavier/meatier taste than the other meals I’ve made.  Oh … and know that I think of it, maybe adding some of this powder to some Zucchini bread would be good.  Hey, there are all kinds of options for this powder.<br /><br />I can’t really comment to heavily on the ‘healthy immunity’ claims on the product page but as this product is organic, vegan, non-gmo and gluten free and doesn’t list any negative ingredients or additives then the product is probably as healthy as fresh mushrooms.<br /><br />If you want a little extra flavor with your meals then this powder is something you should consider.",69367,13

I don’t run anymore; no surprise here, my knees don’t ‘take kindly’ to running; but I do enjoy walking as much as I can.<br /><br />And, I must say, for the entire walk the Ancocs Adjustable knee brace was extremely comfortable.  I would never go so far as to say it didn’t feel like I wasn’t wearing anything on my knee, but it was pretty close.  Unlike many neoprene-based knee braces, which quickly get soaked by sweat, this knee brace stayed cool for the entire time.<br /><br />The lateral coils (which is where I need the support), performed their function well and did it with surprising comfort.  At no time did I feel any ‘hard mass’ trying to push up against the sides of my knee.  Just the right amount of support to do what I need a knee brace to do.<br /><br />The flexibility, meaning how easy is it to bend the knee when walking, was very good.  The shorter, middle hook&loop strap came around enough to keep the brace tight enough but didn’t dig into the back of my knee with every step.<br /><br />I think this is a product worth trying.<br /><br />I’ve included some pictures to give you an idea of the overall length of the brace, the size of the individual hook&loop straps and the width of the brace.  I’ve also include a picture of the lateral coil ‘stabilizers’.",69367,1119

Because it states to test on a small area of fabrics first I was worried about using it on any of my work shirts at risk of losing my ability to wear the shirts as professional dress, so I cannot comment on whether it works better on BO than it does on foot odor, but considering I've used odor eliminating products that kill the germs causing the smells and work in minutes rather than the hours of working and drying this product takes, I do not think I will use this product again, particularly as I prefer the fresh scent my other odor eliminators leave behind over the stale bandaids of this product.",71170,762

Initially for the night light but also for the ease of selecting other types of sounds for drawing, writing, stretching and concentration.<br /><br />It recalls the volume and last sound. But will not resume if power is lost and restored. I mention this because the other sound machine I use just has a simple dial for power on and volume. I've kept a constant sound and volume by connecting it to a smart plug that resumes its present dial settings when power is restored by a sleep routine. So why mention this? I can imagine an infant finding comfort by a parent controlling an analog sound machine with a smart plug; sometimes gentle music can soothe a crying infant (like when you're confident it's not diaper or hunger causing the unrest). Can't do that with electronic controls without integrated smart home controls. This sound machine doesn't have smart home controls either. But works well for an older child that doesn't care about automation. So it's a good fit for my child.<br /><br />This machining did need a standard 5V 1A power plug to get started though.

4.0,1666561836628,For the toastiest feet!,"As I sit here writing this review, I feel completely relaxed as my feet are bathed in the warmth of being surrounded by this foot warmer.<br /><br />It's one of those products that you really didn't think you needed until you finally try it.<br /><br />The heating blanket seems to be extremely well constructed.  It's made of very soft fabric -- particularly in the foot pocket which contains fleece for extra comfort.  The bottom of the blanket is lined with gripped padding to keep it in place while in use.<br /><br />The included wired controller provides an ample amount of cord leeway for easy placement.  There are 6 different heating levels that the blanket can be set for along with preset timers for auto shut-off.<br /><br />The manufacturer claims that the Double-sided heating pad is controlled separately.  As far as I can see, this is not the case.  The supplied controller does not indicate separate heating functions nor does the included instructions.  Is this something you should be concerned about?  Well, this product is considerably more expensive than similar alternatives and if doesn't perform as described, you shouldn't be paying more for it.<br /><br />Personally, my only intent of use is to insert my feet into the pocket of the blanket.  I currently have the blanket turned all the way up (level 6), and it seems rather perfect without being too hot.  I have found that my feet get so wonderfully warm that when I finally remove them in a 72-degree room, it suddenly feels cold.<br /><br />The inside of the blanket is very roomy -- almost too much so.  While it's nice to be able to have the freedom to move your feet around while inside, it just seems a bit too large for its purpose.<br /><br />It seems like this should be very easy to clean.  You unzip and remove the heating pad from the fabric before throwing it into the washer.  The instructions claim that there are storage straps to hold everything together when not in use -- but yet another feature that is not actually included with this product.<br /><br />Bottom line: This foot warmer is considerably more expensive than others I have seen on Amazon.  The fact that it is ""Double-Sided"" may be a perk for some.  I don't think this gets hot enough across the top to work as a normal heating blanket for injuries.  While the manufacturer claims separate heating controls, it certainly isn't related to the included controller. The so-called storage straps mentioned in the instructions aren't to be found anywhere.<br /><br /> If you do opt to pay more for this, I think you are getting an exceptionally well-built blanket that should last you a long time.  However, I would also consider cheaper options.",75173,2016
1.0,1660415735049,Don't consider these toilet tablets,"I have never been more let down by a product than this.<br /><br />I do a lot of traveling with my girlfriend and we are very respectful of each other when it comes to bathroom odors.  We always bring along a small bottle of spray specifically made for toilet use.  You simply spray three squirts into the bowl before using the toilet and it does a remarkable job of covering up embarrassing odors.<br /><br />I was really excited about these tablets.  They look to be a more convenient solution when traveling due to the fact that they are tiny and easy to throw into luggage.  I was eager not to have to deal with a spray solution anymore and simply throw a tablet into the bowl before using it.<br /><br />Here's the huge problem with this product...<br /><br />It's a total failure.<br /><br />So, imagine this:  Nature is calling and you have to use the toilet immediately.  You throw one of these tablets into the bowl and then....you wait...and wait...and wait...and wait.  It took a single tablet more than 15 minutes to completely dissolve.  Is anyone going to hold back their movement to wait that long for the product to ready itself?<br /><br />What's worse is that when the tablet finally dissolved, it left an ugly discolored stain on the bottom of the bowl and absolutely no discernable scent to cover up what comes next.<br /><br />I couldn't believe how poorly this performed and I was really disappointed as I had such high hopes.<br /><br />I would love to give you some sound advice:  If you are looking for something to cover up toilet odors I highly recommend the small sprays made by Air Jungles and Clean-And-Fresh.  You spray three times before toilet use and they are highly effective in masking odors.<br /><br />This product should not be considered.",75173,14889
4.0,1656439103445,What you should know when investing in this foot massager,"[[VIDEOID:9e29f50fd04feddb524fde569839d071]] When considering spending nearly $150 for this Sharper Image product I think it's important to know the pros and cons of this purchase and whether this will make for a sound investment when it comes to your health.<br /><br />My first impression when taking this out of the box is that this is a well-built heavy piece of furniture/machinery weighing in at a little over 12 lbs.<br /><br />With an overall height of approx. 6.5"" off the ground, it seems a bit of a ""stretch"" to call this an Ottoman. I am used to such pieces of furniture being much taller.  My opinion is that this comes across as more of a footstool.<br /><br />That being said, it looks like a nice piece of furniture, handsomely covered in fabric.  When in use, a long cord protrudes from the top cushion.  That cord can be removed and stored when you wish to make its functionality less noticeable to those who visit your home.<br /><br />The top cushion of the Ottoman easily flips over, serving two purposes.  On its flat Ottoman side, it's a simple footrest that provides heat and/or vibration.  When you flip the cushion over, a more elaborate Shiatsu function allows you to slip your feet into sleeves for a customized massage.<br /><br />Now that I have given you an overview of this Sharper Image product, let me dive into my impressions using the Ottoman and Shiatsu functions.<br /><br />As I previously noted, this really doesn't act as an Ottoman.  So, if you are relaxing in your favorite chair, this serves more like a footstool.  The Ottoman functionality is not very exciting.  It's basically a heated vibrating pad for your feet.  A small button in the upper corner lets you choose vibration, heat, or both.  I really don't see the benefit of having a constant level of vibration and a slight amount of heat being applied to my feet.  If this were all that this Ottoman offered, this would be a big fail in my opinion.<br /><br />But fortunately, there's more...<br /><br />When I pulled a tab and flipped the cushion over to the Shiatsu side, things got more interesting.  I slipped my feet into the sandal-like sleeves, turned on the power, and felt the rollers inside the unit provide an intense massage to the bottom of my feet.  As this was happening, the sandal-like sleeves that cover my feet began to compress tightly and release.  The combination of bottom rollers, and top compression in constant motion along with a little bit of added heat provided for a very soothing and relaxing sensation.<br /><br />I must say, the Shiatsu aspect of this device is the most compelling.  I think that it could probably do wonders for sore, tired feet.  The motor inside is very powerful and as a result, the level of massage is very satisfying.  Of course, if it's too much too quick, you can lower the intensity of the massage.<br /><br />So, I have mixed feelings about this very expensive device.<br /><br />It's certainly well-built.  It's a handsome piece of furniture though I would not consider it an Ottoman.  The flat side does nothing more than vibrate and provides a little heat (it never really gets noticeably hot). The Shiatsu side is quite good as it provides a really strong acupressure massage to the feet.<br /><br />I almost feel you could spend less money and get something that's not designed to be furniture in order to get an equally good Shiatsu massage.  However, if you opt for this Sharper Image massager you are getting an expensive, but solid product.",75173,2759
5.0,1638800750209,Very capable portable water flosser,"This is the second similar type of portable water flosser I have obtained, for which I am giving my girlfriend as she has watched me with envy as I use it while traveling.<br /><br />These portable flossers are great.  They deliver a very powerful stream of water to the teeth and gum line which easily pushes away food particles on and in between teeth.  They are so powerful in fact that they rival the Waterpik units that have become a staple of bathroom hygiene for so many years.<br /><br />This flosser by Miracleplus deserves the professional moniker.  It is well constructed and (as I mentioned) quite powerful.  It's also very simple to use:  charge the flosser with the USB cable (power brick not included) and then fill the reservoir tank with water.<br /><br />This kit includes 5 different snap-in nozzles, one of which is a tongue scraper.  There are five different power modes to deliver water to your teeth, one of which is a nice massage burst and the other designed for softer delivery for sensitive teeth.<br /><br />The inclusion of a digital readout is a nice added touch.  It not only displays the currently selected power mode but also the remaining battery level.<br /><br />What I love about this and similar flossers is that you get about the same amount of water power delivered to your teeth in this portable unit as you do with the larger home ones.  At the same time, it's portable enough to simply throw this into your suitcase or an overnight bag.<br /><br />If you have never owned a portable flosser before I think you'll be really surprised how much water power these units deliver to your teeth.  It's certainly a quicker and more fun way to floss than using string between your fingers.<br /><br />This looks to be a very capable, well-constructed flosser that should stand up to a rigorous amount of use both in your suitcase and in your bathroom.  Don't think twice about purchasing.",75173,897

5.0,1639249409317,Much better than a manual roller!,"Love this electric microneedle.  It allows even application all over your face with a sanitized needle.<br /><br />I have used a manual roller on my skin for several years, as I am pro dermaroller (I strongly believe there are the extremes on both sides.  My past experiences, both in and out of a salon (I had electric roller in salons) - I disregarded the instructions which looked bad (and other reviews have also affirmed).<br /><br />I used on dry, alcohol sanitized skin, and followed with a serum.  It did hurt a bit, but I also abide by the “no pain no gain.”  My face was a little swollen for about 24 hours, and then slightly red for a few days but other than that, no noticeable difference.  I did not use makeup the entire day and I would recommend waiting until the next day, regardless of whether you do it in the evening or morning - just let your skin sit by itself.<br /><br />Pros to this type of treatment - sanitized, one use roller, quick, depth is consistent.  It comes with it several needles if you wanted to share your machine with a family member, but I do not and I just change the needle each time I use<br /><br />Due to my consistent use of a dermaroller, I don’t expect any mind blowing results as the results take time and consistency to use - much of which I’m already getting.  However, I will definitely continue use.  My goal is once a month (allows my skin time to heal between treatments), although I don’t always make that goal.<br /><br />I have normal to dry, slightly acne prone skin.

I love Tumeric as a spice and fresh but it has other purported benefits including as an anti-inflammatory (which is what I like about it). For those who aren't fans but like the potential benefits this is an easy way to take it. It is ONLY Tumeric nothing else like often one might see black pepper.

5.0,1593019526258,Been using for a week as a moisturizer and a first aid ointment,"Have been using this ointment in 2 ways since receiving it some days ago. I've been using it on my hands for extra moisture/moisture barrier and on a cut on my leg. The ointment has a scent that I can't quite put my finger on but it's not unpleasant or overwhelming- does not smell medicinal to me and doesn't last for a long time. Because of the nature of the ointment it will be greasy and not absorb quickly at all, which is to be expected in order to function as it says it will, protecting cuts and/or retaining moisture. A little dab will do. The ointment has been working very well on the cut on my leg, definitely less angry looking than it was before and softens the scab while protecting it and keeping it from being too dry and will likely help with any potential scarring. My hands stay moisturized for much longer with the ointment over my usual hand cream. It feels a lot like a heavy first aid cream/gel but lasts a lot longer. It will be a very useful ointment for me.",76677,876

Washing dishes, cars, cleaning fish tanks, scrubbing bathrooms and floors and just about anything else I don't care to get my bare hands into. I was offered Pacific PPE 4 pack of Latex free gloves and thought I'd try them out.<br /><br />They come nicely packaged as a set and then again individually for storage until you want to use them. I got a set of medium sized gloves. I have long slender fingers (bottom of palm to tip of middle finger 7"", and palm width not including thumb approx 3"" across), these gloves fit me very nicely. The product page says the unlined gloves are for ""dishwashing"" which I find amusing, though they would certainly work for that I find the flocked gloves entirely more comfortable to wear when working with hot water as your hands tend to perspire and then stick uncomfortably to the unlined glove. The unlined gloves will likely go to cleaning my aquarium or washing my car. The gloves are a nice weight and seem just as durable as my brand name ""mr. clean"" gloves that I'm sure I paid more than $3.75 for which at the time of this review is the cost per pair here.

Personally I already take collagen in a pill supplement form and have been relatively happy with it, however when offered this supplement that also has an extra boost of protein and other amino acids compared with what I already take and it was FLAVORLESS I was willing to try it. I have been putting it in my coffee (and sometimes in my coffee WITH my powdered fiber supplement as well) and it doesn't taste like anything. I did see mention that it discolored black coffee for some (and it does do that) but since I use half&half in my coffee it just seems to add to the already ""solid"" coffee staying power when I drink it, it almost feels like a meal. I don't like the serving size though and since I already take a collagen supplement I have only been doing half the dosage recommended which will still deliver for example 10.5g of protein.

2.0,1570051366445,"Will only work as a parasol, I wouldn't trust it for anything else (w/pics)","I like umbrellas. Even parasols when it's a day I'll be in the direct sun a lot. So when I was offered this Anti-Sun umbrella for ""Rain and Wind"" as stated by the product title I was in.<br /><br />Let me say I've rarely had to give a product a 2 star review. I usually pick products that I'm confident will be of some quality or use. Sadly for the first time in a long time I was disappointed with a product. Upon first glance out of the package all was well. It was light weight and very compact, though the black material was a little to plastic/pleather looking for my tastes it was still ok. Has it's own sleeve and an attractive blue. I unraveled it and opened the umbrella, it didn't open properly at least the first 3-4 times I tried, I always had to ""correct"" it and flip the outer edges down in some way. This does NOT give me confidence that it would be any good in rough weather, or even an aggressive breeze. After I did it a few times it started to open correctly. So I started inspecting it for construction flaws, which sadly I saw right away. The post seems as if I could easily bend it with little force, along with all the ribs of the umbrella. I also saw retail type nylon tabs holding the fabric down among the skelleton of the umbrella. My particular umbrella had a hem stitching flaw along one of the scalloped edges. It was also harder than I'd like it to be to get it to fold up and the strap to engage with the velcro. There is no way I'm going to get it back into the sleeve without a lot of effort that it's just not worth expending. The umbrella is NOT a good value at over $20 at time of writing.<br /><br />The ONLY reasons I would give this a two star and not a one is:  The design is nice with the color on the outside, the dark black on the inside will help keep sun out. The scalloped edges are pretty and a nice touch. THIS UMBRELLA IS ONLY GOOD AS A PAROSOL (on a non-windy day) provided yours does not come with a stitching flaw as mine did. Otherwise it is in my opinion useless in any other weather.",76677,2178
5.0,1562903186139,"A small luxury for a very good price, great his/hers gift (review with pics)","I don't often wear sleepmasks but I do on occasion. My pillowcases are mulberry silk, which I've been told is good for our skin (doesn't absorb the moisturizer we just put on, doesn't crease the face as bad as other materials, etc). So when I was offered silk sleep masks I thought, well that's going to be better than the cotton one I have. I often go to sleep with the tv on in the background as white noise and though I have the backlight turned way down sometimes the light annoys me. I also like to have a little pressure sometimes on the eyes but nothing covering the rest of my face- a sleep mask fits these purposes.<br /><br />I was offered a set of 2 masks, one purple (on the outside, ""inside"" it is black) and one all black. The set also comes with a company information card and a set of your typical orange foam earplugs (which are just a little freebie but are not really part of this review other than I'm mentioning them).<br /><br />These are beautiful masks. Some have pointed out for them they are a little small. At the widest point across the mask it is 8"" and the widest point along the eye covers is 4"". It is perfect for me, hits me just 1/3 into my temple area, just past my cheekbones and covers 2/3 of my forehead- and I can adjust that accordingly. So if there's any question about its size, take a quick measurement with a flexible ruler or tailor's tape. I find that sometimes sleep masks are entirely too big, I'd say this is the best size I've personally come across. It entirely blocks out the light without covering the whole top of my face. The silk is sooooo smooth. I can see the approx 1"" closure they used to put in the stuffing but the piping and cushion were excellently done. I don't feel any awkward bumps in the filling. What I especially love about this particular mask is NO VELCRO. So many of the masks I've had or been given have been made with that infuriating material that just does not work well in a sleep mask. This adjustable slide was easy to move and fit my face right- and the elastic has just the right amount of give and doesn't seem flimsy- so now I don't have to keep opening and closing the strap to get it to fit every time I wear it. It will also not catch my hair. These are at a very good pricepoint and feel and perform like a nice luxury item so they are a good value.<br /><br />The masks did not come with washing instructions, but I'd suggest handwashing by themselves with gentle detergent and lay out flat to dry. Use a steamer and not an iron if that's necessary, but I don't forsee that being an issue. The card that the masks came with does promise quality, and a quick answer if there is any question- also says they have a ""lifetime warranty"". Though I have not needed to contact the company for any reason- I have yet to be disappointed with things I've purchased on Amazon that have these kinds of cards with them. I think this set would make an excellent gift for his/hers. Having used my mask for a week I have absolutely enjoyed it so far.",76677,75

I typically use this in a diffuser and like it by itself (i.e. diffusing only the bergamot oil), but it also is a great EO to blend with other EO’s as well to create unique scents/fragrances (really combines well with lavender).  The oil can also be used in making DIY soaps, candles, etc. if you do those types of things.  Overall a very good product!",77815,946
5.0,1632512600075,"Excellent quality, great price","I have used MAYJAM EO’s before and have been generally impressed (their Ylang Ylang and Sandlewood are great!).  Lavender is one of my favorites though, and this one is excellent.  If you are familiar with lavendar EO’s you know that they generally fall into two main categories of scents (depending on the specific species of lavender used).  One type is slightly sweeter smelling (still strong lavender scent but the subtle sweetness takes the edge off of the scent.  The other general category of scent is a stronger, almost medicinal scent with a slight edge to it.  This falls closer to the latter.  Personally I prefer this stronger scent as I think it does a better job in a diffuser, which is how I generally use it.  It does well in other scenarios too, but sometimes the scent needs to calm a bit so that the edge is off.  I would say that while this one is closer to the stronger, almost medicinal scent, it is not the strongest I have smelled, so in that regard it is sort of the best of both worlds.  The bottle is a large, almost 4oz bottle with a screw on top.  It comes boxed with a separate screw on dropper as well so you can use either.  The box was securely packaged, as was the glass dropper inside.  The price, at under $10 for almost 4oz of high quality lavender EO, is *very* good.  Overall this is definitely a winner.

4.0,1626988866693,"Used on stainless steel, crockpot, and enameled cast iron - see details in review","I wanted to try this product for 3 very specific cleaning needs - stainless steel pans, a crockpot crock and an enameled cast iron dutch oven.  All three had stains that didn’t affect the usability, but just didn’t look all that great.  I had previously scrubbed with multiple things trying to get the stains out but to no avail.  So, here is what happened with this product:<br /><br />On the enameled cast iron dutch oven I would say that it removed 80%n of the discoloration.  Perhaps I could scrub longer or put more elbow grease into it and I could have gotten it all, but I got tired (lol).<br /><br />On the stainless steel skillet, it took quite a bit of elbow grease but it removed ALL stains and it looks like new.<br /><br />On the crockpot crock - I had darker colored stains on a white crock and white (lime???) deposits on a black crock.  I used this product on both and it was a breeze to remove the stains/deposits.  Unlike with the stainless steel and the enameled cast iron I didn’t have to scrub nearly as hard to get the good results with the crocks.<br /><br />So… overall I would call it a success, especially with the crocks and the stainless steel.  The cleaner comes with two non-scratching scrubbing pads (sort of the size of a wash cloth) that are easy to use and easy to clean.  I do wish it had worked a little better on the enameled cast iron, and I am going to give it another try but am pleased that it did at least remove about 80% of the stains.  Overall, a solid 4 star product.  I hope this info is helpful to you in our buying decision!",77815,9751
5.0,1612804256818,Great product that provides customizable comfort,"This is a great product, and while it might seem a bit expensive, I will share with you why it is not:  I have *very* flat feet, and have two sets of custom orthotics (obtained from a podiatric specialist).  Those orthotics cost in excess of $500 each.  They work well, and last 10 years plus.  They have done well for me over the years and are what I use in most of my shoes (since they are removable).  But here is where they fall a bit short, and where these inserts step in (no pun intended):  My custom orthotics are hard/rigid material with a cushioned top.  Unfortunately, for some shoes it doesn’t work well - usually because I can’t remove the sole insert in the shoe OR there is still some sort of arch support built into the shoe.  This insert gives you the opportunity to make adjustments to the fit based on your own specific needs, as well as taking into account the limitations with the shoes they will be going in.  You get two sets of ‘pads’ that you can use to adjust the insert wherever it might be needed.  Each set contains 3 different sized pads, and the sets are differentiated by how rigid the pads are - one set is much firmer than the other.  They are pretty easily moved around so that you can experiment with them to get them just right.  The only downside is that if you are using the pads to adjust the fit/feel based on some limitation of the shoe itself (for example, if you can’t remove the existing sole insert), then they aren’t as easily moved from one set of shoes to the other.  From a size standpoint, I wear a size 10 (men’s).  According to the size chart the Medium fits sizes 8.5 to 10.  I almost decided to order a large and figured I could cut it down but opted for the medium and am glad I did.  It is true to size, and it fits my size 10 shoes perfectly with absolutely no trimming needed.  If you wear a size 8.5, 9 or 9.5 you would need to trim the medium accordingly.  But ultimately, the sizing guide the seller provides is accurate.  I am extremely pleased with the fit, the customizable nature, and the comfort.  Too early to make any judgment on longevity though.  I hope this review is helpful to you!",77815,571
4.0,1605471281354,"High dosage Vitamin D, with added Vitamin K to help","This is a high dosage vitamin D capsule, with vitamin K included to help in the calcium absorption process.  As someone who has had low vitamin D in the past, I started taking supplements a couple of years ago - especially in the winter months when I spend far less time outside in the sun.  The product is vegan, plant-based, and contains Vitamin K which works hand-in-hand with the vitamin D to improve efficacy.  The capsules are pretty standard sized capsules with no smell, taste, or after taste.  Additionally, I have not had any gastric distress either.  If you have no problems taking typical sized capsules you should have no problem with these.  There is a 60 day supply included (1 capsule/day).  The container is a bit large for 60 so it looks kind of empty once you remove the protective cover (not sure why they have such an oversized container unless they have a standard size but offer larger quantities?).  In any case it seems to be a little wasteful as far as plastic usage goes, but it doesn’t affect the product itself.  Check with your doctor before taking Vitamin K products - especially if you have clotting issues, or are on a blood thinner of some kind.  Overall a pretty good product at a reasonable price, especially if you want to add vitamin K to your regimen in addition to the vitamin D.",77815,150

The shake does make a very good meal replacement and keeps you satisfied for a few hours, if you can tolerate the taste. There is just something too earthy about this particular chocolate  flavor that isn’t present in the vanilla. I’ll definitely finish it because I like the nutritional profile but it will have to be doctored up to be palatable. Hopefully adding some instant coffee and half oat milk/half water will mask the flavor.

4.0,1625077557999,Decent taste with a satisfying thickness,"I recently received this protein powder for review.  Having consumed a wide variety of protein powders, both milk and plant based, I have a large pool of powders to compare this to.  This Carlyle powder is quite good.  It bears no resemblance in taste to products from Orgain, but does remind me in both texture, grittiness and taste to Vega's products.  It also has some texture and taste similarity to the Purely Inspired line of plant based protein powders. Carlyle's powder is, however, thicker when mixed with the recommended amount of liquid.<br /><br />I mixed one scoop with 6 ounces of water, and found it a bit too thick for me.  When mixed with 8 ounces, it was quite a bit thinner and more to my liking.  The taste is definitely plant based vanilla protein powder, and if you drink it right after mixing, it is gritty.  Let it sit for a few minutes and the grittiness greatly diminishes.  As for clumping, I couldn't get it smooth with just a spoon, but in a shaker bottle (without a blender ball) it mixed up perfectly clump free.<br /><br />I really appreciate the high fiber content in this, and while there is a bit of an aftertaste, it isn't unpleasant.  The powder is quite sweet, which may not be to everyone's liking, but mixed with a bit more liquid it diminishes.  I also really like that it has a variety of plant proteins, although the main protein is from peas, adding to the grittiness.  There is a nice vitamin and mineral profile in this powder which adds to its value and health benefits.  If you're already high on consuming those vitamins though, you may want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />I've been liking this as a breakfast drink and it tides me over until lunchtime just fine, with a satisfied feeling without bloating.  Nice protein, but at it's current price, it's a bit expensive when compared with better known brands.",78203,64

Kind of like sweet potatoes that were blended or really mashed, compressed and shaped into a bar (which is probably what happened), so it's denser than I expected.

I did notice the same thing another reviewer has mentioned about the use by date being a short time span, which I understand, but the disclaimer about how the company only guarantees 20million cfu instead of the 40 million your paying for is bothersome. This is too expensive if you are truly only getting 20 million by the time you take it.",81058,528
3.0,1673581988821,Meh,"For “relaxation” this did nothing for me. Nothing more than drinking any warm drink. The taste was meh. Taste is subjective, though. I had one mug-ful and then never thought “oh I want to drink that again.”",81183,1923
3.0,1657847746247,Aw well,"My bedroom is very bright in the morning and I love to wake up to that, so when I want to go back to sleep I put something over my eyes. I was excited about getting this (free, through the Vine program). Figured it would be perfect. Not for me, unfortunately. Too bad, as it would make a lovely (though perhaps naughty seeming) gift. It comes in a lovely box and it feels heavenly on. So soft!<br /><br />However, the size and shape of it are really off, at least for me. For reference, I have a small and rather narrow face. That’s why it is surprising that it’s a bit too narrow for me. Also, the notch for the nose is very shallow and because of that light gets in from the bottom. It simply does not fit my face properly. It’s good enough, but if you want solid darkness it is doubtful you will get it. Perhaps it will fit someone who has a flatter nose? I don’t know. But because of this I can not recommend this otherwise lovely product.",81183,169
5.0,1620082034990,Great maca,"I adore maca. This one is superior and the price is about the same as other brands.<br /><br />Maca has a toasty almost yeasty taste and smell. I can’t explain it. I happen to love the taste of it. I use it in smoothies and have for years. It’s supposed to be good for you. Can’t attest to that, but I do know that maca seems to give me a little boost without the jitters of caffeine, so that’s great for me as I can not tolerate caffeine.<br /><br />I particularly love smoothies with a combination of raw cacao and maca. Try them together if you haven’t.<br /><br />When I first started using maca I remember that I thought it actually smelled like sweaty socks - not dirty socks, but athletic socks that had been worn on clean feet that had been sweating. It’s a very particular odor! Nutritional yeast has that smell. And I thought all maca does, too, but that turns out not to be the case. I don’t get that smell from this brand of maca. I’ll admit that I rather like that smell. I like nutritional yeast and I like maca, but this is quite a bit nicer. It has a strong smell that maca lovers will like. My hubby, whose sense of smell isn’t as strong as mine (according to him) really loves this maca and commented on the good smell when I put it from the re-sealable bag into a glass storage container.<br /><br />It is noticeably finer ground than other organic brands that I’ve been buying. That means you’ll have a less grainy taste, not that I noticed it before, but I did notice that this was ground very fine indeed.<br /><br />Good price. Good product. My only complaint is an odd one, and not one that I’ll take away any stars for: I do not like the packaging design. It doesn’t look like the packaging of a food product but more like it would be suitable for office products. Doesn’t matter, as I threw it away. I like keeping products like this in glass containers.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",81183,2132

5.0,1546352271828,Great stuff,"Turmeric is great stuff. It’s super good for inflammation, but on top of that, it’s essential in cooking Indian food. So, why not use the best organic turmeric there is? This would be that, though I do admit I rather like the darker turmeric that I already had in my kitchen pantry. Still, this turmeric is delicious and full of aroma. I thought, from the color, that it might be slightly less aromatic.<br /><br />We make salad dressing with turmeric and I highly recommend trying it. Mix turmeric into any oil and vinegar dressing and add whatever seasonings you want. It seems to add a thickness to it that is really nice and it imparts a delightful color.",81183,13

I tend to dissolve it in warm temp water and then just add lots of ice to make sure it all dissolves.<br /><br />Personally I find that the scoop of these is a LOT for me. I usually use like half or 2/3 of a scoop just because it's a lot of powder for me for one drink. To me just a little less of the aminos is still really helpful and a great amount of flavor. Plus then the jar goes a longer way. Hope that helps!,82662,5785

Not a big deal, I just make sure to not add anything else sweet to my smoothies and it's good.  I like this with peanut butter powder, mmmmmmmm.<br /><br />In nay case, nutrition is good, with the added collagen a welcome addition.  This blends easily, and digests without issue for me.

It's convenient to have a soup flavored collagen, and I've been adding it to soups and stews as both a flavor and protein boost.  I don't think this is the best value when compared to plain collagen and beef bullion, but it is handy.",82679,706

This is the type of unflavored collagen is my preference, as it's the most versatile.  This has basically no flavor, dissolves easily in hot and cold liquids, and gets the job done.  I mostly mix this in smoothies, where it makes no taste of texture difference.  I'm also a fan of adding collagen to soups and stews to boost the nutritional content.

This is a strange product, as it is similar to the sports performance/recovery options out there, but upon closer inspection and after trying it this looks more like a somewhat cynical cash grab in the name of wellness and Kardashians.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- The flavor is mild, lightly chocolate-y, and only lightly sweetened.  Emphasis on mild.<br />- Decent nutrition.  20g of protein per serving, 10g of which is collagen, with no added sugars.<br />- No plastic is nice.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- I wouldn't describe the flavor as fudge in any way.  It tastes more like swiss miss cut with powdered milk.<br />- Strangely expensive given the generic commodity ingredients.  It's not organic, or grass fed or really anything to justify the price. $3 per serving for 20g of protein and a sprinkle of cocoa powder is not a good deal in my book.",82679,1556

I have a number of lingering soft tissue injuries that I've been rehabbing for months, so these seemed perfect for me.<br /><br />These have no smell, and are easy to swallow, so on a practical level taking these is no different than taking any vitamin. I've been taking the recommended serving for two weeks now, and while I can't report massive changes, I do think I'm noticing faster recovery than prior to taking them.

5.0,1595202014333,"Solid ingredients, pleasant flavor, annoying bag","I use protein powder on a daily basis for post-workout shakes, and this looked like a solid option so I gave it a try,  I like the ingredients list, there's no weird ingredients, no junk filler, and especially no added sugars.  I tried the vanilla cold brew flavor, and based on the name I was uncertain if there is cold brew coffee in it, or if the vanilla itself is somehow cold brewed and there is no coffee?  The ingredients don't really explain what's going on there.<br /><br />Upon opening the package, there is a distinct coffee aroma, and when I mixed it with water and ice cubes to test there is a faint coffee flavor.  I don't know that I'd call it a coffee flavored powder, it's more a background note, so don't worry about it overpowering other flavors you may add.  The flavor in general is mild and not-too-sweet, which is just what I'm after with a protein powder.  If I want more excitement I'll mix frozen berries in.  The texture is a little grainy, but that comes with the territory for anything made with hemp/rice/pea protein.  The color is a slightly weird yellowish-brown, but whatever this isn't a beauty contest, it's a convenient way to get a hit of protein on the way out the door.<br /><br />My only complaint is the zipper on the bag clogging with powder and refusing to close. I hold the bag closed with a rubber band and am careful not to knock it over on the shelf, but this type of bag is an annoying way to package powders.<br /><br />In general, this is right in my sweet spot for clean ingredients, good nutritional profile, and good but unobtrusive flavor.",82679,297

He is really bad at flossing, so the water pick option is something he actually likes and uses more. Says it makes his teeth feel more fresh and clean after brushing. Squirts away and excess gunk stuck between his teeth or gum lines. It's also easy to throw in the travel bag and take on the go.

I also like how the sound fades in and out at stop and play so that it’s not just a sudden jolt of noise. The light feature is really cool.

I do his back for him.  I asked him last night how he felt about the product and he said he LOVED IT.  after he buzzes his hair he always has to take out the vacuum and do a whole big cleanup on the floor... not last week!!!  he said the clipper caught almost all of the hair and there were so few that made it to the floor that he just left them b/c I wouldnt even notice them.... and I have to say... I didnt.  less mess in my bathroom... ahhhh yes please!<br />u get 3 guards total.  2 of them flip over so thats really 4 settings and 1 fader.  the fan has 2 speeds and the clippers plug in using a usb cable, which is provided, but no wall plug.  in my opinion, the machine was pretty quite for both clipping and vacuuming at the same time.

I used 1 with pledge to clean my glass dinning table (not cleaned in at least a month... dont judge... we dont use it), after I was done the wipe was still looking good so I moved on to my wet bar.  I folded it a bunch of times to keep the side I was using clean.  I then went into the kitchen with a new 1 and did all of my kitchen counter granite.  as kitchen size goes... its smaller, but not that small.  my granite is black and I didnt realize how much yucky stuff was lurking til I used a single wipe.  I then grabbed another and cleaned my entire toilet.  again great results.  ok lets recap... for 21 cents I cleaned my wet bar, dinning room table, kitchen counter, and my toilet... sign me up for another package of 300 please.  I did put the towel down for a few minutes after wiping the table and I will say that it dried rather fast, so if it isn't really dirty I think u could use 1 again... im not sure if u would want to keep a used 1 lying around, but I think u could.  the only thing I didnt love about the product was the packaging.  these 9"" x 9"" cloths are just lying on top of eachother in a super simple plastic wrapper that once it is open... its not cleanroom ready.  anything could get into the package.  I suppose if u were already inside a clean room when u opened them, it would remain clean, but it just feels like they should have added a ziplock edge to one side of the package.  just a side note... I tried to tear 1 with just water on it, and I wasnt able to...

5.0,1659535818506,"Easy formula to absorb, made in USA, third party lab verified","I need to take magnesium due to low bone density issues which is the result of cancer treatment decades ago.  I have learned that not all magnesium supplements are created equally and that some forms of magnesium are more readily absorbed than other forms -  the National Institute of Health notes ""studies have found that magnesium in the aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms is absorbed more completely and is more bioavailable than magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate.""  As a result, I switched from the less expensive magnesium oxide I had been taking to using more absorbable forms of magnesium.  My research led me to find that magnesium diglycinate is one of the most readily available forms of magnesium for digestion.  One study, entitled Bioavailability of Magnesium Diglycinate vs Magnesium Oxide in Patients with Ileal Resection confirms how much better-absorbed magnesium diglycinate is over the common magnesium oxide.  As a result, magnesium diglycinate is one of the best magnesium forms available for absorption.<br /><br />For a magnesium supplement, this has almost all the positives going for it (the only thing lacking is they are not organic):<br /><br />Made in the USA<br />Third-party tested<br /> Vegan capsule<br />Uses Magnesium Diglycinate<br />Well-sized and easy to swallow<br /><br />The only issue I have with this supplement is that to get 420 mg of magnesium requires 3 capsules rather than the daily dosage indicated on the package of 2 capsules.

Set up was a bit of a pain and I used the single sheet instructions that were printed in LARGE type to do so, but I found that these instructions skipped some setting and the instruction booklet requires me to grab my reading glasses so I haven't sorted that out yet.<br /><br />Once setup, it is easy to use WITHOUT THE VOICE and the readings are accurate as compared to an OMRON machine my wife uses.  That said, this does take a bit longer than the OMRON.<br /><br />The display is clear and easy to read and stores 99 readings for each of 2 users. It is easy to switch between users.<br /><br />The device comes with a set of 4 AA batteries but also includes a USB A to C cable that can power the device.  I was surprised that when I disconnected the USB cable to move the device from one room to another that my settings were saved so I did not have to go through reprogramming the date and time.<br /><br />The verbal reading is helpful but with a thick accent.  When I turn it off, I'm honestly not sure what the machine is saying - I think ""measure over"" but I'm not certain.  I also find it odd that it reads out systolic and diastolic measurements as  ""X millimeter or MERcury"" - I think just a number or even 106 millimeters but hearing ""of MERcury"" twice each reading will wear on me.  There was some setting for PA which I turned off that gave a reading in some other measurement as well, but that was not useful to me.<br /><br />Overall, this is easy to use (after setup) and does the job fine.  The package includes the device, armband, batteries, a warranty card (12 months), USB cable, and a small carrying case.<br /><br />I'm happy to recommend this Antrolife blood pressure monitor - it is easy to use, functions properly and the visual and verbal readout are easy to see/hear.",82707,173

5.0,1655423611178,Wow. 3000mAh battery. Up to 6 hours operating time. Quality design and materials.,"This device is a nice upgrade for anf abdominal/lower back/menstrual heating pad. It contains graphene technology for quick and uniform heating (heating and infrared therapy), offering three temperature settings (104ªF - 140ºF). The three temperature settings are indicated by corresponding color lights: Green = Low Setting, Blue = Medium Setting and Red = High Setting.  These indicators are found on the battery, which is an integral accessory for the heating pad. It controls the power on/off and access to the three temperature settings.<br />The battery bank has one button, a series of indicator lights and a port for the pad’s plug. The battery is the only means to powering and controlling the warming pad.  So, don't lose it, and you can't replace the power bank with a spare USB power bank. Operation is simple, easy. Theres a power button that cycles through the three temperature settings. As mentioned earlier, the single temperature indicator will change colors respective to the heat level.<br />Also displayed on the battery bank is the battery status indicator lights: Flashing (0 - 10%), Low (10 - 35%), Mid (35 - 70%), High (70 - 100%). These setting are indicated via the three blue lights (0/blinking lights, and 1 - 3 steady lights for the four instances).<br />The use of graphene allows for a relatively thin heating pad. This enables a lightweight device, that is conforming to the body’s curves. It fits comfortably, with excellent, consistent contact.<br />These are all noteworthy features. However, the highlight component is the battery capacity. The battery capacity is rated at 3000mAh. Indeed, to my knowledge, it is the highest capacity battery for the product genre. This generous capacity provides up to 6 hours of operating time. According to the manual, it takes 3 - 4 hours to fully charge a depleted battery.<br />At the current cost of $28, it seems very reasonably priced, especially considering the battery specs. Factoring in the various features and quality of design, materials and construction, it’s a very good value.<br />The significant other gives this device a strong favorable nod. Thus, based on these initial impressions, it earns a well deserved 4.5+ star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,9791

Further, it seems to maintain a uniform output during the session duration. That’s already a good improvement. Some other facial nano steamers will have fluctuating temperatures (although not in an extreme sense) and occasional sputtering of steam output.  In our initial testing, it was very responsive, providing a quick steam output with a pleasing warmth. They state that is will endeavor to hold a steady 40℃. Without confirmation from a thermometer,  I feel it did keep a consistent warmth throughout the treatment duration.<br />The attractive appearance would fit most decor, especially in a bathroom or bedroom (the significant other will often indulge her home spa experience between the bathroom and bedroom).

This statement, along with the USDA Organic certification demonstrates that commitment, checking off quality concern boxes for me.<br />This maca has the familiar fragrance and appearance of quality maca. I added it to a bread recipe, and it it created the welcome aroma while baking. The odd thing, is it has less of an earthiness taste when added to a bread recipe than when added to a cup of coffee (possibly due to quantity of maca concentration in the respective usage).<br />This maca powder fully satisfies expectations, earning a 4.75 - 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",82749,1629

So, it's just a matter of affixing the belt, using the velcro connections on the ends to hold the pad in place.<br />It comes with two cords, very short and a longer one.  The short cable is intended to be used with a USB power bank (not included). As mentioned, there's a fabric pouch to hold the battery, with velcro to affix to the pad.  Personally, use of a a usb battery pack is my preferred mode, allowing mobility.<br />Operation is fairly simple. Plug in the power cable. A long press of the power button powers it on/off. Pressing the M, Mode, button cycles through the four options.  Each mode has a corresponding button backlight color.  Red = Red Light, Blue = Near InfraRed Light, White = Red Light + Near InfraRed Light, Green = Red Light + Near InfraRed Light, pulsing.  The button backlights did not illuminate the buttons properly, with only a noticeable coloring in one side of the M button (see attached photos).  While this did not adversely affect operation or performance, it is annoying.  And, it's an indication of lack of quality control.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a series of images noting the button backlight colors per different modes.<br />Based on initial impressions, this device garners a 4 - 4.25 star rating.",82749,796
5.0,1645652961712,Tastes pretty good. Mushroom tea for calming and relaxing.,"I actually consume mushrooms every day; Often as food and as daily supplements (bulk powder or in capsule form).  I appreciate the potential health benefits, and the taste. Two of the mushrooms I take are included in this 'tea preparation'. As noted in the product details, Reishi and Cordyceps are often consumed for their relaxing feature, and mellowing out one's mood.  They're also noted for positively affecting immune systems and cognitive/neurological systems.<br />The significant other was dealing with taxes, and was obviously stressed out. Between dealing with clients and accountants/taxes, I could see she was more stressed than usual. So, I followed the directions and prepared a cup of this ""Unwind"" tea.  I took a sip, and it has a nice taste, and I recognize the usual mushroom earthiness.  But, it has more than a mushroom flavor. There's hints of Chamomile, Passion Flower and Peppermint. Overall, it has a very welcoming taste, and she said it's an enjoyable tea.<br />There's only 5 calories per serving, with 0g sugar and no added sugars. It uses organic monk fruit extract as the alternative sweetener.  So, that's another positive for this product.<br />The contents of the packet dissolved nicely, and didn't leave any grit on the bottom of the mug.  I did add some almond milk, which gave it more a smoothness (she likes her tea and coffee with almond milk).  After the cup of this mushroom tea, she said she felt better and not as stressed out. And, said she'd like another one, after she finishes with her last appointment.  So, it passes the taste test and seemed to calm her stressed out state.<br />Based on these initial impressions, this product earns a 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,1923
4.0,1645304484488,"Nice, mild vibration. Excellent for children and adults. Soft textured material.","This plush pillow, with mild vibration feature, is exactly as depicted and described in the product details.  After removal from the vacuum sealed packaging, the pillow resumes it's functional state as a plush round pillow.  The material that covers the pillow has a nice softness, with great tactile texture/feel.<br />There are no instructions or user manual included with the product.  However, and thankfully, it's simple to figure out. There's a zipper that conceals the vibration device. You remove it and install two AA batteries. Then return it to the compartment and close the zippered opening. (Wish they had a nicer method, which would hide the zipper pull.  Maybe using velcro or snaps would have been a better option.)<br />Pressing the 'hidden' vibration button or squeezing the pillow in the right position will activate the vibration feature. It's a gentle vibration, and is quiet.<br />The significant other's friend and children are visiting today, and the kids love the pillow.  The little girl like hugging it. The little boy wanted to sit on it. haha.  Anyway, it's a big hit with the kids.  The significant other and her friend both thought it was a nice product, especially to occupy the kids.<br />So, overall favorable impressions. Thus it garners a 4 - 4.25 star rating.",82749,2081
4.0,1645223209021,Nice plush pillow with soft material. Decent vibration.,"The pillow comes in a vacuum sealed package, which creates it's own fun.  A child (and adult) might find the reviving, reflating of the pillow to be amusing and interesting to watch.  Once it's expanded to it's full fluffy functional state, its a very nice plush round pillow, with a soft textured material covering.<br />There are no instructions/user manual included, but the process is very easy and intuitive. You open a zipper to reveal a compartment that houses the vibration device. Remove it and insert two AA batteries (not included).  Replace it back into the compartment, being sure to have the 'button' facing the outside.  Then a press of the button through the outside, or a considerable squeeze will activate the vibration.  The vibration is mild, but noticeable. The significant other sat on the sofa, and held this on her tummy while she watched tv. She said she likes it, and thinks kids will really like it.  But, she noted that the zipper pull needs to have a better method of hiding it.<br />So, overall, it matches the pictures and descriptions in the product details. It's a comfortable and comforting product, with good plushness and nice, soft textured material. It earns a 4 - 4.25 star rating.",82749,2081
5.0,1644612376674,"Excellent gifting option. Excellent shower steamers with smart, individualized packaging.","Review for BYGGVIR Shower Steamers, 18PCS Travel-Sized Shower Bombs Set, Aromatherapy Shower Steamer with Bow Gift Box.<br />First of all, the very attractive presentation definitely elevates the worthiness as a gifting option. In fact, it already looks like it's all set to be presented as a wrapped gift.<br />The attractive presentation is a prelude to the colorful and fragrant shower steamers within.  The shower steamers do not disappoint.  Covering them is a translucent page, with the respective fragrances, along with their visual coloring. It's an elegant manner to identify the size different types.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the shower steamer product, with a ruler for size reference.  I included photos showing measurements of the shower steamer. I hope these images are helpful during your purchase consideration.<br />I really like that each shower steamer is individually encased in a capable package. This eases packing the shower steamers in a gym bag or luggage. Usually, we have to put shower steamers into zip lock baggies (if you wanted them seaparated, you'd either use separate baggies or put a paper towel between them). So, this is a very nice and welcomed feature of this product set.<br />Overall, the product delivers as a gifting option, and supplies quality shower steamers with smart packaging that facilitates storage and travel utility. Based on these criteria, it earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,2120
5.0,1644357991452,10ml (0.3floz) bottles. 20 bottles of excellent fragrances. Impressive assortment.,"This is an impressive collection of quality and fragrant essential oils. What is also noteworthy is these therapeutic grade essential oils are: ""PURE AND ORGANIC – our set of essential oils is carefully handpicked, ensuring there are no additives or artificial components. We understand the essence of natural essential oils, and that is why all the 20 bottles only have organic products that are non-toxic and safe for human use.""  So, besides the wonderful scents, they are human friendly. This is good scents and good sense.<br />The significant other opened each of the bottles and said she loved the aroma of each. She decided to use the Chamomile oil in the diffuser, for the living room. A few drop was more than adequate for the job. So, these 10ml (0.3floz) bottles should last a long time.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the essential oil product set. I included close ups, in groups of 5, for a closer look at the assortment.<br />The set has an attractive presentation, and would be a wonderful gift.  In my case, the significant other said she decided we're keeping it. haha. So, obviously it a winner in our home.<br />Based on these initial impressions, it earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,2152
5.0,1642715567098,Decent quality. Cost effective sonic toothbrush replacement heads.,"This seems like a credible replacement for sonic toothbrushes. However, the cavity that accepts the metal extension is smaller than expected. To be fair, though, it was not tested with a Philips brand sonic toothbrush; the host brush is a different brand sonic toothbrush.  So, it is possible that it's fully compatible with the Philips brand.  (Although, I've attached other 'compatible' sonic toothbrush heads with success.)<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the toothbrush heads. I included pictures of the product attached to a sonic toothbrush. You can see that it cannot fully attach, leaving a gap.  Also want to note that it took considerable effort to 'force' the brush head onto the metal spindle. When powered, the brush did appear to function as expected.<br />Overall, the brushes appear to be identical to my original sonice toothbrush head. I couldn't measure the diameter of the receptacle. However, from attempts to attach it, the hole was obviously too small.<br />Since, I cannot be fully certain of the compatibility with the specified Philips sonic toothbrushes, owning a different brand, I will rate this product based upon the apparent quality of materials and manufacture. As such, it's a very credible product, and will receive a 4.5 star rating.",82749,767
5.0,1642482033376,Excellent sonic cleansing performance. Attractive design. Good value.,"I like the overall appearance of this sonic cleansing brush. It has a stylish minimal aesthetic, with easy handling and operation.  Of note, it affords an exemplary sonic performance. When powered, even at the lowest setting, your skin can feel the brush head actually vibrating. This is perhaps the best sonic technology cleansing brush that I've encountered.<br />It comes with three different brush heads, which easily push on/pull off.  Two of the brushes have fine nylon bristles, designated as soft and deep cleaning, with the third being a silicone bristle brush head. The brush heads are well made.<br />The device has three modes. According to the user manual: Level one is Daily Cleaning, Level two is Deep Cleaning, with the third level cycling between the two modes.  The user manual does not give specifications for each level. (The product details mentions the two levels as being 9600rpm and 7200rpm.)<br />The user manual is very brief, with sparse details, specifications.  Besides the lack of details regarding the power levels, there is no information on the battery capacity. It does note that it takes 3 hours to charge the battery. And, that it can be used for two months. That's a very vague, ambiguous specification for operating time.<br />Also, no definitive detail on the waterproof rating. They claim it's waterproof, but clearly mention not to 'soak' the device under water. So, I doubt that it's rated IPX7, which would be true waterproofing. At best, it's IPX6, which means that it's safe to wash/clean under a faucet. But, again, this lack of detail/specification is missing.<br />The regular price of $50 seems like a decent cost for the quality of the product. The current cost of $25, including the $25 savings coupon, makes this a very good value.  Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.  Various angles and close ups of key features, aspects are provided for a comprehensive overview.<br />The quantity and value of the missing data counters the excellent design and performance of the product.  It does exhibit excellent performance, elegant appearance, and good value, resulting in a 4.5+ star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,604
5.0,1642373765259,What a sonic brush should be. Excellent design. Excellent sonic power.,"This is one of the better powered facial brushes that I've used, including sonic, rotary or vibrating varieties. It has a nice sleek, minimalist design appearance. There's only one button, for very easy operation. The massage heads merely push on, and pull off, but they don't fall off when in operation.  Perhaps the only design flaw is the piece of silicone that holds the cover for the charging port will sometimes interfere with standing it up on a counter.  It's generally possible, but I feel it's not very stable. It's a minor issue, though.<br />Operation is a simple press of the power button, which lights up the ring around the button. Also, the top button lights up, indicating the first power level. Another press advances to the next power level, indicated by the bottom light coming on. Next press activates the third power level, with both lights alight. The next press will power it off.<br />I was actually surprised by the robust sonic cleansing effect of this brush. You actually feel the brush impacting the face.  In fact, I had to take off the brush head to confirm that it wasn't rotating the brush. Prior to this device, I always felt that rotary brushes performed much better at cleansing the face, because I actually felt the brush moving on the face.  I got this effect from this sonic cleansing brush.<br />There is no information regarding the battery capacity, other than the product details stating that it takes 3 hours to charge it, and it lasts 2 months (with the title explicitly stating ""continuous use for 2 months"").  I think the battery capacity and some semblance of operating time estimate should be provided, especially in the user manual.  This absence dings the rating.<br />Additionally, they state that the device is 'waterproof', without disclosing the waterproof rating. I consider IPX7 to be waterproof, with lower ratings to be water-resistant. This information is also lacking in both the product details and user manual.<br />The user manual is very brief, with sparse information/specifications. This is the negative aspect of the product.<br />Overall, I do like this sonic cleansing brush, a lot.  Attached are photos to show real world images of the sonic cleansing brush, with a ruler for size reference. Various angles, accessories and close ups are provided for a comprehensive overview of the product.<br />The missing information/specifications lowers the rating of an otherwise excellent product. It receives a 4.5+ star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,604
4.0,1641253746574,Decent performance. Damaged/marred exterior surfaces.,"The initial impression is the haphazard presentation.  It seems like little to no concern about the organization or preparation of the parts/components of the product.  Some parts obviously interacted/crashed into each other, leaving scratches, nicks and marks on various parts. This is unfortunate and disappointing, because the product is a decent and competent steaming device.<br />Assembly took about 20 -30 minutes. Probably would take much less time, but i have to admit that I was watching tv, while assembling it in the living room.  Then, based on the significant other's instructions, carried it into the master bathroom (yes, she's the 'master').  The bathroom is a perfect size room to contain the steam, and is constructed for steam from baths/showers.<br />Operation is very easy.  Fill the container with tap water (at least for the first five sessions, per the instructions).  The controls are separated for the heat/steam and the UV lighting.  The UV Lighting feature is not to project UV light onto a person.  Rather it's used to sanitize/clean the water and ozone generation.  Together it emits a nano ionized steam, which they state ""improves cell vitality and skin's absorption of oxygen.Using the facial steamer regularly can Cleaning your face effectively, moisturize your skin and reduce wrinkles and colored patch.""<br />She commented that it works great, and it's easy to position the output.  She's only sorry that she didn't use the aromatherapy feature. But, she smiled, 'there's always tomorrow'. So, she's very happy with the performance of the professional facial steamer.<br />Based on the excellent performance/function of the facial steamer, the relative ease of assembly, and factoring in the cosmetic damages, this product earns a 4 - 4.25 star rating. If you have the space, this is a very nice accessory to outfit your own home spa.",82749,2011
5.0,1641177418859,Premium level design and construction. Red Light and Near Infrared Light Wavelenghts.,"There seems to be more pen shaped devices offering red light therapy features.  And, usually, their offerings are only in that specific red light wavelength spectrum.  This product offers both Red Light Therapy and Near InfraRed Light Therapy, 660nm wavelength and 850nm wavelength respectively.  The main difference between the two is the depth of penetration of the light therapy.  Red Light deals more with aspects closer to the surface of the skin, while Near Infrared Light can affect deeper within the skin to more directly affect muscles and subcutaneous tissue.<br />Some assembly is required in this instance.  The bottom section unscrews to reveal the battery compartment. They supply 1 rechargeable battery.  In this design form, when the rechargeable battery goes bad, you can purchase a replacement, and continue using the product.  In other products, with a 'fixed' installed rechargeable battery, when the battery fails, the product is finished.  And, rechargeable batteries do eventually fail.<br />In another clever design move, they made the top section removable, too.  This reveals the usb-c charging port.  There is a small indicator light near the charging port. While charging it glows red, and then green when fully charged.  It takes 4 - 5 hours to fully charge a depleted battery.  The defined treatment session is 10 minutes, after which the device will automatically power off.  The user manual states that it can be operated up to 12 times on a single charge.  So, basically 2 hours of expected operating time.<br />Besides the usual accessories (protective eyeglasses, drawstring pouch and usb power cable), they include a tripod with flexible legs and an adapter clamp to hold the light therapy pen.  This is a smart and clever addition, which allows the user to position the device handsfree.  This addition boosts the rating.  It's an accessory that I never considered with our other light therapy 'pens'.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.  Various angles and provided for a comprehensive overview of the light therapy pen, with closeups of key aspects/features.<br />The product offers 660nm and 850nm wavelengths, for Red Light and Near Infrared Light therapies.  It's smartly designed, with the product exhibiting quality materials and construction.  It satisfies expectations for a portable, reliable dual wavelength light therapy pen.  Thus, earning a 4.75+ star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",82749,2444
4.0,1640127571888,Decent vacuum function.  Good for body grooming.,"I've been hesitant to use this type of specialty product - body hair grooming device with built-in vacuum/suction.  I figured that I already have cordless hair clippers, with a variety of hair guides.  And, after using that to trim, shave body hair, could brush off hair debris and take a shower.  But, having used this I can see the possible benefit of the combined features.<br />It creates less mess, with virtually no cleaning up (depending on the length and amount of hair that is handled).  And, cleaning the device of suctioned hair is fairly simple and easy.<br />Maybe because I'm not very experienced, but i felt that I needed to use the top suction power level to handle the sparse chest hair that I shaved for the test.  When I first started, with the lowest suction level, I wasn't sure if it was suctioning the hair. I didn't feel at ease until it was at full power.<br />I didn't feel that the device was very ergonomic, with the grip area far from the shaving action.  I felt that I had much more control using my cordless hair clippers than this device.  Attached are photos to show real world images of the product, with a ruler for size reference.  Different angles are shown for a good overview of the device.<br />Overall, it does a credible job at cutting and suctioning hair bits. The blades perform well, cutting the body hair with ease.  At the top speed, it did a competent job of suctioning.  To be honest, I'm not totally convinced of the efficiency over my previous usage of cordless hair clippers.  Based on initial impressions, it garners a 4 star rating.",82749,15893
5.0,1639695849567,Quality appearance and feel.  Visually attractive.,"Excellent pill case, with metal exterior and credible plastic internal compartment.  I found the textures on the top and bottom of the case to be quite attractive.  The manufacturing displays quality, with impeccable construction, with excellent materials.<br />The clasp shows the inherent design and construction quality.  There is a space created to allow free motion of the clasping mechanism.<br />I won't wax poetic about a pill case, but this is a well designed and attractive product.  Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.  It ably serves the intended function, with quality design and materials.",82749,181
5.0,1638148024458,Decent quality IPL device. Abundant number of flashes. Needs better documentation.,"This is an excellent entrant in the IPL market genre.  It follows an often used design form, that allows for comfortable handling and application.  The operation is deceptively easy, just keep in mind that the light energy is powerful, so use it cautiously and wear the provided protective eyewear.<br />IPL is Intense Pulses of Light, that is a treatment primarily for 'permanent' hair removal, and also in certain scenarios for skin treatments.  In this case, the product is designed for treating hair follicles with the eventual goal of permanent cessation of hair growth.  ""IPL treatment is administered through a handheld flashgun device that emits pulses of light, which are absorbed by the melanin pigment in hairs. The light turns to heat that is absorbed by the skin, resulting in damage to the follicle effectively removing hair and slowing down regrowth significantly.""(online reference).  After repeated treatment sessions, the regrowth cycles is disrupted to the point of no further hair renewal.<br />To be effective, the subject needs to qualify according to skin color and hair color.  Basically, light skin color and darker hair color are the ideal combination.  This is due to the intense light affecting melanin, the pigment. So, the contrast is necessary, and you want the light energy to affect hair pigmentation, and not skin, obviously.<br />Operation of this device is straightforward.  Plug in the AC power adapter cord.  A long press of the power button (with the power icon) will activate the IPL device.  The fan will start, and you'll see the display showing the number of flashes remaining, the intensity level (default is set at lowest), fan icon.  The display will also indicate if it's in auto or manual mode.<br />The user manual does a very poor job (actually non-existent) at explaining the manual mode.  In this mode, the user actually triggers the flash.  The significant other tells me that everyone uses the automatic mode because it's easier and faster.  Anyway, the large button above the power button switches between automatic and manual mode.<br />In automatic mode, when you press the flash window on skin it will trigger the flash. Then you lift it and move it to the next, adjacent target. Lower the flash window, touching the skin, which automatically triggers the flash again. This process is continued until you cover the targeted hair region.<br />They warn against overlapping and missing areas.  I wondered how a user can ensure that there is no overlap and avoid missing areas, when the flash window is not flush with an edge.  This is not an issue specific to this product, but to IPL devices in general.<br />I like the overall presentation and quality of the product.  Besides the IPL device, it includes a generic straight edge razor, protective eye wear, AC power adapter/cord and user manual.  While the user manual is adequate, I feel it could have been better, more informative.<br />Based on initial impressions and observations, this is a very competent and capable IPL device.  It is exactly as depicted and described in the product details.  It earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,4143
3.0,1634165613505,Somewhat decent performance. Horrible instructions.,"This facial steamer seems like a generic product.  In general, it's a capable product and functions properly.  There's one button, that powers the device on/off.  That's the only control element, which demonstrates the simplicity and ease of operation. Assembly is very simple, too, with one hitch.  The main body is already complete, needing only the extension arm to be installed.  The extension arm is slightly tapered, and the correct orientation is very obvious.  Insert the end with the opening, which would allow the steam to flow through the tube.  Also, the other end has a small opening port for the steam to exit.<br />The reservoir is removed by lifting it upwards.  Once removed, you simply unscrew the cap and fill the reservoir with filtered/distilled water (they stress the use of distilled water to avoid any residue or contaminants which would negatively affect longevity).  Screw the cap back on, put the reservoir back. Position the extension tube so the opening is in the desired direction.  Press the power button, and within 30 seconds, the steam will issue forth from the slot in the extension tube.<br />The user manual/guide is horrible.  Besides the broken english, there is a lack of information.  For example, there is a small ""half tube"" with slotted openings.  It fits into the opening in the body, and the extension tube can fit over it.  What is the proper orientation of this half tube? What is the function of the half tube? It would be nice to know, but there is zero mention in the manual/guide, nor in the product details.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the product and accessories.  You can see the half tube alongside the extension tube.<br />Facial steamers range from $20 - $40+.  This is priced in the mid to upper range of comparable products.  While the product does function, with decent performance, it was an underwhelming experience.  Based on initial impressions, this facial steamer receives a 3.5 star rating.",82749,9306
5.0,1633738806687,"Effective performance.  Good construction. 2 channel, 4 outputs.","This is an upgraded version of the usual consumer level TENS/EMS device.  It's a very capable device, able to deliver effective electrical signals to effect muscle and nerve stimulation.  In fact, the levels of intensity are probably more than ample, with most users finding the lower levels more than adequate.<br />It seems that the primary upgrade is the addition of an output port for each channel.  So, you can actually affix four sets of pads, 2 per both A and B channels, to either form an extensive treatment or to share a 'massage' session simultaneously.  Keep in mind that each channel has a set output, and adding pads will share that intensity.  So, you may find that you'll increase the intensity levels to accommodate the shared load.  Then, if you opt to use just one set of pads per channel, you will need to adjust for that instance (so a lower intensity will feel the same, within your tolerance levels.<br />I have a slight issue with the two side buttons.  It's very difficult to identify them using their markings.  Fortunately, it's just two buttons. The top button is the power button, where a long press will turn it on/off. The lower button is the 'lock' button.  So, if you get confused and long press the lower button to turn it on, you'll notice nothing happens. Then repeat the long press on the top button, and the display will light up, and you're ready to select your mode, timer and channel intensities.<br />Operation if fairly simple, especially if you've previously used a consumer TENS/EMS unit.  The M button allows the user to select the massage mode. T button cycles at 10 minute increments the timer function (the default is 20 minutes, but you can cycle through and get a 10 minute option).<br />This device is well equipped with 24 modes and 20 intensity levels.  However, the only specification provided regarding the battery is that it takes 2 - 3 hours to charge the battery. And, the product details states that it lasts 20 hours 'Standby Time"".  I have no idea what 'Standby Time"" means, and at what manner of settings it includes.  Perhaps, it's 20 hours of just being turned on? This lack of definitive battery capacity rating and operating time dings the rating.<br />This issue with the battery and operating time specifications is unfortunate.  The product displays decent design, materials and manufacture.  And the current cost of $32, including a 20% discount, makes it very reasonably priced for it's quality level in the product genre.  Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference. Various angles and views are provided to afford a good overview of the device and included accessories.<br />Accordingly, this product earns a 4.5 star rating, with a moderately high level recommendation.",82749,605
5.0,1632537262704,Fantastic assortment of green agate hearts.,"We love the diverse group of green agate hearts. The product details provides an accurate measurement for the hearts. The hearts match the pictures shown in the product details. Of course, due to the vagaries of natural agate, the appearances will vary.  So, you cannot be certain of the specific coloring or patterns.  You can be certain that you'll receive an attractive assortment, though.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference. You can clearly see the range of colors and patterns of the green agate.  The hearts are nicely polished, resulting in a shiny and shooth surface.<br />The green agate hearts are exactly as described and depicted in the product details.  They are lovely.  As such, this product earns a 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",82749,8528
3.0,1631111101632,Mild scent.  Disappointing.,"The attractive presentation makes this a very gift-able option.  The shower steamers are colorful, with a mild scent.  In fact, that is the problem with this product.  She used one last night, and I used the product in this morning's shower.  My shower tends to be quick, so I thought the short duration affected the aroma intensity.  It didn't seem as strong as other shower steamers that we've used.  So, when I asked her impression of the steamer, she said that she was a bit disappointed because it barely had any fragrance.  She said she even picked it up, to sniff the disc. It definitely had a significantly weaker fragrance than others.<br />I also noticed that the discs are smaller than other shower steamers that we've used.  But, the size shouldn't affect the scent.  Also conspicuously absent was the usual welcoming aroma upon opening the box. In this instance, there was barely any scent.  I thought they possibly used a different covering/coating around the shower steamer to 'hold in' the fragrance.  When I'd hold a steamer to my nose to sniff, there was a slight recognition of the fragrance.<br />The steaming discs are not labeled, nor identified on the box.  They do give a color code with associated scent, on the enclosed 'thank you' card.  It's in small print, but it's there.  While I don't like this mode of identification for the shower steamers, it's better than nothing.<br />This set of shower steamers, offering four different weak scents, proved disappinting.  Accordingly, it earns a 3.5 star rating.",82749,335
5.0,1630173632667,"Exquisite, beautiful Himalayan Salt hearts. Exactly as shown. Lovely.","I got these with the intention of using it for massage treatments. However, once the significant other saw them, she said they should be displayed because they look beautiful and emit strong energies.  I did have to agree with her. They seem like works of crystal art/sculpture.  So, if you plan to purchase these for massage purposes, you might consider buying two sets. One for display and one for massage.<br /><br />The pair of hearts received are very similar to the pictured product. One is pale pink, while the other has more of a rose pink hue. The shape/form are practically identical. There are generously sized, with corresponding thickness. The heart shape is well proportioned. I estimate the height and width at approximately 3 inches, with the thickest aspect about 1.5 inches.  Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br /><br />Even though they are touted for their mineral content and physiotherapy application, they can easily stand alone on their visual beauty.  These Himalayan Sea hearts are expertly crafted, resulting in wonderful heart shapes, with appropriately smooth surfaces.<br /><br />The pair of salt hearts come in a gauze drawstring bag, that increases it's worthiness as a gifting option.<br /><br />We are both impressed with these Himalayan Salt hearts. It matches the image and descriptions in the product details. It deservedly earns a 4.75 - 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",82749,17967
5.0,1627511359688,Exactly as shown and described. Great touch-up kit.,"If you get a scratch, scrape or minor chip on wooden furniture (actually any wooden surface), somehow it seems magnified and always catches your eye. Even a tiny, slight scratch.<br />This touch-up kit can help minimize that annoyance. It comes with 10 touch-up markers and 10 filler touch-up crayons. The supplied colors: Black, Gray, White, Mahogany, Maple, Oak, Cherry, Walnut, Chestnut and Brunt Sienna.  Each set has it's own specialty.<br />The touch-up markers will mask a slight scrape or scratch. The 10 markers have a range of wood tones that should accommodate most finished wood surfaces. The filler sticks resemble crayons, and you use the included sharpener to make a finer point, depending on the nature of the repair. They recommend warming the filler stick before application. You rub this filler stick into the problem area, 'filling' it. Allow it to dry. To refine the repair, use the touch-up marker to attain a close match to the surrounding wood.<br />If the filler stick doesn't handle the repair, it's probably not a minor issue. Then you could try other repair products, like wood putty or plastic wood to fill the chip or crack. Then when those products are dry/cured, you can use the touch-up markers to match the original wood.<br />The product matches the product details. It's a worthwhile repair kit. Besides furniture repair, it can be used in arts/crafts projects, too.  Overall, the product is exactly as shown and described. It won't create magic and restore things like new. But, it will mask obvious scratches, scuffs and chips. So, it earns a 4.25 - 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,2174
5.0,1623868556225,"Great transportable phototherapy device. 54W = good power. 630nm, 660nm and 850nm wavelengths.","Considering the design, the form makes this a very transportable device. It even comes with a drawstring bag to store it. With a rating of 54W, this has ample power, similar to some of the more powerful bulb types. It covers 630nm, 660nm and 850nm wavelengths, as opposed to most bulb types that don't only include red light 660nm and infrared 850nm.  I also feel the rectangular format issues a more uniform exposure.<br />The power cord has the power button, which also accesses the timing function. Successive taps of the power button will cycle the timer settings.  Including the usb power plug is a smart decision, making the item a complete product. Now, the user won't have to search for an available usb port, or a spare usb power plug. The only disappointment is the lack of a user guide/manual. But, to be fair, other red light therapy bulbs that we have did not have a user guide/manual included.<br />Another included accessory is the folding stand. It can unfold in various configurations to allow numerous positions for the lamp. See the attached photos, I show two possible configurations, with the lamp in horizontal and vertical orientation.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the product, with a ruler for size reference. Note the compact size, and the smart design. There is no fan, operating in complete silence. This product could easily travel inside a gym bag or luggage.<br />If you are searching for a credible, quiet photobiomodulation (red light therapy/phototherapy) lamp for skin, muscle treatment, this deserves serious consideration. It matches the descriptions and images in the product details, and appears to be a very well crafted device. It earns a solid 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,607
5.0,1622414931447,Cute. Good flexibility. IPX7 Waterproof. Decent speed. Adorable.,"Per the significant other, this is adorable. It's smaller than expected, which works to it's advantage in this case. It is flexible, and not just at the neck of the device. It handle yields, and bends allowing a generous arching.<br />The operation is very easy and simple. Press and hold the power button. This requires a deeper press than usually found on other facial brushes. This is because the device has a generous silicone covering, which establishes the IPX7 waterproof rating. In fact, this rating allows this device to be safely used in the shower or bath. (At the bottom of the handle is the self-healing silicone port for the charging cord. It closes and seals to maintain the waterproof integrity.)<br />Once powered with a long press of the power button. Successive short presses of the power button cycles through the 4 speed settings. The silicone brush is not silent, emitting an audible buzz/hum. The frequency changes with speed increases. The accompanying speed increase does noticeably increase the vibrations felt during skin contact. The sound level might be a bit louder than desired, but it's indicative of the powerful motor. Personally, since the motor/vibrations are robust, I can accept the associated sound levels.<br />We both like the appearance and performance of this silicone brush. I am amazed at the degree of 'bend' capability of this device. (The significant other just yelled to me that it's pink, so it's hers, and I shouldn't use it. Find a buy a blue one. haha)<br />The product is exactly as described and shown in the product details. It easily earns a 4.75 - 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",82749,8373
3.0,1622338239437,Decent sound quality. Very poor manual. Audio files seem sub par.,"I was intrigued by a sound machine that also displayed the temperature and humidity.  And, this product does indeed prominently show that information. Maybe the next innovation will be incorporating a clock with an alarm (with option to sue the various sounds), which would be fantastic. But, the temperature/humidity works as advertised.<br />There are few buttons, which would normally indicate ease of operation. However, in this instance, it could use at least one more button. There is a power button, a long press turns it on/off. Below that button is a control for volume. Unfortunately, it the only button for volume control. You cannot selectively increase/decrease volume. You need to go to full audio before you can begin lowering. Separate buttons for up/down makes more sense on a sound machine. At the very least, some manner to control the direction of volume.<br />There is a time button, that allows selection of 20, 40 or 60 minutes, with the default being no timer setting.<br />On the right side of the display, the top button has a lock icon. This button will lock the settings.  Press this button and a single tone indicates lock state, another press with 2 tones is unlocked.<br />Below that button are two buttons, that give access to the categories and sub-group of audio files.  The speaker system is surprisingly good for a sound machine/night light. Unfortunately, the audio/sound files do not seem to be the best quality or wise selections. For example, the water sounds are not soothing. One sounds like water dripping, which may be more like torture than sleep inducing. I went through a majority of the sounds, and couldn't find any that I thought would be conducive for meditating or sleeping.<br />The manual is close to useless. Perhaps the only value of the manual is to see the listing of all 48 sounds contained in the machine. I found that most of the functions were discovered by trial and error.<br />Case in point. the manual shows that there's a button with a light bulb icon, that controls the lighting on the machine. There is no such button. But, touching the speaker grill on the top of the device will cycle the lighting scenarios.<br />Now that I figured out the buttons and lighting, I wish the sound files were better.  Based on these observations and considerations, this sound machine earns a 2.75 - 3 star rating.",82749,1783
4.0,1620518573845,"Decent speakers, good audio selections. Nite light color selectable. True AC adapter included.","The sound machine aptly reflects the pictures and descriptions in the product details. There is a large assortment of sound choices, each of decent quality. The speaker is decent, although a bit lacking in the lower frequencies (bass sounds). The sound machine does operate as expected. While the icon based touch buttons are a bit small, they are rather easy to figure out (especially easy if you read the user guide, and view the round card insert that details the function of each button (see attached photo, close up of the round card).<br />A 3 second press of the 'sun' icon will activate the light feature. Successive taps of that same button will cycle through the various colors. A 3 second press of the button will turn off the lighting feature.  That's an example of how easy and simple the operation of this product.<br />Opposite the 'sun' icon are the three touch buttons to select the audio/sounds. There's 32 audio options available. You can adjust the sound level, however the lighting intensity cannot be adjusted.<br />The clock icon engages the timer options.<br />The operation of the sound machine is much common sense, and pretty straightforward.<br />An important note: this is not a rechargeable battery operated device. This could account for the better speaker (needing more power for this aspect). While I prefer cordless operation of this genre product, this was not a stated feature of the product. So, this does not negatively affect the rating.<br />On the other hand, a full AC adapter with long cord is included. Not a USB cable that requires a free USB port, or a USB power plug. This is a plus.<br />Another feature mentioned is the availability of a headphone jack. I find this a bit odd, but I guess if someone wants the sounds, without disturbing someone in the same room, headphones would be considerate. This scenario only makes sense if you're planning to use the sound machine for meditating or relaxing. I don't envision someone wearing headphones while planning to fall asleep.<br />This is a very credible sound machine with a rather bright night light feature. It basically satisfied expectations, based upon the descriptions and pictures in the product details. It earns a 4.25 - 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,202
2.0,1615322169368,Mediocre performance. Not for use in wet conditions. Information discrepancies.,"This cordless razor for women has a nice design, but has performance issues. It seems to have a decent battery, but the overall power is rated at 3W. Compared to cordless hair clippers that are rated at minimum of 5W, and most are much higher than that. This could account for the suspect effectiveness of the device. Also, like many electric razors, the hairs should not be long. Long hairs tend to get pulled in most electric razors, that's just the tendency of long hair and moving blades. So, at best, this works best with fine, short hairs. If you use it daily, there will be less pulling, and a more comfortable shaving experience. Is this ideal? No, but that's the best circumstance to use this device.<br />The product details mentions in some spots that this is a 'wet/dry' device. The user manual explicitly states to keep this device away from wet conditions. Huge discrepancy. If someone just followed th product details and not carefully read the user manual, there could be serious issues. This serious misinformation negatively affects the ratings.<br />The product details also says it has a lithium battery. The product states it has a Ni-Cd battery, huge difference. There are more discrepancies, but these two major items suffice to note that the product details give inaccurate (and possibly dangerous) information.<br />Based on these considerations and issues, I would caution anyone considering this product.",82749,2013
5.0,1615246148999,Excellent source of organic maca.,"Maca is a superfood, adaptogen, that I consume daily. It is an acquired taste, mind you. I usually add it to coffee, along with mushroom powder blend and protein powder (sometimes a collagen powder, and often chocolate flavored). This is what I call my superman, superfood morning cup of coffee. Some studies have shown vast health benefits from maca consumption. It's contains antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and generally considered to be nutrient dense. It helps with energy, mood, general well being and hormonal balances, too.<br />The company notes that they ""tested dozens of samples from various suppliers around the country, and based our choice on organic quality, flavor profile, 3rd party testing, and country of origin.  WE DO NOT SOURCE OUR INGREDIENTS FROM CHINA"" (Note: country mentioned is Peru.) I mention this aspect because many are concerned about the purity and integrity of supplements/foods with China origination. And, with maca being a native product of Peru, it makes sense to get the 'real' thing from the proper source.<br />The label has certifications/badges for: Gluten-free, Soy-free, Non-GMO, Packaged In USA and USDA Organic. The certification for USDA Organic is comforting. I wish they also had FDA registered facility and/or cGMP certifications.<br />The scent and taste of this maca is exactly as expected. I feel that it's an excellent source for quality maca.<br />This product merits a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",82749,2132
5.0,1613408082285,Excellent selection of sounds. Perfect for sleeping or meditation.,"An excellent device to create an audio ambiance. There are a number of user selectable options regarding audio type, volume, color of lighting, timer setting.  So, it's easily customizable per your intended use.<br />We have a sound machine in the bedroom, and this will have a home in the home office, which is also the mediation room.  Usually we like to use the water sounds, but sometimes the white noise is more useful to block out extraneous sounds/noise. Setting the timer is a gentle way to know when the scheduled meditation has ended. Instead of an alarm of some sorts, the sound machine simply ceases. Wonderful.<br />Even if you're not into meditation, place this unit in your bedroom. When you're feeling stressed, set up a relaxing sound and lie down. Just relax and breathe...be conscious of your breathing and just don't think about things. Just relax. And, umm, well, now you're practically meditating. hehe. You'd be surprised how this little mental respite can refresh you.<br />The only issue with this product is the absence of a USB power plug. It comes with a usb power cable, but needs a USB power port. Having this near a laptop or computer kinda defeats the purpose of the sound machine (getting away from stress/work). So, you need to purchase or have a spare USB power adapter plug, like the one usually used for smartphones. Luckily, with the proliferation of smartphones, most people have a spare usb power plug. For a device like this, the usb power plug should be included.<br />Overall, it's a fantastic product. It meets expectations, matching up to the descriptions and pictures in the product details. Attached are photos to show real world images of the sound machine.<br />it's a very useful and competent product. If it came with the usb power plug, it might be close to a 5 star rating. However, based on impressions and considerations, this product earns a 4.75 - 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",82749,212
3.0,1612912311703,"One side is effective, being a good quality shower brush. Other side is a fail.","The soft bristle brush on this shower brush is very effective, and works as expected. The wooden handle is crafted nicely, with no sharp edges or 'thorns' (small splintery aspects). In general, with manufactured well with no unexpected surprises.<br />The surprise comes from the other brush side.  From the product details: ""One side is very soft and holds soap well, and the other side of the natural bristles is perfect for a deep scrub,especially in the exfoliation."" Well, the natural bristles are somewhat stiff, but actually work well with scrubbing the back. Especially compared to the reverse side. This is supposed to be the softer bristle side. Instead of bristles, there's a widely spaced pattern of nubs (plastic, nylon, silicone?) that are not natural bristles. These nubs are attached to a flexible base, so they bend with contact and pressure. The nubs are not soft, by any definition. As mentioned, the base is flexible, and allows these nubs to rub along the skin.<br />I found this shower brush to be incongruent with the product details description.<br />If the hard nub side was not on a flexible base, it could serve as a decent back scratcher. As is, i feel it's ineffective and a design fail.<br />Another issue: the pictures show an exaggerated view of the size of the brush.<br />So, one side, with natural bristles, is an effective, functional shower brush. The other side is a fail. Based on these impressions and consideration, this shower brush earns a 3.25 star rating, and a cautious recommendation.",82749,210
4.0,1612802197302,Excellent method to custom fit supports.,"This is a versatile and effective insole/orthotic. There are pairs of inserts that you can affix to the insole (or the inner sole of the footwear, thought placement would be tricky). They vary in size, but have the same height. You can build up to achieve your personal need by placing smaller insert on top, creating a dome-like shape. The orange inserts are 'normal' and the yellow inserts are 'softer' cushioning. You can stick with one form, or mix them. For example, a firmer bottom insert with a softer upper piece.<br />A word of advice: If you plan to use the cutting guide, and not the existing original insole as a template (maybe it's glued in and can't be removed), then cut larger than you think is necessary. Then you can fine tune the cut for a perfect fit. If you cut too short, there's not much recourse.<br />I like that you can start with this product as a cushioned insole, and gradually build up for arch support. Further, appreciate the option to customize the softness of the arch support. I put this into my winter boots, with soft arch support, and it feels great. My shoe size is mens 8.5, and it's near the lower end of this product's Medium size. I think I cut along the lines that measure for size 9 (checking that it seemed larger than the existing space). Lo and behold, it fit perfectly into the boot. Maybe boots have extra space, more than sneakers or regular shoes. But, this is the very reason I advise cutting larger and then fine tune your adjustments.<br />Overall, the product appears to be constructed of quality materials, similar to other insole/orthotic products. It is not as stiff as other orthotics, which I prefer. (I don't require an orthotic, even though i don't have normal arch levels. So, i use cushioned insoles which give a gentle arch assist/support.) I used the softer insert, for a gentle slope and support. At this point it's difficult to assess durability. It seems to be made with quality materials, similar to other insole products. However, if it deteriorates quickly, or affords less comfort/support, i will amend this review.<br />I like the concept and implementation of the assorted shapes and stiffness of self stick inserts, with a cushioned formed insole. This product earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",82749,571
5.0,1611418134186,9g protein per 10g serving. Good unflavored taste.,"This is a very competent collagen peptide powder. It delivers 9 grams of hydrolyzed collagen peptides per 10 gram serving. It has only 35 calories, No Fats, No Carbohydrates, No Sugars, No other ingredients other than Collagen Hydroglyzed (Beef) Powder. So, this is as clean as you get.<br />I added it to a morning smoothie, that had strawberries as the dominant flavor note. One scoop of this powder added no discernible taste to the drink. Fantastic. I did the finger taste taste, and any flavor is barely perceptible.<br />I am impressed. I am considering adding this powder to some tapioca pudding I'm making as dessert, to kick up the health/protein aspect.<br />The label contains a number of certifications and badges. The one that if of most critical to me is cGMP. Certified Good Manufacturing Practices denotes attention to the purity and integrity of the ingredients and manufacturing processes. Checking off this box is an import plus for me.  At the current price of $23, it's reasonably priced.<br />Good certification/badge, very good 'non-flavoring', excellent hydrolyzed collagen peptides powder, decent price leads to a solid 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,4243
5.0,1608505528958,Excellent mushroom extracts. 5 popular mushrooms in capsule.,"As a long time advocate/user of mushrooms, in bulk powder and capsule forms, I am impressed with the ingredients in this supplement. Mushrooms have shown potential health benefits regarding antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, immune system boosters and positive aspects relating to brain/neural systems. That and tasting great, at least in my opinion.<br />This supplement provides a good quantity of the various mushroom extracts per capsule: 500mg Lion's Mane 4:1 Extract, 50mg Chaga Mushroom 4:1 Extract, 50mg Maitake Mushroom 4:1 Extract, 50mg Shiitake Mushroom 4:1 Extract & 50mg Reishi Mushroom 30% Extract. And, the company notes these are all extracts from fruiting bodies.<br />The bottle displays certifications/badges for 100% All Natural Premium Ingredients, Made in USA and cGMP (certified Good Manufacturing Practices). The cGMP is the most important badge, to me, because it indicates attention to the purity and integrity of the ingredients and processing. So, check this box.<br />Serving size is 2 capsules, with 60 capsules per bottle. If you consume other mushrooms, or supplements that offer the same health benefits, you could take one capsule/day and extend this supplement to 60 days.<br />Overall, I like and am impressed by the ingredients in this mushroom extract supplement. It matches exactly to the description and depiction in the product details. It earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,2140
3.0,1607731991111,Very good flavor. 20g protein per 35g serving. only 12 sevings = pricey,"First, the chocolate fudge flavoring is very good. This might account for the rather high caloric numbers per serving. Also, 35g per serving seems like a considerable amount of powder for a protein mix. The notion that a Supplement Facts would note a serving size as being ""2 heaped tbsp"" seems like a rather inaccurate measurement. Either include a scoop, or use a conventional measure, like 1 level tbsp or 10g. Using 'heaped' could varying significantly based on the size and shape of the spoon.<br />This product contains collagen, milk protein concentrate, whey powder, whey protein concentrate, instant whole milk powder. I like that it has 0 saturated/trans fats and only 5mg of cholesterol. It does have 6g of sugars per serving. Of the 20g protein, 10g is collagen. Thus the remaining protein is derived from the milk/whey powders and protein concentrates.  This does give a nice balance of collagen (which is not a complete protein source) and milk/whey proteins (which is considered a complete source of essential amino acids).<br />Based on their suggested serving size, there is only 12 servings in the container. I would prefer these types of products to provide a month's supply.  So, based on 12 servings, this is a pricey collagen/protein mix.<br />There are badges for Gluten-free and All Natural Ingredients. However, not for GMP or 3rd Party Tested, which is disappointing.<br />The flavoring is top notch. The calories are excessive. The servings per container is too low. Pricey.<br />Based on these considerations, this collagen/protein mix earns a 3.5 - 3.75 star rating.",82749,1556
4.0,1606671721143,"Impressed with the ingredients, with high potential health benefits. Collagen Peptides, too.","I truly like the assortment of healthy ingredients in this Beauty Blend Powder. It contains: Beet, Maca, Chaga Mushroom, Goji Berry, Maqui Berry, Acai & Collagen Peptides.  As a disclaimer, part of my daily regimen includes beet powder, maca root powder, various mushroom powders and protein/collagen powder. So, having these, with the antioxidant/flavonoids from the berries is welcome.<br />They don't list the quantities of each ingredient, but a 6.6g serving yields 3g protein. So, I am guessing that the collagen peptides fills most of that protein. That brings up an issue. I think users want more details about the quantities of the ingredients.<br />I do appreciate that the Nutritional Facts lists certain facts/numbers. 0 sugars, 0 cholesterol and virtually 0 fat are important aspects, in my opinion.<br />The flavors of the berries basically masks the flavors of the other ingredients. Adding it to a smoothie or almond milk gives it a purplish hue. it's a tasty addition.<br />There are no badges/certifications relating to FDA or GMP, which is somewhat disappointing. However, i did enjoy and appreciate the ingredients in this superfood blend. Accordingly, it earns a solid 4 star rating, with a moderately high level recommendation.",82749,1582
4.0,1603657112062,250mg Trans Resveratrol per capsule. Very good value.,"It seems resveratrol products are finally becoming more commonly available, and from various companies. Further, trans-resveratrol, which is the 'active' component is being marketed (derived as a resveratrol extract). This product is an interesting variant which is composed of resveratrol extract (50%), yielding 250 mg of trans-Resveratrol per capsule.<br />While the suggested serving is 2 capsules, I would advise starting with one capsules and build up to 2 capsules per day. As with other supplements, give your body a chance to assimilate to the new addition to your diet. Also, see how your personal biology reacts. And, since this is an extract, it's more concentrated than normal resveratrol.<br />The two important badges on the bottle note Mae in USA, and GMP certified facility. These are comforting and confidence inducing aspects.<br />This supplement is very competitive in the resveratrol marketplace. So, beside being a 50% extract, it's also a decent price value.<br />As with many supplement, and especially with products like resveratrol, the benefits are not readily apparent. You ingest many supplements like this in quest of long term benefits (some supplements do provide relatively quicker benefit/effects, though). So, I can't comment on the efficacy of this specific product.<br />The product does match the descriptions and depictions in the product details.<br />Overall, the product earns a 4.25 - 4.5 star rating ,with a high level recommendation.",82749,6152
3.0,1601424643288,"Mask is bit stiff and small. Plain, generic strap extenders. Nice neck lanyards.","While the product has a nice presentation, instead of simply tossed into a plastic bag, there are shortcomings to the mask. I liked the openness of the design, which allows for easier an greater air flow. However, the size is rather small, and most people will feel that with the top place on the tip of the nose, it will barely cover the mouth.<br />Another issue is the stiffness of the mask. While I applaud the attempt to make a durable product, the stiffness makes the mask cumbersome and uncomfortable.<br />The strap extenders are generic and basically functional. Getting 50 of this item is excessive, but welcome. Personally, I use the ear loops and they're effective and easy to affix and remove.<br />The lanyards (2 provided) are decent. The masks have connection points, which you can use these lanyards to secure to the face, and to hold the mask when hanging from the neck.<br />Sadly, I was disappointed in the masks, which is the primary component of this offering. It needs to be more flexible and larger. As such, a rating of 2.75 - 3 stars might still be a bit too generous. A mild level recommendation.",82749,717
4.0,1601005988453,725mg of Vitamin C per capsule.,"This supplement contains 725mg of Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid).  My usual Vitamin C supplement contains 1g of Vitamin C per capsule. However, this supplement adds Phospholipid Complex (Sunflower Oil and Lecithin), 25mg per capsule. I do like this addition, and prefer lecithin from sunflower instead of soy. In fact, the label also states that it contains no soy at all. There's a list of items that are absent from this supplement, like artificial ingredients, flavors and sweeteners.<br />The product displays certifications and badges for Made in USA, GMO-free, Vegan, Gluten-free and GMP.  The two key badges are the GMO-free and GMP badges, in my opinion. These badges on the bottle lifts the confidence in the supplement's integrity and purity, and positively affect the rating.<br />So, while it is not as strong as other vitamin c supplements (per capsule measures), it is a very credible supplement. The suggested serving size is 2 capsules, so the does would reach 1450mg, which is more than decent.<br />Accordingly, this supplement earns a solid 4 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,2143
4.0,1600207518706,"Improvement over previous generation. Softer, more effective bracket. Not perfect, though.","I was intrigued and interested in this upgraded mask bracket. Indeed, I feel it is an improvement over the previous generation bracket. It seems a bit larger and is constructed of softer silicone. This softer material, seemingly more malleable, conforms to the face better. Also, the shape is more triangular, which accommodates the positioning around the nose and mouth.<br />The larger holes compensates for the more numerous, smaller openings found in prior masks. So, I felt it was actually a bit easier to breathe with this bracket under a mask.<br />Is it perfect? No. But I think it's practically impossible to design a bracket that would work for everyone. It can't be one size fits all. Luckily, these just barely fit my facial features. I would have liked it to be slightly larger, but it still seems effective at the current sizing.<br />I don't wear glasses, so I can't comment on resistance to fogging. I'm giving one to my sister, she wears glasses, and will get her opinions on fit and whether it effectively deals with the fogging issues. I will amend this review/rating upon receipt of that evaluation.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br />My initial impressions are positive. Thus, I feel the brackets deserve a 4 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",82749,18575

From only 100% grass fed cows, our bone marrow supplement is FREE of hormones & GMOs. Our bovine supplements contain absolutely NO fillers or flow agents, and undergo rigorous quality screening for agricultural and chemical contaminants. Manufactured under the highest quality cGMP standards. ""<br />That statement impressed me, I try to be careful and look for manufacturing processes that align with my health pursuit. I am bewildered that none of these 'standards' are noted on the bottle. The omission of these badges or notifications on the bottle does not instill overwhelming confidence in these claims. For this reason, the rating gets appropriately dinged. It is unfortunate because I am impressed with the ingredients, otherwise.<br />Accordingly, this gets a 3.75 - 4 star rating, with a moderately high recommendation.",82749,256

TENS unit worked as expected.,"This is a credible TENS EMS product, with a variety of patterns and a very good range of intensity.<br />I wanted a portable unit that I could put in my backpack or sports duffle, so I could deal with achy muscles after sports or doing odd jobs away from home. This unit fits that bill admirably.<br />The TENS unit is solidly constructed, not too heavy but with enough heft to give it substance. In other words, it doesn't feel cheap or like a toy. The display screen is nicely sized, so viewing the options is fairly easy. There are basically 6 modes, with each having 4 iterations. A and B channels are independent, which allows you to alter the intensity of each channel. While not usually mentioned in these portable TENS units, you can also opt to just set up one set on a channel, for a simplified 'massage' instance.<br />The setup of the pads is very simple and straightforward. The setup of each channel, selecting the modes and intensities is fairly intuitive. I'm not sure if my prior experience was a large factor, but setting up the channels and actually using this unit seemed very easy and less complicated than previous generations of portable TENS products.<br />I did have one issue with the product. The USB power supply was faulty. After connecting the power cables, it failed to charge the batteries. I simply used another usb power brick to charge the TENS unit.  I will need to test the provided USB power supply to determine if it's truly defective. I will update this review after I determine the actual condition of that component.<br />After an afternoon of biking and playing some tennis, my leg muscles were barking, especially the calf muscles. So, while at my friend's house, we were both recuperating from being weekend sport warriors, and i pulled out this product, to attend to my leg aches. He watched with amazement and curiosity. After a brief session, he asked if he could try it. So, I set it up on his balky knee, and adjusted the pattern and intensity. He said it's fascinating and effective.  I told him I have a set at home, and got this for my 'away' bag, and explained the science/technology behind the TENS EMS. Told him I got it from Amazon. He wrote down the name of the product and said he needed to get one, too. So, that is a random, objective endorsement, which I feel positively influences the rating.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with ruler for size reference.<br />I feel the product matches exactly with the description and illustrations in the product details. It is decently priced in the market niche. Based on ease of use, and quality of build, it merits 4.25 - 4.5 stars and a high level recommendation.",82749,877
4.0,1581545914965,Impressive mushroom supplement. Wish they included Cordyceps.,"In general, I liked the components of this mushroom supplement. One mushroom is missing, in my opinion. I would have been happier if they included Coryceps mushroom powder in their mix. However, the mix of mushrooms in this supplement is impressive.<br />Also impressive, they note that much of the ingredients of the blend are extracts, so theoretically more potent than just mushroom powder.<br />Overall, an excellent assortment of mushroom powders (in extract form) in a capsule.<br />High recommendation.",82749,2148
3.0,1577209992570,Slightly more bitter than comparative products.,"Nicely packaged, which I think preserves the freshness of the powder. I like the aspect that it's 'wild grown' organic, and cruelty-free. The certifications are assuring. I've ingested moringa powders from different brands,  in capsule form and pure powder. This package seemed a bit more bitter, which was definitely noticeable. I used it alone, and then I added it to a mixture that included maca, spinach, beet and kale powders. The bitterness was less apparent, obviously. Of course it's impossible to assess the efficacy after a few days, even after weeks...So, I won't even try to offer any speculations.<br />I think that the taste will not be a factor after daily use, which was the case of other powders that I ingest. I will continue to use this product, and the aspects of certifications, being organic and 'wild grown' will encourage me to purchase this brand.<br />So, in all fairness, I'd currently rate it at 3 - 3.5 stars.",82749,308
3.0,1576186356277,"Medium size a bit snug, but credible set of dishwasher gloves","Overall, a nice set of dishwashing gloves. They are individually packed, and come sealed in a larger plastic bag. Funny thing is one set was supposed to be green, but my eyes see them as being more bluish. Not to start another internet meme about colors, but i found it interesting the color differed a bit from the product details illustrations. Other than that, these gloves are pretty much as described and depicted by the product details.<br />One set is unlined, another set is flocked with cotton, integrated into the glove. The gloves I received were size M. As opposed to a different set by the same company, these fit reasonably well. Just a smidge snug, but no complaints. Personally, I usually get these genre of gloves in size L, so that it's easier to put on and remove. I will say the flocked lined gloves were easier to put on and remove, and perhaps has more of a premium, luxurious feel. The company says they use the latest materials and manufacturing processes. Since these gloves feel kinda thin, hope the technology facilitates stronger durability of the materials. However, being thinner, the fingers feel more free to handle items. Personally, I did not notice any appreciable increase in tactile grip, but that could just be a function of normal washing of glasses and dishes. For a test, i was able to pick up a dime from the marble countertop.<br />I think I may re-purpose the gloves to protect my hands while crafting. I think these could be very useful when making candles in molds, or using soap molds (I don't make soaps, but think these gloves could benefit those that do.).<br />For the purpose of dish washing, these are fine gloves.  They are thin, but I can't determine durability until time, usage has elapsed. If there is any development after some reasonable time of use, I will amend this review (positively or negatively).",82749,2801
3.0,1576104638515,"Decent set of dishwashing gloves, latex-free. IMO, a bit thin.","Overall, a decent set of dishwashing gloves. They are a nice length, and you can always fold them upwards if the length bothers you. The length is nice to protect your sleeves/arms from getting wet, also to prevent water from spilling into the interior of the glove. The integrated flocked lining is the nicer of the two types, with a nicer feel on the hands. This lining also seems to allow easier removal of the gloves, I found.<br />These were sized L, and they were a little loose, which was fine. I usually wear a L sized men's glove (USA sizing), and the fit is just right.<br />I cannot say the textured fingertips performed any better than other rubber gloves, partially because I am careful while handling pots or items that are handwashed. The coloring on the fingertips have not real additional functionality.<br />The gloves seem to be on the thinner side, which concerns me regarding durability. To be fair, time and usage will be the arbiter of that issue. Latex-free for those with such sensitivity.<br />Again, of the two types, the integrated flocking is the nicer feature.",82749,2151
5.0,1587169045875,Good for cakes and cookies,"These are really nice little gift boxes.  The 8x8 inch size makes them good for small gifts and baked goods.  I got these to package cookies and smaller cakes in and so far, they have been great.<br /><br />These come flat and are easily assembled for each use.  They seem pretty sturdy but I add a cake board for extra support for heavier items.  The only downside for baked goods is that they don’t have the nice display window.  These would work very well for gift boxes too",82812,1097

I figure with this large quantity at such a low cost, we can afford to replace them if needed and i wont be so mad at him for always forgetting to bring them home.<br /><br />The plastic is good quality and stands up to microwaving.  I also have ran these through the dishwasher several times without any melting or warping. The blue lids snap on easily every time and offer a very secure fit. These are definitely comparable to the name brands with a much lower price.",82812,258
4.0,1573880371383,Not too sweet,"I have been using this agave inulan powder regularly in smoothies and also mixed in with matcha tea.  I don’t like my drinks super sweet, so this is perfect for me.  It really doesn’t have much flavor, not like some sweeteners that leave a bad taste in your mouth. It adds a hint of sweetness without being too much.<br /><br />With that being said, I think this would not be a product for someone looking for a very sugary sugar substitute.  It would take a TON of this to get to the same level of sweetness as granulated sugar.  My daughter has also tried it and ended up adding 4-5 big scoops because it wasn’t sweet enough for her.  If it’s used in small amounts, I think it’s a good value.",82812,13
5.0,1572349552423,Great brand for Irish moss powder,"I’ve found that Super Organics is a great brand to use.  This Irish moss (also knows as sea moss) comes in powder form.  I have previously only used it in its whole form. It’s great as a thickener to replace gelatin for a vegan option.<br /><br />There are a ton of health benefits from Irish moss. I’m skeptical of some of the claims but there are lists and lists on Pinterest to sift through. Similar to coconut oil, it’s made to sound like a cure all, but you’ll have to decide for yourself.<br /><br />I have added this to smoothies and muffins for tile nutritional boost.  How much to add is a matter of personal taste so I would experiment with small quantities to make sure it’s a flavor you like.  I don’t mind it in small doses, it gives off a little seaweed flavor that is easily masked by other ingredients.<br /><br />I do think this is a good brand to use, there are some less than high quality options out there for Irish moss/ Irish moss powder and it’s hard to tell the difference sometimes but I’ve been very happy with this brand.",82812,13

1.0,1605707183135,"moves around a lot, blood is not absorbed and sits on the surface.","I  was really excited to receive these. They came just in time as I was fixing to start my cycle... fast forward to me being 4 days into my cycle and I absolutely HATE these cloth pads. I have other brand ones and was really hopeful and excited for these. however the one button that fastens it to your underwear is not enough, I find they slide forward or backwards a LOT throughout the day, which calls for a LOT of readjusting. there is a little tag on them that does not stay down and that comes up periodically throughout the day which causes you to scratch your behind like you have some issues in there.  they clump up a lot when you sit down which is really uncomfortable. the microfiber material is not absorbent to the menstrual blood, it is just sitting on the surface which leaves you with a really wet and gross feeling. also on a new pad, the first time you use the rest room, even if there is a VERY LITTLE on the pad, the smell is really potent and horrible... but worst was the little liner you get. I found myself SEVERAL times in my 2 hour grocery trip, hiding in an aisle and digging my hand down my pants to pull that thing more forward because it keeps going to the back and into my butt crack which was super uncomfortable... Overall I don't think these are good cloth menstrual pads, there are much better ones out there that will get the job done",82937,7585
5.0,1654264281404,Great facial steamer with a fantastic look!,"[[VIDEOID:a6226cb3f85010349ed640dec3d79e96]] What do you get:<br /><br />1- The facial steamer device.<br />2- A stainless-steel skin kit including 4 tools.<br />3- Instruction manual.<br />4- Oil pad and its mount for using essential oil.<br />5- A measuring cup.<br /><br />This facial steamer works great. The first thing I noticed was the fantastic and stylish design. It comes with a fairly long power cable to reach the plug conveniently. Using the device is very easy, you fill the measuring cup that comes with the device up to 80ml and pour it into the device, add essential oil on the pad if you want and place it in front of the steamer nozzle and turn on the device by pressing the power button.<br /><br />It takes seconds to start the stream of the steam and the good point was that it was a consistent stream both in the flow and its temperature. The stream is warm enough to feel good on your skin and as long as you don’t move your face very close to the nozzle, you won’t have any problems with the steam burning your skin. Adding your favorite essential oil will add a much more pleasant scent to it as well. It is mentioned in the instruction to use the device for a few times a week and no more than 10 minutes each time. Based on personal experience, the device doesn’t run more than 20 minutes with 80ml but that’s more than enough for one person.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1- Stylish design for the device and the plastic dome.<br />2- Decent length power cable.<br />3- Consistent stream of steam and temperature.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1- The refill capacity is only 80ml which is not very much but more than enough for one complete use.<br />2- The plastic dome doesn’t sit stable enough and the slightest push can move it, so you have to be careful with it.<br /><br />Overall, this facial steamer is fantastic. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for something convenient for at-home usage.",82971,8063
5.0,1634956181953,Great plant-based protein powder with good flavor!,"I tried JYM protein powder and it is one of the best ones I have ever tried in terms of the flavor. I am generally very picky about the flavor of my protein powder, and it took me a long time to find something that I really liked. This one comes very close to that in terms of not having either the bad flavor or the after taste. According to the supplement facts, it has about 24 grams of protein for every 38 grams and 140 calories plus 2.5g of fat. The amount of fat and the calorie were a little bit higher than my other protein powder, but it wasn’t a really big deal. The only thing that is missing in the supplement facts, is the amount of cholesterol in each serving.<br /><br />The flavor is pretty good, but it is a bit overly sweetened. The artificial sweetener also doesn’t help. It is hard to find a protein powder that doesn’t have the bad after flavor, but this one was decent. Not the best but was good enough. The serving size is one scoop and it says to mix one scoop with 6-12 oz of water, but I mixed it with 16 oz and it was still decent. One thing that this one was missing was the flavor of hazelnut. The chocolate flavor is obvious, but there is only a slight hint of hazelnut.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Flavor, great scent, dissolvability in water and gritty taste plus the good packaging.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The amount of sweetener is a bit high. It doesn’t taste bad, but it is slightly over sweetened, in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this protein powder if you are looking for a killer protein powder with good quality ingredients.",82971,1540
5.0,1629892976199,"Good variety of scents, they all smell great!","This pack comes in a nice and compact that has all the bottles securely placed in it. The pack of essential oils comes with a wide range of scents including: bergamot, cinnamon, eucalyptus, frankincense, jasmine, peppermint, rosemary, rosemary, lavender, lemon, tea tree, ylang ylang. All smell good as expected, except bergamot and ylang ylang since I don't know what those two scents are, I cannot compare them to any other brands of essential oils I've had in the past. The oils are decent quality and last a long time with a few drops when used in a diffuser.<br /><br />The peppermint is a bit weak compared to how strong it smells before using it. I wasn’t a huge fan of the rosemary oil but it smells like rosemary so that has more to do with not liking the scent rather than any complaint with this brand.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these oils as they seem to be good quality for long lasting scents when used in a diffuser. This pack can also make a great gift for sure.",82971,615
5.0,1608135474807,Good quality organic turmeric with really reasonable price!,"Disclaimer: these bags are big :D. There are three individual bags for a total of 12 oz of turmeric powder. The scent, color and taste are as expected. There is only turmeric listed as the ingredients, however it is packaged in a facility that also handles tree nuts, so this product is not allergen free. This item is listed as raw, vegan and USDA organic in a BPA free package.<br /><br />Overall, the quality of the turmeric is good enough and comparable to other turmeric I’ve used. It tastes pretty good and has a very good scent. My main complaint is the packaging. The zipper to seal the bag is a poor design and as soon as any powder gets in the zipper it fails to stay sealed any more. I ended up having to put the bag in another Ziplock to keep from spilling as the zipper wouldn’t rezip after the first time opening.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this product as is good quality turmeric and priced very good.",82971,2111

This set can easily be all you need to easily fix your glasses anytime you need for a long time. It is very cheap (only $14) and has various sizes of screwdrivers, screws and everything you need for that. It even comes with spare covers and nose pads for your glasses in case you need them. Isn’t it awesome?!<br /><br />Cons: The set comes in a plastic box and it could definitely be sturdier than what it is. So, you have to treat it a bit carefully.<br /><br />Overall this is amazing, and I would totally recommend this to anyone dealing with glasses. It can be a good alternative for going to a store for simple glasses problems.",82971,2299

It has a pretty great taste, and an interesting orange flavor to it, but it is not too sweet as it is expected from similar products. I have tried many powdered drinks like this one for workout and sport and it seems like the main ingredient to many of them is just sugar ☹. Jigsaw drink, however, does not have sugar and contains only 10 calories per serving, which is a great advantage over similar items. The pack has 60 servings as advised on it, but depends on how strong you like it, you can add less than the serving size every time or just water it down to be able to share one stick.<br /><br />This product offers a variety of nutrition such as sodium, potassium, chloride and magnesium and it is ZERO SUGAR. The powder has a fine quality and fully dissolves in water. You can drink this alone or even add it to a smoothie of your choice with any other drinks you can think of, but be careful because it has a strong taste. The package is also super convenient to use, you just pull the bottom part out, get as many sticks as you need and push it back in. It also makes it easy to store for any period of time.<br /><br />Overall, I would give this product a solid 5-star review and highly recommend this to anyone as it was one of the best I have tried so far.",82971,1673

Overall I found the massaging function kind of useless for daily cleaning and more useful for special days I just wanted a little more pampering. If you're going for a massage, this is your brush. If you're going for deep clean, this ain't it.",83062,2014

Ok another sip.. downed the glass. No. I was right the other times. I really dont care for the stuff. But honestly, im not the typical person. I pull 14 hour days and I feel at times like I could pass out. I work a lot in heat, sunlight, hot attics, on black plastic at the organic farm. You name it. I do physical work. At the end of the day Id drink (well i wont say that word I was thinking) but lets say I dont care what it tastes like as long as it puts those nutrients back in my system FAST and as long as I can recover. It must be nice having a posh life in the AC.  I dont have that option. So does this stuff work? ABSOLUTELY.

I own an organic farm. Do some research. Make sure the website isn't sponsored or owned by the giant parent company or you'll only get ""their side"" and of course they are going to sugar coat it; (pun intended) Other than that they are pretty good, and we all need extra zinc and Vitamin C in these 2021 times.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful please click the HELPFUL review button!

You're kinda hoping no one else brought a gift, and you can sneak yours out the door when no one is watching. Oh that's just me you say? Ok. I'm ok with that. I didn't like those people anyways!<br /> This bag is inconspicuous yet professional.  Business like and classy yet plain. Its just a beige bag with a thick rope handle that's a bit too nice for hanging out for groceries, but perfect for an upper class gift. They're VERY sturdy, and I trust the rope. Unlike the bags at a local grocery store that includes the word Joes.. cough... who's bag handles are known for breaking. Just nice thick sturdy plain gift bags for when you need exactly that. I say premium price because its about a buck a bag. But that's about the going price of a gift bag, so fair is fair. An overall decent deal.",83658,109

5.0,1606077813534,"Myself, my wife, and my dog. All 3 of us are taking this!","The thing about supplements is they are hard to prove or disprove. So many factors. Was your body already in the healing stage? Did you stop sitting on a certain couch that was causing it? Did it really work?<br />I'm a realist. Unless I can say with 100% proof positive conclusion; I'm not saying either way.<br />I got these for myself, my wife, and our dog. All 3 of us are experiencing joint issues. Have they cured any of us? No. Have we been on them for months? No. Do they work? unsure. Is it worth a try? YES!!! Does pain hurt??? YES!!!<br />unless I can prove something doesn't work I rate it 5 stars. Because I don't want to smear any brand's good name.<br /><br />So the best anyone can do is the following:<br />1) limit sitting time! Sitting for too long can cause these same issues. Your body needs exercise, and until you give it said exercise, expect to continue hurting. Of course there are exceptions, but that's just my findings. In times (like during snow storms) when I find myself watching a lot of TV or playing a lot of video games, I experience pain in the joints. Its conclusive. The 2 go hand in hand.<br />2) Use a cain to get up if necessary, and exercise WISELY. Don't over do it. But don't do nothing either! A good steady walk down my local main street at night enjoying the lights seems to help.<br />3) Research any remedy. The ingredients on this look promising. Its exactly what my research suggested I needed, so I'm taking it. Time will tell.<br />4) For the pooches the same rules apply. They're just like us only covered in fur.<br />Hope this helped somehow.",83658,1632

The elastic band can be adjusted with velcro and is softer on the side that is against your face.  I wear my hair in a bun when I sleep, and I did find that the velcro easily caught on my hair and pulled it.  It was fine once the mask was on, but not pleasant getting to that point.

3.0,1644015865246,I Think Best for Light to Moderate Cleaning,"This spray mop is okay for light to moderate cleaning.  I like it because it's easy to put together plus I can use my own cleaning solution (50% vinegar and 50% water).  The mop head, which is a large flat pad that attaches to the bottom of the mop, is large about 15.5 inches in width.  This comes with 3 mop heads.  An interesting feature is a plastic comb-like tool that attaches firmly on the mop handle for cleaning the mop head or, as suggested, cleaning tough spots on the floor.  To be honest, I use a mop so hopefully I don't have to bend over and clean much on the floor.  On my floor, which was quite dirty, I did have some spots that I cleaned using another scrubbing item I already have which is why I state this is mop works best for light to moderate cleaning.  The cleaning solution bottle is easy to use.  It just pulls out where it fits in a position that to me seems upside down.  The bottom is a small plastic lid which twists off.  When filled with the desired solution, it just goes back on the mop handle.  I found it does take a small push to get it properly fitted into place.  To spray the solution when mopping, there's a trigger-type lever on the top part of the mop handle.  The solution sprays out several inches in front of the mop so care is needed if one doesn't want to get woodwork, doors, and such wet.  My rating is 3 stars for this is not cleaning as effectively as I hoped for especially with the roughness of the pads which should have helped with 'scrubbing.'",84446,1292

Fortunately, my hands don't get that dry because I would not like to have to use this since it's thick and sticky.  The active ingredients are petrolatum and lanolin.  Other ingredients are cod liver oil, light mineral oil, microcrystaline wax, and paraffin.  These ingredients form a good protective barrier and are soothing but definitely cover the area applied in a sticky film.

The white pair with blue fingers are unlined inside.  The blue pair has a flocked lining inside.  Although I prefer gloves with the flocked lining, both sets of gloves are great for protecting hands while doing household cleaning chores.  Even though these gloves offer no heat protection, I find that I can tolerate hotter water when washing dishes when I have either pair of these gloves on.  These provide a good grip when cleaning dishes and other items as well.  My rating is 5 stars for these gloves perform well and are a good value.",84446,1643

I've attached a picture of the first pair along with the second pair for comparison.  The other 2 pairs of gloves are unlined and are white with pink fingertips.  These gloves are sized as medium and fit my hands well.  I would consider my hands small so I was a bit surprised by the fit.  I like that these gloves come individually packaged so there's no need to open them until needed.  I like the rich blue color of the lined gloves.  The palms of the gloves are embossed which assists in gripping.  I really didn't notice it on the blue gloves but this embossing stands out on the white gloves.  It's fairly easy to feel items being handled through the gloves.  I like how these protect my hands and am rating at 4 stars.",84446,1649

I'm 5'3"" and about 117 pounds so I had no problem getting them on.  Although this says it fits most, I suspect it does but the larger one is, the more difficult it may become.  The legs were longer than my legs but I just did some tucking at the bottom.  I do like the way they look.  They fit like a glove.  The crotch area does not embarrass me as it fits smoothly.  The waist is very high with a wide 4 inch band at the top. It stays up and is comfortable.  Obviously this is the type of leggings worn with a long top that goes over the waist and hips.  The fleece lining is black and feels very comfortable.  I like wearing these.  I like wearing these so much that I don't even mind that the instructions state to hand wash.  My rating is 4 stars because of the care needs as well as one size does not necessarily fit most.  I think it's important to share what body types work and don't work with these.",84446,11

The second day I used it after leaving it in the fridge for 2 hours, made me feel even more relaxed and sleepy. The headaches and migraines aren't gone unfortunately, but just that compression and relaxation feeling is worth having it on for me and I think I am going to use it every night in bed.<br />Things that I didn't like though is that it is Hard to keep in place if you wear glasses and you are using it during the day.

3.0,1627513591722,Interesting tool...works great for leg cramps...,"This massage tool is interesting in that it uses counter pressure to wrap around your body part (arm / leg) to squeeze and roll-rub the tissue. I've used this a few times and have come to the conclusion that it works very well to rub the calf muscles, especially if you struggle with leg cramps like Charly Horses. This helps circulate blood flow to all the right areas and help overall soreness. I do see a potential problem for some folks with this if they have very big / thick calfs, thighs or arms. Call it fat arms or legs, or muscly - whatever your body structure - it may not work for you as this tool only pulls apart so far to be able to wrap around your leg or arm.

When I tried this with booties, sneakers, heels, flats and with no shoes here is what I experienced - when wearing booties/boots - my foot would slide around with this gel cushion. I had my socks over my foot and this product, so it shouldn't have moved as much, but it did. Have you ever tried walking with your feet kind of moving back and forth or side to side in any of your shoes? Yea, me neither. So this was an uncomfortable experience. This happened in booties, heals, healed booties, wedges. When wearing sneaker, tennis shoes, flats - these gel pads moved a lot less as there is less friction and pressure on the toe area, BUT it did not work well with all flats (pointy, almond toe, or that have petite noses instead of elongated noses). Did it help relieve pressure and pain? Kind of? It is very jelly, so it creates an extra cushion barrier between the toes and that part of the foot and the shoes you are wearing. If you are on your feet a lot or all day this isn't the best product to help minimize impact, paint and pressure. This also causes your footsies to presperate and sweat because the product is gel-like and the feet inside already a closed shoe are not extra contained with something that doesn't allow a lot of breathability. Yes there are those holes in the product for that breathability, but it just doesn't quite work the way I was hoping it would.",84958,1620

They're either too loose, or they press uncomfortably against the face and get all sweaty over time.  This right here is the solution to those problems.<br /><br />Since the start of the pandemic, I have gotten all kinds of masks.  These are most beneficial for masks that are a bit loose because they take up some of the room and make them much less likely to fall down.  I am not able to use them on tighter masks because the masks smash the bracket against my face, but that makes sense.  With the right size mask, these are perfect.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- They keep masks from touching my face.  It makes wearing a mask for longer than a few minutes much more comfortable.<br />- They have made masks that were too large usable.  I have masks that have gotten no use because they were too large, but now I can use them comfortably.<br />- One frustrating aspect of masks is how they act with facial hair.  Facial hair pulls masks down when talking.  These brackets keep that from happening.<br />- In addition to the 12 brackets, they include a bunch of strap extenders and a couple of lanyards.  The lanyards can be used to keep track of masks or glasses and are very useful.<br /><br />For the price, this is a complete win.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- When used with a mask that's regularly tight, the brackets can leave facial marks if they're worn too long.  It's kind of like bedhead, but for the face.  The marks go away pretty quickly.<br /><br />Unknowns:<br />- Each bracket has a clip on the left and right sides.  I cannot figure out what it is for.

5.0,1644542713609,Nice facial brush cleaning,"This is one of the better powered face brushes I've tried, including those with sonic, rotary, or vibrating motors. It has a good sleek, minimalist look about it. There is simply one button for simple operation. When in use, the massage heads simply press on and draw off, yet they do not fall off. Perhaps the only design problem is that the piece of silicone that secures the charging port lid will occasionally interfere with standing it up on a counter. It's generally doable, but I don't think it's particularly stable. It's a little annoyance, though. This brush does not rotate, but rather vibrates in the manner of a sonic toothbrush head. When I tried it on myself, I really enjoyed it. The speeds are comfortable, with options of 7,200, 9,600, or a combination of 7,200 and 9,600 RPM. More significantly, the brushes are gentle and efficient, causing little harm to the skin's surface while providing a refreshing sensation. The silicone head is said to be the gentlest, but it feels the toughest on my face; nonetheless, the rounded tips are probably less abrasive than the bristles on the brushes.

5.0,1642098105952,Good facial steamer,"This is the ideal size for a face steamer. It's tiny enough not to take up much space, yet strong enough to make you feel like you're at a spa. When fully charged, the steamer lasts around 10 minutes. I enjoy that I can add essential oils to truly nourish my face while also making my room smell lovely! The face steamer has a 180ml expanded water tank that emits a mist that moisturizes and cleanses your skin for 10 minutes. The facial steamer's built-in proprietary inner UV disinfection technology sterilizes the nano-mist before it comes out the nozzle, ensuring that the steam is purified and 100 percent clean, protecting your skin. The steamer for face does a good job of penetrating and hydrating the skin.",85941,9306
5.0,1634001515085,comfortable earplugs,"The earplugs are soft and spongy. They use a few thin rubber gaskets to create a complete seal from air, ensuring that no water can pass through. Sound will pass through, but the volume will be reduced by at least half. They are not the most comfortable earplugs, but they are reusable and can be washed and sterilized for use again and again. The belt box is well-made, and it keeps my pair clean and free of contamination. It is critical because germs and viruses can enter your system through your eardrums. The mini box is secure enough to give me peace of mind that my earplugs are clean and germ-free when I need to use them on public transportation. Loud noises amplify my tinnitus. These ear plugs aid in the reduction of traffic noise.",85941,23510
5.0,1633977155981,loves this stainless steel cleaner,"This cleaner removed varnish from the flame facing side of my hard anodized aluminum pans. It got rid of the food remnants on the inside. The varnish came off the bottom of the stainless steel, which is the cleaner's named purpose, and the inside looks brand new. This worked great on a burnt pan as well as in my stainless steel dishwasher. It does state that it is ""not recommended for use on stainless steel exteriors."" On the label, I couldn't find the precise reason. I'm guessing it's to avoid dulling a super shiny exterior, but my dishwasher has a satin finish. I used a gentle hand and only a small amount of product, and it turned out beautifully. This product is packaged in an opaque plastic bottle that is tightly capped and taped to prevent leaks during shipping. It also comes in a printed box with two scouring cloths. These cloths are fairly thick, approximately 11"" x 12"", and folded to form a scouring pad.",85941,9751

It appears to provide some relief to my shoulders, which can ache when I overdo it at the gym, as do all such products. The smell of the cream is one thing I really like about it; it smells better than Ben-Gay or the generic Walgreens equivalent I've used in the past. I like that it's made with natural ingredients. It is an excellent choice if you want to avoid potentially harmful ingredients such as parabens. I also like that it is made in the United States.",85941,25719

It's simple to adjust the height and doesn't take up much room. This is a high-quality machine that can be used professionally or at home. I like how it rolls and looks more professional than counter-top versions. You'll fill the container halfway with hot water. After the fifth time, I began using distilled water. It runs for about 5 minutes and feels like it cleans my pores. It's also a nice way to unwind for a minute. You can also use this while taking a hot bath. The arm will lean against the tub. The instructions will show you how to apply the essential oils to a cotton swab or where to put them. Its save me a lot of times and money.",85941,2011

This transparent glass bottle has simple clean lines that make it suitable for sitting on the counter. This is generally flavorless, however there is a smidgeon of coconut oil taste. Using a tablespoon in my coffee worked wonderfully. There is a slight oily coating on the top, but it isn't a major issue. It also works nicely in smoothies, where it is barely noticeable. The flavor is mild and precisely what it should be. This is the most expensive MCT I've seen.",85941,146

The cutting mechanism moves smoothly without hitching and these are easy to use. The only small complaint I had was in regards to the corners on the handles. In some positions, they had a tendency to be a bit uncomfortable to hold. It didn't affect performance of the clippers and was a small issue.

This was my first ""melt"". I'm not quite sure what to think of it. The flavor itself isn't bad. I'm not quite a fan of the citrusy taste, but I've had vitamins that tasted a whole lot worse. This almost reminds me of a Fruit Loop. The melt dissolves quick enough and the bottle is small for easy storage. The one aspect I really do like about this is the fact I only have to take one a say. Most other beauty supplements require you take at least two daily for optimum results. This is one and done, which is a huge draw for me. It may be enough for me to continue purchasing just for that aspect alone.",85966,1087

For increasing surface area with acrylics, these work great. If you're looking for a buffer that will shine your nail, look elsewhere.",85966,1521
4.0,1609832314054,Nice selection,"These bath bombs were a wonderful buy, with some interesting quirks. To start, there are plenty of bombs in the pack with lots of variety. The interesting thing, though, is they all smell very similar. They are packaged well in tissue paper and plastic wrap, and none of my bombs were broken. As far as giftability, I would have to break my box into individual gifts. The front of the box says ""Contains Essemtial Oils"", which made us all chuckle. I wouldn't gift something with such a glaring error on the front, but that's just me. The performance of the bombs, though, is nice. It scents and softens the water well, so no complaints there.",85966,213

4.0,1600856556538,Good supplement so far,"As someone who uses probiotics daily, I am happy with this brand so far. Since I struggle with digestive issues and a leaky gut, I need a probiotic with a high strain count. This supplement has the high number I need and has seemed to help keep some of my stomach issues at bay. It's easy to take and the capsule isn't overly large or difficult to swallow. It also hasn't caused excess heartburn or gas after taking, so all in all, it seems to be gentle on the system. The bottle itself requires no cooling or refrigeration, so it would travel well and be convenient to take with you. As a necessary product for me, I do believe this is a worthwhile investment.",85966,528

I think they would be fine for massage since they are smooth and fit nicely in the palm.,86449,17967
4.0,1623901727560,Hoping I won't have to use this (because I'd rather not get bit by insects),I was intrigued by this product. I get very bad reactions to mosquito bites (I swell so badly & get cellulitis) so I wondered if this would work. Of course I'd rather not get bit by any kind of insect so I hope I never have to use this. I did try it out on random areas to test out the suction. I guess it's decent. The suction was stronger on areas of looser and not taut skin. The pieces can come apart easily if you're not careful but it's easy to put back together. I will update if I ever get bit by anything so see if this product helps.,86449,1177
4.0,1622632516774,Pear scented toilet spray,I could smell this right out of the package. In fact my hand smelled like it for a while. I think the bottle leaked slightly as the pump looked wet but the box was dry. I shook the bottle and sprayed it twice into the toilet. I couldn't really smell the scent at that point. I've tried this with formed stools which don't really smell in first place. Then I tried it with soft stool/ diarrhea and it masked the smell but not completely. Maybe if I sprayed more into the toilet it would've completely masked the smell but I didn't want to go through the whole bottle so quickly. Overall I think it works for the most part.,86449,1543
3.0,1615517564738,Nice sized shaver but lacking some desirable features,"This rechargeable electric razor does look and feel cheap as others have mentioned. I do like the shape of it as it is easy to hold. I wish there was some texture on the body to provide a better grip. I used this to shave the bikini area and I thought it did a great job. The size of the shaver head was perfect for me for that area (much easier to maneuver compared to my old battery standard sized shaver head which I'd been using for years). I didn't experience any snagging of the hair as others have mentioned. The hair was pretty long but I just went over it with a light hand until it got short and then I got a close shave. I like that one side of the blade is curved for the under arms and bikini area (although I did those areas just fine with the straight side too). I think the biggest thing that I don't like is the way the blade/ foil is removed in order to clean. Mine was a mess inside because there was some kind of lubricant/vaseline type substance in there and the hairs were all stuck. I had to wipe all that gunk out. It wasn't the easiest the clean compared to my old shaver. I feel like this new one is not really meant to be cleaned or it would've had a better design to open up the shaver head. Another issue is that this is not to be used in or around water which is kind of inconvenient. I think the only thing I would put under water is the blade/foil once it's removed from the body. I wouldn't trust rinsing it under water while attached to the body like they show in the product video. On my unit when the blade/ foil is removed, I see a little piece of sponge/ foam in the center and underneath that it looks like it's opened into the handle. Definitely don't want to get water in there. I wish there was an included protective cover like my other shaver. I like that it is rechargeable by using the included micro USB cord. The handle glows red when it's charging and turns off when it's done. There is more to be desired but it gets the job done so it's not a total waste. I also don't know why the box says 'epilator' because it is not.",86449,2013
4.0,1608527768087,Cute looking silicone facial brush with rotating massaging beads,"This is a massaging silicone facial brush that not only vibrates but there's also 4 magnetic beads that rotate in the center which makes it different than most silicone vibrating brushes. It is waterproof to an extent and it recharges with its proprietary USB charging cord. I do wish it was a standard micro USB or a USB-C cord instead. The device is easy to hold and because of the cute flower design, a ""petal"" can easily reach the sides of nose, above my upper lip area, temple areas and chin. The device will automatically turn off in 90 seconds and when you turn it back on, it goes back to the mode where you left off. There are 4 modes and I like to use the first 2 modes (gentle or deep cleaning both with magnetic bead massage). I noticed that my face felt soft & smooth after use. I do find the power button which doubles as the mode button is really small and could be difficult to press. To plug the charging cord in, there is a tiny slit in the silicone that covers the opening and I did find that I had to gently wiggle the plug around to find the correct spot internally to actually plug into the device (instead of jamming it in and risk damaging it). Device also comes with a drawstring storage / travel bag which was a nice surprise.",86449,2014
4.0,1607473736446,Cordless travel friendly hair straightener/ curler,"This is a cute little flat iron that can straighten and curl your hair. It was smaller than expected but larger than my other mini flat iron. The best part of this one is that it is cordless. I've always found cords on hot styling tools quite annoying, even if they swivel, the cord always somehow gets tangled and in the way. This cordless flat iron charges by a micro USB cable which is included. It doesn't have a lock to keep the plates closed but it did come with a silicone ring that slides on around it to keep it closed. The only thing I wish it had was a safety lock so the power switch didn't turn on accidentally. It's a slide switch so if you were traveling with this, there is a very good possibility that the switch would slide to the on position if it was put in a bag or purse. The outside of the straightener doesn't get terribly hot to the touch even at the highest temperature setting but that is still a safety hazard. I don't use this to straighten my hair since I have naturally straight hair already but I use it to curl my hair which works well. My curls were still there when I woke up. My hair never got stuck when using it. There is a comb on the straightener which helps keep your hair smooth. This would be great if it came in a full size version. I knocked one star only because of the potential safety hazard with the power switch. I like the portability of this and it being cordless.",86449,4946
4.0,1603775760339,A great rose quartz facial roller & Gua Sha gift set,"This rose quartz facial roller and Gua Sha stone arrived undamaged because it was nicely packaged in multiple layers (open the outside descriptive packaging and the plastic refrigerator box was surrounded by padding. Then you when you opened the plastic box, there was more padding on the bottom & sides of that box. Inside the box was the travel case and inside the travel case was the roller and a microfiber cleaning cloth. The Gua Sha stone was underneath the travel case on top of the padding). The facial roller rolls smoothly & quietly. The stone feels smooth and cool to the touch. The handle does not appear to be stone, it just looks like pink plastic so I think that would've been better if it was a stone handle like my other rose quartz & jade rollers. The Gua Sha tool is small compared to my other ones. One side is smoother than the other but I understand that a natural stone would have some imperfections. That side just doesn't look or feel as polished but it doesn't feel rough. The roller feels nice on my skin and it's relaxing to use. Everything arrived as pictured. This would make a great gift set for someone and for yourself (we all need a little self-pampering sometimes)!",86449,1583
5.0,1601611836254,Great deal for these standard face masks,"These came sealed in a plastic bag and came in a box. This is a good value for 50 masks @ $8.99. I have not seen this price at a local store. I have a small face so the mask is a little big but all I do is tie a little knot at the end of the elastic and that makes a difference and it fits perfectly (I don't like twisting the ear loop because it leaves gaps on the side of my face), by making a knot at the end of the loop, it fits snug like how a mask should fit. The nose piece is essentially a twist tie but it holds it's shape. I'm used to the medical grade masks where the nose piece is an actual flat piece of metal (I work in healthcare so we don't purchase masks outside of medical supply places - there is a difference in the level of protection, that's why most masks that the general public can purchase at the stores say ""not for medical use""- these masks say the same). You can't go wrong with these, it's a great deal so there's no excuse. Wear a mask (cover your mouth AND nose at all times in public), wash your hands frequently for 20 seconds, social distance of 6 ft and be safe!",86449,223
3.0,1601610020261,A cute looking mask but not the best fit if you have a small face,"These masks are cute but they were too big on my face (I do have a smaller face so I tend to have that problem with masks). I had to modify the mask by making the ear loops smaller and then the mask fit much better and more snug on my face. It doesn't have a wire on the nose for a better fit and it doesn't have a filter pocket. The ear loops were not adjustable due to how it's made, it's not an elastic so those small silicone beads that you see on the adjustable masks would not fit on these masks (these ear loops are made from the same material as the edging on the mask, like on cotton underwear). If you have a larger face these should fit fine. But once the ear loops get stretched out from normal wear, these masks will be useless unless you get crafty (I tied some thread around the end of the ear loops to make it smaller or you could also fold some of it & sew it smaller). It's hard to tell which way to wear the mask without the adjustable nose piece (the shape of the mask is not entirely symmetrical from the nose to chin area). There is a tag inside the mask so for my masks, as long as I have the tag on the left side, I feel that the mask is on my face properly.  While the mask is not bad, it did miss the mark in some areas as mentioned above. There are better masks out there that offer a more customized fit (if the mask doesn't fit properly then you're not protecting others from yourself).",86449,70
5.0,1600525577797,Super soft cloths for your face,First impression out of the zip lock bag was that these cloths were super soft and thick. I think it feels more like a nice quality throw blanket (not like typical microfiber cloths/towels) and these cloths feel the same on both sides (unlike most throw blankets where one side not as soft or smooth feeling). The cloth is like the size of a large pot holder. I like that it included small round ones that are perfect for around the eyes. I'm not wearing much makeup these days since all this mask wearing but I did wash my face with it. It feels nice and gentle on my skin. I first tried it with just water but I felt my skin was still felt a little bit oily so I used a little bit of cleanser with it and my face felt a lot cleaner. The cloth absorbs a lot of water. I just washed it by hand after using it and hung it to dry. It dried beautifully in a few hours and it looked brand new as if I had just taken it out of the package. I would recommend if you're looking to try something like this.,86449,9752

I usually shake it up in a blender bottle and it mixes instantly with no signs of clumps.<br />The taste is supposed to be almost like a Twix candy bar which I can kind of taste but its a faint resemblance.<br />Overall, it provides a good 25g of protein isolate and 10g of collagen so It's a good protein to drink after a workout. I recommend it for the supplement content but flavor could be better.",86542,594
5.0,1643592772440,Very well made foam. Great for neck pain!,"This is a very well made neck foam pad that helps stretch out your neck and relax those tense muscles and nerves. I've used this a couple of times when I feel that my neck is tense and I definitely can feel the difference right after. You rest your head on it for about 5-10 minutes and you can feel your neck relaxing. The only thing about this product that you must be careful with is resting on it for too long because you do start to feel a tingling and numbing feeling on your neck. I think that using it in moderation and monitoring your time on it definitely helps. The item itself is very durable but soft enough that it won't feel unpleasant to rest your neck/head on. The instructions say that you shouldn't use it to sleep and that makes sense since after more than 15 minutes on this, you do get a numbing sensation. I would definitely recommend people with neck pain or soreness to give this a try. I hope my review has been helpful for you today!",86542,2051
4.0,1634099818500,"Quality Ingredients. Flavor is better than ""Chocolate Hazelnut"".",The overall quality of the supplements in this product are very good. It has no soy and protein blend comes from Pea protein and Rice protein Isolate. It mixes well with any liquid without leaving any types of clumps. It actually tastes like cinnamon as opposed to the other Plant Jym flavor which tastes nothing like chocolate hazelnut and was almost undrinkable. I actually enjoyed drinking this protein blend and the protein ratio is excellent at 24g per serving. Overall I would recommend this flavor over the other Plant Jym flavor selection.<br />This is my honest review of this product and its taste. I hope that my review has been helpful.,86542,1540
3.0,1634099279946,Taste is not good at all!,"This review is for the Chocolate Hazelnut flavor. The consistency of this product is good and it dissolves well but the overall taste of the chocolate hazelnut flavor is pretty bad. It almost tastes like butter popcorn instead of any type of chocolate or hazelnut. It's hard for me to even try to swallow the whole shake because of the flavor alone. The supplements in this protein powder are high quality for sure but the taste just doesn't allow me to enjoy it. I also got a tub of the Oatmeal Cookie flavor of Plant Jym and that was way better tasting. They both have a chalky aftertaste but I believe that it's because of the pea protein so I don't mind that. Overall, I would not recommend the ""Chocolate Hazelnut"" to anyone and I definitely wouldn't buy it myself. I don't believe I will be finishing the rest of this product either.<br />This is my honest review of this protein supplement and I hope that my review has been helpful.",86542,1540

They somewhat cancel noise out but I have used other brands that work much better. I do have smaller ears but I cannot get these to fit right in my ear. I will roll them between my fingers for a good minute to get them to shrink up before putting them in my ear but they expand before I can insert them. Once I finally do get them somewhat set, I can still hear everything pretty well. They cancel a bit of the noise but they really don't work as well as I thought they would.",86707,1363

The rollers give a bit -- they are made of a high-density foam.  The frame provides a reasonable amount of pressure that you can easily adjust with your hand.<br /><br />I got this mostly for my calves.  The first time I used this the experience was quite painful -- I had knots in my calves that I hadn't been aware of.  Over the next few days, just using this once a day, things got better.  I've also tried it on my upper legs and my forearms, just to see if it would work, and it did.<br /><br />I don't know how well this would work if you have a lot of fat on you, but if you're fairly lean, it works great.",86809,19955

2.0,1637643846873,Won't recommend,"7I cannot say for certain this product caused my issues, but this is the only different thing I'd done. Here's my story:<br /><br />I had a deep cleaning done at the dentist in September. I've waited about two months since having that done and continued with my thorough dental hygiene routine. I wanted to try to keep my teeth nice and white like after a dental cleaning so I decided to try out these Moon strips.<br /><br />They are all the same, top and bottom. I find them to be a little small. The instructions say to use twice a day for two weeks. I find the twice a day to be a bit of a hassle. I tried doing it about 30 minutes after brushing in the morning and evening. The strips are pretty sticky in your mouth, but start dissolving pretty quickly. It does leave a bit of a film on your teeth once it's gone. The flavor is fine.<br /><br />After 3 days of use, I noticed some discomfort along my bottom gumline. Upon further inspection, the gums at one of my bottom front teeth is now receding. I immediately have stopped using the strips and no longer feel the discomfort but my gums haven't gone back. I didn't notice my teeth looking any whiter after just 3 days. I have another dentist appointment now for December.<br /><br />So, be weary trying these. Even without the issues, I don't think I'd recommend these strips anyway because of the instructions, tedious and inconvenient.",87101,3489

On the day that I did not take them with food, I had some stomach issues. BUT I'm not a fan of having to eat later in the evening, especially not right before I go to sleep - which is when I typically take my vitamins.<br /><br />Also, by about day 5 I was getting a pretty significant breakout on my face and this was the only change in my routine (no different foods, skincare, cleaning, etc).

I had a hard time pulling them up over my thighs. The rise is also ridiculously long. The top reached the bottom of my bra - it felt like I was wearing maternity leggings. The ""stay put"" band squeezed my ribcage. There is no tag or any indicator of front vs back on these. I also feel like pants that don't have a seam down the center of the back, look odd on my butt.

You also know the unit is on when the center of the brush turns red. Two additional buttons on the handle to increase or decrease the temperature. The instructions do indicate the best temperature per hair type and recommend using a heat protectant spray on your hair. So basically same care instructions as a flat iron but this is so much easier to use and doesn't leave your hair fully flat with and with an indent near the scalp of your hair like a flat iron does. Since this is shaped like a brush, I was able to get slightly more body into my hair rather than completely flat which is what happened with a flat iron. Also the bristles are not meant to comb your hair with but they are meant to hold your hair in place like a brush as you run the unit through your hair. You're supposed to brush out and detangle your hair first before using this straightener so don't use it like a hair brush.  I really love this design so much better though. It also came with a heat protectant glove for the other hand that is holding your hair in place as you're running the unit through your hair sections but I found I didn't need it. Also unlike a flat iron, I wasn't pinching or pulling my hair on this nor was I applying any heated weight to it, all good things in my opinion. My only suggestion is that the buttons should be placed elsewhere because having them on the handle, I ended up changing the temperature by accident while maneuvering the device. But that's not enough of an issue for me to be deterred from recommending this device. It's very nice! I'll be using this in the mornings now when I decide to wear my hair down. I have crazy cowlicks on the back of my head and I was able to smooth that out quickly with this device today. Also I wanted to mention this is really easy to store and isn't a huge device either. Since it's like like your traditional flat iron, it doesn't flop open like pair of tongs so storage isn't awkward and would be easy to travel with.

I've gone through a lot of different styles of pet toothbrushes only to find them either too small, too hard, too flimsy or too difficult to use. I even tried using a human toothbrush for awhile but it was difficult to maneuver in my dog's mouth since the bristles are too long. This one has the best amt of bristles packed in where it doesn't feel flimsy during use. The bristles are at a good length and are soft enough where I know I'm not hurting my dogs gums but firm enough to actually feel that it's doing a good job brushing. I'm able to brush her front teeth easily with the width of the head even while she fights me during the brushing process. I like this one enough that I'm coming back to get the 4-pack after initially getting the 1-pack.",99669,348

4.0,1634570610371,Well made,"Good sturdy metal. The mirror is attached securely. You will have to run the mirror under hot water before using in order to prevent it from fogging up. You get exactly rwhatbis pictured in the listing photos. The case is made of a tin-type metal. All items were easily sanitized by me before use. How do I use it? I have no idea. Lol it doesn’t come with instructions. I did google how to use them but I’m thinking maybe I don’t have any tartar because when I attempt to play with it, all I feel like I’m doing is scraping the actual tooth? I dunno. I don’t think that I, personally, need this as I go to the dentist regularly for cleanings BUT if you are someone who doesn’t do that..this may be perfect for you. Also, if you have a pet with disgusting tartar, like my little guy has..this would be super healpful if he lets you use it on him. FYI! Be gentle with your pets teeth. Only gently scrape off what you can get to easily. You could totally cause a major infection if you use this improperly. Maybe bring the kit with you to your vet and ask them how to properly use it on your pet.",102739,2054
3.0,1632425188663,Works as described,"This is a really nice massager. It has heat, which works well, shiatsu and compression. I have small feet (6.5 women) and I feel like the compression isn’t even noticeable unless I put it on high. Anything below that and I can’t feel it. The shiatsu is ..ok…if I have the compression on high but I feel like the little nubs are always Juuust missing the parts of my foot that need the massage. I have to kind of put my weight down on the rollers and move my feet around to get the good spots. I feel like this is made more for people with bigger feet. Like, especially a larger men’s size foot. After using it for about a half hour, I didn’t have that relaxed feeling in my feet that I was expecting. Probably because the shiatsu roller never really did much. The heat and compression felt really good, tho. I bet if my feet were bigger, it would have been a really good massage.",102739,2759
5.0,1606257393954,Get this!!!!,I love this massager. It is lightweight and really quiet compared to others. The cord is long and it comes with a regular AC plug as well as one to pkug into your car lighter port. It has a belt/strap to attach it to the headrest of your car and a handle to carry it. The actual massage is amazing!! It gets really hot (there’s a flap you can use to prevent it being too hot against your skin) and has 3 different modes. I prefer this over the other shiatsu massager I have that has the handles that you drape around your neck to pull on to use. This product is so much better. It’s light enough to bring anywhere and use anywhere. It also gets areas that that other one can’t like my mid back/shoulder blade area.<br />Definitely recommend this!!  It’s the best I’ve used,102739,980
5.0,1604103907579,Great quality,This is a really nice set. I normally make my own pads but was in need of more and figured it would be nice to see what kind of quality is out there. I must say that these are great.  You get 6 large sized ones and one small light day one as well as a wet bag. The top of the pads are made from a very soft (kinda microfiber style) material that feels nice against my skin. It does. It appear to cause me any irritation (and I have very sensitive and reactive skin). The backs of the pads is made of a plastic type fabric (PUL) that makes noise when you crinkle it in your hand but not while you are wearing the pad properly. The snaps are strong and the whole pad is put together very well. They washed up really nice and I was even able to put them in the dryer and they came out perfect. No shrinking or changing shape.,102739,7585

1.0,1598215703478,Tastes like rubber!!,I've been trying to find a pre workout drink for awhile now and tried this due to the good reviews. I guess my expectations were too high because I'm really disappointed in how this tastes. It smells alright but it tastes gritty even when I added more water thinking that would help. It tasted like rubber and I only had a sip of it and couldn't drink anymore. Maybe I got a bad batch or this really does taste this awful but either way I'm quite disappointed in this product.,108231,1604

4.0,1634439518879,Helps on tiring days,These are super useful when you've had a long tiring day. Gets you relaxed and in the mindset of rest. The scents are great and they last at least 10 minutes in the shower. Can be overpowered by certain body wash scents though. Very giftable and can't be packed in a toiletry bag for travel,115545,335
5.0,1632081971090,Love this scent,Wish I could bottle up this scent and spray it in my house. The mixture of orange and lemongrass was awesome. It wasn't too strong nor was it to mild in the shower and it lasted a nice amout of time. I wouldn't suggest using it for quick showers though. Easy to store and clean up. It definitely woke up my senses and at the same time relaxed me before bed.,115545,9542
3.0,1632081722335,Very strong,"Definitely did not like this scent. It was extremely overwhelming. It was overpowering while in the bag but in the shower, the scent did not sit well with my nostrils. Can't really describe it but I just know the mixture of eucalyptus and frankincense is not for me. The good news is that it didn't dissolve quickly and the scent filled the shower well allowing you to have a good or bad experience with it. This one just wasn't a scent I liked but someone else may. It dissolved easily once under a light stream of water and cleaned up easily also.",115545,1614
4.0,1606465525465,Not too bad,"These really didn't stay in place in my shoe as expected, but when I was able to use them without them moving around in my shoe they were very comfortable and super helpful. I would have liked for them to not slide around but things happen. Very comfortable to walk on and easy to place in your shoe. Initially it felt weird having them in my shoes but after a few minutes i forgot they were there until the next time I put my shoes on.",115545,8185
4.0,1604184116166,A little tricky to use,Overall I like this body brush. I had to use a little more body wash than I usually do to keep the brush lathered. Using it on my upper and lower back was a little tricky as it was a little awkward to hold and use. The bristles feel a little harsh on the skin when you're using it but it may not feel like that for others. I just decided to use it mostly for my feet and under arms. Still a good body brush though.,115545,1610
5.0,1623984636359,Sugar Free Energy!,"Usually when I see “sugar free”, I move right on to the next one, and it doesn’t really matter what we are talking about.  Going against better judgement, I decided to give this one (Glytch Gaming Energy Supplement) a try, and I am sure glad that I did.<br />Despite being sugar free, Glytch actually has a good flavor to it.  The label says it tastes like “Rainbow Magic”, though I’m not sure what magic tastes like, so I will say that it has a berry flavor that is not overpowering and is actually really easy to get down, unlike many energy supplements.<br />Within 20 minutes of drinking a single serving, I feel a noticeable increase in energy and motivation .  It makes me feel ready to do whatever it is that I have planned, either gaming, going to the gym, or going on a run.  It is a physical as well as mental effect which makes it really easy to focus completely on whatever it is that I am doing and even makes me feel excited to be doing it.  This energy supplement by Glytch really does work.",139317,623
4.0,1616482588530,Expensive For a Creatine Product,"I was always under the belief that creative monohydrate was the best and most effective creatine available, in fact, until this supplement, I had not ever seen other forms of creatine.  I figured I’d give it a try to see if I noticed a difference.<br />The first thing I noticed was how well this mixes.  I mixed it with about 12 oz water and it fully dissolved within 20 or so seconds.  The flavor, “Lions Blood”, actually tastes good and was easy to drink.<br />After about 3 weeks of usage, I decided that I could not determine any noticeable difference between this and plain creatine monohydrate.<br />My one complaint here is the price.  Creatine is generally inexpensive, however, this is just under $40 for a 60 day supply, which is simply too much.",139317,3364
5.0,1615951367143,Basic Creatine,"This product is exactly as advertised, regular old creatine monohydrate.  This is unflavored, as plain creatine is, so in terms of flavor, it is exactly what one would expect.  I have been stirring it into a cup of iced tea, which has worked perfectly.<br />This creatine does mix well, though I will stir it a few times as I drink it to make sure it is fully dissolved.  Stirring 3-4 times for 15-20 seconds each time will completely dissolve 2 scoops into 1 glass of the drink of your choice.<br />After a month of use, I can tell a difference in my lifts as well.  Definitely a slight increase in the amount of weight that I am lifting across the board on all lifts.<br />This is a great value for the money.  Creatine actually works, and this jar has 60 servings, for less than $15, that is a really good deal!",139317,949

When you take<br />2 scoops, as recommended for the “strong” dose, it can even be a bit too much, especially if you are not used to strong preworkouts.<br />If you are caffeine sensitive, this is NOT the drink for you.  This pre workout is high in caffeine and not for caffeine sensitive people.<br />Aside from a high dose of caffeine, this pre workout has a pretty good ingredient profile, including the staple of any pre workout drink, creatine.<br />The “Berry” flavor is pretty good, not great, as it has a bit of a chemical aftertaste.<br />Overall, this is strong pre workout drink.",139317,747

4.0,1659284766112,Odd taste,"I really wanted to like these since I take quite a few medications everyday so adding a pill-based cranberry supplement isn't all that appealing.

Other than taste, they aren't sticky so getting them out of the bottle is easy.

5.0,1649611500522,"Great size for traveling, fits great in your bag!","This sample tub of Alpha Lion is absolutely *perfect* for traveling. It's small size means it wont risk weighing your luggage down at the airport (I put it in checked bag) and assuming you're using 2 scoops per session it gives you about 7 days of preworkout, which is more than enough for a week or longer (depending how many days you workout) trip. Very great sizing and useful for short stints for work or vacation.<br /><br />In terms of ingredient profile, its pretty run of the mill standard ingredients. I will say their citrulline malate 2:1 combo is slightly higher than most (7g instead of 6), but still a bit underdosed based on the 6-10g of pure l-citrulline effective min-max effective dosage. The rest of the ingredients are fairly common. AstraGin is a nice addition to this preworkout, which claims to boost absorption.<br /><br />Hulk Juice as a FLAVOR was great. It's a kind of green apple flavor. If you like ""green"" flavors you'll enjoy this one. Not the most cost effective for bulk buying, but GREAT for travel.

I very much like the inclusion of Agmatine Sulfate, Norvaline, Nattokinase, and Stearoyl Vannillyamide. The green tea extract and Nitrosigine are nice boosts. The inclusion I could do without is the sodium -- in fact given how many of us have electrolyte imbalances and favor sodium over potassium, I'd prefer the latter if any were to be included. Very few of us need MORE sodium intake in our diets...<br /><br />That said, the capsules are GOLD in color. My hunch is this isn't super healthy for us, but it certainly feels and looks cool downing 8 golden capsules! Really makes you feel like royalty before you tuck yourself in under the barbell on the bench press!<br /><br />I generally cut the dosage in half and use alongside my main preworkout.

I break these in half, and only use a half a pill per day (but you will still see a strong change in urine color an hour or so after using!). You can check the ingredient profile and compare with other multivitamins, and you'll see this one exceeds some of the other cheap multis on the market. That said, the SMELL is pretty atrocious, and if you leave it in your hand for even a second or two you'll have a smell on your hand that is pretty annoying -- I have to wash my hands every time I take one.

The industry has had many years to perfect whey protein flavoring schemes, but the plant protein genre has been suffering a bit in this regard. I don't know how JYM managed to make this plant protein taste so good, but they really accomplished something here. I might have trouble going back to anything else after this. THAT SAID, it is a bare bones plant protein -- you're not getting all the greens and random bells and whistles that other plant proteins try to jam in. But honestly, it is perfect as is.

So in reality you get 9 colors and of those 9, 3 are in glitter colors.<br /><br />The bottles are decent in size and the polish spreads nicely.  You can be generous and put on a thick single coat and pretty much get full coverage.  Set times don't vary from any other brand I have used.<br /><br />Scent (nail polish scent) is not more pronounced then other brands.  These colors are very vibrant and jewel tone like.  Really good set.",160430,1520
4.0,1604931994859,Nice any event bags,These are pretty sturdy little bags.  They are strong enough to support a book without the bottom falling out.  They aren't overly thick but for standard gifts most or many items will fit in these.  The Rose Gold color and Silver are much attractive then the regular gold one.  They don't shed a ton of glitter over everything and are sturdy enough to be re-used by the receiver if they like.  Mini card are also included.  Pretty handy set to keep for last minute wrapping needs.,160430,1788

They fold easily and have a nice shimmery rose gold color to them.  Takes no time to assemble and they are really cute.  If you put something heavy in them, you will need to support the bottom.  Light weight items, like jewelry won't be an issue.  A cupcake would probably be the weight limit without keeping my hand under the bottom.  Overall, perfect simple gift or display box.",160430,2469
3.0,1595253068367,Not the best for the price,"These are decent sponges & scouring pads.  The stainless steel is pretty much normal standard quality you will find available at any grocery or discount ""dollar"" store.  They hold up rather well and do a pretty great job on your heavy duty pots.<br /><br />The sponges are another issue though.  They are ultra light and not very durable.  The yellow portion feels similar to a car sponge while the green is just okay.  They aren't the worst sponges I have ever used.  They do rinse out and dry easily without molding super fast.  But they just don't last very long with multiple daily use.<br /><br />For the price these aren't the best.",160430,286
4.0,1593953334120,It's not sweet,"Most toothpaste, to me, has a sweet / sugary kind of flavor mixed in.  This toothpaste doesn't really have that.  It isn't bitter or chemical just has a somewhat minty non overly sweet flavor.  Not a ton of foam, which I don't think is an issue, and does leave my mouth/teeth feeling clean.  Overall, this doesn't taste bad at all but it is different.  If you have ever had ""natural"" or ""chemical free"" (I didn't label it that) toothpaste then you will get the idea.  Kids may not be to excited to use this.<br /><br />Price pint, per tube, is a bit higher then standard commercial brands but they are pretty normal / comparative to other natural toothpastes I have used.",160430,814

The pastel colors are exactly as presented in the advertisement photos.<br /><br />Balloons are standard ""party"" balloon size and were easy to blow up and tie off.

It is packaged well and oddly does curl my hair better then straightening is.<br /><br />The power button and digital screens are easy to see and clear to read however, please note, that when turning it on it isn't instant you MUST hold the power button longer then other product types or it simply won't turn on.

Some day's I need to have a large intake of carbs yet due to allergies what I would need to eat would be MASSIVE so bam I can drink this and I am good to go.<br /><br />Flavor isn't bad I enjoy it.<br /><br />Like every other powder mix I have ever tried the best way to get this to mix well is take 1 to 2 oz of hot water, dump the powder in and shake/stir until dissolved then add super cold water and you shouldn't have any clumping or powder balls to deal with.<br /><br />No caffeine is great since I usually have to take this at night and I don't want to be up all night.<br /><br />Price point, For ME, isn't bad since I am not taking this daily.  Overall, it does exactly what it says it will do but I highly recommend reading the label to make sure it will work with your diet choices.",160430,1955

4.0,1585596491260,tastes terrible but restores everything needed better then any other,"As far as flavors go this is not something I want in my mouth because you can taste the salt going back into your body.  For results, this is one of the best recovery drinks I have ever used, I feel great after chugging it down.  If you are super active/ sick and sweating a ton then this is the drink for you.  But again, the flavor of this is not something anyone will drink unless they need it.

Seriously one bit felt like I was chewing for very very very long time.  The vanilla isn't as bad, to me, in taste.

At that point, I started doing some Indian cooking at home, and also adding turmeric to other dishes when I thought it wouldn't be noticeable.  That isn't always practical, however, so taking it in capsules is a good alternative.<br /><br />These capsules seem to help, and are an easy way to get it.  I find that I need to take two at a time, and appreciate that they didn't try to pack so much into larger capsules that I would only need to take one, as that one capsule would be difficult to swallow.<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading my review.

This looked as if it might be a good alternative, and I  believe that it is.  Being plastic, it's not going to break.  I didn't realize that I was going to love that I can close the nasal applicator tip and shake it up to make sure I dissolve the salt, but I do.  Having used a neti pot for a very long time, I was also surprised by how much easier and more comfortable it is not to have to lean way over in order to have the solution flow through my nasal passages – I'd just gotten used to doing it.  Being able to squeeze the bottle also allows for changing how fast it flows in.  Being able to see how much is still in the bottle, so that I can stop halfway, and switch sides is also extremely helpful!  The only thing it doesn't have, which I wish it did, is a stand to hold the bottle upside down when drying it.<br /><br />The salt packets are hard to empty, as the slit for opening them is badly placed:  lengthwise, and in the middle, so they just tear down the middle, leaving a pocket on both sides which is hard to empty by pouring (as a nurse, I'm not going to stick it in the bottle and shake it, for sanitary reasons).<br /><br />This is definitely a keeper!<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading my review.

It's not always practical, and the electrically heated ones seem to work better in my experience..<br /><br />I love that this eye mask has a silk cover, which should be much better for the skin around my eyes.  I haven't spritzed it yet but it seems to get my own eyes to release tears, at the least.  I have another heated mask which seems to run longer, and at a higher top heat than this, but half an hour's probably all that's practical anyway, and I don't want it to be too hot.<br /><br />I'd put the cord on the other side of the mask, if it were up to me.  Also, the nose cutout isn't realistic for Western noses, though it does work.  My bridge is just too high for this to fit just right.  Other than that, I'm happy with it.

The texture is too squishy, the flavour is mediocre, and there is a bit of an aftertaste... though at least they are not crystal coated so they are smoother to chew.<br /><br />At about 25USD, they are very expensive for a 30day supply of a single strain of probiotic bacteria.

While not coated in sugar like some, it is larger and flat and not as chewy or tasty as any of the others. While the artificial taste of others may not be ideal, it is preferable to all of the sugar and lack of taste in these.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this as a supplement, but if you like weird consistency gummies and sugar you might like these.

4.0,1610380651701,Inexpensive replacement Oral-B toothbrush heads...,"Like all third-party Oral-B replacement heads, these are much less expensive than the first-party branded ones. While the plastic heads and bristles do not feel as high-quality as most I have purchased recently and the price per head is not as cheap as most other brands on Amazon, these offer coloured heads and a smaller size. The coloured heads help to  stop mix-ups of the devices and heads. The smaller size helps to get better coverage in the back of the mouth and are more comfortable for people with smaller mouths.<br /><br />While I prefer the cross-action replacements more, these definitely have a niche for homes with a number of Oral-B users and for those with smaller mouths or difficulty reaching the far back of the mouth.",160495,2092

It has all of the power and comfort (no pulled nose-hairs) of his previous favorite nose hair trimmer... and many added features.<br /><br />The other tip is a hair shaving attachment and there is also an included charge cable and a brush to help clean the tips. The USB charge cable does make it convenient as there are so many USB chargers around the house. Charging is relatively fast, but normal use as a nose hair trimmer does not take much of the battery time.<br /><br />Cleaning is easy, just remove the tip and rinse it... use the brush if there is anything stuck.<br /><br />The big pluses are the power, easy of use, the built-in battery with charging, and the cost. It is only about 3 dollars more than I paid for my favorite name-brand one from 5yrs ago. We recommend this... and we will post any updates if issues are encountered.",160495,22987
5.0,1557048981673,"Mild flavor, great potential health benefits","I didn't know much about the potential benefit of noni fruit powder so I did some research.  I found out that noni powder is ""loaded with antioxidants, polysaccharides, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals."" It is supposed to give you an immunity-boost. Who couldn't benefit from that?  I added 1 tsp into my smoothie.  The noni fruit powder had a mild flavor and blended well.  I didn't notice any immediate, noticeable changes but if the information I researched is correct, it is beneficial in ways that may not be immediately apparent.  I am going to continue using it for the potential health benefits.  I have included the other information I found during my research below:<br /><br />""Origins of Noni Powder<br />Noni is the Hawaiian name for the Morinda citrifolia plant, an evergreen shrub that probably originated in Southeast Asia and has spread throughout Oceania. It is believed that noni was a ""canoe plant,"" so highly prized by Polynesian peoples that they brought it with them as they migrated in their canoes to new islands. As the white noni berry is pungent and bitter, it was only eaten during times of famine. However, Polynesians used the noni berry widely as a dye and to treat wounds, inflammations, infections and other ailments.<br /><br />Health Benefits of Noni Powder<br />Noni is sometimes known as a superfood because of all its phytochemicals: antioxidants, polysaccharides, flavonoids, fatty acids, and catechins. It contains 17 different amino acids, as well as a significant amount of other nutrients.<br /><br />1) Antioxidant Powerhouse: Organic noni powder is packed with protective antioxidants, flavonoids, and catechins. These compounds protect cells from oxidative damage caused by free radicals, which helps reduce the risk for premature aging and chronic conditions like heart disease.<br /><br />2) Immunity-Boosting: Noni is a rich source of polysaccharides which support the body's natural defense system against illness and infection. A study at the University of Hawaii demonstrated that the polysaccharide content of noni juice improves the function of white blood cells in the immune system, which protect the body against diseases. A separate study at the university found that specific polysaccharides, known as noni-ppt, inhibited tumor growth and improved the life span of tumor-bearing mice.<br /><br />3) Essential Nutrients: Organic noni powder is an excellent source of essential fatty acids and all 9 essential amino acids that our bodies do not produce naturally and must be obtained through diet. Essential fatty acids keep our cells functioning normally and essential amino acids are required to help our bodies make proteins. Additionally, noni powder is an excellent source of vitamin C, dietary fiber, iron, and potassium.""<br /><br />Hope this is helpful information to others!",160497,13

5.0,1432479147000,A large supply of a good quality supplement for overall joint health - easy to swallow caplets that promise good benefits,"I'm a tall man and I work out pretty regularly, and I do occasionally have joints that complain. I had heard about the combination of glucosamine, chondroitin and MSM, and had been meaning to try it out when I had a chance to try a sample from Viva Labs for the purpose of testing and review. I've purchased a number of their other products and have always been happy with the quality, so I was happy to try these.<br /><br />The caplets are easy to swallow. The recommended daily dosage is two caplets per day. I've been taking them for about a month now, and I haven't noticed any of the usual (but occasional) joint pain. I can't say for sure whether this is the reason, since I'm not able to compare the results with a placebo in a large double blind study. I do know that research supports an overall increase in joint health with these supplements and I'm fairly confident that Viva labs is a good source with a quality product. I've been happy with it so far, and will buy more when this bottle is finished. (There are 240 capsules, so this is a very generous 4 month supply.)",160497,420

5.0,1556112920734,Very good vegetable protein option,"Vegetables actually have a fair amount of protein, and I'm happy to see this vegetarian option in the marketplace.<br /><br />I do a lot of weightlifting, and the more variety of protein options there are, the better.  I can't imagine using the same protein powder for years at a time.  I'm always happy to try out a new option, and this offering from GENONE is very good.<br /><br />Flavor:  If you've never tried ""workout chocolate before"" then let me warn you it is not a candy bar.  Nearly every brand of workout supplement that claims to be chocolate is like a semisweet chocolate powder.  Have you ever tried cocoa powder?  well, thats what this GENONE is like.  Personally I am very happy that its NOT SWEET.  I tried a ""cookies and cream"" protein drink recently and was really put off by the appalling sweetness.  This GENONE chocolate on the other hand is not sweet and has a relatively decent aftertaste.  BUT!  If you are looking for the chocolate flavor usually associated with milkshakes made from real ice cream, you won't find it here! (or most anywhere else, for that matter).<br /><br />It says it has 30 servings, and since I work out 6 days a week, that will last me for about 5 weeks.<br /><br />Mixing it was fine, it says all you need to do is ""shake well"" and its nice to not NEED a blender ball to keep it mixed.  But I did have to use a fork to stir it, particularly because I had to scrape the bottom and side of the container to get it all mixed in.  Really, thats not necessary it was just me being a little OCD about ""mixing it all"".  I felt it mixed well.  I just mixed it with water which is how I mix all my shakes, particularly when I'm reviewing them.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this for a change of routine if you are looking for a new protein powder to try.  It doesn't have EVERYTHING under the sun, like some protein drinks do, but maybe thats a good thing, right?",160530,9732
4.0,1532018014394,I like it but really some basic statistics would be good.,"its kind of like an insurance policy.  you hope it works, but there isn't any way you can prove it.<br /><br />One thing I was very curious about was the ability of the unit to control the air in a certain area.  But I can't find anywhere on the website or the amazon product page where its clarified.  At the moment I have two of these, one is in the laundry room and the other is in my son's bedroom, which is about 11x10 feet.  One presumes that the unit can handle a bedroom, but as I said, its really not clear.<br /><br />According to the manufacturer, the bulb loses 15% &#34;efficiency&#34; after 4000 hours (5.5 months of continuous use), and should be replaced.  I have been waiting until mine burn out before replacing.  Replacement bulbs are reasonable.  At the time of this review, they are $8 each delivered from Amazon but $14 each from the manufacturer's website.<br /><br />But lets go back to this 15% efficiency loss.  What is this 15% of?  Brightness?  luminousness?  UV rays (quantity)?  UV strength (quality)?  Germs killed?  15% suggests there is some number, some study, but all we get is 15%.  If I'm running it in a small room, and if there is a loss of efficiency, won't all the germs get killed anyway, but just slower?  too many unanswered questions.<br /><br />Guardian's website says:<br />&#34;UV-C light helps kill the DNA of germs reducing their ability to reproduce. UV-C light kills germs.&#34;<br /><br />I found this a bit confusing.  On the one hand, the UV light neuters the germs so they can't reproduce, which does help.  The next sentence says that it kills germs.  If it kills germs it doesn't seem relevant that it would neuter them.<br /><br />While I like this unit, I feel that GG needs to provide a bit more depth to their information.  They have a lot of grand, sweeping statements like &#34;UV-C has been used to kill germs for 100 years&#34;, but very little information about the efficacy or efficiency of their own product.<br /><br />Basically, they say &#34;Our product must work, because science is happening inside.  You can't doubt science.&#34;  So I remove a star for the lack of information.<br /><br />I do believe in the science, which is why it gets 4 stars, but I just can't give 5 stars for a &#34;covered wagon medicine show&#34; presentation depth.<br /><br />Some extremely basic statistics really need to be added.",160530,125

3.0,1676249704369,Too tight,"I’ve had the opportunity to test quite a few face masks.  This one would be near the bottom of my list.  Let’s start with the good.  It is very lightweight.  It has a nice formed foam and doesn’t rub on my eyelashes.  It comes with a cooling gel pad.  There are several issues as far as I see it.  First and most important, it doesn’t fit well.  I have it set to the very end of the Velcro and it is still tight on my head.  I do not particularly have a large head.  As a matter of fact, I can wear some youth baseball caps set on the largest setting.  This elastic tugs far too much to be comfortable.  The next issue is that this thing has a cord that isn’t much longer than 3.5 feet.  That means you have to be close to your power source.  You can use a usb battery but they are expensive if you don’t already have one.  With regard to the heat, this mask on the hottest setting just got lightly warm.  Most of the heat seemed to be in the raised areas where the eyes go and not the part that touches your skin.  It means that it has to heat up the air between you and the eye area in order for you to feel the warmth.  It’s just not warm enough for me.  Since the cord has to be attached to the mask via magnet, with such a a short cord, basically I have to sit perfectly still.  No way I could actually wear this to sleep in unless I found a way to mount the usb battery near my head.",160570,766

The two issues I have are related to the flosser.  First you can’t open the reservoir other than the small hole in the back.  This makes it a lot harder to get completely empty and air dry or clean.  The other is the tube that sucks up the water is stationary.  This means you have to contort yourself to get the last of the water out by leaning the unit a particular angle.  I have another that the tube is weighted and it rocks from side<br />To side depending on which way you need to lean the unit while reaching your teeth.  Overall this is a decent set.

Way better than manual toothbrush, get that dentist feeling clean if you’ve never used it before.<br /><br />May have less options on strength and pulse variety depending on what version of Sonic Care you have.<br /><br />Uses same head attachment as Sonic Care. Glad there’s no propriety brush head. Very easy to purchase more when you run out.<br /><br /> Charges on bottom via USB Type C. Cannot stand straight when charging. Must pull out rubber water resistant cover with pen or coin, and lay it on it’s side to charge.<br /><br />--Water Flosser<br /><br />Water flosser is like a portable WaterPik, but is bulky and not as natural to use. The orthodontic and tongue cleaner tips are a very nice addition.<br /><br />Water pressure is a bit stronger than standard WaterPik head due to the small opening. Recommend you put it on Soft setting first<br /><br />Head attachment is a bit loose compared to WaterPik. Wobbles when you touch it slightly.<br /><br />Propriety head and charger. Have no idea why they didn’t go for USB Type C like for the toothbrush<br /><br />Overall, very decent bundle. Toothbrush is very similar to Sonic Care brand but has odd charging method.

It took 2 scoops and some to get any sweetness at all. When I tasted the powder on my fingers, it literally just tastes like powder. Not sweet at all unless you REALLY try to find the sweetness. It’s a vegan alternative to sugar, but I think there might be better alternatives for vegans that have much more sweetness.

I've recently become keto and am very satisfied with the change. I feel fantastic! I've had a very carby lifestyle for so long and found out I'm celiac and had no idea! Just a little over a month and I'm feeling like a new person! No more aches and pains! Unless I get glutened but I try to keep that from happening and I've lost 9lb! This bone broth has actually helped too! I've been trying to add collagen in my diet and get my body back to running smoothly from all the damage that's been done from gluten. I can't believe the difference in my hair and nails! I really didn't think anything would be that noticeable at least not this quickly but wow! I'm a believer!<br />This broth taste great! I do have to add a little sea salt to mine as I'm a salty person! :-) I've been trying to do intermittent fasting but I don't know if it's for me. On days I can't get to lunch, which honestly is most, haha I drink a serving of this broth! It really saves me! It's 90 calories and apparently that would take me out of the fasting BUT it's worked! I'm feeling food and losing weight so whatever I'm doing is working!<br />I really do like this and I don't drink it everyday! I MAY look for another brand that's not quite so pricey but I may end up coming back to this. I really do like it and it seems quality! Some things are just worth the extra bucks!",160596,706
4.0,1613919008568,Good but expensive!,My mom is 85yrs old and I've been suggesting she drink collagen for a while and she decided she would try it. She tried these samples and LOVES it! She said they dissolve fairly well. She's used to using a powder creamer and this takes a little longer she said it's worth it. No flavor but adds a bit of creaminess. She still uses her powder creamer but only about half. She adds her sugar as usual and says it's great! She even put a pack in her tea last night! I've used a lot of brands of collagen and this seems like a good quality.<br />My issue the price! At $2.78 a pack I just can't justify that! I've had some really good quality that's less than $2.00 an individual pack so I personally will not be purchasing this. I would have personally given this 3 stars just because I think the price is just too high but I gave it a 4 because my mom loves it so much she may be buying this brand.

I have some powdered and I add it to mine but honestly that's a deal breaker for me. What else is a deal breaker is the dextrose. I'd prefer to not have any sugar since I'm keto and 5g is a lot when I'm not getting all the stuff I want in this.<br /><br />Now for pros...<br />The Zinc is great! 25mg is a very good amount! Vit C is OK, not bad compared to some I've seen but it could be a bit higher too. Vit D is a nice amount.<br /><br />More on the cons. I'd like to have seen some B vitamins in there. The elderberry is nice for immunity but 50mg is sooo low. That's almost nothing. Personally I'd have preferred to skip the elderberry and add some B vitamins! This product is advertising it's an electrolyte drink and have the sodium and chloride for it but doesn't have B vitamins. Also the taste is.... OK at best. For 5g of sugar I would have expected this to taste great! I personally don't like the taste.<br />All in all I don't feel this is a bad product by any means BUT I think it could be better and for this cost it SHOULD be better!",160596,771
5.0,1612629212428,Tiny pill!,"LOVE how tiny this is!! My 8 yr can take this no problem and I LOVE how it has coconut oil in it to help with absorption. I've had to be very mindful when taking my other D3's and make sure I'm taking them with a higher fat meal so I will absorb more but there's no worrying with this one. AND it's only one pill! It's 5000IU too!! That's a great amount! I don't take this everyday though since it is so much. I try to go outside and get D that way but if I can't or if I feel sickness coming I take this. It's a great price too! This is 2 months for more for me. It says to take it morning AND night but if you don't have a deficiency I personally wouldn't recommend that. I am NOT a Dr or even a nurse but I do research a lot and too much D can be a bad thing so research your stuff before you go taking a whole bunch of anything. D is not water soluble and it's like Vit C where you just urinate out what your body doesn't use. You can build up D in the system which can cause unwanted side effects and possibly an ER visit. Only throwing this out there since D is like the ""thing"" right now. It IS great but be responsible! :-)",160596,634

ANY cloth pads are sooo much softer than disposable and I try to limit exposure to as much chemicals as possible. I DO find for me that when I walk a lot the pad scoots to my backside and I need to pull it up ever so often. That being said it may be the way I walk because it's all cloth pads, not just these. That's also why I don't wear them places like grocery stores because I can't just stick my hands down my pants to tug on it while I'm walking around a store.<br />These are fairly absorbent but I have noticed I need to change them more often during my heavy time than some of my other brands.

The lady doesn't make them anymore and I've about worn out the ones I had and when I saw these available I jumped at the opportunity to review them! They are super soft and wash up well. I LOVE that they are dark on the side that needs to be dark because of stains and they seem to stay put pretty well. The little bag is really nice and would be great to take with you to carry clean ones and put the used ones in. I've washed them all 3 times already and they still look brand new.

For me, the Lotus variety is the stronger of the two.  It has a more pronounced and sweeter smell.  The Blossom is more a background floral scent.  They're different but I like them both.<br /><br />One thing worth mentioning - from the photo in the ad copy I thought the set had two dispencing actions - one aerosol and the other pump.

Although the four units were packaged together in shrink wrap, it wasn't tight enough to keep the lids on. I think the jar could be designed with a better &#34;snap&#34; for the lid to keep it on.

It took a few seconds to find the center wipe and a couple of extra came out with it since I had not quite grabbed the end.  After that they all came out smoothly as expected.<br /><br />This comes with a polishing cloth which I used, after cleaning, on my phone and tablet.  I have a smart home so, in addition to monitors, I have a variety of AI devices with screens.  I cleaned all of them and these wipes left them bright and streak free. They do dry out fast compared to other types of wipes but that may be do to the different ingredients in specific purpose wipes. These do contain ethyl alcohol. They have a pleasant and mild orange scent.<br /><br />Ori-Lemoon Monitor Wipes work very well to clean fingerprints, smudges, etc. off of electronic screens.  I was so pleased with these wipes that I even used them on my eyeglasses which they also left clean and clear.  I like these screen wipes and would get them again.",160675,9305

5.0,1600443767169,My negative first impression changed after using these cloths,"Atitifope Eco-Fabric Multi-Purpose Cleaning Cloths are very useful and have a place between paper towels and micro cleaning cloths or sponges.<br /><br />My first impression was negative because I was startled to see the size of a roll in comparison to paper towels.  I’ve attached pictures and it didn’t seem to be an economical choice since some brands of paper towels hold up well for cleaning. I soon realized that my mistake was in comparing them to paper towels.<br /><br />Once I started using these Atitifope cleaning cloths my impression quickly changed.  One thing that made a big difference is how they respond to cleaners containing bleach.  Paper towels quickly dissolve.  I’ve attached a picture of one of these cloths after using it for a whole day and then wiping down counters and sink with a bleach product.  It is starting to show wear but is still in one strong piece.<br /><br />This product is ideal for those chores where one doesn’t want to use a microfiber or other material cloth because it would be better to throw it away rather than launder.  Chemicals used in stainless steel cleaners, etc. are not something that I want to put into the laundry with other items.  Now I can have the strength of a soft cloth that can be economically tossed when done.<br /><br />I would prefer that these came individually folded in a flat box rather than on a roll but that is just personal preference since they don’t require the space of a large paper towel holder.<br /><br />Atitifope Eco-Fabric Multi-Purpose Cleaning Cloths are a good choice for strong cloth cleaners that are ecologically friendly and can be easily tossed away after standing up to challenging tasks. They won’t replace either my paper towels or my microfiber cloths but they definitely have a use alongside them and work very well.",160675,226

At times, he would stop taking them just to see if they were really helping and found, shortly thereafter, his knees would start bothering him again.  So taking joint nutrients is part of his morning routine.<br /><br />While the brand that he was taking included MSM, it did not contain chondroitin.  I started to read about the benefits of the combination and even noticed the ingredients being included in my older dog’s kibble.<br /><br />This Viva Labs combination seems to be a good balance and requires two servings a day in order to get the same amount of glucosamine that he was taking with one serving of the other brand.  Taking the servings twice a day seems preferable for a couple of reasons,  the Viva Labs capsules are slightly smaller than the best selling tablet but much easier to swallow. In addition, one can adjust the amount taken to one’s personal preference or needs.  Two servings at different times of day would seem to spread out the benefits too.<br /><br />Disclosure: A complimentary bottle was sent to me for trial and evaluation.

This gummy supplement is good to have on hand when you've decided that if you're going to eat sweets occasionally, it's going to have at least some healthy benefit. I used to eat a LOT of regular gummy candy and now I use gummy supplements for treats, instead. I realized that I was never going to completely give up sugar, but if I can combine it with vitamins or collagen every time - the benefits add up day after day. It's helped me lose some weight because I can only eat a couple of D3 gummies, a few collagen,  a few B vitamins, etc., but it satisfies my sweet tooth and I can tell by the way I look and feel that it's beneficial to me.

5.0,1628315581370,Delicious and vital for good health (D3 deficiencies are common),"This is an excellent gummy D3 supplement - 2 gummies have 2,000 units of vitamin D3 and<br />Vitamin D3 is critical for staving off some really miserable conditions like depression, fatigue, obesity, alzheimers and skin problems. Studies have found that anywhere from 40% - 75% of people in the U.S. are deficient in D3. (Depending on which study you're looking at) I love this gummy form because it's so easy to take! I hate swallowing pills, so if I can get something in a gummy candy, I do it! This is an excellent vitamin to take, considering how beneficial it is and how common deficiencies are. I had a vitamin D3 deficiency and after taking a 5,000iu daily D3 supplement for only 2-3 weeks, (my doctors advice) I noticed a big improvement in my energy level and in the appearance of my skin.<br />If you have any of the conditions that I mentioned, such as frequent fatigue, your doctor can give you a blood test to find out what your blood levels are of D3, B vitamins and any others you suspect you may be deficient in. If you don't want or can't afford to go to a doctor, trying this D3 supplement is a safe and easy way to rule out a deficiency in this vitamin. If you take this and in two to three weeks you find that you have more energy, among other things -  you most likely had a D3 deficiency like roughly half the population does. Do a little research on dosages, because there are several factors that you need to take into consideration when you take D3 long-term. D3 is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means that it IS possible to get too much. It can become toxic and that can cause some problems. (Eg. Kidney stones, nausea) You need to consider how much sunlight you get, for instance - whether you use sunscreen, do you live in Alaska, or Arizona- things like that.<br />This is a very easy, inexpensive supplement to take and it can make an enormous difference in how you look and feel.",160683,103

I was feeling downright weak! I've been drinking this protein powder for about 2 weeks now and I've noticed a huge difference in my energy level. It's amazing how this problem of low energy just crept up on me unnoticed until it was pretty pronounced. I'm glad I tried this one - it's very palatable - it  has an excellent chocolate flavor and mixes easily. I've been mixing it with ice and water in a shaker and it tastes good, it's even better if you use almond, coconut or soy milk instead of water.

5.0,1586140374183,Excellent quality/lots of benefits...,"This is a great supplement for vegetarians, I stopped eating animal products a year ago and now I use a lot of plant based protein powders. This supplement has 12 grams of protein per serving, (6 tablets) so it's definitely worth taking. It's a really nice change from powders because when I use them, I have to cover up the taste to some extent and they can be a bit inconvenient because they can make a mess trying to use them when travelling. These ""tablets"" (I believe they're actually called caplets, which are easier to swallow than tablets because of their shape) , are very easy to swallow because of their oblong shape and smooth coating. This is also a good source of iron and potassium; they're pretty important and this can eliminate the need for taking extra pills if they aren't included in any of your other supplements. There are a lot of great reasons for taking this supplement; it's onsidered one of the most powerful superfoods in the world; it was found to have more protein (up to 70% more) than beef or soybeans!

I don't believe it's a common side effect of glucosamine, but seeing as hair loss has been a real problem for me the past few years, I've decided to try something else. If you don't have a problem with hair loss, I'd consider trying this because it has apparently been effective for a lot of people and because if it does have that side effect on you, it's reversible. This appears to be a good quality supplement, it even contains niacin, which is an excellent vitamin for joint and circulation improvement.

After a few months of using this  you will notice a lot of little hairs growing out around your hairline and this is happening all over your head,  it just isn't noticeable for a while. It really does grow hair (revives old follicles??)  and makes your fingernails super hard. I'm not sure how long it was before I noticed that my nails were harder, but it was very obvious when I had to trim them.  When I have read reviews in the past for products like this one, there were claims that, if you have white or gray hair, it will begin growing out dark again.  It happened to me! My hair was pure white/silver (I am 60) and it began getting dark brown, it is now pretty dark in the back and salt and pepper all over. I posted photos of this on Amazon for the brand that I was using at the time and I will try to find them and post them here.  My only problem is that I really liked my white hair! Lol.  I must say, though,  my hair is a lot thicker and shinier after using the collagen and when I stopped using it for a few months (I ran out and put off re-ordering), I began to see a lot more hairs in my hairbrush,  a real bummer.  Just imagine what your body must be missing in the way of nutrients if it has such a drastic effect on your hair!

I have been following a strict keto diet for a little over a year & started taking a similar supplement long before I began my journey. If you just do a quick search online, you’ll see that it has many benefits such as loss of appetite or desire to eat less than usual, reduced cravings for unhealthy foods, a more positive & uplifted mood (feeling happier, energetic, etc.), an increase in concentration and energy, stabilized sugar levels, improved bowel movements, and a reduction in joint pain. I can honestly say that this has helped in every single one of those areas. I love that this comes in a powder and is tasteless so you could pretty much mix it in anything. I would like to note that if you’re mixing it into something cold then you’ll want to use either a blending ball or a mixer. I did find that if mixed in little by little, it’ll blend nicely into cold water after giving it a good shake.<br /><br />With all that being said, garcinia cambogia is not for everyone. Those who are diabetic and are taking medication for their condition, who have a history of liver or kidney damage, or those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should probably avoid this before speaking with your doctor.<br /><br />I didn’t ever feel anything but positive side effects but everyone is different so you might want to try a little at a time before moving up to the recommended dosage.<br /><br />Overall, I am 100% satisfied with this and look forward to purchasing more once it runs out.",160693,13

Unfortunately at the time of ordering this, the ingredient list was not available. Like many others, I assumed that it was pure coconut milk powder. It’s not. This contains “Organic maltodextrin”. Organic maltodextrin or not, it has maltodextrin. Like another reviewer, I was unable determine if the maltodextrin source is corn, tapioca, potato, or wheat.<br /><br />Evidence has shown that maltodextrin can affect the balance of gut bacteria, which play an very important role in people's health. Maltodextrin has an even higher glycemic index than regular table sugar. Meaning that maltodextrin can cause a sharp increase/ spike in people's blood sugar shortly after they eat foods that contain it. This is not good for those with diabetes or someone who is doing the keto diet or sugar free diet.<br /><br />HOWEVER, my fiancé eating habits are much different than mine so he was happy to try it and stated that the taste was pretty good & he seams to enjoy it. For that, I’ll give it 2 stars. He has been using it in his coffee successfully. He was unsuccessful with mixing it in cold water. It will clump if not mixed into hot water.<br /><br />I will not be reordering.

For years now we have been enjoying the lower sugar and positive effects of dark chocolate, braving all the way up to a smooth and cool 90% cocoa -- That's right up there with baking chocolate.  I didn't let myself expect much from a commercially made probiotic, and maybe that has to do with my happy surprise. But let me start with the fact that the chocolate is 64% cocoa! Not bad, not bad at all for dark chocolate lovers.<br /><br />They are the size of a rounded quarter and have a firmness that allows them to be savored - they melt just like a piece of chocolate would. If you are a dark chocolate lover you will appreciate the slight tang and less syrupy sweetness that accompanies milk chocolate. These are really pleasing and they tout that their flora survives our stomach acid 100X better!  It took me 4 days, to notice the shift.

So rather than feeling that your food takes hours to digest there is really a sense that things are more efficiently being broken down in the intestines. It's not an uncomfortable feeling at all (but could be if you over do them).<br /><br />They don't taste like they smell,  so don't dig your nose in and take a big whiff anticipating a nice rich chocolate smell...You won't. What matters is the flavor and the results both of which you will get.",160703,15

The packets are convenient for easy use and for the on the go.<br />I like that these were not salty tasting compared to some electrolytes I have tried.

However; I really enjoyed the oatmeal cookie flavor.  You get both the oatmeal and the cinnamon and it was much better than I was expecting.  It did not have any horrible aftertaste either.  It has a very slight chalky taste, but it was very little.  I am impressed overall.  Still giving 4 stars to both as they both were better than expected even though the one was not my preference (but chalkiness, formula, and etc were still great).",160705,1540

I tried both the strawberry lemonade and the blue raspberry.  I did not get a very strong flavor from either.  I enjoyed them mixed with another supplement I am using though.<br /><br />The downfall for me is the expiration.  Both say to use within 60 days after opening.  I personally do not love using the same flavor everyday.  I like the mix it up.  I use a few different ones at a time.  Unless you plan to only use this one and use it everyday, it will be expired before you finish it.  Most of the ones I have use a two year shelf life (some one year).<br /><br />This did mix well though with no clumping.  I just wanted more from the flavoring.  I do not really see what is different between the Base and the 9 as both are recovery essential aminos.  This formula has a finer powder, but the flavoring is about the same (tried strawberry lemonade in both).",160705,8676
4.0,1618083806735,Pretty Good,I have tried so many of these and I was expecting these to be thrown in the garbage.  I am pleasantly shocked with the flavor on these.

They are great for recovery.<br /><br />This tastes great and mixes really easily.  I always use a pre-workout before my workouts, so I wish they would have left out the added caffeine.  It is a smaller dosage, but not something I personally love in my BCAA.  I drink these during my workouts.  I will definitely use this on days when I use less pre-workout or on my off days when I need a little extra boost.<br /><br />I really like them though and hope to try more flavors.",160705,6891

I did not get much flavoring and tasted more of the coconut water flavoring than apple.  I even tried adding more and it was just the same.  I did not mind the taste, just not my favorite.<br /><br />My issue was the blendability.  I use the same type of shakers for every brand I use.  I do not use a ball and just water and ice.  This would not mix that well and I was left with a gritty texture when I was drinking it.  I did not like this aspect of it.  I tried shaking again and again and it was still a little gritty.",160705,5785

I was hoping to get past the smell while drinking it, but it turned me off from wanting to put this to my lips.  The flavor just needs improvement for me personally.<br /><br />I am giving this three stars though as it is a great concept.  My friend gave these to her husband and he enjoyed them.  I think this is going to be a personal taste preference if you like it or not.",160705,1102

The soft and flexible material makes it easy to wrap it around legs, arms and back. The velcro straps keep the belt secure in place. If you are new to using red light therapy, then don't expect to see results immediately. You have to use it every day for 20 minutes for at least 3 months.

I leave the pad on my favorite spot on the couch and use it daily at 130F for an hour. It has a memory function that remembers the last setting I used it on and starts from the same setting every time. I'd like to also mention that unlike regular heating pads, this one takes a while to heat up (about 10 minutes). After I come home from work, I start to heat the pad and cover it with a blanket so the heat doesn't escape. I go take a shower while it heats up and then sit in the couch and use it.

I have chronic neck pain so I tried to massage that area too but there isn't enough range of motion to get an effective massage around the neck. I tried it on my arms and I was suprized by how easy it is to navigate the massager with one hand. I though I would need my husband's help but I can do it by myself.

By the end of the first week, my head easily reached the bed as I was able to increase my time on the device. This means I can turn it around and use it in the other direction to increase my flexibility even more. The material is on the harder side, but has give to it. The first couple times I used it, I thought it was a little unpleasant, but after that, it felt perfectly fine. I can feel a good stretch happening right at the base of my skull where my neck starts.

So if it's dark in the room, as is often the case with a sleeping child's room, you can't see the symbols to see what you're trying to turn on. Lastly, the light is too bright, in my opinion, to be used as a nightlight. I would pass on this and look for something with better function.",160741,202

Thats where the good review ends.  The box and metal cutter are pretty flimsy and I am always in danger of loosing the end of the floss back into the box.  The biggest concern I have is the weakness of the thread.  My first floss lasted a few seconds and the floss broke.  A second peace broke in the same spot. After four breaks I pulled out a different brand and flossed that tooth with no breakage.  I tried going back to my original floss and broke it twice before a successful round could be completed.  One break or two I can understand but this was too much.  The slightest sharp edge on a tooth renders this worthless.",160741,1621

They are very easy to open - which is a bonus for anyone with arthritic hands.<br /><br /> And that is my concern.  The design implies to me that it would be great to just grab the day's dose and throw it into my purse.

I've tried many different brush heads and most don't clean as well or they fall off from the vibrations.

5.0,1618370491557,Great hydrogen peroxide based cleaners:-),I got this set of cleaners because I really wanted to do a deep clean as part of my yearly deep clean spring cleaning routine. I have used hydrogen peroxide cleaning products before so I knew what to expect. If you're new to using hydrogen peroxide for cleaning you may be surprised when every once in awhile you clean something and get a very distinct smell of vomit. That seems to happen when the hydrogen peroxide comes into contact with a lot of organic material. For example my sink drains add bathroom drains would sometimes get pretty foul for a few days after cleaning with hydrogen peroxide. None of the items I cleaned with this set of sprayers cause that except for a small area around the faucet of my guest bathroom. The scent doesn't bother me because I assume that it's removing all the organic waste but I am trying to remove anyway. The sprayers are good quality and easy to use. The plastic bottles are also a good quality and stand up well in my cabinets. I even used this product to clean up some old coffee stains on my Carpeting and they removed the stains with no problem.

I never even thought about looking for generics, but these seem to be pretty good. I will say, they are gooey and thicker compared to the ""As Seen on TV"" version. Because they are thicker, they didn't fall neatly into my bathroom drain, but did fall in with some encouragement. Also, they are not as perfumed, while still reducing odor. I actually think I prefer that about this product.<br /><br />I put one of these in my smelly bathroom sink drain. It did get rid of the odor after a few days and I forgot about it. These are good only if a person has the kind of sink drains where the sticks will fit through without having to take the entire contraption apart.<br /><br />Then the stand-up shower drain got a little smelly and I put a stick down the drain to take care of the smell. I doubt these could prevent a clog, but if you put one in after cleaning the drain it could help keep the drain clean. If they continue I will most definitely buy them again.

5.0,1607035176991,I'm A Convert :-),"So, I got these laundry sheets from Amazon, and they are great! If you travel with them, you will find them to be lightweight and easy to stash in your suitcase or backpack. The whole pack is smaller than most paperback books. For home use, it's so easy to have these on the shelf by the washer. I'm actually embarrassed now about how many huge plastic jugs I have of laundry detergent--which could all be easily replaced by products like this.<br /><br />But, I guess the real test is in how well it cleans laundry. Well, one dryer sheet sized sheet handled a medium-large load of laundry with no problems. The directions say to use two sheets for larger loads or heavily soiled loads. The laundry came out clean and had no perfumed scent. My kids have sensitive skin and had no adverse reaction to this product. The clothes I washed were a mix of kids' clothes and all the stains were also removed--Impressive!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product! I'm even buying some for my niece to take to college. I hope all laundry manufacturers learn from products like this. There is no reason to produce huge plastic jugs of mostly water for laundry purposes. Most laundry products can be concentrated into tiny bottles, or better yet, sheets like this. The only room for improvement for this product would be to offer it in a paper bag instead of plastic.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my long review :-) Hope you found it useful!",160756,1527

She asks to wear these because kids' masks are too small and adult masks are too large for her. And with all the compliments she receives, she will wear them all day without complaint. These fit just fine and better than many varieties out there for her age. We are very strict on mask-wearing, even though we are staying safer indoors, so she has to wear a mask almost every day--so we've tried many. Earloops are adjustable, thick but easy to breathe, and just throw them in the washer and dryer with no fuss.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",160756,5408

I like my gloves very tight on my hand and size small fit me and my 10YO. Most people would want to order a size M or L. The cuff is long enough to cover the wrist for better coverage. Pretty useful to have them around, especially at this price, as everyday gloves.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",160756,9121
5.0,1593389372515,"Finally, A LARGE Compostable Trash Bag!","Most compost bags are between 1-3 gallons.  Our composter is about a mile from the house, so tiny bags are a pain because we tend to leave them outside where they get invaded by ants before we feel like taking them out to the compost pile.  And anyone who composts knows those bags (unless pure paper) don't ever really break down in the composter.  With these large bags, we can put about a week's worth of compost in a large 13-gallon stainless steel trash can before having to trek it out to the compost heap.  I have tried several brands, this is a keeper. I need a compostable bag that holds up for at least a week. These bags did not leak, tear, smell, or break down. I like the small box it comes in that fits small kitchen draws.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",160756,504

Propolis & Echinacea are a nice addition to the other Elderberry gummies on the market. It’s like a gummy, but slightly more chewy (has a texture of a gummy when it dries out a little bit).

Elderberry has helped me fight back. I believe in natural remedies with Elderberry firmly at the top of the list. I usually buy a capsule or a liquid.

This definitely has a hemp oil scent, which is just as dominant as the lavender.  Thus, the oil has more of an earthy scent.  As a roll-on, the oil dispenses well.  I do get some scent and oil leakage if the container is stored upside down or on its side.  I don't think hemp oil has many ""relaxing"" benefits, but as an oil it is moisturizing.

4.0,1638042812930,"Wood easily warps, nice intricate design","These appear to be laser engraved given the detail of the design. I thought I ordered the Triple Lunar Goddess design, but received the Butterfly with Moon. Both are designed for the same purpose, so it was no major consequence. The wording is large and clear and in its appropriate order and space. The design in the middle is more about something symbolic and you can make its meaning however you want. I don't recognize it from any archaic text, so my guess is that it's made specifically for this or it is something obscure that I am not aware of. The wood seems light and on the fragile side. Without even using it yet, I noticed when it sat flat on the table, it had a bow to it. Examining it further, the right and left sides are lifted off the table. This could be from the water being absorbed, or it was not cut flat. It has a thickness, but I feel like one would need to treat it with some care and it probably could snap easily. Luckily it does not need to go through much in the way of a stress test, so as long as it's away from heights, it should be safe.

The “pillow” is really more of a firm piece of foam with nodules and curves, and it is meant to use as a rehabilitative aid for those with cervical spondylosis (text neck) caused by bad posture which compresses the nerves of the cervical spine. The instructions noted that there will be some discomfort during initial use, such as tingling, aching, and numbing in the area, all of which I felt, but after continued use, I can feel the relief it is intended to bring. I especially like the complementary accessories it comes with- a carry bag for the pillow, earbuds, and nighttime eye covers.

Thet are thicker and other brands I have used, and the 3 pack is a good value for the price. The only drawback I noticed is the mostly smell the gloves had once I took them off, the moisture was purely from my hands sweating inside the glove after hours of labor.

It’s unlike any kind of conditioner I have used before. Typically it’s thick paste-like and feels that way when I put it in my hair. And then water it off and it leaves my hair Smith. This conditioner has less thickness to the texture and does not “lather”. So it feels more dry. However, I admit, I am really enjoying the results. My hair doesn’t feel softer, but has a nice sheen to it. I don’t get that from all conditioners. Further, my hair has a more relaxed feel.

She benefits greatly from her feline dose -- as long as she gets it in her food, there's no diarrhea, but watch out if I forget!<br /><br />Because the cat benefits so much, it occurred to me that maybe I could eat bell peppers again -- like I did when I was younger -- if I tried probiotics. Over the last few years, it's gotten so bad that I don't even touch a tiny square of green bell pepper because the result is that I need at least six simethicone pills to ease the bloat. Then, red bells began to affect me, and my love of pizza and fajitas was severely impacted. The gas just isn't worth it. The simethicone can't handle it well enough.<br /><br />So, I tried these and found out that this broad-spectrum probiotic is just what I needed. While I still don't eat green bell peppers -- they aren't my favorite, so why risk it? -- I can have red bells again as long as I take these about an hour before I eat.<br /><br />My husband recently began reacting to the same peppers and found that one of these pills fixes him right up.

3.0,1613916573709,not enough support for me,"I wanted to try these inserts because of the adjustable arch support they provided.  I was disappointed in the actual insert.  It does have slightly better support at the arch than what comes with your new sneakers, but the rest of the insert was thin.  The foam at the heel and under the ball of the foot were not enough for me.  The adjustable, with the included 3M stickers, was not intuitive to apply.  I prefer the inserts that I get from Dr. Scholl's  better than these.  I am on my feet all day and these were not enough.",160785,571
4.0,1610721907350,attractive solar system mask 2 pack,"I was mostly happy with this two pack of masks with the solar system print.  They are a good roomy size to fit my plus sized face and the straps are long enough to adjust with the slide adjusters.  The fabric is thick enough to give protection and they have a filter pocket and included filters.  I only had issue with the sewing on one of the two masks.  It was not sewn as well around the bottom front of the mask.  That is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  The price seems reasonable for two masks, too.",160785,5407

I just take my mask off too many times during the day to have to worry about this extra piece. If you don't have the luxury of working in an isolated space like me, and keep your mask on for hours at a time this will help.  It keeps the mask from sucking in against your face when you breathe hard.  It washes up easily, too.",160785,18575

Changing pads in public and having to carry a soaked pad until you get home is problematic for me. Blood has an odor and it won't be long before it's noticed by others while either wearing one of these pads or carrying a soiled one home.  I do think they would make a nice addition to wear under a disposable sanitary pad to protect your underpants from staining. But for me they aren't enough to wear alone.",160786,572

I also wish it were organic but having said that, there are clear benefits to the use of this and since it can be difficult to find in season, I really like the ability to find it in a powder form.

Initially I started almost by mistake as it was the main ingredient in another product I was taking...garlic of all things. I had taken the kyloric brand garlic in the past but suddenly found myself more energetic, alert and feeling good but couldn't figure out why. I realized I had bought a different garlic - it contained astragalus. That's when I realized the benefit. Fast forward a bit and now I use this as a stand alone. I like the amount, it's fine ground and easy to mix in without notice of anything. Good quality and would buy again!",160797,13

Many use inferior forms of b12 like cyanocobalamin but the methyl is far better tolerated and doesn't give me headaches like the other. The flavor is okay - tolerable. Not great. This claims high absorption and while I don't feel much different, it is fairly easy on the stomach and frankly, a lot easier than taking a bunch of pills. Make sure you shake it and keep refrigerated. I've added this to my list and would be inclined to buy again in the future.",160797,678

Unlike men, there are far fewer options so it is nice to encounter this at an affordable price. The container itself is good and the idea is good but the actual execution is far less straightforward.

Although past the half century mark, I'm athletic and tend to have a low heart rate and lower blood pressure - the beets and some of the other ingredients have a tendency to lower blood pressure and heart rate to levels that are not acceptable...it's probably not a huge problem for most people but for those on the low side, use with caution and/or sporadically.

4.0,1630030404013,Great for maintenance,These strips are easier to use than the Crest ones. I like that there is no peel off and I can lay down to sleep with them.<br />They do have a lot of sticking power. Maybe too much because they really stick to the inside of my mouth and I fear my tissue ripping every time I put them on. I have used them once a day (at night) for two weeks.

1.0,1593400970226,breaks too easy,I am so hopeful that this will get better that I keep trying to use it.  Unfortunately I usually only make it through two or three teeth before it breaks.  It feels waxy and thin.  So it goes in easily but it usually rips when you pull it up an out.  It is great that it is environmentally friendly.  It really did not have much of a flavor for me.  Overall I just think this is junk and more wasteful though since I have to use about 5 pieces to get through my mouth one time.,160826,1621
5.0,1577762051554,Tasty and I hope they work,My family has been taking Elderberry for two years in hopes that it would prevent sickness and it seems to help.  I have tried many varieties and this is one of the best tasting.  I'm not sure why but it says to keep out of reach of children.  I also find it interesting that it has raspberry flavor and doesn't just use natural elderberry.  I'm sure that makes it more attractive for those folks who can't stomach the elderberry flavor.  I will continue to buy this brand as long as it is a reasonable price.,160826,898

You don’t need a cup to actually use the flosser, you can put the end of the flosser in your cuffed hands under running water and it picks up the water and you can floss. The bristles on the brush are soft, softer than my Phillips electric toothbrush bristles but it still gives a good clean. My teeth felt clean after using it.

I thought if I turned the water on that it would heat the water up but that didn't seem to be the case either.

3.0,1576782781141,It's Just OK,"I've actually tried several different Keto creamers (MCT Oil Powder, 360 Nutrition KETO Creamer With MCT Oil , and this one). I found this one to less harsh on the system if you actually use a spoonful compared to MCT Oil Powder as you don't have to run to the bathroom right after or during drinking your coffee. This is unflavored compared to 360 Nutrition KETO Creamer With MCT Oil which I like because it does not alter the taste of your coffee. I cannot drink black coffee so I need to use a Keto creamer and sugar in order to get my coffee fix while staying on track with my Keto. However, if I had to choose between this powder and MCT Oil powder. I would choose the MCT Oil powder because I find that I have a hard time drinking my coffee with this creamer and the Keto sweetener I've always used compared to drinking coffee with just the MCT oil powder.",160827,1115

I was curious to see if this cervical neck traction device would help me. It is a foam device that has 2 layers you can add or remove from the bottom of it to adjust how tall it is. If I'm being honest, I've tried it at all 3 settings and haven't really noticed any change or improvement after using it, so I am not sure it is for me.

4.0,1640105992800,Very nice...,"I'm used to using traditional heating pads for back pain... this one was intriguing to me because it has some features that look different than typical heating pads - notably the jade rocks and the infrared heat option. I am not sure about the jade rocks but was curious to give it a whirl. This heating pad comes rolled up in a nice looking box. It has an included storage/carrying bag (nothing fancy), as well as an elastic/velcro strap that you could use to strap this thing to your back while you're sitting up or something. There's a power cord that detaches from the pad, and the cord has an in-line remote similar to other heating pads. The instructions say that this doesn't work like other heating pads, to turn it on, leave it warm up for 10 mins before use. I followed the directions. I had it set to the max temp of 158f. There is an LCD display on the remote that shows what temp it is actually at, and after some time it was hanging around 140ish. I decided to just use it. It does feel warm to the touch, and the infrared heat does feel like it radiates into your muscles. It feels like it does a better job than ""normal"" heating pads. Probably the only thing about it that threw me off a little bit, is even after using it for roughly an hour, the max temp seems to hang around 139-141ish, and doesn't get close to the set temp of 158. It still feels plenty warm and everything, but I just found that a little odd.",160832,2088
1.0,1622682081753,A white noise machine that doesn't make white noise?,"I've got tinnitus and use white noise or relaxing sounds to help distract from the constant ringing in the ears. I recently got a fan-based white noise generator that lets you adjust the tone and volume and have been using that in the bedroom to help sleep. I had been curious about some of the electronic white noise generators and thought to give this one a try, thinking I would use it in my office.<br /><br />Probably the best thing going for this device is that it looks nice. It's about the size of an Echo Dot, looks sleek, has a nice speaker on top, and a great looking screen. First impressions were very good. Actually operating the device is another story. There are 6 touch buttons on it (no tactile feedback) - power, volume, timer, lock, category, sound. Operating this should be easy, but it is really not pleasant. For instance, to adjust the volume, you can't simply press volume up or down, there are no such buttons. There is just a single volume button. You can hold it, and the volume will change in 1 direction. I guess it cycles to the loudest sound, and then back down to the quietest sound? Strange.<br /><br />Then there are the scenes/music you can cycle through. There's a category button, and a sound button. You can press category to cycle through categories, and within each category you can press the sound button to cycle through the sounds in that category. There's no indicator on the screen of which category or sound you are in. So you can cycle through things like nature, animals, life, etc. Some of the options are very strange, like there is an ASMR category which contains sounds like eating potato chips, or drinking water. There are some genuinely good sounds in here, but I find it very strange to navigate around. I wish there was some visual indicator of the category or sound, because I have to look at the instruction manual to try and figure out which category I am in. I suppose if you find a favorite sound and don't want to switch to others it would be fine, but I still don't like the process of navigating the sounds on this.<br /><br />The thing that is most baffling to me is that this is called a white noise machine, the manual calls it a white noise machine, but there are actually no white noise options to choose from on it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Looks nice<br />- Decent speaker<br />- Screen is good quality<br />- Displays temperature/humidity on screen<br />- Battery powered<br />- Can work OK if you find a sound you like and don't want to navigate around<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Single button for volume control is bad<br />- Navigating scenes/sounds is not intuitive, it's hard to tell where you are and where you're going without referencing the manual<br />- It's called a white noise machine but doesn't actually have any white noise option<br /><br />For all it gets right, the stuff it gets wrong is enough for me to not recommend it.",160832,1783

2.0,1600008821863,Not my favorite,"I've used several of these type of machines before but this is my first foot massaging machine. It comes in a nice retail box that would be gift friendly. The actual foot massager looks to be a quality machine. The power cord is relatively short, around 5.5 feet, so you have to be in very close proximity to a power outlet to use. The cord will have to route around furniture you have on the floor which makes the cord feel shorter than it is. As far as the actual settings, it has 2 speeds (slow, fast), you can turn heat on or off, and you can increase the air pressure. I have to be honest, I am not a fan.<br /><br />- I feel nothing on the arches of my feet.<br />- The air pressure, even on the highest setting, feels like it isn't enough.<br />- I can't feel any heat.<br />- The little nubby massage things under the ball and heel of my foot don't feel good. I embrace massage where it may be painful but you gain something from it. This just doesn't feel right. The nubby things are rock hard plastic. I wouldn't say it hurts, but it is not pleasant, and I don't think I am getting anything out of using it. I feel like if they had a little give to them, if they were firm but slightly squishy, and the air pressure was higher it would be a million times better.<br /><br />I have sat and used it for 20 minutes on a few occasions and it's not BAD, I just don't care much for it. Feels like it could be so much better with a few tweaks. Two of us in the household tried this and felt similarly. Maybe we have the wrong feet for this and others will have better luck!",160832,2759
3.0,1454989344000,"This scale is old and expensive, newer scales are cheaper and measure more things while being friendlier with Apple Health.","I bought this scale almost 4 years ago and am just now writing a review. The reason I am writing the review is because it recently started flaking out which prompted me to buy a new (different) scale, so I figure it's worth sharing my experience with the Fitbit Aria scale now.<br /><br />The things I like about the Fitbit scale are that it looks gorgeous, seems to be made of high quality materials. Really, never thought I'd be so impressed with how a scale looks, but it just looks and feels premium. It seems to provide pretty accurate and consistent measurements, but -- it only measures weight, body fat, and BMI.<br /><br />After daily use for nearly 4 years it has started acting up -- and this has happened occasionally in the past also -- while the scale is sitting undisturbed, it'll just keep acting like someone is standing on it and will say &#34;Step Off&#34; or &#34;Thinking&#34; over and over and over. Sometimes it'll do that in a loop for hours. I'm surprised the batteries last as long as they do, but the battery life is surprisingly good.<br /><br />Besides the scale becoming possessed and going into these seemingly endless cycles of thinking someone's standing on it, the biggest thing that bugs me about it has to do with Fitbit as a company not embracing popular health platforms like Apple Health. Your $100+ smart scale suddenly feels not-so-smart when it doesn't sync with Apple Health, when it seems like just about every other modern smart device or app out there that measures anything fitness/health related does sync with Apple Health. Apple Health wasn't around when this scale came out, but it's still irritating that they don't support it now. You can go on the iOS app store and get a paid app that will sync your Fitbit data with apple health, but it's a manual process to do that.<br /><br />When I started searching for a replacement scale I found that many newer scales are cheaper and measure lots of different things that the Fitbit scale doesn't. I bought a new smart scale that tracks weight, BMI and body fat % (the only 3 things fitbit tracks) as well as muscle %, bone %, water %, and BMR (things the fitbit doesn't track).<br /><br />If I could go back in time, I'd still have bought the Fitbit scale because I liked having it and it was the best option when it came out, but at this point in time I have a hard time recommending it to anyone because there are many alternatives to this scale that are newer, have more features / track more things, and cost less. The Fitbit hasn't gained any new features in the many years it's been out, it hasn't dropped in price, but loads of smart scales from other companies have come out that are more competitively priced and measure/track more things, all while being more friendly with platforms like Apple Health. I guess the only reason I'd recommend this is if you want to track your weight and only do it within the Fitbit ecosystem. For me, I've moved on from the Fitbit ecosystem and like to track lots of different stuff within Apple Health so I may be a bit biased.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Premium look/feel/build quality<br />- Has served me well for several years of daily use<br />- Surprisingly great battery life. Batteries seem to last for months at a time of daily use, even when it goes in to these bizarre loops of measuring over and over while nobody is standing on it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Started flaking out occasionally and going into loops for hours at a time where it thinks it is sensing someone standing on it. While I'm happy to get nearly 4 years of daily use out of ANY electronic gadget, it feels like a scale is something that, especially for the premium price tag, should last even longer than this did.<br />- Fitbit as a company refuses to embrace Apple Health, requiring you to jump through extra hoops if you want to sync your scale data with Apple Health<br />- Expensive - has been out for years but still has the same premium price tag<br />- Newer scales measure more things than this and cost less, while embracing platforms like Apple Health",160832,1001

These mushrooms come as a finely ground powder. I chose to add a teaspoon to a cup of boiling water. HINT: Put the teaspoon of mushroom powder into the cup first and slowly add the boiling water while stirring. The mushroom powder has the consistency of dry hot cocoa. It mixes like it, looks like it but it sure does not taste like it. Actually, I did not find the taste repulsive at all, but drinking it straight would tale a little getting used to. Try adding a little honey, still is better! Last but not least try adding your favorite tea bag and you may have a winner!<br /><br />Also try adding it to your favorite smoothie or squeezed vegetable drink. It will turn anything it touches a brown color but the taste of your drink will mask the rather benign taste.

I'm not sure what makes this an extract as what is in the capsules looks like ground black cumin seed. However, it does say it is standardized to 5% thymoquinone so I'm guessing it is balanced in some way. In terms of usability, this is easy to swallow and I tolerated it well when taking it with food (no stomach distress). It smells vaguely herb-like, but it doesn't have any taste. I also did have any unpleasant burbs after taking it. I can't speak to the efficacy of it as a supplement because this isn't the sort of thing that you take and have immediate results with. It's a long-term dietary addition which is supposed to contribute to overall health (as does eating leafy greens or other nutritious food). I believe it is helpful, but I can't prove it. This is only a one-month supply and on the pricier side, but it's hard to rate value when it's impossible to compare this extract to the more common oil supplements.",160851,972
5.0,1612380838523,"versatile, easy to use","I have a few white noise machines of various types including mechanical and recorded. This is one of the better ones in several ways. First, I didn't notice any looping in the sounds, though I can't say that I listened carefully after falling asleep. It also has the widest variety of noises among all of the machines that I have had experiences with. I liked that it has buttons for each type of sound so I didn't have to cycle through too many options to get to the one I wanted. The animal sounds are soothing in particular, but I was a big fan of the types of white noise and the fan noise for aiding in falling asleep.<br /><br />The light on this is pretty versatile. The first white light is very faint and works well as a night light without being too bright. The second one is more of an actual light then the rest are just atmospheric for color effects. One of the most impressive points is the volume. One of my white noise machines which uses recorded sound is pretty good, but it can't be made especially loud. That means it's hard to drown out louder noises with it. This gets super loud and I was happy with the range of volume options.<br /><br />The only minor quibble I have with this is that the power cord connects to USB. I don't have a USB connector in my bedroom so I had to use my own adapter as this did not come with one. This is a small thing, but worth keeping in mind if you don't have a lot of spare adapters lying around or a USB connector on your power strip or wall.",160851,212

The filter is not very thick, but it is tightly woven. As an addition to a mask that is already 2-3 layers, I found it to be satisfactory without making it too hard to breath through. The only down side to these was that they have slits across the bottom and top to make them fit your face more accurate by angling. I would have preferred to cut them myself because they are cut a bit longer than I need and that increases the likelihood of gaps. However, with a good pocket, I think they should work very well.",160851,215
4.0,1603640863340,seem helpful in reducing bloating,"I've been trying a variety of probiotics to help with digestive issues and this one has the shortest range of shelf stability (about 4 months). Since one bottle is a one-month supply, this isn't a big problem. I think the short expiration date is probably a good thing since it means that the manufacturer may be more accurately estimated the viability of the cultures in it.<br /><br />This is supposed to have a special formulation to help the probiotics survive stomach acids and reach the intestines to assist with gut flora there. I have no way of knowing if it is working. I can only say that I have had considerably less stomach discomfort and bloating since taking this. I tolerated it well, didn't have any issues digesting it or having it feel ""stuck"". The capsules aren't too big to take, though they are less slender than some. They have a slightly sour milk smell, but they have not taste.",160851,528

These are much more like nitrile gloves or exam gloves. They have a good fit (my hands are generally between a medium and a large and these large ones fit nearly perfectly with just a little extra room above my fingers). They have good ""touch"" (aka, you can feel things through them). They're stretchy and are easy to put on and take off. They aren't powdered inside, but they glide on easily anyway. They are pretty strong for thing disposable gloves as well. The only small point is that they are very short at the cuffs and don't expend much past the top of the wrist.

I also wasn't a fan of the texture, which was on the gooey side with little crispy bits scattered throughout. I liked the crunch, but was less a fan of the gooey parts. I ate this during hot weather so it might be better if it's refrigerated. The caffeine portion is on point though. It's less enjoyable than a cup of coffee, but more portable.",160851,1497
4.0,1580307377573,"thicker than average, long lasting","I mainly use these gloves for common household cleaning like doing dishes and cleaning household surfaces. I haven't used them for more heavy duty purposes or with very abrasive cleaning materials (like steel wool). For my purposes, they have worked very well in terms of durability. I would put them as being at least on par with Playtex living gloves in terms of quality, possibly a bit longer lasting. They have about the same tactile qualities as those gloves which means they are good for medium-duty work, but not finer work as you can't feel a lot through them.<br /><br />I liked the fit and found them easy to put on and take off. I'll note that I generally experience chafing and dryness in my hands from wearing gloves like these, but haven't had that experience with these gloves.

4.0,1513611670783,absorbs well and not greasy,"I usually use Lubriderm (though I sometimes use cheap no-brands as well) so I'll be comparing this to those brands. The first thing you notice about this is that the cherry scent is really quite potent when you first apply it. To me, this was the greatest weak point as it smells not of the flesh of cherries, but of a pit which is going off a bit. The almond scent isn't present at all. However, the scent doesn't linger after application and you really only smell it when you first rub it in.<br /><br />I used this as an all-over body lotion after showering given that it's economical and in a large bottle so I used it on my legs, arms, neck, and hands. I did find that it did a solid job keeping my legs from getting flaky, dry skin on them (which I'm prone to) as well as my arms. It didn't go the distance on my hands, but I do wash them a lot and wear rubber gloves about a dozen times a day (stripping them on and off dries out the skin). I don't think this is potent for hands, but it's certainly decent for more average use.<br /><br />As someone else said, it's hard to get the top to pop up when you first open it (very hard). I guess this is supposed to help it not leak during shipping, but the truth is that mine leaked a little into the bag it was in anyway (I don't know how). The lotion goes on smoothly and isn't greasy. It absorbs well. For me, I found this to be a good “all around” type of lotion.<br /><br />Pros: absorbs well and not greasy, economical, moisturizes well over the long run<br />Cons: cherry smell is off-putting, hard to open pump",160851,153

The bottom of the box does look a little weird... Like it’s not put together right, I did undo it and do it the other way and realized I did have it right the first time, so changed it back. So if you are going to be putting something kind of heavy in the boxes, a little bit of tape on the bottom would help reinforce it form anything falling out.

Unfortunately, it didn’t work out that way.<br /><br />First, these are NOT burpless. I was burping them up 1 out of 3 times taking them. That’s bad enough, but it is not an uncommon experience with fish oil supplements. The taste was just horrible, even for fish oil. Maybe it was the lemon flavoring, I don’t know. It was just worse than other fish oil I”ve burped up. I ended up not being able to finish the bottle, which is very unusual for me. I’ll usually go ahead with a moderately bad flavor. The expiration date for my bottle was good for about a year, so freshness shouldn’t have been the problem. This was with taking only 1 as a dose. I can’t imagine what it would have been like taking the recommended 3 per dose.<br /><br />That 3 softgel dose is also higher than most fish oil supplements,which tend to be only 2. This means the bottle only lasts for 20 days, not a full month. It also means taking 3 large pills, which these are. I could swallow them, but they might be hard for anyone who has any difficulty swallowing pills.<br /><br />The bottom line is these just didn’t work for me.",160859,1741
4.0,1621088949614,Did A Pretty Good Job On My Bathtub,"I have an older porcelain bathtub that has become more and more difficult to clean as it has gotten older. It probably needs to be resurfaced, but I’m not looking to do that anytime soon. I’ve tried all kinds of cleaning products and just haven’t gotten the results I wanted, even with a whole lot of elbow grease. While researching cleaning these older tubs, I consistently found peroxide was the recommended cleaner. So, I got GreenFist’s Hydrogen Peroxide All Purpose Cleaner Spray 32 oz (2 pack) as another attempt to clean the bathtub.<br /><br />I like the idea of a more natural cleaner than the hasher cleaners (some of which I have tried). I sprayed the tub down really well and took the electric scrubber to it. While it didn’t handle all the stains, it did clean the tub better than anything else I’ve tried so far. Bonus, I didn’t need a nap afterwards from herculean scrubbing efforts.<br /><br />The scent is fairly mild and has a somewhat citrus smell. It’s doesn’t leave a strong “fresh” scent like some cleaners, but I’m fine with that. The bathroom is small and I have to close the door when cleaning to keep the kitty from helping. Many cleaners can be overwhelming in the smaller, closed space.<br /><br />I didn’t see an expiration date on the bottles. It’s my understanding that hydrogen peroxide degrades, particularly after opening the bottle. I have no way of knowing how “fresh” this is or how long the effectiveness will last. I was also surprised to see it in a clear bottle, as I always thought it came to opaque bottles to help preserve it. Maybe this is different from medical grade peroxide? I suppose I will just continue to use it as long as it is being effective.<br /><br />I’m happy with the results for this product and will be trying it on other areas in the house.",160859,1447
3.0,1620522923195,Average Bath Bombs Best For Kids,"I use a bath bomb almost every day, so I’ve used many different brands. There are certain things I look for in the bath bombs I really like, though I don’t consider myself a bath bomb snob. There are just certain things I want from my bath bomb as an adult. For me, YULONG Lab’s 18 Pcs Bath Bomb Gift Set with Natural Essential Oils rates as an average bath bomb. I feel they are best for kids or just daily bath treatment for an adult who isn’t wanting that luxurious bath time.<br /><br />These bath bombs are small in size. Now, that doesn’t mean they are necessarily not a good bath bomb. I’ve used small sized bath bombs that were actually quite nice. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case with these. I have a large tub, so I will probably end up using two at a time, which it means I’m only going to get nine bath uses from the set.<br /><br />The areas where I was disappointed with this set were fragrance and water color. There just wasn’t much fragrance to them, even in the box before they went into the water. I don’t like an overwhelming scent, but I do like more than I got with these. The second area was the water color. One bath bomb barely colored the water.<br /><br />The packaging and the bath bombs themselves are pretty. They also fizzed...well they actually gave more bubbles than fizz. They actually did pretty good with the bubbles. They also made my skin nice and soft. They also didn’t stain the tub and cleaned up easily.<br /><br />Overall, I’d have to say that these are average bath bombs. They have come down on the price (currently $19.99) which is more reflective of the type/quality of bath bombs. If you are looking for a luxury bath bomb, these aren’t the ones for you. But as a basic bath bomb, they hit the mark. There is certainly a place for this type of bath bomb. I would possibly gift these in certain situations.",160859,2880
3.0,1617881931972,"Thick Consistency, Not Much Lather","Spotlight Oral Care Toothpaste for Total Care is packaged and priced like a higher end toothpaste, so I thought I would give it a try. Maybe I’m just used to toothpastes like Colgate, but this toothpaste has a strangeness factor to it that I haven’t adjusted to yet. I don’t hate it, but I don’t love it either.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that it is thicker than any toothpaste I’ve ever used. I have to work at it to get just a little out of the tube onto my toothbrush. The consistency is somewhere between toothpaste and caulking. The second thing I noticed is that it doesn’t suds or lather much at all. I’ve never experienced that before. I wondered how well it could be cleaning without hardly any sudsing. If you are a messy brusher, this might be a plus. The third thing is the flavor. When they say mint flavor, they mean mint. I get the mint tingle through my whole mouth and lips. I’m talking about the Blistex tingle, not a mild tingle. It’s a bit too much for my tastes.<br /><br />All that said, when I do finish with my rather unique brushing experience, my teeth do feel very clean, more so than with my regular toothpaste. The clean feeling also lasts longer. I do think this toothpaste is overpriced for one that doesn’t contain whiteners. It’s ingredients are aimed at cavity prevention and plaque buildup, which are basic toothpaste functions. While it seems to work at cleaning my teeth, I don’t think I would get this again.",160859,1618
3.0,1616326054595,Could Use Improvements In Some Areas,"I use a lot of bath bombs, almost everyday. I have to admit that I am a bit picky about them and look at several different areas. Lyskiycyn’s Handcraft Bath Bombs（XXL-5.7oz) ended up being about average for me. While they were okay in some areas, there were other areas they could use some improvement.<br /><br />Presentation: The box itself is slightly above average. It’s fairly sturdy. The presentation of the bath bombs inside the box was nice. Aside from the ball bath bombs there are a couple different shapes, including a large heart with the word “Love” on it,  that make the set a bit unique. The ball bath bombs had botanicals embedded on the top, which is always a nice touch. There were also several silk (?) flowers, which is definitely different. It was a pretty touch, although I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do with them. They do smell nice, so maybe use like a potpourri. Several of the bath bombs had areas that were crumbled however. The petals fell off some of the flowers while removing them from the box. For my own personal use, those aren’t really big deals, but it does drop the product down as something I’d want to use as a gift.<br /><br />Scent: There is a nice scent when opening the box. The scent of the bath bomb in the water is only a fair plus. I can smell it, but just barely. The scents of all the bath bombs together nicely. I keep a basket on my countertop filled with bath bombs to use, so that’s important for me. They keep my bathroom smelling nice and fresh. I’d give them a fair for scent.<br /><br />Fizz/Bubbles: These bath bombs leaned more towards bubbles than fizz. They do fizz, but the bubbles are more obvious and hide the fizz while they are dissolving. The bubbles didn’t last long past the bath bomb dissolving. I’d give them a fair plus on this one.<br /><br />Moisturizing: This is a key area for me. The moisturizing effect was on the light side. I could tell there was an additive in the water, but I didn’t leave my bath feeling my skin was really soft and smooth. I got more good skin benefits from the soap I used. I’d give them a fair minus in this area.<br /><br />Water Color: This is the least favorable area for these bath bombs. The water barely changed colors. I did not get pretty, relaxing colors for my bath water. I’d give them a poor in this area.<br /><br />Clean Up: They did very well in this area. Cleaning the tub was a breeze. They didn’t leave the tub slippery or slick. They also didn’t stain the tub. Yes, I have had some bath bombs stain the tub, so this a potential big deal for me. I’d give them a good in this area.<br /><br />Price: When I got these bath bombs, they were selling for $12.99. The current price, when writing this review, is $20.99. I feel the price of when I got them is more reflective of the quality of these bath bombs. At the current price, I’d be pretty disappointed since my expectations would be higher.<br /><br />This is an average set of bath bombs that are probably more appropriate for children (except not really child themed) or teenagers. It proves that bigger isn’t always better.",160859,614
4.0,1614436435412,"Love This Sound Machine, Nightlight Combo","I got the Swonuk Sound Machine with Night Light to replace my other sound machine that was getting finicky in its operation. I can’t sleep without white noise and my other machine would periodically suddenly stop, instantly waking me up.<br /><br />Different people who use sound machines need different sounds. This sound machine has a lot of different sounds, so there should be a sound that works for most people. There are even three musical lullabies for babies. The volume has a good range and actually can be set quite loud. The machine will remember the last setting from the last use. I usually takes me a couple of nights to adjust to the differences in the sound with a new machine. For some reason, that was not the case with this machine.<br /><br />It is also a night light with vivid colors that aren’t too bright. There is a dim and brighter setting for the white light. You can also have it automatically cycle through the colors. I use it when I have to get up in the middle of the night. I also use the colored lighting at times before I go to bed just for relaxation.<br /><br />I always bring my sound machine with me when I travel. This machine is more compact than my previous machine and will travel well.  Hopefully, that will be happening again soon.<br /><br />The only issue I have with the unit is the controls are touch sensitive. There are no button or even raised areas to the ring with the controls. It’s very easy to brush up against the wrong control. It’s even harder at night if you are wanting to control the machine. I’ve hit the volume up when I was wanting to turn on the night light. Considering how loud the machine can get, it is quite jarring in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Even with that, I have been unexpectedly happy with this sound machine. I guess I was expecting something “less” and it’s nice to be surprised in the positive direction.",160859,1773

Aozzy’s Bath Bomb Gift Set-12 Pack Natural Bath Bombs with Petals and Rainbow Colors-Bath has been a bath bomb set that I have really enjoyed.<br /><br />There are certain things I looked for with my bath bombs and these have hit the mark in several areas. They smell wonderful just in the box. There are several different scents, but they blend together while all together. This is nice since I place my bath bombs in a little basket on my bathroom countertop. They are also very pretty, so they display nicely. The scent isn’t overwhelming though. When in the water, the scent is subtle, which is my preference.<br /><br />They are on the small at just a little over 2 ounces, but they aren’t a weak bath bomb. They have good fizz, but not a whole lot of bubbles. The water color is very nice, but don’t stain the tub. They dissolve completely after a few minutes. They contain natural ingredients and moisturize fair with shea butter, cocoa butter and essential oils. They aren’t the best at moisturizing as I’ve used, but they Fair+ in that area.<br /><br />Several of the bath bombs did have divots in them. This doesn’t affect the way they work, but is an esthetic that I wouldn’t care for if I was giving them as a gift.<br /><br />Overall, I’ve been enjoying this bath bomb set.

I absolutely love these bath bombs and I’m pretty picky.<br /><br />Size: They are large at 4.5 oz each. Bigger isn’t always better, but since my tub is large I’ve had better luck with bigger ones. These offer plenty of the good stuff for all the water my tub holds.<br /><br />Water Color: These add great color to the water depending on the bath bomb. The colors are rich and pleasing to the eye. They don’t stain the tub or washcloth.<br /><br />Fragrance: Each bath bomb is a different scent. All of the ones I’ve used so far have smelled very nice without being overpowering.<br /><br />Moisturizing: These bath bombs left my skin feeling smooth and nourished. I could definitely feel the essential oils. Oh, so very nice.<br /><br />Fizz: They had lots of fizz that lasted for a few minutes. I even got a bit of a bubble from them.<br /><br />Clean Up: There’s not a lot of clean up with these. They didn’t leave the tub slick or slippery.<br /><br />Aesthetics: This is a very beautiful set, suitable for gifting. The box is heavy with an elegant design. There is the issue of a typo on the front of the box and hopefully that will be corrected with their next box production.  Each bath bomb is double wrapped. The outer layer is tissue paper with a sticker and the inner layer is the shrink wrapped plastic. The bath bombs themselves are swirled multi-colored.<br /><br />I’m very pleased with these bath bombs as they hit the mark with all the areas I look for.

At the time of this review, there is no contact information for the company on the package or on Amazon, I can’t find any info via Google, and therefore, I cannot determine if the maltodextrin source is corn (the most common), tapioca, potato, wheat, or whatever. While the website would seem to indicate that the source might be coconut, that could be referring to the coconut milk part of the ingredients, and in all my years of reading labels, I’ve never seen coconut as a source of maltodextrin, so again, I have to wonder if that’s what’s being said.<br /><br />It would be nice if the maltodextrin source were listed on the label.

5.0,1577596387683,Great in Morning Protein Shake,"I've been using this in my morning protein shake. Pleasant taste, especially in comparison to spirulina. This is super high in folate. Funny thing about folate, I've read that studies show it reduces the likelihood of getting cancer. However, if you already have cancer, it can be aggravated by too much folate. ""Folate might suppress some types of cancer during the early stages of development, whereas high doses of folic acid taken after preneoplastic lesions have been established might promote cancer development and progression.""<br /><br />Liver, spinach and black-eyed peas are good sources. Only about 50% of the folate in most foods is bio-available, so a lot of people only get enough through supplements.

I always take 2 per day in the winter and I have not seen any negative effects from D3, only positive.<br /><br />I personally believe everyone should take D3 each day. Even 5000iu will help boost immunity and enhance your mood. Those are easy to see in my life and I haven't been sick for a couple years now and I think vitamin D3 is one of the main reasons. No COVID, no flu, or even a cold. I also take zinc and vitamin C daily as well as a probiotic but that's all. Nothing expensive or complicated. D3 has other supposed health benefits and of course you can get D3 for free from the sun by being exposed to UVB rays. I can't do that during our cloudy winters working in an office all day and one of the first things I noticed when I started taking D3 softgels a couple years ago is that my mood was better after just a few days and it's been more stable ever since.<br /><br />These tablets are not as small as other D3 doses I've taken, but they certainly aren't too large to swallow for anyone who takes any other pills. I suppose these could be crushed up and eaten with food if you are unable to swallow, I haven't tried it.

You can microwave these and they made from BPA free plastic. You can also freeze them. I think the best feature with these is they cost less than a dollar each so if you are in a situation where you need to throw one away or leave it at someone's house, it's fine. Or you can use them for years, since they don't really fall apart. They can get scratched up over time but they still work and I put mine in the dishwater with no issues.<br /><br />It's hard to give these storage containers anything less than 5 stars.

It tastes better than expected to be honest, and seems to have the same antioxidants and other benefits of fresh juice. I use about 12 ounces of water, they recommend 8 but it's whatever you prefer.<br /><br />The product seems good so far. I've used half the tub already and I'm happy with it as a real juice alternative.

The metal legs were covered with something that looked like dried up boogers ( or a glue?) but I wasn’t able to remove it by scratching off with my finger nails. I tried dipping paper towel in water just to see the reaction to water, was it gonna soften or something but no, 0 result.  Then I saw these and decided to give them a try. I dipped in water and pressed hard... it was COMING OFF! It wasn’t the water, it was the wipe a d I could tell by the way it wS coming off. It wasn’t melting, it was sort off coming off in tiny chunks. Regular paper towel didn’t do anything, nada! I don’t know much about fibers and exactly were these made but they are thin yet VERY DENSE. You can literally wash it, rinse it and reuse it. I really think the density of the fibers is what gives them scrubbing power. I then sprayed my bathroom sink with a bathroom cleaner and used this to wipe off..OMG! I didn’t use anything to scrub like usual (scotch scrub sponge), I just wiped with this wipe which scrubbed the sink and absorbed cleaner at the same time leaving my sink looking clean and shiny after just a few wiping moves, seriously? I then went onto my kitchen cabinets that were ahem kinda due for a scrub... did great.<br /><br />The only downside is the packaging. It’s a plastic bag with a stack of large square towels. That’s it. It takes large space to lay flat and you need to keep it flat so it’s easier to remove one wipe at the time.

5.0,1600474853340,konjac sponge is the most natural and gentle exfoliant,"Konjac sponges are made out of konjac root, a porous root vegetable that grows in Asia. They work great to exfoliate the skin gently. When soaked in water, the konjac sponge becomes incredibly soft and almost feels slimy. Because of its texture, you can exfoliate every day. I have used konjac sponges for my babies too. These are six sponges in different colors, all infused with other ingredients:<br /><br />White - Pure konjac powder,<br />Black - Bamboo activated charcoal,<br />Yellow - Turmeric,<br />Dark pink - Red clay,<br />Green - Aloe vera,<br />Pink - Sakura (Cherry Blossom)<br /><br />Each sponge has a little string, which is very helpful to hang it dry. Out of the bag, these sponges are hard as a rock and need to be submerged in water for a couple of minutes. My other konjac sponge came with the instructions to microwave on high for 2 minutes to sanitize, but this brand doesn’t ask for that. After use, it’s important to rinse, squeeze out the water; your sponge will last longer and be cleaner. That should be routine with any washcloth, though, so this may be an unnecessary comment.<br /><br />These are great, I scrub my face EVERY DAY with my Red Clay konjac sponge, and my skin does not get irritated.

Honestly, no laundry soap I had a chance to try was able to wash the bibs without pretreating the stain first. I love this new packaging, it is very practical and I love that I don’t have to screw  dispenser cup back on, this version is a cartoon box and there is a insert for the cup on the top so it’s easier to just place the cup there.

Great gloves with grippy surface,"I was afraid these gloves are going to be very thick and I will hate using them then probably completely void because I can’t get a good feel and I just never feel things are clean unless I get a good sensation in my hands. I hope this makes sense. However, these gloves are not one of those thick rubbery gloves that numb your sensation for touch. They are still thick and durable but feel more like a silicone then rubber and allow my hands and fingers to have a good sensation to touch. I have medium sized hands and M fits me well with a little extra room too. The fingers are not too long and the overall fit is very good. They are even decorated and have a little trim design around the hand opening. They are not too deep, see photo. They come about half way to my elbows. The palms and fingers are textured in a cute way and this allows for a better grip when holding something in a soapy water. I received 2 pairs, white with blue fingers and plain purple and both colors are cute if that matters.<br /><br />Bottom line, I always hated rubber gloves but I use these without dreading it,  it’s a first.

It should also be avoided if you’re predisposed to developing diabetes. Another reason to limit maltodextrin is to keep your gut bacteria healthy.<br /><br />According to a 2012 study published in PLoS ONE, maltodextrin can change your gut bacteria composition in a way that makes you more susceptible to disease. It can suppress the growth of probiotics in your digestive system, which are important for immune system function.<br /><br />The same study showed that maltodextrin can increase the growth of bacteria such as E. coli, which is associated with autoimmune disorders like Crohn’s disease.

I can't step over a tub wall without extreme difficulty, and getting out of a tub is near impossible so I don't take baths.

There are two grades of bristles, some silicon mini nubs that are very very soft, and some stiffer larger nubs for an exfoliate action.<br /><br />My lower leg skin on my shins started to flake off like shedding a snake skin.  After a few showers unable to reach there I was peeling off pieces of dried skin about the size of a quarter.  I poured on some body wash with the stiffer nubs and used this to shave off the rest of the dead skin.  It did a nice job, my skin in sensitive there, most of the brushed I have will irritate that area rather than exfoliate.  It reaches the small of my back rather well, an seems to allow enough body wash to lather up the area to clean properly.  I don't have anyone to help me wash my back so this is a nice tool for the bath or shower.  It's a little trickier to get the top of the back I have to use on cross angles to do that, but it's still works.

Some of the beneficial effects probably lost during the conversion to gummies are fiber for one, that may be an assumption on my part, but they don't list it on the bottle, so it's likely true.  I'd say next a certain proportion of the antioxidants are not carried over.  Fresh uncooked berries would retain a lot more antioxidants than processed ones.  I know from my past history as a juicer, that once the fruit or veggie is juiced the concentration of antioxidants drops very quickly from hours to only a day or so depending on the method.<br /><br />Still there are a lot of benefits left, from mood enhancing to digestion, to vitamin C, enough of the health benefits remain to want to use an easy way to take Elderberry.  This particular version is somewhat unusual as most seem to use blueberry as a flavoring for Elderberry gummies, but this brand uses raspberry.  I like that they are sugar coated on the outside as gummies can stick together and be a pain to dig out of the bottle that way. My usual caution is in effect because they taste good and can be harmful if you take too many.  Adults should resist eating too many, and put away so your kids don't find a great new gummy candy that can hurt them if they consume the bottle.  With these precautions in place.

5.0,1587082249983,Gives decent support for those who have a problem with slouching and others with medical issues.,"I'm a bit big to try this out and have decent posture anyway, so I had my friend put it on today.  I ordered it with her in mind as she'd been complaining of shoulder pain.  She'd had rotator cuff surgery not too long ago, and the pain was back.  She had problems sleeping on her side with the pain.  I mentioned this to her and she said her doctor has told her about similar devices that helped maintain posture.  I've ordered and used compression straps for my forearms to alleviate and allow healing for tennis elbow, so I know how a little support helps.  Anyway, she tried it on and said she immediately felt two inches taller.  The support was there and it helped with the pain immediately.  The device came with two pads, but didn't have any explanation for them.  I thought they might be shoulder pads, but later read on the product page they were for the arm pits.  They wrap around and velcro the strap there so it doesn't make that area tender.<br /><br />I think the best thing about this she thought besides the support and pain relieve was how light it is.  She is still working and on her feet all day inspecting electronic components for a local firm with government contracts for critical plane parts.  With this she can wear under her clothes and maintain good posture all day working while her muscles heal.  Thus avoid the bad things of taking NSAID painkillers and other things that become chronic problems instead of solutions.  Going on her experience, I recommend this device, it's inexpensive and does it's job well.",192350,1805

In the 90's I used Spirulina a lot, usually in tomato juice or just plain water.  I got about four ounces from a health food bulk store, and a teaspoon per mix lasted nearly 50 servings.  Other than some coloring of my stools, it did nothing but make me feel better.  I used it for about six months and didn't have a stomach ache or upset the whole time.  The rest of my diet was much worse, but if the pipes work good the digestive system can handle a lot.  This is tolerable, nothing strong about the taste, and it blends well with vegetable oriented juices.  Not recommended for fruit juice, and milk is maybe a toss up.

The taste just isn't there, and I don't like the mouth feel, it has a limp chewiness, no crunch and while you can make out some of the flavors, none of them tells you to come back for more.

5.0,1555967389602,"Color me impressed, I expected not to like this thinking it would be cheap, but it was great.","I have a shower filter by one of the more prominent makers.  The problem was it restricted water flow a lot, and the filter replacements cost as much as this whole assembly.  I couldn't believe the filtering tech going on here. Fifteen stages , really, and designed in an order to filter out the bad stuff and finish up the purification in the end.  It probably doesn't filter our fluorine, bus that is something that some people like and others do not.  It generally needs a reverse osmosis filter to remove it anyway.<br /><br />Like my other shower filter, I thought this (especially with so many stages) would slow my waterflow in the shower to a trickle.  It did not do that the flow although slightly restriced was nothing like my other filter.  This one lasts longer too 4-6 months per filter cartridge and you get too.  I didn't price them, but since the device and two filters cost more than one filter replacement from my old shower filter, I figured I could not go wrong here.  The water even tasted good when I rinse my mouth (I usually brush my teeth and shave while showering).  I love it, recommended.  Frankly if they can get this much water flow for a shower filter, why not use these types for those passive filter pitchers I have in my fridge.  It might take a bit longer to filter through, but the result would be worth it.",192350,12
5.0,1531073423223,"Great product as good as the name brand, and an inexpensive as you could get without being free.","Seems to work as good or better than the leading brand, I use Petroleum Jelly for areas of my skin that gets chafed or irritated due to clothing or skin to skin contact.  I use three things actually P Jelly, A&D Ointment, and an antibiotic cream, it all depends on what the redness seems to be caused by and if it's swelling.  All three of those products have the effect of sealing the skin from air and moisture.  I believe this inhibits bacterial growth on the skin and promoted healing.  Amazon's brand here like the big V brand is basically a protectant, it's among the best to be used in areas just starting to chafe.  If you are starting to be inflamed, then A&D will do some healing, and if the infection is bad, go with the antibiotic cream.<br /><br />This earns its fifth star for the price the price Amazon is selling this for seems to me like it's below cost, so if you use the stuff, this is a huge supply for under 8 bucks on the current list price for 4 large jars of the stuff.  If I had any complaint it would be that some of the product leached out a little in the shipping, and seeped into the cardboard, but it was little and no harm done except new stuff should be a bit better sealed.  The four were sealed in plastic, but it still leaked through that.  Recommended, great for covering burns, sores, any type of skin issue, with no chemical effects.",192350,120
4.0,1529350169209,"Fair price and a good cleansing and conditioning shampoo, not for everyone, don't recommend with children, or allergic.","The odor takes a bit of getting used to, but all the aloes, oils, extracts and especially the activated charcoal, which since it's listed first meaning it's the most prevalent ingredient, do a nice job of cleaning and conditioning the hair.  I have to use a dermatologist prescribe shampoo to take help take care of a scalp skin condition, and I like to follow it up with something, but my dandruff shampoo is a bit harsh for use after that.  This is milder than you'd think and contains a number of things that act as a conditioner.  Activated charcoal is often used with pets, and sometimes humans to negate and get rid of poison if swallowed.  It works equally well as an outside purifier, often you find it in those Brita or other water purifying pitchers because of the cleansing effects.<br /><br />This shampoo is gray and smells very much like medicine, but not as bad as lye soap, and the natural barks and other substances give some temper to the smell, it's no worse than a strong anti-dandruff shampoo, but milder and better for your hair.  I think this would work better than my swim shampoo to take out the stiffness and effect of pool chlorine as well, so I'll try it next time I go swimming at a hotel. The cost is no bargain, but on the other hand, it's not much more than many dandruff shampoos.  From what I can see a little goes a long way.  It didn't bother me, but there is a caution that you might be allergic to one of many ingredients, there are about 25 of them listed, and a very diverse list of natural substances, so a bit of testing should be in order.  Although it seemed mild to me, it cautions about getting in open sores or your eyes.  If you have lice or other conditions make sure the scalp is headed before using.

This only comes with 2 basic tips and a tongue tip.  No ortho, no brush, no varied sizes.<br />Open-top means my cats think this thing is a water dish for them with a string-toy on the side.  Probably going to get chewed through at some point.<br />While you can flip the water tank over, you cannot secure it without unlocking and removing the hand unit/tubing.<br />When in travel pack mode I was unable to get the pick(s) to fit inside, and they were awkward lumps inside the travel bag.<br />Stiff cord makes it's length less lengthy.  (hopefully it'll soften up a bit)<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I can't say this is a bad unit, I just wanted so much to love it and it has quite a few drawbacks.  I missed that it was open-topped (that's on me, it's clearly advertised) when I got it and thought it would be cool to have this thing ready to go at any moment, filled with water and a splash of germ-killing mouth wash to keep it from growing anything inside.  That got dashed the second I realized it would be a water dish for my cats and would be ruined fast since one of my cats washes her paws (kitty litter mouth-wash anyone?) in the water dishes.<br />If the lid were flippable on the fly it would be great, but the cord attachment blocks the tank from sitting properly upside down.<br /><br />It's still a nice unit, just less versatile than it seems.  It is a little premium in price and certainly shines/looks premium but delivers average instead.<br /><br />In the end ask yourself if this open top is for you.

As you can see the individual pieces don't have any indication that they are NOT for consumption, or even what they are.<br /><br />This is great for discretion I suppose, and the lemon smell doesn't smell like food lemon, but more like cleaning supply lemon, so hopefully no kids will eat these.<br /><br />Anyway, you plop one into the toilet and it seems to kinda fizz a bit like a weak alka-seltzer and the smell of lemon is there.  It's mild.  Not overpowering at all, which gives concern for it's effectiveness after an Irritable Bowel meets Dairy Allergies evening of discomfort.<br /><br />First, if you're in a rush (which I sometimes am due to having IBS) grabbing a pellet and ripping the (pretty sturdy plastic) packaging off and dropping it in the toilet might be the last thing on your mind.<br /><br />Furthermore, it states if you get this on your skin to wash it off immediately.

I suppose if you're just at a friends house trying not to peel paint in their guest bathroom it's fine?<br /><br />Anyway, it plop-fizzes before you plop-whiz and to it's credit I would say that I mostly smell just the faint aroma of lemon.  Occasionally a whiff of my own brew would break through, but nothing too shocking.<br /><br />Also to it's credit I allowed my last creature feature to stew for a solid 5 mins after I was done and came back to a still mostly lemon smelling bathroom.

Does it have enough strength to blast away gunk stuck in my teeth? YES. As others have mentioned, the water basin is kinda small and doesn't last but more than a full cleaning, but I also would be the type to change out the water anyways, so it doesn't bother me. Because I am new to water flossing, I didn't expect the setting to shoot out water in sporadic episodes, ie, it's not like a constant outflow of water hitting your teeth. I'm guessing this is so you can move from tooth to tooth without a flow but I haven't mastered doing it quick enough yet. The first time I did it, I sprayed water all over my mirror, sink and face.

Unfortunately, the product itself gives no indication of what amount of water to use.<br /><br />So why four stars instead of five?<br />Unfortunately, there are no guidelines for how much water to use with this powder. I guess it's supposed to be to taste, but it would be nice to have a baseline amount from which to make personal tweaks.<br />The other reason is the ""organic beef type flavor."" I'm not sure what ""beef type"" is and it would be nice to know.<br />The cost at $3/serving is also a bit steep, but that may be worth the convenience for some.<br /><br />It is my understanding that the jury is still out regarding the research being done on the benefits of collagen, however, my personal experience tells me that it works, at least for me.

4.0,1601058951826,Better than Gatorade Zero in taste and formulation,"My boyfriend, who sweats like crazy when he mows his father's lawn every week, didn't much like this when he just tried it in the evening, but then he tried the drink he usually tries when he mows, and it tasted better than that, and it also grew on him with time. It has a more appropriate formulation, so I worry less when he is out there working himself to death. Then on top of that, I felt pretty darn wobbly after having some teeth extracted, so I tried some. I loathe Gatorade and have always hated the taste of salt (one reason I sometimes lack electrolytes), and not only did it taste good to me, but I started to feel better right away. This is the good stuff.",236916,1673
4.0,1598756815763,"Still makes me drowsy, but it's my best last resort for serious allergy situations","Despite all my other allergy medications, which may vary according to what's going on, my doctor says I can take diphenhydramine for breakthrough symptoms like hives and itching when I have an insect bite or an allergy to food or medication. It's a good old reliable that has kept me out of the emergency room more than once. I always keep some on hand.",236916,7468
4.0,1571859794899,"Tends to cake a little, but a little stirring loosens it up","I added this tasty powder to my oatmeal, and that worked out perfectly. It stirred in without any lumping and added a fruity flavor to my breakfast. I haven't found the scoop yet, but it wasn't hard to estimate the amount. The package reseals well, not like most of them. It's an easy way to add some antioxidant fruit to a meal.",236916,13
4.0,1492724159000,who does more strenuous outdoor exercising than I do and manages sugar better as well,"I got this mostly for my boyfriend, who does more strenuous outdoor exercising than I do and manages sugar better as well. That, however, was before we both got the stomach bug. When you've been throwing up, and now you're feeling queasy but thirsty, an electrolyte preparation seems to help things settle even better than my go-to tummy beverage, cola. This one tastes pretty good, can be diluted as much as you like, and doesn't seem to have that nasty greeny-yellow fake coloring like many lemon-lime sports drinks. If, like I did, you suddenly decide to mix it into ice water, let it sit a few minutes after the initial stir so the powder can dissolve and it will be fine. That works a lot better than stirring frantically and tossing patience out the window. Another small hint: when you try to poke the scoop back into the canister, go for the handle-first option. The scoop part is a lot more difficult to insert into the powder.",236916,16
4.0,1635642035764,MASS pre-workout supplement,I've tried many pre-workout supplements previously. Most of them contain caffeine or large amounts of B12 but this one does not. The container arrived double sealed and has 240 capsules in the container which are gold in color. This provides only 30 servings per container at the recommended serving size which is 8 capsules! The directions state to use 30 minutes prior to your workout and that new users may want to start with only 4 capsules. I'm not a fan of taking pills and having to take 8 capsules prior to my workout isn't appealing by any means. The capsules are average in size but I'd prefer this to be in a powder format instead. You could open up each of the capsules and put them into a shake instead but I have no idea if that would cause any issues. There are a good mix of ingredients in the supplement which does contain some salt and black pepper. The supplement does work for its intended purpose but I had to lower the rating because of the 8 capsule serving size.,236926,16109
5.0,1617408004879,Apple Cider Vinegar gummie review,I wanted the benefits of apple cider vinegar without the bad taste or smell and these gummies seemed to be a good solution. I'm also not a fan of swallowing pills and having to measure out liquid for each dose also wasn't appealing. These gummies arrived sealed and you get a decent amount in the bottle. There was only a slight odor to the gummies but it wasn't overpowering. The gummies actually taste good with only a very slight bitter taste. They contain a good amount of apple cider vinegar with only a small amount of sugar. I had no digestive issues with these gummies or other side effects. I would definitely recommend this apple cider vinegar supplement.,236926,2618
5.0,1615759818417,Aggressive Labz Creatine Review,"This creatine supplement arrived in a double sealed container. I was easily able to find the scoop at the top of the container. With a flavor named ""Lion's Blood"" I was expecting the taste to either be really bad or be somewhat close to blood orange flavor. I used 24oz of water instead of the 8oz suggested and the taste is actually pretty good. It has a light orange taste (because it is watered down from adding more water). There are no extra unnecessary ingredients and no ""proprietary blends"" in the powder. There is a higher than average amount of creatine in this powder which is reflected in the additional warnings on the label regarding its use. This supplement is targeted toward the serious athlete or body builder and not the casual gym user. I would recommend this supplement for those that need the additional creatine for their sport but it's probably an excessive amount of creatine for the average person. I would recommend this supplement for its intended audience.",236926,3364
5.0,1608441531286,Mamlyn face mask review,These face masks are well made and comfortable. They have pockets for filters and the elastic ear pieces are adjustable. They come with a carrying case as well as a laundry bag to keep the masks from getting lost in the wash. They provide a good amount of coverage and are thick enough to provide a good amount of filtering even without the filter. There was no odor to the masks upon removing from the packaging and they fit well. I would definitely recommend these face masks.,236926,713
5.0,1566780064167,Notebook journal review,This is a very nice notebook/journal. I use it to track my workouts so that I can see my progress over time. The notebook is hardback with plenty of pages that have a date and page entry areas at the top right corner of each page. The pages are double sided and the lines are spaced far enough apart to allow easy entry and reading. The pages are off-white or light tan which is easy to look at and the notebook comes with an attached ribbon page marker. The size of this notebook is compact which would make carrying or transporting it very convenient and easy. The only thing that I would have liked to see would be stickers or divider tabs which most notebooks come with. Other than that minor issue it's a very nice notebook that is well made and should last for a long time. I would definitely recommend this notebook.,236926,237

Berry flavor is amazing. Fast forward a few weeks to today I got a package in the mail and they also sent me the free sample packs and another cup. I'm shocked with the generosity of this company I was not expecting to also get the samples sent to me I almost cried when I opened the box how sweet of them.

These multi-collagen pills work just as well as the powder, I think.  I take one serving (3 pills) per day, with a full glass of water.  They're easy to swallow.  I also add a Vitamin C supplement when taking these, since collagen reportedly works better in conjunction with that.<br /><br />I've noticed my face looks a bit plumper (good) and my skin is less dry.  Haven't noticed a pain reduction (I'm frequently sore from exercising), but I never expected collagen to help with pain.

This does not have magnesium which is surprising since that is one mineral most people need. These tablets contain ingredients that come from seafood so they are not suitable for strict vegetarians (since many yoga enthusiasts are vegetarian I think it would be wise to create a vegan version of this).

It is tightening yet comfortably so...  I use it twice a day after washing, before applying vitamin C serum...  It has become quite a pleasant ritual.",249064,2053

I know, not likely a biggie, but I just don't like it.<br /><br />This little machine has battery power as well as plug in power when the juice is available.  That is really convenient for camping!  Although, when camping, you often hear REAL Crickets and such!  Speaking of REAL....  This sucker is as real sounding as REAL!!!  You cannot tell the difference, and I am a country boy!<br /><br />There are many sounds available and the truth is, they are all really good.  My only nick on this setup is the the buttons are touch buttons that their feedback isn't as accurate as I would like, as is the light actuator... Not as predictable as I would like because I hate fussing with the light or the on off or changing sounds to get it on the setting I want.<br /><br />That said, this thing is tiny but awesome!",249064,1783

I don't know if that is normal but I like it.<br /><br />Now, it must be said, these are big gel capsules but they are easier to swallow than I thought possible.  I take it by itself with a glass of water and take my time.  I like this formulation and it seems to help a lot of issues.",249064,296
4.0,1576959253028,They work well while challenging in the area of comfort.,"These earplugs are much better than the foam disposable earplugs and they don't need to be thrown away at the end of the night.  What I think these earplugs need is some fine-tuning of size.  I tried the small for my left ear (the smaller of the two) and the small was too small.  My right ear canal is larger and the medium-sized earplug fits well.<br /><br />I can generally sleep 5-7 hours with the earplug in, but by the 5th hour, my ears hurt pretty badly.<br /><br />Nonetheless, they do an adequate job of quieting the environment in general, however, the snorer next to me seems to be insurmountable.  The earplugs mute the snoring slightly, but not quite enough.  I am a very light sleeper, so your results may vary.",249064,1185
4.0,1643483076104,Good economical choice,"This shaver does a really nice job. The blades are sharp and you can cover a decent amount of area with each ""pass"". I deducted one star because the battery life isn't quite what I would like but it did get the job done without needing to be charged. Just don't expect to go multiple cuts without charging. The price is reasonable and I would definitely recommend as an economical choice to keep your head free from hair.",249137,6
5.0,1610973343025,So far so good,"My husband has been using this for a couple of weeks and while it is too early to see long term effects, so far so good. It mixes well with water and does not leave a chalky aftertaste. His recovery time seems to be better and he has had no ill side effects thus far. You only use a small amount at a time so this container will last a while. He has been pleased and said that he would definitely purchase again.",249137,949
5.0,1606339757845,Wonderful neck massage!,This neck massager is glorious. It has a long enough cord that you can use it on a bed or a couch/chair and be able to relax while doing so. There are different settings and I really appreciate the option of heat. There is a wall plug and also a car charger although I feel like it would be very awkward to try and use it while driving. It does however work wonderfully at home! I do not have a current listed price to compare value but it would definitely make a great gift. I highly recommend!,249137,980

My one complaint is that they're tight across the top of my face and I feel like it's going to leave a mark. For this reason, I don't wear it for an extended period of time. Other than that I would highly recommend for quick trips or stops.",249137,70
5.0,1601122181663,Great value and quality,These compostable forks are a fabulous deal. They are sturdy and strong and the huge package will last my family for a good while.

4.0,1599876438628,Spa-like experience,This fizz smells amazing! It turns a regular bath into a relaxing spa-like experience. My skin felt very moisturized afterwards which is a huge bonus.

3.0,1595543230607,Not the best quality,"These gloves are true to size, maybe even a little on the small side.  I have small hands and the fit was a bit snug.

5.0,1594638726256,Awesome loofah!!,"These loofahs are wonderful! The weave is tight and it gives you an excellent lather in the shower. Afterwards, my skin felt smooth and exfoliated.<br /><br />I really like the set of 4 because I am always forgetting to replace my loofah regularly. This way I have an extra available and the price is great compared to what you would pay in stores. Awesome product!!",249137,476
4.0,1592491153329,Lovely gift,"These bath bombs arrived in a lovely, heavy-duty gift box.  They are all individually wrapped and can be given as a set or broken up to use in individual gift bags or baskets.  I really like the scents but did find that a couple of the bombs were already starting to crumble.  Not a big deal since they will be dissolved in a bath anyway but it could be an issue if you are opting to give this as a gift.  The candle design would not be my first choice, especially if you want to give this as something other than a birthday gift but not a big deal if you’re purchasing for yourself.  Overall, this is a great set at a reasonable price.  At roughly $1 per piece, these are definitely a better deal than many others that I have purchased in bath and body shops.",249137,1538
1.0,1591701947251,Smell awful,I was super excited to try these dryer balls because I love the idea of not having to throw away countless fabric softener sheets while using something that is much better for the environment.  My excitement was short-lived however because right out of the package these smelled awful.  I left them out of the plastic for a few days hoping that the smell would dissipate but they still smell like a stinky sheep.  So much so that I cannot bring myself to throw them in with a clean load of laundry for fear that my clothes will smell the exact same way and we will all smell like we've been rolling around in the barnyard.<br /><br />I really wanted to love these but I just can't get past the smell.  It seems that the other reviews are very positive so perhaps I just received a bad batch??,249137,1498
4.0,1667757831276,"Minor Flaws, But Does The Job","Having three small long hair dogs that need groomed frequently gets expensive. While I am by no means a professional, these are easy to use with a small learning curve to getting used to it. The clippers are smaller and lightweight, so you aren't holding a heavy clipper while near a small dog. They don't pull or snag the hair and the noise level is really low. The dogs don't get scared by the noise thankfully. The fact they are cordless makes them easy to use on dogs. I can't speak to cats because I've only used these on small yorkies, but I'm sure they work for cats too. I'll be saving us money each month doing standard grooming at home.",249213,2074
5.0,1651929665448,Homesteading in the 21st Century,"With all of the inflation and shortages across the country, this is actually the best way to ensure you have laundry soap for cheap. The two bags are 10 lbs and that provides you months upon months of washing soap if you want to save money and make it yourself. The bags reseal easily too, so you can make small batches when you need them. I use these as a deep cleaning as well as an ant killer for inside the house because the spring rain has brought ants. You can use these for so many purposes; bath bombs, detergent, cleaning agents, and so much more. It's cost effective too! There aren't any impurities in the bag and I've enjoyed using it to make laundry soap. Even the little ones like helping out because it's natural and it's like a science experiment for them. I definitely recommend these, especially if things keep going the way they are.",249213,1624
4.0,1637513943642,Add More Water Than Suggested,"We live in the south. You need all the help when you live in the south in the summer. The humidity and heat are brutal. If you don't beat the heat, you'll need these. The trick I found to these is to do a little more than 32oz of water. I do 4oz with warm water for the powder to dissolve and then I had 30 oz of cold water and ice cubes and shake again. These tastes much better cold, but the powder dissolves easier when it's mixed in warm water initially.<br /><br />The orange tastes good. It is a bit sweeter than I would like, but sweet is better than salty and the sweetness gets better when you add those extra couple oz of water. It doesn't taste like the fake sugar thankfully. And it doesn't taste like salt which I half expected like other fluid replacement and electrolyte mixes.<br /><br />They come in an easy to keep package. Grab what you need and stick it back in the closet. These are even good for school sports since you can hydrate a whole team for just over $1 a piece. Still cheaper than name brand.",249213,472
5.0,1637202836681,"Good Gauze, Okay Medical Tape","I've been putting together my jump bag which requires a lot of gauze and bandages. For $14 at the time of review, you get 30 rolls of gauze. These are literally the perfect size for any first aid kit or jump bag. The one thing I like most is that the gauze doesn't stick to wounds nor fall apart. They are multi-ply gauze that are well thread. You can pull this tot without worrying about it ripping. It could be a makeshift sling if needed it's that durable. I find the individual wrapped rolls better to use than a large roll where you have to keep cutting after each use. These are perfect ""one time use"" rolls. They fit snug in the box or you can stick them all in your kit depending on size. No complaints here!",249213,2282
5.0,1633210886052,Smells Intoxicating!,"Oh man these smell so good! Lemongrass is my favorite scent when it comes to essential oils and I enjoy looking for bath bombs and shower steamers that smell like strong lemongrass. The only thing I didn't care for was how difficult it was to actually open. Once I did get the bag open, I was hit with the lemongrass. The smell is literally intoxicating. If you place directly under the shower, they will dissolve quickly. I like placing one on one of the built in shelves where the water just splashes occasionally. I get a longer lasting steamer and the scent is closer to my face. These are $17, which puts them at almost $2 a piece, but this is okay because I've paid far more for shower steamers from name brand companies that weren't as strong. This is really a win for me!",249213,9542
4.0,1623006699731,More Perfume Scent,"$12 for 6 bombs is pretty average when it comes to the price of good bombs. I wouldn't say that these are over the top, but I do believe they are decent. The actual bombs are small, fitting in the palm of your hand. The scents are a bit strong, more perfume scented than fruit scented. The orange actually smells like orange, but the others smell like perfume. A little too strong. The bombs do float and fizz longer than the other brands I have tried out. The water is colored with pretty colors and not just a dirty looking bath. I would say these are better for kids than adults personally, but for the price, you can't go wrong. I don't care for the perfume scents, but some do.",249213,1542

The scent, the size, the colors, and the extra soap petals are a steal! The bombs are a great size. They fizz, spin, and float for quite some time, longer than usual bombs. There is even a very large heart shaped bomb that lasts forever. The scents vary and are not too perfume like nor too fake smelling. They are relaxing and calming. I love that it includes the plastic piece to open the bombs easier too. The box itself has a bunch of flower petal soaps inside. These petals are fun for floating and using the soap to wash with after. You can't go wrong with this box of spa bath bombs.",249213,614

It’s really much to large and expensive for a home unit, but it’s also nowhere near professional quality, so I’m just not sure who the target consumer would be here.<br /><br />A bit about me, I’m a total skincare aholic and will try anything at least once when it comes to skincare fads. Now I have over the years totally boiled a pot of water, poured in some essential oils and herb blends, and gave myself a steam facial. Not only for beauty but also if I am congested or have a stuffy nose, and it totally helps. So my hope for this product was that it would be something that was quicker and easier, and more comfortable while doing the steaming, than the whole boiling pot on the stove thing.<br /><br />And it kind of delivers somewhat, but not what I expected for the price point. First the steam does get decently warm, but not hot. More like water that was boiling and you turned it off 15 minutes ago hot. It definitely could get hotter in my opinion.<br /><br />The overall quality isn’t very great either for the price point. It’s wobbly and you can tell it’s made with cheap materials as well.

4.0,1617728270435,Fells heavy at first but soaks into skin quickly and no greasy feeling,"The first time I used this skyn Iceland Nordic renewal moisturizer I wasn’t a fan of it at all. It felt very heavy and thick on my skin, even with the smallest amount used. Generally I hate moisturizers that are that heavy feeling. However within 10 minutes of using it I noticed it had all sunken into my skin, and my face wasn’t greasy or gross feeling at all. This is honestly the first moisturizer I have ever used that went on that heavy, but soaked up that fast and left my face feeling soft and moisturized without being greasy or gross feeling!<br /><br />Scent wise this is very very lightly scented. I can’t smell it on my skin and I have to really sniff to get any sort of scent form it at all even in the jar. It’s almost like a sunscreen/summer scent that’s hard to describe. But it doesn’t smell bad and the scent isn’t overbearing at all. I also really like that when you want to buy a refill you get it a little cheaper and just insert it into the original jar.

These appear to be of good quality and are made to high standards, but the price is really high compared to most other brands.

I have found with repeated uses, however, that it does accomplish what creamer does to a degree.  It makes the coffee a little smoother and less pungent.  It also adds a bit of sweetness, and I'm grateful it's not overly sweet.  One packet seems about as sweet as perhaps a half packet of stevia.  The french vanilla flavor I got is also pleasant.

3.0,1579055197735,Okay But Could Be Better,"I've used breathe-right strips in the past to help get better airflow through my nose while sleeping.  They work well but the cost becomes a burden since they're disposable.  Decided to try a nasal dilator and got this.  I see the potential and it work somewhat, but it needs improvement.<br />The first issue is the little tab that holds the two dilators together.  It's super short and keeps me from being able to insert the pieces far enough into my nostrils.  I ended up cutting the strip and separating the dilators, which helped a bit.  The second problem is that the tubes need to be a little longer for my nose.  They don't reach quite far enough into my nose to completely open up the airways.  Thirdly, I find the blue filter inserts to be counter productive.  They reduce airflow, which is already the issue they seek to fix.  I got rid of them immediately.  The last thing is that these don't always stay in my nose overnight.  The extra-big ends that remain outside of the nostrils keep them from getting a good tight seal for me.<br />Despite the above complaints, these still help.  They might work better for someone with a smaller nose.  Ideally the tubes would come with plenty of length and could be trimmed to size to fit the users nose more suitably.

4.0,1579706111630,TRAVEL ESSENTIAL,"I used to use rubber bands and a zippered storage bag to keep my supplements safe and secure when traveling.  When I saw this travel organizer, I knew it would be perfect!  I actually use the organizer every day [not just when traveling]; but when I need my pills ""on the go,"" I just slip the organizer into the pretty pouch and securely slip it in my bag.  The pill organizer is well made with a lever latching system which makes each compartment simple to open.  The compartments conveniently stay open while you are filling them.  However, since I completely fill these containers, I have found that the little lever can actually crush the pills on top when closing.  Even though this organizer is large and each compartment is generous is width, the compartments are much more shallow than my previous organizer.  It is a challenge to fit all of my supplements into the compartments and close the lid.  If each compartment was just a little deeper, this would have been a five star review!  Although some reviewers have said the pouch looks ""cheap,"" I think it is attractive, functional and durable.  The manufactured PU ""leather"" will keep this pouch looking good for a long time.  I did not think I would have a lot of use for the pretty little matching round three-compartment container.

2.0,1570118039459,Real PROS.  Nasty CONS.,"These Neem Seed Oil capsules had truly lessened some of my auto-immune symptoms.  I was so excited about the results until I started notice a distinct ODOR in my breath, perspiration, and overall ""body odor.""  It is hard to describe the smell, but it was NOT pleasant.  I was actually emitting an unpleasant odor that I was able to smell myself.  The odor started within a day or two after adding this Need Seed Oil to my supplement regimen.  After I discontinued the Neem Seed Oil, the odor dissipated within a couple of days.  I did a little research and came to find that Neem Seed Oil is known to have a strong ""garlic-like"" odor.  Well, it is just too unpleasant for me.  I would love to continue these capsules because I was noticing a difference in my overall well-being; but I can not tolerate the ""body odor"" it gives me.",262356,315

It gets a star for being more environmentally friendly than others. I found for it to work better with grease type dirt, just like any other cleaners, you need to let it soak into the stain for a little while first, then mop it up. Give it a little time to soak in and then scrubbing won't be so hard. (The packaging does not tell you this, but just basically mop and go.) In the package it smells fresh and clean, but one sheet of it in a gallon doesn't really smell like much. This pack does yield quite a bit so it should last a while.

Twist the top off, and just drink the premeasured strawberry flavored magnesium in one shot. Well, unfortunately I do not find that the liquid easily comes out of the tube when opened, and I have to squeeze and roll it several times to get every drop out. Also it is only about 1/2 of the dose as my other under the tongue formula, so I do not think it packs enough of a punch for my needs. We are all different, so your requirements may be different.

4.0,1648527384124,I wished this tested more than 45 common foods.,"As long as you are drawing blood and sending it in, why not test for as many allergies as possible? The instructions are easy enough. They do ask that you have eaten from all the foods that they test for, within a 3 week period, to get better results. Since these are common foods, I did eat from most of them in this timeframe. I only poked myself once, and I was able to fill the number of circles that they asked for, I think 8 samples was what was needed... but it took a long time becasue my initial poke was relatively small and wimpy. I sent the results in on a Monday, and I had results back online in about a week. Mine luckily came back that I am not allergic to any of the foods tested for, so I was happy about that. I am fairly confident that this is accurate becasue I really didn't feel that I was allergic to any food substance... I just like to eat, so darn, it didn't tell me anything I should avoid on this list. THe test was easy enough for me to do myself, and I do not like poking myself to draw blood!

4.0,1646005345544,There are things I like and things I don't care for.,"What I like is that the ease of the roller ball, and the hardness of it, allows you to roll right over your clothing... so if you do not feel like getting undressed (other than after a shower, or any other reason why you are not clothed), it seems like it is still effective even thru ""average"" wight clothing. I am sitting here with sweatpants and a thermal shirt on, and the rolling motion is still felt thru my garbs. The instructions on the box do not say anything about ""skin,"" and just mentions ""affected areas.""<br /><br />Now I will go the opposite direction with this... let's now assume I am now in only my birthday suit, and I want to rub in a lymphatic massage oil, or any other herbal oil or body butter... can I use this roller to roll over or to apply something to my skin that also helps my lymphatic fluids to move? The directions on the box that this ships in do not mention anything about using this product with oils or creams. THEN i did just look at the sales/info order page here on Amazon and it does mention using it with these products. I only checked here to double check it's usage. Good to know, but I with this was printed on the box or came as an inserted instruction. But, now I know and will proceed to try that!<br /><br />The only other negative that I noticed, and this is probably just me, but I felt my soft tissue on my upper outer arm kind of hurt, like light bruising, after rolling this over that area a few times. That sore feeling did go away after a couple minutes. I got this becasue I have lymphedema swelling and liquid retention  mostly in my left leg, becasue I had uterine cancer and 50+ lymph nodes removed 16 years ago. My arms are fine, but I do have fibromyalgia sensitivities, so that is probably why this would have felt like it hurt. (Kinda dumb observation on my part I admit, being that I am the one who controls the pressure! Not the fault to the product! But I guess it doen't take much pressure to use this ball, and that can be a good thing.) THis said, compared to other lymph massagers, like wooden U shaped sticks and wands, they tend to massage up a larger and flatter swath, involving more skin area with each stroke. This one is more like a rolling acupressure point. I an not tell which method moves the lymph better... I am going to guess this is personal preference.",262389,9125

These are an upgrade over a simple neti pot as they allow more control, but I found them hard to squeeze. They do soften a bit when filled with warm water, but I still needed to apply quite a bit of pressure to get it to spray. My husband really likes these as he doesn't have to bend over the sink as much and can easily squeeze them with one hand. The tip sprays water like a shower nozzle rather than in one jet stream like his old bottle too. Not really sure if that makes a difference in the cleaning of your sinuses, but it feels nice. Overall, for the price for two bottles, this is pretty reasonable and the saline packets are easy to pick up at your local warehouse store or online.

As is the case with most natural style toothpastes, this one does not create huge amounts of lather, but it still does a good job of cleaning. it gets the job done without any unnecessary additives.

I have used some potent preworkouts that I love, but do not feel comfortable drinking them on a daily basis if they are filled with chemicals. On the otherhand, many natural preworkouts are so weak in their potency that I do not get much of a benefit from them in the gym. This natural preworkout from Tattle is the best of both worlds. First, it is completely pure thanks to being sweetened with natural monk fruit and colored with purple carrot juice. Then, the potency is on point - 6g of bloodflow-boosting citrulline, 2.5g of betaine, caffeine and huperzine for energy and focus, and the added benefit of nootropics, like Lions Mane & Rhodiola.

This Organic Wheatgrass Juice Powder is nice because you know each scoop is getting 100% wheatgrass powder that is high quality and organic. You can smell and see the freshness. The taste is certainly mild and tolerable, especially if mixed with other ingredients. The cost is a bit high, but for the amount of servings in the bag, there is decent value.

As other reviewers have stated, the manual is well-written and easy to understand which is great. I like the fact that it is a rechargeable lithium ion so you do not need to keep replacing batteries. The device is easy to set up and has several different modes. I must say, it is very powerful! Even at the lowest setting, it can be intense on certain muscles. For example, even the lowest power setting on my forearm causes my fingers to fully flex and contract. On larger muscle groups, the higher settings may be more suitable, but certainly start low and assess your tolerance. I enjoyed the different modes and think that each has its potential benefit depending on your goal of pain relief versus muscle strengthening versus massage and recovery.",266653,877

4.0,1643773754947,"Decent hair dryer, three attachments. Can adjust temp 50-90C in 1 degree increments","This is a decent-quality hairdryer with an atypical feature: It has a LED screen and allows you to adjust the target heat temperature by 1-degree increments, between 50 and 90 degrees Celsius (122 to 194 degrees Fahrenheit). It's rated for 1875W power, which is close to the top end for a home hairdryer (professional models can go up to 3600W).<br /><br />The controls on this hair dryer allow you to both adjust the target temperature, and to adjust the fan speed. You can also turn off the heating element with a short press of the power button. Note that when you do this and then return to heating mode, it forgets your previous heat temperature setting (annoying).<br /><br />Also annoying is that temperature readout/setting can only be done in Celsius. There is no Farenheit mode. Weird for a US-marketed appliance.<br /><br />It feels OK in the hand, although the handle could be a bit wider in my opinion. The airflow is strong.<br /><br />In addition to the hairdryer,  you get three attachments: A finger diffuser and two concentrators. I'm a middle-aged guy, so I'm only gonna use one of the concentrators. But if you have long thick hair, you'll probably want the finger diffuser. The attachments snap onto the end of the dryer, where they are held on by small plastic clips. This appears to be a fragile system that will almost certainly break over time. My recommendation would be to find a concentrator you are happy with and just leave that on.<br /><br />The kit also includes a cheap travel bag and a cheap comb.<br /><br />This hair dryer is only rated for US use (120V)--no surprise for a high wattage device.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent hairdryer. The LED display and ability to fine-tune the target temperature is interesting--although I wish they'd included the ability to use Fahrenheit. The way the attachments attach to the dryer--small plastic pins that are in the hot airflow stream--looks fragile and may not hold up.",293851,2066
4.0,1642966985229,Decent shave. Attachments are a mixed bag. 4D model LK-5802,"Let me note upfront that I don't have a bald head, and I won't be testing this for bald head shaving. I'm testing it as a shaver for the face.<br /><br />Like many of you who are reading this, I've used rotary blade cordless shavers for decades--mostly Norelco. These always feature three floating heads. I've always thought there must be something magical about three heads because that's what everyone presents :-)<br /><br />Well, here we have six heads. Six heads must be better than three, right? I have to say that I wasn't convinced. I figured there must be a reason that the big names don't use a larger number of heads. And after trying this shaver, I think I know the answer.<br /><br />The answer isn't the quality of the shave. In fact, I was impressed at how well this shaver cleared the stubble on my face at the end of the day. It was comfortable and managed to navigate the nooks and crannies of my face and neck as well as my trusty Norelco. But--and this is huge--the ergonomics of the shaving heads leave something to desire. First off, there's very little reservoir under the cutting heads for shaved hair (see photos). This means you'll need/want to wash the head (it's water immersible) after each shave. Second, the middle head of the five doesn't pop up. To remove it, you have to twist it off. It's a bit of a pain--and there's even less room under this head for hair than any of the others.<br /><br />The third issue I have with the cutting heads--and this is huge--is that there's no obvious way to replace them without simply replacing the entire shaving head assembly. This can get costly--especially since my experience with these types of shavers is that the heads start to get dull reasonably quickly.<br /><br />In the kit you get:<br /><br />** Six head cordless shaver with LCD readout of charge remaining and reminders to clean heads and when power is low.<br />** IPX5 water-resistant<br />** Can be put in soft lockout mode by holding power button--good for travel<br />** Nose hair trimmer attachment<br />** Hair clipper attachment<br />** Two face cleaning attachments<br />** Protective packing guard for the shaver assembly<br />** Charging cable (requires USB-A power source)<br /><br />The non-shaver attachments are a mixed bag. On the plus side, the nose hair trimmer works very well. This is in contrast with the nose hair trimmers that come with clippers, which are worthless. The nose hair clipper here works as well as the dedicated nose hair clippers I've used.On the minus side, the hair clipper is mediocre--it operates at a low speed and struggles with any amount of hair. It's not very useful. The face cleaner attachments are probably OK, but I can't imagine using them.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd consider this a decent little kit useful for shaving your face and for nose hair removal. The remaining attachments are, in my opinion, not very useful. While it does a good job of shaving out of the box, I worry that the shaving heads will get dull over time, and there's no clear replacement path.<br /><br />Pros:<br />** 6 head shaver does a good job on the face<br />** Nose hair clipper works well<br />** Li-Ion battery: 700mAh,  2 hours charge for 90 minutes run time<br />** IPX5 water-resistant<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Hair trimmer doesn't work well<br />** Face cleaning attachments not very significant<br />** Shaver doesn't provide much room for hair and will need to be cleaned after each shave<br />** Middle head of shaver attachment difficult to remove for cleaning<br />** Sixth (central) head in shaver assembly does not float like outer heads<br />** Charge port on shaver is not USB-C<br /><br />Note that this same shaver is under various names on Amazon. Shop around for price.<br /><br />The same manufacturer that makes this kit also makes shavers with 5 and 7 heads. (And the attachments, including the shaver heads, for the two models are interchangeable). I did not find that adding a sixth head (as here) added much value in terms of how quickly or well the shaver was able to shave my face. And, since the motor in the 5,6,7 head models appears to be similar, a sixth head means a bit less power to each of the heads.",293851,13782
4.0,1642293754949,7 head shaver. IPX7 Waterproof. Decent feel in the hand. Attachments of varying value,"First off, I'm going to review this for face/beard shaving. I don't have a bald head (yet, anyway), so that isn't my focus.<br /><br />I have used rotary floating blade shavers for decades (usually Norelco). They work best on my face, especially for the neck region. These shavers have always featured three heads.<br /><br />Well, here we have seven heads. Seven heads!! I have used very similar shavers to this one with five and six-head shaver attachments. This is one more. The question is: Why do the high-quality venerable brands stick to three heads, and these shavers use so many more?<br /><br />The answer isn't quality of shave. In fact, I was impressed at how well this shaver cleared the stubble on my face at the end of the day. It was comfortable, and managed to navigate the nooks and crannies of my face and neck as well as my low-end Norelco (if not better). But it's no match--not even remotely close--to my top-of-the-line Norelco (though that costs about 4x as much, so that's probably not a fair comparison). But--and this is huge--the ergonomics of the shaving heads leave something to desire. First off, there's very little reservoir under the cutting heads for shaved hair (see photos). This means you'll need/want to wash the head (it's water immersible) after each shave. Second, the middle head of the seven doesn't pop up. To remove it, you have to twist it off. It's a bit of a pain--and there's even less room under this head for hair than any of the others.<br /><br />The third issue I have with the cutting heads is that there's no obvious way to replace them without simply replacing the entire shaving head assembly. Based on my experience with other shavers quite similar to this, expect the blades to get dull after a bit of use, and factor in the cost of an entire replacement head unit when they do.<br /><br />In terms of seven vs six vs five heads? Well, the motors in these shavers are effectively the same. So if you have seven heads, the amount of power you provide to each head is less than it is in a five head design. That's going to affect the maximum speed and also the ability to easily tackle heavy stubble. Given that I don't sense a huge amount of improvement with seven vs five (or six) heads, I'd be inclined to veer towards fewer heads.<br /><br />In general, I'd suggest that you can interchange the 7/6/5 head assemblies if you want to get a replacement.<br /><br />In the kit you get:<br /><br />Seven head cordless shaver with LCD readout of charge remaining and integrated activation lock<br />IPX7 Waterproof<br />Nose hair trimmer attachment<br />Hair clipper attachment<br />Two face cleaning attachments<br />Three length guides for the hair clipper attachment<br />Charging cable (requires USB-A power source; USB-C port on shaver means you can use cables you already own).<br />Small cleaning brush<br /><br />Shave is controlled via a simple on/off button. You can lock the shaver by holding the button for 3 seconds (unlocking is accomplished by holding for 3 seconds, as well). This is convenient for travel.<br /><br />The non-shaver attachments are a mixed bag. On the plus side, the nose hair trimmer works very well. This is in contrast with the nose hair trimmers that come with clippers, which are worthless. The nose hair clipper here works as well as the dedicated nose hair clippers I've used. On the minus side, the hair clipper is quite mediocre--it operates at a low speed and struggles with any amount of hair. It's about as good/useful as the clipper that's integrated into some shaver handles. Those can clip a bit of trim hair, but they are an exercise in frustration for any serious hair removal. Same here. The face cleaner attachments are probably OK, but I can't imagine using them.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd consider this a decent little kit useful for shaving your face and for nose hair removal. The remaining attachments are, in my opinion, not very useful. While it does a good job of shaving out of the box, my experience is that the heads get dull somewhat quickly, and you need to buy a not-inexpensive replacement assembly. Also, cleaning the assembly is a nuisance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />** IPX7 waterproof<br />** 7 head shaver does a good job on face<br />** Nose hair clipper works well<br />** Comfortable in your hand<br />** Li-Ion battery: 1.5 hours charge for 90 minutes run time<br />** Attractive styling<br />** Can lock the power button for travel<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Hair trimmer has limited usefulness<br />** Face cleaning attachments not very significant<br />** Shaver head assembly doesn't provide much room for hair and will need to be cleaned after each shave<br />** Middle head of shaver attachment difficult to remove for cleaning<br />** Must replace entire shaving head unit when one/more blades get dull<br />** 7th (middle) head in shaver assembly does not float like outer heads<br /><br />Note that there is a dizzying number of similar 5/6/7 head shavers sold on Amazon. As far as I can tell, having reviewed many of them, they are all made by a handful of companies and work pretty much equivalently well. The snap-in attachments even work across different models and brands. There are variances in features like level of waterproof and how the power switch works (and the body shape), but the function is pretty similar. So shop around for price.",293851,6
4.0,1641357649532,Interesting kit includes both irrigation and toothbrush functionality. Non-standard brush head,"I was intrigued by this kit, which promises to be “portable” while also offering the unusual combination of both oral irrigation (Waterpik type function) and brush mode.<br /><br />What you get in the kit is a rechargeable handle, two irrigator heads, a toothbrush head, and a periodontal probe, a short charging cable, and a rubber hose that connects the handle to a water supply for irrigator mode. There’s also a cheap soft-sided carry bag.<br /><br />The function of the handle changes depending on whether a toothbrush head is attached or an irrigator is attached. For toothbrush mode, you have Low and High settings. For irrigation, you have a a few different settings (Normal, Soft, Pulse and DIY).<br /><br />The handle is pretty chunky, but no more so than a low end Sonicare toothbrush.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />** Both toothbrush and irrigator modes<br />** Toothbrush mode works fine<br />** Irrigator tools are small and can be packed for travel<br /><br />What could be better:<br />** For irrigator mode, you need to run the rubber hose to a glass of water. The hose isn’t that long, and the first time I tried it, I accidentally pulled the glass to the ground.<br />** The handle is a bit too clunky to be attractive as a portable toothbrush<br />** The toothbrush head uses a non-standard connection to the handle, and it isn’t clear where you will get replacements.<br /><br />I didn’t try the periodontal probe. I mentioned it to my dental hygienist, and her response was: “Put something like that, vibrating rapidly, near your teeth? You’d be crazy! But I’m sure the dentist will like the extra business when you chip a tooth or damage your gums…”<br /><br />On the whole, I’d say that if having a portable version of an irrigator is what you’re looking for, this may fill the bill. But if the brush is your main interest, look elsewhere—the handle is chunkier than I’d like, and the brush heads are non-standard.",293851,15892
4.0,1640910866775,"Decent inexpensive replacement heads, but not as good as genuine Philips heads","If you're reading this, then you know that Philips uses the razor model for their toothbrushes: Sell the body for a decent price, then charge like crazy for the replacement heads.<br /><br />I've been around this block a few times, and I've tried other non-Philips replacement heads before--usually to great disappointment. But I like to save money, so I keep trying.<br /><br />These brush heads are far better than some I've tried. I mean, at least they are attempting to create a brush head that looks like the real thing. The brush head is about the same size as the genuine article (see photos). And it connects stably to the toothbrush itself.<br /><br />In terms of feel, these feel a bit less soft than the genuine replacement brushes, but the difference isn't dramatic.<br /><br />One key difference between these heads and genuine Philips is that Philips includes a metal ring at the base of the head. These don't (and most cheap heads don't--not sure if that's for price or patent reasons).<br /><br />What I like a lot about these is that each comes with its own plastic brush cover, suitable for travel.<br /><br />In the end, these are OK for the price. They aren't perfect replacements, but certainly good enough and far cheaper.",293851,767
4.0,1639804985722,Produces strong red light at useful wavelegths,"The whole field of home-based red light therapy is one that is continually debated. Useful or not? There are plenty of studies to suggest both answers. Still, there are enough reasonably well carried out studies that demonstrate some red light / beneficial effect, photobiomodulation, that a lot of people have tried it--and many swear by it.<br /><br />The development of high-powered, low-cost LED light sources has made it possible to develop red light therapy devices that are small and relatively inexpensive (compared to the cost of a useful device just a few years ago). This particular device promises a combination of 660 and 850nm red light in something the same size as a regular flashlight.<br /><br />While I can't attest to any amazing abilities of red light therapy in general, I can affirm that this device is capable of generating a very very bright red light, providing irradiance of 200 mW/cm^2 at at start of the external beam. (See photos).<br /><br />In the kit you get:<br /><br />** Red light therapy flashlight, produces light at 660nm and 850nm in a 2-to-1 ratio<br />** 1 x 18650 Li-Ion battery , 2600 mAH<br />** Cheap tripod with a plastic adapter to hold the flashlight<br />** Small travel bag<br />** Charging cable<br />** Cheap sunglasses<br /><br />To turn the light on, you just push the button at the end of the device. Push it again to turn it off. It will automatically turn itself off after 10 minutes.<br /><br />I am not sure I can attest to the value of red light therapy, but if you're a red light believer, this kit offers a way to bring that technology home for a reasonable price.",293851,2444
4.0,1639454848420,IPX7 Waterproof combination body clipper and vaccum -- a novel solution to hair everywhere,"There is a huge number of options for hair trimmers on Amazon, some marketed specifically as body hair trimmers. But, honestly, any trimmer can be used as a body hair trimmer as long as it is maneuverable enough. That includes all the T-Blade trimmers and smaller head standard clippers.<br /><br />That said, if you're trimming body hair, life gets a lot easier if the trimmer is waterproof (so you can use it in the shower). Because trimming somewhere else inevitably results in a ton of hair getting everywhere.<br /><br />Well, until now. Someone decided to combine a medium-sized clipper with a small vacuum. The idea is that the vacuum will pull in the hair as it's cut. So the hair winds up in the device, not on your sink or floor. It's not a bad idea.<br /><br />In practice? I found that this clipper DEFINITELY pulled in most of the hair when I used it. But it's not the world's most powerful vacuum, and some still wound up on the sink (or floor). So, in the end, this will help keep things cleaner, but you'll still want to do some cleanup.<br /><br />In terms of functionality, you have one speed (on/off) and two speeds for the fan (low and high). Low seemed worthless--you'll definitely want to run it on high. As I mentioned, this is a lower power fan and you'll want all the power you can get.<br /><br />In the package you get:<br /><br />** Clipper/vacuum device with superior quality ceramic cutting blade<br />** Three clipper length guides (two of which are double-sided)<br />** A cleaning brush<br />** A USB charging cable (requires USB-A connection; connection on clipper is USB-C so you can use any USB-C charging cable you have)<br />** Cheap body sponge<br />** Cheap plastic hair cutting bib<br /><br />Honestly, I am of two minds about this. While the vacuum is nice, it doesn't catch all the hair. As a result, I would still be more inclined to step into the shower and run the clipper (where the stray hair can be washed down the drain). But if you are the kind of person who runs the clipper outside of the shower, even though the vacuum does not catch all the hair, it catches enough to reduce the clipped hair mess. So this might be the extra cost over a standard clipper.",293851,15893
4.0,1639290732683,Basic IPL hair remover works well. FIDAC Model T2. A bit pricy for the basic functionality,"The latest craze in hair removal is IPL: Intense Pulsed Light. Owing to improved light technology, handheld devices that can provide the requisite intensity light to perform IPL at home and at an affordable price are now available.<br /><br />I've tried a number of these IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) devices for hair removal. Compared to the others I've tried, this is one of the more expensive ones and doesn't seem to offer much in the way of differentiating functionality. As is typical, you get a IPL hair removal tool rated to around a million flashes. This one has a LCD counter of the number of flashes and the indicator of the power setting (1-5).<br /><br />Operation is pretty trivial: You plug in the power supply, (the hair removal tool is NOT battery operated; you must have it plugged in), you choose the power level (five settings, chosen by rapidly pushing the bottom of the power button)) and then you aim it at a body area with hair you'd like to remove. It is recommended that your body is freshly cleaned and that the hair be shaved before starting. You can choose either on-demand flashing (via the button in the middle of the body) or else automatic flashing when skin contact is detected. Switching between the modes is accomplished by a long press of the flash activation button. The mode is indicated by a symbol in the middle of the screen.<br /><br />The light is extremely powerful and could damage your eyes with continued direct exposure. Therefore, you should never look directly into the light and a cheap pair of folding protective eyeglasses are included in the box.<br /><br />The light is triggered by a touch-sensitive metal area in the front of the device. Using very slow-motion photography, I was able to capture a snapshot of the light (see photos). But the light duration is extremely short.<br /><br />You run the tool over the area where you want to remove hair, and make sure you exposure all the hair follicles in that region. You will not see any immediate results. The light signals your hair to stop growing, but it requires multiple treatments over several weeks before you will be expected to see results. Eventually, you should find a substantial reduction in the hair in the treated areas.<br /><br />In the box, you get:<br /><br />** IPL tool<br />** Power adapter<br />** Cheap pair sunglasses<br />** Inexpensive disposible shaver<br />** Instructions<br /><br />This device only offers one mode: Hair removal. Other IPL devices offer other modes (skin rejuvenation and acne treatment). Whether that's a loss depends on whether you believe those other modes really work anyhow. The jury is out. Another thing you don't get with this tool is any attachments that can make it easier to address certain body areas. Some IPL removal tools include these. The actual value of such tools is subject to debate and the fundamental functionality (which is a flash of high-intensity light) does not change.<br /><br />Overall, the device does what it promises to do. It's worth noting, though, that for a basic functionality IPL device, this one is priced higher than many. It's probably worth shopping around and comparing.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />** Hair removal IPL, simple to use<br />** LCD readout of number of flashes left and power level. Also indicates the mode (automatic, manual)<br />** Rated for 999,999 pulses (longer than you'd ever use it)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />** Somewhat expensive relative to other devices that only do hair removal IPL<br />** I prefer gun-shaped IPL tools to those, like this one, which are oblong",293851,4143

It's a bit of a pain--and there's even less room under this head for hair than any of the others.<br /><br />The third issue I have with the cutting heads is that there's no obvious way to replace them without simply replacing the entire shaving head assembly. Based on my experience with other shavers quite similar to this, expect the blades to get dull after a bit of use, and factor in the cost of an entire replacement head unit when they do.<br /><br />In terms of seven vs six vs five heads? Well, the motors in these shavers are effectively the same. So if you have seven heads, the amount of power you provide to each head is less than it is in a five head design. That's going to affect the maximum speed and also the ability to easily tackle heavy stubble. Given that I don't sense a huge amount of improvement with seven vs five (or six) heads, I'd be inclined to veer towards fewer heads.<br /><br />In general, I'd suggest that you can interchange the 7/6/5 head assemblies if you want to get a replacement.<br /><br />In the kit you get:<br /><br />Seven head cordless shaver with LCD readout of charge remaining and touch activation<br />Nose hair trimmer attachment<br />Hair clipper attachment<br />Shaver attachment<br />Two face cleaning attachments<br />Three length guides for the hair clipper attachment<br />Charging cable (requires USB-A power source).<br />Small cleaning brush<br /><br />You turn this particular shaver on/off in a very unusual way. To turn it on, you hold both of the ribbed sides with your fingers. It turns on. If you take your fingers off the sides, it turns off. There is no way to keep it on without your fingers on the sides. I didn't find this very appealing and don't see the advantage over a clipper with a standard on/off switch. I also found myself occasionally accidentally turning it off when I was using it.<br /><br />The non-shaver attachments are a mixed bag. On the plus side, the nose hair trimmer works very well. This is in contrast with the nose hair trimmers that come with clippers, which are worthless. The nose hair clipper here works as well as the dedicated nose hair clippers I've used. On the minus side, the hair clipper is quite mediocre--it operates at a low speed and struggles with any amount of hair. It's about as good/useful as the clipper that's integrated into some shaver handles. Those can clip a bit of trim hair, but they are an exercise in frustration for any serious hair removal. Same here. The face cleaner attachments are probably OK, but I can't imagine using them.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd consider this a decent little kit useful for shaving your face and for nose hair removal. The remaining attachments are, in my opinion, not very useful. While it does a good job of shaving out of the box, my experience is that the heads get dull somewhat quickly, and you need to buy a not-inexpensive replacement assembly. Also, cleaning the assembly is a nuisance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />** 7 head shaver does a good job on face<br />** Nose hair clipper works well<br />** Acceptably comfortable in your hand<br />** Li-Ion battery: 2 hours charge for 90 minutes run time<br /><br />Cons:<br />** The odd system for turning on/off the shaver is not ideal<br />** Hair trimmer has limited usefulness<br />** Face cleaning attachments not very significant<br />** Shaver head assembly doesn't provide much room for hair and will need to be cleaned after each shave<br />** Middle head of shaver attachment difficult to remove for cleaning<br />** Must replace entire shaving head unit when one/more blades get dull<br />** 7th head in shaver assembly does not float like outer heads<br /><br />Note that there is a dizzying number of similar 5/6/7 head shavers sold on Amazon. As far as I can tell, having reviewed many of them, they are all made by a handful of companies and work pretty much equivalently well. The snap-in attachments even work across different models and brands. So shop around for price.<br /><br />To be honest, this shaver would not be my first choice, because of the weird on/off system that requires touching the two ribbed sides. Your mileage may vary.",293851,18452
4.0,1638237065595,"Suttik T-Blade Clipper Model JM-700AL. Zero-gapped, works well. Kit has all the basics.","There is a boatload of so-called T-Blade clippers available on Amazon. The secret is that a very large fraction of these is made by a handful of manufacturers. Some carry different names in the listing, but they are mostly just a small number of different models with moderate cosmetic differences.<br /><br />The good news is that they are mostly quite decent. They feature 0-gapped heads (or at least close to it), 600 mAh batteries, a cutting head that can be rinsed in water to clean (although you should not submerge the body of the clipper), and a small number of cheap length guides you can snap on.<br /><br />The only significant differences among most of these different listings are:<br /><br />1) The charge level readout. The best ones provide an LCD display of the percentage charge left. The cheap ones do not.<br />2) Some provide a collar that can protect the shaft going to the T-blade. This can either be a plastic collar that snaps on, or, in some cases, an extension of the metal body around that area (hiding the shaft)<br />3) A ceramic cutting blade. This is unusual, but a few offer a premium ceramic cutting blade<br />4) The pattern/design of the body<br /><br />That's pretty much it. Any descriptions or reviews that try to suggest other differences are usually mistaken.<br /><br />This particular set of clippers is made by Suttik (one of the common brands), and comes in a Suttik-labeled retail box. The model is JM-700AL.<br /><br />Specifics of this kit:<br /><br />** Rechargeable cordless T-Blade clippers<br />** Zero gapped cutting head (cuts close)<br />** Three lengths of optional length guards<br />** Plastic collar ring to protect the rotating shaft<br />** Charging cable<br />** Cleaning brush<br />** Clipper oil<br />** LCD readout on clipper provides charge status, but not oil reminder (not a big loss)<br />** Metal handle<br />** Ornate pattern on the handle<br />** IPX4 water resistance (can be cleaned under the tap, but do not submerge)<br />** 1500 mAh rechargeable battery (per listing)<br />** Retail box suitable for gifting<br /><br />Common items NOT included in this kit:<br />None. Pretty much a standard ""complete"" T-blade kit.<br /><br />Clipper operation is trivial: There's an on/off on the bottom near the top of the handle. That's it. The clippers work well. The clipper feels comfortable in the hand.<br /><br />Personally, I find the design of the handle a bit juvenile--it's not my taste. But, to me, that's a trivial issue. A 1500 mAh battery in a T-blade clipper is on the large side.<br /><br />As mentioned, there are a number of sellers selling this same Suttik JM-700AL (or similar) clipper under various listing brand names. This is a good option for this type of clipper but shop around for the best price, as they can fluctuate pretty drastically depending on the listing. A typical price for this clipper would be in the range of thirty dollars.",293851,2021
4.0,1630452066570,Decent tasting low calorie (15 cals/glass) electrolyte+caffeine drink; contains sucralose,"I drink a lot of fluids during the workday, and ""just water"" gets really boring, really fast. I could go with all coffee, but that also gets old after a while. So I figured I'd give these Quench ""Island Ice Hydrating Eletrolyte Rip Sticks"" a chance.<br /><br />I filled a glass with 8oz of cold water (and some ice) and stirred in one packet. The mix creates a cloudy yellow/white drink. It tastes fine--reasonably dissolved, not grainy.<br /><br />The taste is good--strong and sweet. The flavor comes from the prickly pair, but if you've nevr had one of those, here it's pretty similar to pineapple. There's caffeine in these, and I did notice a little bit of a caffeine jolt in the mid-afternoon, but not like a stiff cup of coffee.<br /><br />Now, at 15 calories per glass, I am not sure what they're talking about with respect to ""replenish drained energy"". But, honestly, at this stage in my life, I don't need caloric energy replenishment as much as I need a good-tasting drink that is low cal and gives me just a bit of a mid-afternoon bump. These seem to do the trick.<br /><br />Note that in the fine print, the note that these contain sucralose, along with fructose, guar gum, and silicon dioxide. I'm OK with all that, and it does taste good to me. But if you're averse to sucralose, be aware.<br /><br />I got these in 09/21, and the best-before date on the packets is 01/22.",293851,13577

It works faster and you have more control as you don't have to scrub and position at the same time.<br />The grinding rollers come in 3 different coarseness but I find that only the fine roller is needed as you really should not remove too much callus at once as you can damage the skin.<br /><br />It comes with USB-A to micro-USB cord. It does not come with a charger.<br /><br />Pros: It is effective. Performance is same as similar looking other brands. Sturdily built.<br /><br />Cons (especially compared to my other unit):<br />  1. It turns on at full speed first. The button has to be pressed to go half-speed. It should start at half-speed. Really don't need full speed anyway.<br />  2. The switch is too easy to turn on accidentally. Often it came on while changing the roller -- ouch! Not good for packing with travel stuff.<br />  3. Kind of big. I have another one which is smaller and easier to handle.<br /><br />Note:<br />One of the roller was defective and would only spin idly because the spindle was too short to engage the motor.

However, this product does several things better:<br />First, this microfiber has a finer weave which is better for glass polishing as opposed to coarser one for dusting.<br />Second, the firm base puts even pressure against surface which makes for even cleaning. Third, the palm straps allows you to reach tight areas such as car windshield bottom.<br />So, this works pretty well for cleaning glass and other hard flat surface.

4.0,1656126551420,"Pretty, Nice Sound, Very Limited Selections","This Orein Assoupi 3-in-1 Sleep Sound Machine has three different functions. With the color changing lights, it functions as a pretty little lamp. It also functions as a sound machine. Its third function is a a bluetooth speaker. I'll discuss them in turn. The power button, light button and three volume controls ( - , pause/play, and + ) are all located on the front of the machine. The sound button and the timer button are located on the bottom of the machine. LAMP FUNCTION: As a lamp, there are five programs, accessed in sequence by pushing the light button on the far right of the front of the lamp. The programs are: 1) fast color change, 2) move to the beat, 3) slow fade color transition, 4) night light, and 5) lights off. Though there are many light colors, you cannot stop on any particular color but instead can only see either a fast or a slow continuous rotation through them all. The exception is #4, the night light, which is only available golden yellow. As a stand alone light, my favorite setting is 3, the slow fade color transition. It is so peaceful to watch, and is absolutely mesmerizing to me, especially when the house is dark. Setting 2 works best connected to bluetooth, but will also change colors and intensities to the sound machine selections, and it's definitely cool to watch on the rain/thunderstorm setting. SOUND MACHINE FUNCTION: There are five sound programs that are accessible by using the controls on the bottom of the speaker. The programs are 1) rain, 2) fire, 3) meditation, 4) fan, 5) ocean, 6) sound off. They have to be accessed in order. The fire program doesn't sound anything like a crackling fire to me, it sounds like very high pitched tinkling. I didn't like this one at all, although I would have liked it if it had actually sounded like fire. The meditation program is a very soothing new age kind of sound that I like a lot, and I also like the rain which includes lots of thunder, and the ocean. I'm not much for white noise, but the fan would be pleasing to those who are. I thought the sound was amazingly clear and sharp for such a tiny little machine. Sound can be played continuously, or the timer button on the bottom of the machine can be pushed to choose an auto-off of 30, 60, or 90 minutes. BLUETOOTH SPEAKER: It was amazingly easy to connect bluetooth, and I tried it on a number of different types of music using my iPod as the music source. I was pleased with how this little speaker sounded with each music selection I played. While this is obviously not going to match the high fidelity sound of my expensive home sound system, I feel it performed quite well. Note: if the power button is held for two seconds and the blinking blue light is on, indicating the speaker is ready to pair to bluetooth, the speaker will automatically shut down after two minutes if it is not paired with bluetooth. If I change my mind about connecting to bluetooth after the blue light is flashing, I can just press the power button rapidly and the blinking blue light will go away and I will return to normal speaker mode. Also, if the speaker is paired to bluetooth and is paused for 15 minutes or more, the speaker will automatically shut down. I find that the more I use this little sound machine, the more I like it, and am content with its limitations. The slowly fading lights and a soft mediation program in the background with this little machine sitting on the corner of my computer desk at home is just perfect for me, and I am glad I ordered this machine.",293876,170
3.0,1655313399438,Breakthrough Chemical Odor that Was Very Potent,"I love shower steamers, and it's rare for me to find some I don't care for. Unfortunately, these shower are definitely not ones I like.

It totally overpowers the smell of both the menthol & eucalyptus and the lavender shower steamers. The fumes were not only unpleasant, they actually started to give me a headache each time. I don't know if I just got a bad batch of these or what, but after trying one of each scent on different days and having the same thing happen each time, I'm not about to try any more. These six shower steamers come wrapped in shiny foil, three eucalyptus (green) and three lavender (purple). They lie on a bed of lavender filler paper, and there is a mesh lavender drawstring bag with an adhesive-backed hook to hang the bag on. The cover of the box is pretty and has a printed lavender ribbon with a bow on it. Two of the sides say ""Make your bathroom different!"". This has all the right stuff to make a beautiful gift, but the intense, unpleasant scent of these steamers make them something I don't even want to finish using for myself, much less gift to anyone else.

The instruction manual is the best I've ever seen with a TENS/EMS unit.  Well written and thorough.<br />3. Also has a ""quick start"" guide that goes over the basics so you can get up and running quickly.<br />4. Battery operated.  Unit uses 3 AAA batteries.

Set of two 3.5' by 5"" pads, great for larger muscle groups like lower back.<br /><br />The ""not so good"":<br />1. The price.  Current price of $72 is definitely on the high end.  Kit is nice but $72, no.<br />2. Lack of extra pads.  Using both channels, there is one set of pads for both the large and small pads.  At $72 there should be extra pads.  High quality pads are usually good for a max of 10 uses, usually less. iReliev's replacement pad kit, with 8 small and 4 large electrode pads, costs approx $20.<br />3. iReliev pads use a ""pin"" type connector.  My experience is that pin connectors tend to come loose more easily than ""snap"" connectors.  If one comes loose and touches your skin, it hurts.<br />Bottom line.  I really wanted to give this kit a 5-star rating.  As is I was wavering between a 3 or 4 star rating.  I was expecting more based on the price.  Although good, it's not $72 worth of good.

After I did that with each box, they each closed easily and tightly with an audible click each time as the magnets connected. I opened and closed each one repeatedly, and not once did any of the flaps fail to perform properly. These little boxes are nice and sturdy, and are great for small gifts.

This Sality Essential Oils Set comes with 20 essential oils, each in a 10 ml amber glass bottle and each nicely labeled as to what's inside. The box these oils come in is black with beautiful flowers, a bird, and a butterfly artfully decorating the cover. Inside, each oil is in it's own cardboard display section. There is a foldout set of instructions that has a cover with the same design that is on the cover of the box--flowers, bird, butterfly, etc.--and it's quite pretty. The instructions cover far more oils than are present in this particular set, and explain the benefits of each oil. As a personal gift to myself, I am quite happy with these oils. I also consider them very giftable to others.",293876,2152
5.0,1641527032292,Good Supplement to Healthy Diet,"My wife uses these. This SMNutrition Women's Multivitamin Gummies bottle contains 60 gummies. A serving is 2 gummies, so this is a 30 day supply. These gummies are soft, tasty, and easy to chew and swallow. They place a strong emphasis on the B vitamins, while also providing 25% of the daily value of iodine and 20% of the daily value of zinc. They don't provide much vitamin C, just 20% of the daily value, but my wife take a separate supplement for Vitamin C, anyway, so that's not a problem for her. It also only provides 8% of the daily value for Vitamin D, but during most of the year she doesn't need it in supplement form because she spends enough time in the sun to meet her Vitamin D needs, and in the winter she takes a separate Vitamin D supplement during the times where she's not going to be outside in the sunshine. Also, she eats a pretty healthy diet which meets many, if not all, of her vitamin and mineral needs year round. For my wife, these SMNutrition multivitamin gummies are perfect for adding to her diet and making sure she is meeting her nutritional needs.",293876,8155
5.0,1640131425926,My new favorite for non-power bank operation,"My cat and I are fighting over this heating pad!  I keep a heating pad on my favorite recliner at all times.  Our cat likes to sit in my lap in the evenings and he's discovered that when I get up he can snuggle up on the heating pad which falls to the seat of the chair.  The fight happens when I come back, he doesn't want to move.  I've had a bad back for years and years and heat has been the one constant that helps ease the pain.  This heating pad is very easy to place exactly where you want/need it, it warms up quickly and has a digital control that lets you set the exact temperature (86 - 158 degrees F) you want, it remembers your settings and you can set it to turn off between 1 - 5 hours.  The heat generated by the pad seems to penetrate deeper into my back and is very soothing.  It doesn't cure the pain but it makes is lessen temporarily and that all I can ask.  I do have another hearing pan that I can use with a power bank that comes in handy when I need to be moving around (especially handy when baking Christmas cookies) but his pad now has a permanent home on my recliner.  Oh, and while the heating pad appears exceptionally large and somewhat bulky, it isn't.  When I looked at the pictures on the product information page I thought ""that can't be the same heating pad"" but it is.  While it is big it's very comfortable to wear/use. Highly recommend.",293876,2088
4.0,1639418320402,"Some good, some not so good","Things I liked:  #1 - The price. At $19.99 I think this is the least expensive water flosser that I've seen.  A good value for the price.  #2 - The handle, it has a couple hundred little bumps on it to make it easier to grip while wet.  #3 - The power cord, its a standard USB to micro USB cord.  I've got tons of those so I don't have to worry about losing the cord.  Most flossers have specialized power cords.  Things I'm not fond of: #1 The water tank - it's unique in that you pull it down from the unit to remove it.  It's awkward to remove/replace and it doesn't have a large opening for filling the tank.  I have to question how long it's going to last since the wear and tear seems pretty heavy; #2 the hose connecting the tank to the flosser. The hose in my unit was about !/16"" too long.  It wouldn't move, it was stuck in one position in the tank.  I cut off just enough to free it but it's still too stiff to allow it to move around to get where the water is when the tank is low.  Summary: A good choice for an inexpensive flosser.  Doesn't have some of the nicer features found on some higher priced units but good for the price.",293876,897
4.0,1638731198922,NON-Sterile Gauze Rolls but Good for Outer Wrapping,"This package contains 30 rolls of non-sterile 100% polyester gauze and a small roll of paper tape. Each roll of gauze is individually wrapped and measures 4 inches wide and 4.5 yards long. The roll of paper tape measures 1/2 inch wide and 5.5 yards long. Since these gauze rolls are not sterile, I personally would not use them in direct contact with an open wound of any kind because of risk of infection. However, I would feel comfortable using the gauze to help hold a sterile dressing in place or to wrap something besides a wound, such as a sprained ankle or to hold a finger splint in place. This gauze is very elastic and extremely soft and comfortable. Even though these are not sterile, these gauze rolls certainly have a place in my medical supplies and will prove useful for many things. The paper tape is particularly beneficial for anyone like me who has extreme skin irritation or other  reactions to regular tape when it touches the skin. Paper tape is the only type of medical tape I can tolerate without getting blisters and huge reddened areas on my body, so I always keep some of it on hand. This package of 30 rolls of gauze and the roll of paper tape currently lists for $14.89, and I consider it a good value.",293876,2282
4.0,1638542559211,"Interesting, Pleasing Fresh Scent","This Focus essential oil roll on is a blend of rosemary, spearmint, and cardamom in a 10ml (0.33 fl. oz.) dark glass bottle. I applied some to my wrist, and was immediately captivated by the light, fresh, wonderful scent. The scent fades very quickly, but I can still smell it if I lift my wrist to my nostrils, and that's actually about the strength I want when I'm in public. This is for my personal enjoyment, it is not meant to be a cologne. Something unusual happened when I put the cap back on and brought it into the living room to take pictures. When I removed the cap again, the bottle was totally open and the entire metal roller ball with the applicator top was stuck inside the cap. I shook the cap, and the applicator top wouldn't come out, but I was able to remove it with needlenose pliers and pressed the plastic applicator containing the roller ball firmly back into the top of the bottle. I've taken the cap on and off a number of times after that to test it, and it hasn't happened again. I had not planned to downgrade my rating because of a fluke occurrence, especially one that was so easily fixed, but I see many other reviewers have had the same problem with the applicator initially coming off. While it is easily corrected, it is a flaw that needs to be addressed by the manufacturer, so I dropped my rating to 4 stars. I like the scent of this rosemary-spearmint-cardamom blend, and I consider this Focus roll on a good value even with the initial hiccup.",293876,16229
5.0,1637540192433,Boy Do I Feel Stupid,"I'd forgotten that I'd ordered an assortment package of these hydration drinks a few months back.  When I tried the various flavors back then I liked one of the flavors but I did not like the orange citrus flavor.  I tried to put my previous experience aside and mixed up a new glass.  That's when I noticed that the packet is supposed to be mixed with 32 ounces of water.  I think I mixed my previous try with 8 ounces.  That's where the ""stupid"" comes in.  Once I actually mixed the packet with 32 ounces the result was completely different.  It's still not the best tasting drink out there but it's a whole lot better than it was with only 8 ounces of water.  Mixed correctly the orange citrus taste is weak and the mixture seems a bit sweet.  I use hydration drinks during the hotter months here in Central Arkansas, which means from April through October.  Although not my favorite hydration drink, it does taste reasonably good and now I have to go back and modify my previous review.  My dad always said: ""If brains were gunpowder, you wouldn't have enough to blow your nose.""  I guessing he may have been right.",293876,472
5.0,1635454667493,Tasty When My Own Creamer Added,"I'm not on a Keto diet, but I got this Keto coffee because I love coffee that is French vanilla flavored. It arrives in an interesting box. To open the box, you slide the top part of the box to the right, revealing the tray underneath. There are 20 packets of instant coffee in the box. Each packet contains added vitamins and other nutrients in addition to the coffee itself. To make a cup of coffee, mix a packet with 6-8 oz of hot or cold water. I mix mine with hot. By itself, the coffee is just so so. However, I drink all my coffee with French vanilla coffee creamer, and once I add my creamer, this coffee is absolutely delicious. While I will gladly enjoy the rest of the packets in the box, the current list price of $44.95 is a bit too pricey for me to want to reorder it.",293876,564
5.0,1635087274785,Almost Too Cute to Use,"This gift set consists of six cute bath bombs in assorted shapes and colors. The cover of the box has pink on the left blending into lavender in the middle and blue on the right. It has a white silhouette of a female soaking in a bathtub getting ready to pop one of the many bubbles floating out of the tub. The sides and back of the box have the same color scheme. The back includes directions on how to use the bath bombs and a generic list of ingredients, which are sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, sodium sulfate, organic shea butter, sea salt, essential oils, and FDA approved colorants. When the box is opened, the contents are covered by bright pink crinkle cut paper. Removing the paper reveals the six bath bombs, each individually wrapped in plastic, resting on more pink filler paper. There is no plastic opening tool. The six bath bombs are each different shapes and colors. One is a green and yellow doughnut with lemon scent. One is a pink. blue, and yellow star with cotton candy scent. One is a blue heart with gold glitter brush strokes that has a rose scent. One is an orange macaroon with a white center and with a ""milk"" fragrance (smells floral through the wrapper). One is a cupcake with a lavender cupcake wrapper, white icing, and tons of multicolored sprinkles on top that has a lavender scent. The last one is a round ball with blue icing and a rainbow on top sprinkled with blue glitter. The scent for this one is sweet orange. These bath bombs have natural and organic ingredients. The bottom of the box clearly cautions ""Do not eat!"", although the online information says the ingredients are ""edible grade."" I suppose this is just a reassurance in case I accidentally get any glitter or other ingredients in my mouth. These little bath bombs are almost too cute to use, and I'm going to put them on display in my bathroom for a bit before I indulge myself with them in the bathtub. This set of six bath bombs currently lists for $16.99, and I consider them a good value and very giftable.",293876,182
5.0,1634954083272,"Nice Scent, Instant Cooling, Prompt Pain Relief","Like many people these days, I tend to develop lower back pain after being on the computer all day. It's not something I want to take a pain medication for, so I usually just suffer through it and hope that it eases up somewhat throughout the evening. This BIOLabs PRO Herbal Soothe product is the perfect solution for me. This comes in a 3 ounce (85g) bottle with a pump dispenser, and the label says the bottle will deliver 60-70 pumps. One pump for each side of my lower back provides plenty of creamy ointment to completely saturate the area. It absorbs quickly, so there is no concern of greasy stains on my shirt after I apply it. The cooling effect from the menthol and camphor begins immediately and lasts for quite some time. I can feel my lower back muscles relaxing and the achiness simply melting away. The camphor and menthol can be smelled, but the scent is mild and pleasant, not like many other muscle rubs. So nice to have such quick relief in a topical format that I can use whenever I need it without having to worry about the side effects of an oral pain medication. This all natural cream currently lists for $19.97, and I consider this definitely worth it for the wonderful relief it provides for my aching lower back.",293876,25719
5.0,1634779282227,"Great Rainbow Color Display, Lasts a Long Time","This box comes with three huge rainbow cloud bath bombs. Each bath bomb is 6.5 ounces and has a cloud face that is smiling and winking--very cute. The minute a bath bomb is put in the bathtub, it begins to stream a beautiful rainbow of color and to fizz its way around the tub. The show lasted way longer than any other bath bombs I've ever had, and it was an absolute delight to watch. The color continued to stream until every last particle of the giant bath bomb cloud had dissolved. The scent is quite pleasant, but even if it had no scent whatsoever, the color display alone makes these bath bombs well worth the current listing price of $19.99. These bath bombs are most definitely giftable to anyone of any age or gender that likes to take baths--whoever receives them is in for a true treat.",293876,183
5.0,1632455194642,"Beautiful, Smooth, Well Carved","This set comes with seven small heart shaped crystals in chakra colors and one larger rose quartz crystal heart. There is a black velvet drawstring bag to hold them all. The small crystals are 3/4"" long and 3/4"" wide. The larger heart is 1 5/8"" long and 1 5/8"" wide. Each crystal is polished super smooth. They are beautiful to look at and a pleasure to hold. The black velvet bag is well made with good stitching and no loose threads.

5.0,1631895070092,"Intoxicating Scent, Couldn't Get Enough of It","I ordered three different bags of these in different scents, so my reviews will be similar for each. This review is for Orange & Lemongrass. Of the three scents I’ve tried so far (Peppermint & Spearmint, Peppermint & Citrus, and this one), this is hands down my favorite. I absolutely love it. This order comes with a package of 10 shower tablets. The tablets are not individually wrapped and are all in a bag with a Velcro closure instead of the standard ziplock closure. The tablets are a bit powdery, as you can clearly see in my photo, but still work well and release an incredible amount of aroma in the shower. They dissolve faster than other shower steamers I have used, but I still managed to get two showers out of each tablet. The lemongrass and orange blend well together, and the scent is downright intoxicating. It made me take a much longer shower than usual, just so I could keep inhaling the fragrance. I feel this is a reasonable price for these 10 shower steamers and definitely consider it giftable because of its incredible scent.",293876,9542
5.0,1631467405544,"Nice Presentation, Very Giftable","This order includes 16 vividly colored shower steamers, four in each color and fragrance. The thank you card included in the box tells me that the blue is eucalyptus, the orange is rose, the purple is lavender, and the yellow is lemon. Each steamer is in its own compartment within the box, and each is individually wrapped in plastic. They also each have bits of petal or other plant parts on top of the steamer to enhance the appearance even further. The aroma of each steamer is strong, and I smelled them as soon as I opened the box. Each of the four fragrances is distinctly different. This is a very nice set with a great presentation, and I consider it a good value and a very giftable item.",293876,335
5.0,1631234319651,Perfect after a day working in the yard,"First tried this foot massager after a day of digging up tree roots from a huge pine tree - it'll take a few more days to finish that job.  At any rate, my feet hurt from all the shovel work, especially my left foot.  I initially set the compression control to the lowest settings, the roller setting to high and included the heat.  After a short period I upped the compression to high and that felt great.  I sat back and enjoyed the massage for about 20 minutes and my feet felt great afterwards.  My wife, who has very wide feet with  no arches tried the massager but didn't care for it.  I was just the opposite, I loved it.  I've used the machine three times since that first experience and have continued to enjoy it immensely.  Definitely recommend starting out on the lowest compression setting until you get used to it.  I wear 9.5 shoes and the massager easily accommodated my feet.  I'd suspect that the massager would easily handle significantly larger feet.  Highly recommended.",293876,2759
5.0,1630638922171,Helps Senior Pet with Improved Mobility,"I actually got these for my ancient cat, since he weighs as much as a small dog and can benefit just as much from the glucosamine and other ingredients in this treat. When I first offered it to my cat as a whole treat, he was totally uninterested. I broke it up into tiny pieces, but he still wanted nothing to do with it. He goes absolutely nuts over his wet cat food, though, so I have been breaking each treat up into a powder form and stirring it in with his cat food before I give it to him. He's in the habit of gobbling his wet cat food down to the last morsel, and putting this soft chew in his food didn't slow him down one iota. It takes a while for glucosamine to start having an effect in humans, and I figure the same is probably true in animals, but I am starting to see an improvement in his stiffness and his mobility. At one chewy treat per day, and 60 soft chews per package, these will last me for two months. I consider this a good value at $19.99, and I believe my cat does, too.",293876,8156
4.0,1630255504151,"Vibrant Colors, Fantastic Fizz, Fun to Watch","These bath bombs have the best spin and fizz of any bath bombs I have ever had. I was so busy watching the show once I dropped one into the tub that I totally forgot to take pictures until it was more than halfway gone, but it was still spinning and fizzing away down to the very last bit. The bath bomb floats on the surface, and if I push it under the water, it bounces right back up, so the entire spinning, colorful effect stays readily visible. The whole show lasted for about 15 minutes. The colors are vibrant. The blue cap dissolves first, and the purple and orange dissolve pretty evenly after that. The fragrance is faintly floral. It leaves my bath water a beautiful reddish orange. The oils and salts in the bath bomb feel very soothing to my skin and leave it feeling clean, soft, and well moisturized when my bath is done. The bath bomb did not leave a residue or a stain of any kind. These bath bombs spin very energetically, and I would not recommend putting one in something as small as a foot bath. Instead, use them in a regular bath tub per the instructions. The only reason I gave these delightful bath bombs a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because the box, instead of being shrink wrapped like most bath bomb sets, is instead held together with a huge piece of packaging tape that goes all the way around the box. When the tape is removed, it leaves a wide stretch of stickiness that prevents the box from being set on anything after that or it will stick to it and spread the adhesive to whatever the box is placed on. This also prevents the box from being used as a gift box, although the bombs themselves make great gifts. Fortunately, this is a problem that can be easily remedied by the seller. Either shrink wrap the box, or just put a tiny amount of tape or another type of seal on the edges of the box, not all the way around the top and bottom. In the meantime, I simply transferred the rest my bath bomb set to another container, no problem. I think these 12 large (4.2 oz), vibrantly colored, fantastically fizzing bath bombs are a good value and very giftable, even if I have to place them in another box each time.",293876,186
5.0,1627683831623,Would make a great gift,"Pack of 12 small bottles (10ml each) in a very nice presentation box.  A nice selection of essential oils.  Pretty much the most popular oils.  I personally use some of them for various repellent concoctions (mice in the basement, deer in the gardens, mosquitoes everywhere).  Others I use in a diffuser.  The oils that I've used so far all have decent aromas, particularly the lemon and rose.  Combined with a small diffuser this set would make a great gift for someone new to essential owners.

5.0,1627061638814,"Easy and Quick to Use, Works Well","This order includes a set of 10 markers, 10 crayons, and a plastic sharpener for the crayons. There are six colors designed to match wood types: oak, maple, chestnut, mahogany, cherry, and walnut. There are four colors to match paint instead of wood types: black, white, gray, and burnt sienna. Each marker and corresponding crayon is labeled accordingly. I have used furniture wood repair markers before, but I have purchased them individually as needed, so it's nice to have a complete set on standby. I tested several of the colors on various bits of older furniture around the house, and each worked well. For the current list price of $15.88 for the full set of 10 crayons, 10 markers, and a sharpener, I consider this a good value and a useful item to keep on hand.",293877,2174
3.0,1626041571548,"Not as clingy as others, much more expensive","I like the idea of compostable cling wrap although with the amount I use it isn't going to have much of an impact no matter what.  We compost most everything we possible can and I used the resulting compost in my garden.  For me an environmentally friendly product has to produce results similar to its nonfriendly competitors.  For cling wrap I'm not going to pay twice as much for a role of cling wrap that's compostable compared to a better product that's not compostable.  In this case the compostable cling wrap is not as good, or anywhere as cheap, as the noncompostable versions.  Amazon has premium noncmpostavle 100' roles of cling wrap for less than half as much as this product.  And quality wise, I couldn't get the wrap to cling to itself at all.  I did like the cutter, it worked fine.  Bottom line is that it didn't perform as well as competitors and it cost twice as much.  Pass.",293877,567
5.0,1623609368389,Quality Steamers at a Reasonable Price & Not Just for Women,"I've enjoyed a number of different shower steamers over the past few years after discovering some at a resort my wife & I stayed at - so steamers aren't just for women.  I ordered these steamers based on quantity and price.  Eight steamers for $12 is a pretty good deal if the steamers are any good and these are.  I've used two of the steamers so far, the lemon and the sweet orange, and both both smelled good and lasted for more than a single shower.  Used per the directions, placed in a corner not under direct spray, the steamers released a pleasing, relatively strong, true to the indicated fragrance, aroma.  On opening the box I was a bit concerned that the steamers weren't labeled with their scent.  They were packaged with the labels on the underneath side of the individual steamers.  I don't like guessing at what fragrance a steamer has and the labels solve that problem.  This package of steamers would make a nice house warming gift or for most any other occasion.  Highly Recommended.",293877,1616
5.0,1622472187611,"Huge Variety of Sounds, Nice Clear Audio","This sound machine is truly impressive with the wide variety of sounds it makes. The instruction manual is detailed and accurate regarding which sounds are there, and in what order, something I don't often find with a sound machine and which I most definitely appreciate. There are six different categories of sound: ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response, which theoretically stimulates tingling skin and euphoria), Animals, Life, Babies, Nature, and Combination Scene. ASMR includes such unusual sound machine noises as eating potato chips and drinking water, as well as some music selections. The Animals category includes a cicada, pigeon, seagull croak, two different sets of birdsongs, frogs croaking, and crickets. Life includes flipping through a book, a campfire, drinking coffee, keyboard sounds, a train, and a ticking clock. Babies includes two music box selections, two songs being sung, a heartbeat, a lullaby, and ringing. Nature includes dripping water, two different wind sounds, two wave sounds, two thunderstorm sounds, a waterfall, and two rain sounds. Combination Scene includes soft background music (called leisure time), an urban street, a suburban pond, ocean waves, a seashore with playing children with waves and seagulls, an aircraft terminal, a coffee shop, a thunderstorm, sounds in the forest, a farmyard, muffled voices in a library, and something called life force which sounds like blood running though a vein as heard through a stethoscope. There is also a light that can be set at ""breathing"" (changing intensity), low, medium, and high. There is also a digital readout telling the temperature and the humidity at that location, be it indoors or outdoors. (The instructions do say not to use this sound machine in a high temperature environment, though). There is a timer button (the picture of a clock) with options of 20, 40, or 60 minutes, or continuous playback. There is also a volume button. Press and hold to increase the volume to the desired level, press and hold again to decrease the volume.  On it's own, the sound machine will play each sound one at a time through all the categories. Press the button with bars on it to change from category to category, and the button with musical notes on it to change from sound to sound within the category. If I find one I want to keep listening to, I can press the lock button to keep it set on that sound. It will remember the last sound played when it is next turned on. The sound machine has a battery, and charges via USB cord. The USB-micro USB cord is included, but not a USB to DC adapter. As you can probably tell, I really like this sound machine and all its many features. The original list price was $59.99, but it is currently marked down to $19.99. I think this is an incredibly good deal at this price.",293877,1783
3.0,1619646620696,"Toenail Clippers Worked Great, Fingernail Clippers Did Not","This set consists of a pair of toenail clippers and a set of fingernail clippers. They come in a nice tin box. Inside, there is a form-fitting piece of hard foam with nice cutouts to allow me to easily pick up each pair of clippers. I used the toenail clippers first, and was very pleased with them. The action is smooth, the blade is nice and sharp, and the clippers are very heavy duty. There is a nice ridged area on the end of the handle to allow for a sure grip when using the clippers. The upper half of the handle contains a built-in nail file which does an excellent job of filing. The blades are nicely aligned. Normally I clip my fingernails and toenails right after I get out of the shower, because that's when they are the softest. This time I cut my nails when they were dry and hard, and the toenail clippers had no difficulty whatsoever. Then I switched to the fingernail clippers. The fingernail clippers are just a smaller version of the toenail clippers, same design. Unlike the toenail clippers, however, the fingernail clippers were extremely stiff and hard to press. It took me two hands to close the blade the first time. I figured it was just because they were new, so I kept pressing the handle repeatedly until they loosened up a little. They were still so stiff that I could not use the fingers of my left hand to clip the fingernails on my right hand--the clippers were simply too hard to push down. The only way I could use my left hand to cut my fingernails was if I curled my hand in such a way that I was using the palm of my hand to push the handle down on the clippers. Very awkward at best. I will keep working with the fingernail clippers in the hope that the tension on them will loosen up a bit with repeated use, but they are certainly not my favorite pair at the moment. The toenail clippers rate an easy 5 stars, but the fingernail clippers bring my rating for the entire set down to 3 stars.",293877,524

They are 3 1/4 inches tall, and they each seal tightly without leakage after being used, so they are convenient for keeping handy in my pocket, desk, or travel kit. Each applicator ball rolls freely and applies a thin layer of oil without dripping. The three scents are Frankincense, Citrus Glow, and Real Love. Citrus Glow is an essential oil blend of orange, lemon, pink grapefruit, bergamot, and vanilla. Real Love is an essential oil blend of Copaiba balsam, pink grapefruit, geranium, , lavender, Ylang ylang, and black pepper. Each bottle contains 10 ml of oil, which should last for quite some time.

5.0,1615088087219,"Comfortable, Well Made, Breathable, Adjustable","Per my wife: There are so many positive things to say about this mask! The design of the mask leaves a nice little air pocket right below my nostrils, making it easy to breathe even when I take a deep breath. Too many times I have felt the discomfort, bordering on paranoia, of feeling a mask sucked up into my nostrils when I was already short of breath. Never a problem with this mask! The adjustable nose band strip lets me get a perfect fit with every wearing so that I have no gaps and so that my glasses don't fog up even with heavy breathing. The wide, soft, stretchy and adjustable ear loops are very gentle on my ears and make it a pleasure to wear this mask for extended periods of time. The inner mesh lining is smooth and comfortable against my face and is also very easy to breath through. The mask comes with two filters, but the overlapping mesh layers inside the mask make me feel quite safe wearing the mask as is without using a filter for my normal everyday activities. It's definitely nice to know I have that option, however, before entering a more crowded or more unsafe environment. This mask is very well made. The stitches are nice and even, and all the outer seams are sewn with good heavy duty thread. The ear loops are a continuation of the upper and lower edges of the mask as opposed to attached separately, which makes for a much stronger mask. the only way those ear loops are coming off is if you physically cut them off. I have tried quite a number of masks over the last year, and so far this one is my definite favorite. 5 stars.",293877,209
5.0,1615086618529,"Lightweight, Portable, Easy to Use","This little round sound machine stands upright on two legs and takes up very little space on a desk, a nightstand, or in a piece of luggage. It is 3 1/2 inches in diameter and about 1 3/4 inches deep. It has a USB charger, and once charged, will run as a stand alone machine. You could run it plugged in if you lay it on its face or tilted it on it's side, but the charger provided will not plug into the upright machine because the legs sit too low for that. It's quite stable both on its side and on its face, though, so it's not a major deal. The operation of the sound machine is super easy. Hold the power button for three seconds to turn it on (or off), turn the front dial to choose one of six sounds (brook, thunder, white noise, wave, wind, or bonfire). Use the + and - buttons to adjust the volume, and use the button with the picture of a light bulb to turn the night light function on. The choices are one light, three lights, or six lights, and the fourth push of that button turns the night light off. The lights fade in and out in as if they are ""breathing."" The night light, even with all six lights on, is not actually bright enough to function like a night light in the traditional sense--even in total darkness, it does not light up the surroundings enough to be able to see anything except the lights themselves. I think it's purpose is more to give something rhythmic to focus on while falling asleep. The sound machine can be left on continuously, or you can set a timer for increments of 20 minutes ranging from 20-120 minutes. when setting the timer, the number of lit lights, 1-6, multiplied by 20 lets you know what length of time you've set. For a basic, easy to use, lightweight, portable, stand alone sound machine that can be used at home, at work, or while traveling, this little sound machine fits the bill perfectly. 5 stars.",293877,7
5.0,1615084297544,"Nice Mask, Poor Translation re Health Tips","Per my wife: This package comes with two identical masks, so I'll just describe one of them. This is a very nice mask, well fitting, well made, with good facial coverage for me from my nose to under my chin. It has an adjustable nose band, adjustable ear loops, and a slot for a filter if desired. It's made in China, and the Health Tips as written on the package are a little rough as far as the translation. What the package says versus what I believe they meant : ""into the bag after use. Carry this product"" (keep the storage bag with you to store the mask when not wearing it). ""please divide the opposite side"" (open the filter slot and use a filter in it). ""do not wear back, anti-external will stick dust powder, direct contact between mouth and nose will be detrimental to health."" (Don't wear the mask inside out because the outside can get contaminated). ""Wash the poison once a day."" (Wash off any contaminates daily).  ""wash it with warm water first, then bot and hot to dry"". (I think ""bot"" means ""blot it off""). So, no, the seller is not saying the mask is poison, as one person thought who rated the mask a one star because of it. This package comes with two very nice masks, a storage bag for the mask when not wearing it, and a mesh laundry bag to put the mask in when it's being laundered. The universal laundry symbols on the mask say to wash cold (though the Health Tips say wash warm), do not bleach, do not dry flat, okay to iron, do not tumble dry, and okay to dry clean using process A (the dry cleaner should know what that means). Since you can't tumble dry the mask per the universal instructions, perhaps ""bot and hot to dry"" may mean blot the mask off and dry it in the sun or iron it dry. Not sure. In spite of the language barrier in translation, I like the masks, the storage pouch, and the mesh laundry bag. and am rating this complete package 5 stars.",293877,713

5.0,1613594174815,Tiny Soft gel Packs Powerful Punch - Only Take 1 Per Day,"Hard to believe this tiny little soft gel contains 625% of the recommended daily value of Vitamin D, but it does. 125 mg of D3 equals 5000 IU. These soft gels are so easy to swallow, too. According to the National Institutes of Health, the safe upper daily limit of Vitamin D is 4000 IU daily, so one soft gel is already arguably too much. It takes very little sunlight, as little as 15 minutes a day for light skinned people, to meet their entire daily needs of Vitamin D, never mind the extra Vitamin D taken in through normal dietary sources. The ""recommended use"" on the label is to take one soft gel in the morning and another at night, which to me seems incredibly risky. The whole point of taking a supplement is to help you stay healthy, not to put you into the hospital with self-induced health problems. Because of how tiny they are and how easy they are to swallow, I would rate these soft gels at 5 stars, as long as they are taken once a day, not twice.",293877,634

It's a normal sized brush head, same as the other brush I use.  The specifications say that the brush is 15"" long, it isn't.  It's more like 13 3/4"".  It also talks about bristles on both nice, not true.  I'm dinging it one star for the misinformation.  The brush itself is great.  Two sides, one with bristles, one with flexible rubber type protrusions.  The bristles are fairly stiff, which I like for scrubbing in the shower.  The other side feels good dry.  I use it on my lower back kind of like a massager.  Don't pay a lot of attention to the web page info.  It's a very nice shower brush and I recommend it despite the misinformation.",293877,210
5.0,1613427579092,"Soothing, Great Way to Fall Asleep","Went to sleep last night to the sound of water running over stones in a meandering stream.  Also had a soft white light illuminating the bedroom.  Before heading to bed I tried out all of the options offered by this sound machine/nightlight.  It has sounds/music to match most any tastes.  I gravitated to the nature sounds as they were different from other music/sounds I've used to help me go to sleep.  The machine offers nature sounds, short 4 lullabies and six selections of ""white music.""  One of the ""white music"" selections is the sound of a running clothes dryer.  That was surprisingly relaxing.  There is only one soft light and it's white.  there are a number of selectable colored lights but for me they were way too bright to be used when going to sleep.  Although the instructions don't mention it, it's possible to set the bright lights to continually change.  The sound quality is surprisingly good.  The controls are very sensitive ""touch screen"" type and are easy to remember after using the machine a few times.  Especially at the price I think this sound machine is a good deal.  Recommended.",293877,1773
5.0,1611514186309,"Nice Clear Sound, Super Easy to Use","This little sound machine has an impressively clear sound to it. After going through the range of nature sounds, white noise, lullabies, color choices, and volumes, I was thoroughly impressed. There were a few surprises. Under the White Noise section, one of the choices was ""Fetal Heart Sound,"" the sound you would hear with a fetal ultrasound. Another was ""Clothes Dryer."" Both of those sounds were extremely soothing, and something I could easily fall asleep to. I can understand the heartbeat being soothing, but who would have guessed the sound of a clothes dryer would prove to be a peaceful background noise? Of the color choices, my favorite was one called ""Colorful Breath Light."" That turned out to be simply rolling through the different color choices and intensities, but it was very pleasing to watch, especially with one of the lullabies or nature sounds playing softly in the background. There is also a timer function that allows you to set the timer for 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes. I like that the user manual that came with it told me exactly what sounds and colors were on the machine so that I didn't have to figure it out by trial and error. I am genuinely enjoying this sound machine. The only hard part is trying to decide whether to keep it on my computer desk or on my bedroom nightstand.",293877,212
5.0,1610757132907,"Beautiful Mask, Excellent Face Coverage","Per my wife: I really, really like these beautiful Galaxy pattern face masks. They provide fantastic coverage of my face from the bridge of my nose down to the end of my chin, without leaving any gaps. They leave a bit more room inside the masks for my nose than all my other masks do, which means there is a little pocket of extra breathing room that I absolutely love. I am a deep breather, and when a mask presses right up against my nostrils whenever I inhale, it makes it hard to breath without feeling like I'm being smothered. These masks come in a pack of two identical masks. Each mask has two filters. The masks are 4-ply masks, not counting the filter, and with that many layers of protection already, I didn't feel like I actually needed the filter for normal everyday use. It's nice to know the option is there, though, and I will keep them in case I need them at some future time. The ear loops are adjustable, and without adjustment they were long enough that they would easily accommodate a face much larger than mine. The elastic of the ear loops was strong but comfortable. The stitches on the mask were tiny and precise, and the material felt quite durable. I have been hesitant to order 4 play masks because the first few that I tried were too hard to breath through, but that is absolutely not the case with these galaxy masks. If I have to wear a mask, I might as well jazz it up a bit, and these galaxy masks are protective, pretty, and fun to wear all in the same package",293877,5407
5.0,1608519627058,"Comfortable, Form Fitting, Well Made","These black masks are extremely comfortable. There is no nose bridge, but the way they are designed created a good fit and there was not an issue with my glasses fogging up. They provided good coverage for my face, and I did not have any gaps either on the sides of my face nor at my chin. The ear loops, though not adjustable, were comfortable and were the right length for me. These masks appear to be well made, with two rows of stitching all around the edges. The ear loops have the same double row of stitching holding them in, which is nice. The mask is thick (the description says it has built-in dual filters), so it is a little harder to breathe through than others I own. I would wear something a bit more breathable for exercising or for all-day use, but for running errands around town this mask is great. 5 stars.",293877,220

With all the masks out there on the market these days, little things like this make a good first impression on me. This mask fit perfectly right out of the package. I found it to be comfortable, easily breathable, and providing good facial coverage. It did not fog up my glasses. There is no noseband, nor are the earloops adjustable, but because of the shape and cut of the mask, I found those things weren't needed. The mask is handwash and drip dry only, but this is easy enough to do. I am very satisfied with this mask and can easily see myself wearing it comfortably all day long.",293877,220

So much more relaxed muscles afterwards.  I even rolled this up and down my lower back.  You don't get the same deep massage because of the way it's made.  But it does help.

The stones are natural and I like that they don’t contain any chemicals. I don’t find that they have an odor either. They work well and because they are rough they don’t take very much pressure. Instead consistent pressure and forward/back motion to get an area clean is all it tales. I have used them in sinks, toilets and my tub. Of course not all the same stick.

Depending on the bite it may need to be done again for continued relief. While other bites can be a one and done treatment. The younger children just take some practice with it.

It was readily apparent what to do with those strips. Just peel them off the film and place a specific side against my teeth. However, after the set time period, I had to peel the strips off of my teeth and was left with a ton of good that I had to spit out. They were easy to use but messy. I saw that these were dissolving, which sounded interesting.<br /><br />When I opened the packet, I was a little confused how to use these strips. They look as though there’s a piece that you peel off of something, but I wasn’t able to do so. It also wasn’t clear to me if there was a specific side that goes against my teeth. In the end, I just stuck them on and hoped for the best. They did dissolve, though they did leave some goo on my teeth, which I basically ended up swallowing. I assume I did it right, but I wasn’t entirely sure in comparison to the other strips that were easy to tell how I should put them on and what I should do.<br /><br />The strips are kind of small and not as long as I’d like, so I do wish they were a little bigger.

While I know that these powders are sold by weight, not volume, I was a bit surprised to see that the vanilla version took up a fair bit less volume. I’m not sure if the vanilla powder is heavier or if it was somehow more compressed.<br /><br />So this product is meant to be a meal replacement and not purely a protein powder, so it has a lot more going on than what a typical protein powder might have. In addition to protein, it has a lot of vitamins and minerals and a lot of fiber. Flavor-wise, it’s OK. It’s got some chocolate flavor, and the sweetness isn’t off-putting. I’ve tried protein powders that were strong with the stevia, which is a sweetener that I don’t really like. This contains some of that too, but it also has cane sugar. I’ve certainly tried far less palatable protein/meal replacement powders. I’d probably rank this high up the list, though that isn’t necessarily saying a lot if you’re coming from never having tried these sorts of things to consuming a lot of them and just getting used to the not-very-good flavors. This does have some grittiness, though I make my drinks the night before, which allows for the powder to hydrate well. Also, given that this has more in it than protein powder, the grittiness should be expected. For example, this has a variety of ground of seeds, which is why it has so much fiber.<br /><br />In comparison to the vanilla flavor, this has slightly less calories, but it has slightly more sodium, more fiber, and more potassium, so there is some difference between these beyond simply the flavors.<br /><br />I’m not really keen on the fact that this is $37, is in a huge tub, but only has 15 servings. Granted, these sorts of products are all kind of pricey, so this isn’t overly so. The biggest negative for me is the amount of sodium this contains. There are 480mg of sodium per serving.

They look more like goggles than the sleep masks I’m used to, cupping the eye so that the material doesn’t push against the closed eyelid uncomfortably, a problem with some other eye masks. And it keeps out most of the light! That’s what surprised me the most. I assume face shape and size affects this, so it likely won’t be good for everyone, but for me it sealed the area around my nose more effectively than most sleeping masks with that little flap on bottom. Is it perfect? No, but it’s close.<br /><br />Update: knocking it down a star since this tore down the middle eventually.<br /><br />The strap is Velcro. I felt like this could be improved a bit. I’m a woman with a normal-sized head, and I had mine pulled almost to the end of Velcro strip, leaving the unvelcroed end of the strap just flapping loose. This could be remedied by a longer strip of Velcro. Still, five stars because it’s fine, just not optimal, and I do really like the mask.<br /><br />The placement of the straps are fine.

It worked smoothly without pinching or cutting my skin. I am a hairy person so this trimmer had some work to do on my arms. I discovered that the vacuum suction is okay, not great. Hairy people will need to empty the storage bin a few more times before finishing. The only dislike is that there is no battery charge indicator on the trimmer.

The roller massager is an extra feature, I like to have it roll and pause. The bubbling function is very interesting, I am very ticklish, and I am surprised I still handle it and like it. It comes with a remote, it is the only way to control the setting. The problem is the infrared sensor location, you have to lean forward to use the “remote”.

5.0,1662107573953,An excellent quality device at an incredible price point,"About four months ago, I was offered a free Antrolife Blood Pressure Monitor for review via the Amazon Vine Program, and I accepted.<br /><br />My blood pressure (BP) has always been a little high.  It's great to be able to track it at home with a straightforward, compact, lightweight, easy-to-read, easy-to-use device like this.  It is SUPER easy to use.  The most difficult part is putting the arm cuff on, and that's easy!  Once you have the arm cuff in the correct position, slightly above the elbow, attach the hose to the main unit and press start.  The built in voice guidance is fairly good and understandable.  The cuff will inflate and your BP will register on the bright, crystal clear screen.  When the reading is all done, the unit will read the results aloud and give you a prognosis.  Depending on what you're shooting for, your interpretation of the numbers may be a little different than what it says though.<br /><br />The unit itself is lightweight, but feels like it's well made.  I like the clean design a lot, too.  The edges are all rouned so it's easy to handle and hold.  The LED screen is super crystal clear and easy to read... in fact, I'm not 100% certain, but I think it may be OLED.  There are four rubber feet on the bottom along with the the speaker.  The cuff is easy to insert and remove.  The design is great.<br /><br />It comes with a nice little carry case that fits the main unit, the arm cuff and a USB-A to USB-C cable for using it without batteries (and it includes 4xAAA batteries).<br /><br />Overall, it is an excellent quality device at an incredible price point.  I gotta say that at this price, everyone should have one of these along with a fingertip blood oxygen monitor and maybe even one of the new ECG (EKG) readers.  Take charge of your health.  The first step is knowing your readings.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Just a little side note:  One of the most important things in taking an accurate BP reading is to be relaxed.  If you look up info on the proper procedure, you're really not supposed to be doing any activity for at least 10 to 15 minutes prior to the reading and certainly you wouldn't take a BP reading for hours after any strenuous excercise.  BP is very sensitive to both physical activity and stress.  IMO the best time to do it is when you're relaxing at home, maybe even just prior to going to bed.  When you put the cuff on, try to stay calm and let it do it's thing.  You can throw off a reading by a lot just by being tense.",340825,173

I love it!  First of all, it tastes really good!  It's sweet and has a very bright, fruity, what I can best describe as a berry-type or fruit punch flavor.  It dissolves easily.  It's refreshing and seems to have a positive effect on my energy and digestion.  I'm a big fan of beets and pomegranate and just about every ingredient in this.  Overall, highly recommended.",340825,1577
4.0,1593246608948,"Dissolves well, but very expensive per ounce when compared with others","About two months ago, I was offered a free 7.4oz jar of Ketond Collagen Peptides (types I & III) for review via the Amazon Vine Program, and I accepted.<br /><br />I've been using various brands of collagen peptides for almost three years - mostly type I & III.  I can't be 100% clinically certain, but collagen peptides seem to have done a lot of good for the health of my gut - so I'm definitely a fan.<br /><br />The Ketond Collagen Peptides arrives in a resealable 7.4oz plastic jar.  In my case, it was completely unlabeled - I assume, because it was a new product released to me for early Amazon Vine review.  That said, I prefer plastic jars over bags for collagen peptides as they offer the easiest, fuss-free usage.  There is a fairly small plastic serving scoop in the jar.<br /><br />According to the product description here (since my jar had no label), this is a type I & III collagen peptides.  According to the question that I asked of the manufacturer, ""the collagen ingredients are from the USA and the product is also manufactured in the USA.""  The description also states that the product is from ""grass-fed, pasture-raised, Grade A bovine, and are certified hormone-free and 100% non-GMO.""  That is all very good.<br /><br />Probably unlike most people who add collagen peptides to liquid for consumption, such as coffee, I tend to add them directly to my meals whenever possible.  However, for the purpose of this review, I tested this Ketond collagen peptides in both hot and cold liquids.  It dissolved as quickly as some of the fastest dissolving peptides I've used in the past, such as [[ASIN:B00XQ2XGAA Sports Research]] or [[ASIN:B07BL69CD2 Orgain]].  Like most collagen peptides, it dissolves notably faster in hot liquids than cold.  In my experience, all unflavored collagen peptides add some very subtle flavor, usually similar to a very, very weak salt.  This is no exception.  Depending on what you put it in, you may or may not be able to detect it.<br /><br />In all honesty, I tend to purchase the cheapest collagen peptides I can per ounce and stock up when I see sales.  There are huge price differences between various brands and aside from subtle differences in they way they dissolve, I seriously doubt there is much actual difference in the efficacy at different price points when compared with other type I & III peptides.  I am willing to pay a higher price for the more complete type I, II, III, V & X peptides.  I try to get certified grass fed whenever possible and would never purchase *any* labelled to have *anything* to do with China.<br /><br />As of the time of this review, this Ketond Collagen Peptides is on the very expensive side per ounce at $4.05.  I've seen some good collagen peptides that I've used for as low as $1.09/ounce.  I've seen others at well over $2/ounce, such as this brand.  Based on the price alone, which is really high for a type I & III peptides powder, I'd give this three stars.  I'll give it an extra star because it dissolves quickly, if that's important to you.  That said, at well under this price point you can easily get a superior type I, II, III, V & X collagen peptides.",340825,18570

I hadnt thought about brushing that surface until my dentist removed a molar because of it.<br />So remember to get the back of your back molars always.  This makes that Very easy (6 stars)<br />It takes a bit of getting used to and I originally thought the bristles were too short.  But with how soft the bristles are if they were longer the ends of the bristles would not move against your teeth.  The bristles in this case grips the stuff between your teeth and pulls it out instead of scraping it out of your teeth.<br />It takes a bit more work it seems to do a thorough job like all soft bristles.<br />Another advantage with this one is that because there are such gaps between the bristles its easy to clean after every brushing.  I mean a FULL clean.  Just your thumb and running water is all it takes.  Give it a little buzz to shake off that water and makes it easy to dry.<br />So  I would give it more of a 4.25 because of how much more work it takes to get all the gunk off your teeth.

This product does mention magnesium oxide, (which is my least favorite form of magnesium, because of its poor absorption and tendency to cause diarrhea), but I'm not sure exactly how much is in this, because it appears to be a combination, so while I'm not thrilled about that, I can say that, overall, this has not caused stomach upset/loose stool at all for me.<br /><br />Made in USA and tested for purity.",340910,1612

It tastes pretty good and mixes well in water.<br /><br />My problem with it is the maca power. It doesn't say whether it's gelatinized or raw, and the difference between the two is a pretty big one. Raw maca can cause horrible stomach cramps for a lot of people. In its place of origin, Peru, it is eaten cooked - always. So, not having this information on the packaging is troubling. By smelling, I can tell there is plenty of maca in this. It has a lovely, distinct smell.<br /><br />So... I have emailed the company to ask about this, but they should definitely have this information on the packaging.<br /><br />Also, while I appreciate the packaging choice (it looks highly recyclable), I don't like how the lid won't stay on securely.",340910,1582

5.0,1662124999896,Works great,"My mother-in-law is an esthetician, and I gave it to her for her business. She was looking for a microneedling pen, and I was able to order this one, and thought that she would be the perfect person to test it out. As it turns out, her first few clients that she used the pen on, were my wife and sister-in-law. They always get treatments from their mom for these types of things, as she obviously will not charge them. My wife really liked the effect that she got from it in combination with a hyaluronic acid treatment, as she claims it vastly improved the hydration of her skin, as well as the glowiness of it. I fiddled around with it a bit too, and thought the quality was really excellent. It doesn't feel like a cheap product at all, and watching my mother-in-law use it, seemed fairly straightforward. From that perspective, I think if you're a newbie to microneedling, the learning curve for this particular device is not terribly steep. I notice the technique is to pay attention to one area at a time, while lifting the pen to another area. Never drag, always lift. I think to help gain the most benefit from skin care products, such as serums, microneedling is something that could really accelerate your results. I might even ask my mother-in-law to give it a try on my face, as I'm in my 40s now, and could use all the help I can get, to regain a youthful look. All in all, it's a really high quality microneedling pen, and one that I would certainly recommend.",340941,4620
4.0,1661970196816,Not too bad,"First off, I have to say that I approach this type of device with skepticism. I didn't have any experience with TENS units before, but wanted to give this a try for some shoulder pain that I experience. The pads that come with the unit are very sticky, and easy to apply. I also did like the size of the unit, as it's extremely small and portable, and with a little practice, not too difficult to figure out. I must admit, my skepticism has been tempered a little bit, because I would find that after a session, my pain would be reduced. That relief lasted a short while however, as it tended to reactivate not that long after. However, I was expecting no results at all. From that perspective, I can say that there is something to this technology. I wouldn't describe it as a cure, or absolute relief, but it certainly can provide a measure of relief that for some people may qualify as invaluable. I think that the size of the unit is ideal, and makes it extremely portable. I will continue to use it in the hopes that perhaps with prolonged use, I can achieve better results. My initial experimentations with it have been more positive than I expected. From that perspective, I'll say that I was pleasantly surprised.",340941,605
4.0,1640867277691,Improved her nails,"My wife loves to spend an afternoon giving herself a manicure, using those gel UV light kits. As a result, they may look great for a long time, however her nails have been taking the brunt of that manicure lifestyle, and become very brittle and weak. I have gotten her powder collagen before, and she seems not to mind it by mixing it into her coffee, but oftentimes forgets it as well because it's not like it adds flavor that is pleasant enough for her to remember to always take it. She and I do take vitamins, and have some medications as well, so taking collagen in a pill form is a lot easier for us to remember, because we just put it in our weekly pill container. After taking the 28 day supply, my wife did let me know that she was happy with how her nails had began to recover. The strength of her nails had improved quite a bit, as they were almost paper thin at one point. I remember her constantly complaining that she had just broken a nail, but the collagen did a good job of strengthening her nails. This also may be anecdotal, but she did notice an improvement in her skin as well. All in all, I would say that they do work, and taking it in pill form as opposed to a powder that you mix into your drink of choice, is a superior method of delivery, in my opinion. My wife liked it a lot, and I think she's going to make me buy some more. It's also worth mentioning that there are some vitamin added benefits to this collagen pill as well, such as vitamin C & D which are necessary and imperative for improved immune system health. It is rather expensive for a 28 day supply, but perhaps worth it if you're looking to regenerate some damaged nails or skin.",340941,19911
4.0,1630412671682,More than just a protein,"What I like about this particular brand of protein powder, is that it can operate as more than just a post workout recovery drink, and do double duty as a meal replacement as well. A couple of years back, I had some surgical procedures in my mouth as a result of some receding gum lines, that required gum grafts. That really is as unpleasant as it sounds. I mentioned that, because at the time it was difficult to eat solid foods for a while, so I was more or less on a liquid diet. I would very much like to have had this protein at that time, as a meal replacement because I feel it would have done a very good job of offering a good overall nutritional value. In this case, I have been using it as a post workout recovery drink. For that purpose, it works very well too. I do fairly high impact resistance training, so by the end of it I'm spent. My muscles certainly benefit from post workout recovery drinks that are protein rich, and will encourage muscle regeneration and synthesis. I found that this protein did nicely at helping me recover from my workouts. I have had the opportunity of trying the vanilla flavored one as well, and I think I actually prefer that one to the chocolate. My wife on the other hand, very much prefers the chocolate. So, I guess you can see that it's obviously going to be subjective. I personally found the chocolate to be a little sweet for my taste. So it's no surprise that my wife liked it, because she has quite the sweet tooth. I did find it to have just a touch of a grainy texture, but certainly nowhere near as bad as others that I have tried. I use a ninja blender that has a smoothie attachment, and that thing does a pretty incredible job of pulverizing the powder. I make my shakes very simply by just adding ice and water, with a couple scoops of this protein powder. As far as the ratios of how much water to powder I use, I usually experiment with that and don't pay much attention to the recommendations by the manufacturer. Personally, I prefer to dilute it a little bit in more water, as I find that makes for a more pleasant drink. All in all, I do like the fact that it has a good nutritional balance of fibers, vitamins, and minerals, as well as the protein content. Like I mentioned, when I had my surgery, it would have been nice to have had this as an option as well as the Ensure drinks that I was always having. I think it's a fine option, and I would recommend it.",340941,2972
4.0,1630412039412,Good healthy ingredients,"I have to say that I was fairly impressed with the quality of this protein powder. I find the ingredients to be very impressive. I do like protein powders to be nicely flavored, but I'm always very skeptical of ones that are too tasty. If they taste more like Hershey shake for example, versus a chocolate protein shake, then you know they're heavily laden with sugar, and other additives that bring down the quality of the protein powder itself. This vanilla flavor one I found very nicely flavored. It wasn't too sweet at all. I'm not too sure that I like the recommendations on how much powder to add to how much water however. 10 to 12 ounces of water with two scoops of this protein powder, is in my opinion not enough water. I use a ninja blender, that has a smoothie attachment, and so I just measured water by eye, more or less, but I could tell you for sure I put probably closer to 16 to 20 ounces of water. I just like to water it down a bit, as I found for my personal taste, it was more pleasant that way and went down smoother. The taste is subtle and nice, especially when diluted, like I did. I use it as a post workout drink, to help my muscles recover from resistance training that I do five to six times a week. I found it very adequate as far as a post workout recovery drink, and on par with other whey proteins that I would routinely use. I mean, you have to take that with a bit of a grain of salt, because it's hard to anecdotally quantify the results in comparison, but I can say that I hardly notice the difference between this and your name brand whey proteins. I didn't try it for cooking or anything like that, but I know that these powders can be used in many different recipes for baking protein rich snacks. All in all, I found that it was a nice quality protein, that certainly fit the bill, and did the job for me and my needs. I found it very easy to take down, and light on my stomach. For all these reasons, I would certainly recommend it.",340941,64

My father is still very much lucid, but struggles from time to time with remembering details, as well as short term memory issues. I actually had him try Braini for 30 days, and he had experienced some very promising improvements. His memory, as well as his focus had certainly improved. For him, that was something that also translated into an improved mood. That's because his frustrations from forgetting things, could often lead to aggravation. When I saw that there was another opportunity to order more capsules from Braini, I jumped at the opportunity, because I wanted him to continue taking it for longer than just 30 days. He continued to take Braini, and saw an even greater improvement in his abilities for recall, as well as communicating his thoughts without having to search for ideas. Basically, he did notice a positive impact to his cognitive ability, more so after continuing then even during his first 30 day trial. I personally, I'm very pleased with these results, and I know for him, who is going through health issues, something that can improve his cognitive abilities has increased his quality of life. For this, I am thrilled about it. I know he's happy with it too, because he says it to me directly. Based on his and my own experience with brainy products, I do highly recommend them.",340941,9431
4.0,1629665506549,It helps,"I have tried several products from Braini already myself personally, and have found them to be very good as far as the results that they provide. I have been able to improve my cognitive function, focus and attention, as well as my memory over the timeframe that I took it. With this particular supplement, I was actually interested in having my father test it. My father is now 80 years old, and oftentimes repeats himself, and has trouble with his memory. This of course is a factor of aging, so I wanted to see if Braini would be able to help him out with this problem that frustrates him. My father is certainly no stranger to taking pills, as he does so for his heart condition, diabetes, and as of late, cancer. Certainly, he has been going through some difficult health issues, so I thought perhaps he might be pleased by improved cognitive function. After taking the entirety of the bottle, and speaking with him regularly throughout, I noticed as well as he did, that his memory had actually improved a fair bit. He was a lot less likely to repeat himself, though he still did repeat himself from time to time. I would say though, that the frequency of him forgetting things, had been lessened. I hesitate to say anything definitively, because this isn't some sort of controlled clinical test. My experience here, and my father's experience, are entirely anecdotal, but that being considered, it was a positive experience. I think I would consider reordering this, and having my father continue it, to see whether or not his brain function could improve even further, or at the very least maintain the improvement that he already achieved. I know that for him personally, with all the frustrations that he has been facing lately with his health issues, the fact that we can speak without him having to repeat himself as much, or forget what it was that he was going to say, has been a great relief for him. For this reason, I do recommend giving it a try.",340941,589
4.0,1629664855967,It does work,"I wanted to give this supplement a try, to see if I could improve my focus and attention, as well as cognitive abilities over the time frame that I was using it. I used Briani for the 30 day cycle, and after that time frame, I would say that I've noticed a decent improvement in my cognitive function. I think for myself personally, the issues that I always wanted to have sort of rectified, or at least a little bit of help with, are in my ability to maintain my focus and attention, as well as my memory. Oftentimes, I find that I'm forgetting things, and being that there is a history of dementia in my family, I sometimes fear that these may be signs at a younger age, that perhaps I may be in line for this terrible disease. Any type of improvement in my memory and cognitive function, is something that I'm very interested in, and will indulge in. The powder doesn't really dissolve the best if you just take it with a spoon, and mix it with water. I also wasn't a great fan of the taste. I began mixing it in with my smoothies that I have every day, and that was a big help. Primarily because the blender would make mincemeat of it, and mix it in without issue, and secondarily because I didn't really notice the taste afterwards. I didn't find that the powder taste affected my smoothie. I often sit and require attention with the work that I do, as well as good memory. Even though, I don't have baseline tests or anything to that effect that I can point to to give you qualified results, I can tell you anecdotally, that I certainly felt more focused, and better memory towards the end of my 30 days. I have to say, I was relatively surprised by that. It is an expensive product, but if it provides good results like the ones that I feel I achieved, it's well worth it. I know that my experience was positive, and so I can recommend it for a trial if you are someone who wants to improve their cognitive function as well.",340941,16499
5.0,1629487393242,Good pre and post workout,"There was a period of time where I pretty much stopped working out. For me that's unusual because I've been working out since I was 16 years old and I'm now in my early 40s. I always like to keep in good shape and these days concentrate on achieving a good physical condition to keep my health as a priority. I took an 8 month hiatus from working out, for no particularly good reason really. Needless to say, when restarting, it's always challenging at the beginning, but I'm glad that I did. After working out for about a month, and slowly working my body into the stress of physical training, I decided to get some supplements in order to help my now 42 year old body generate muscle mass. Along with other supplements such as protein, and oftentimes a pre workout drink, I decided to take the BCAA, to help me develop muscle mass and break certain plateaus of my training. I was pretty pleased with how I was able to achieve good gains in a reasonable amount of time, and I feel very strongly that the BCAA did a good job at helping me recover and build muscle mass. I would take two before workouts, two after my workout, and two with dinner. In the month that I used it, I did notice significant gains in muscle mass, as well as shorter recovery times. It's not a miracle worker by any means, but it does give you a nice edge to help with your training. My experience with it was very positive, and so I would recommend it if you're somebody who's looking to improve their muscle mass.",340941,2982
4.0,1627331764446,Amazing energy booster,I started lifting weights again in March 2021. I’ve been working out without taking anything as a pre workout. I just drink a protein shake after a workout. I decided to try this creatine because there are days that I feel weak and I have a hard time pushing hard for 45 minutes straight. I never thought that this would actually help. I am impressed by the energy boost I get right after I drink this. The flavor is delicious and it dilutes extremely well. I like to add a few ice cubes after I blend the powder in 8oz of water. This is perfect if you are lifting weights. I often feel fatigued on day 4 of training and this has been the key to keep me going!! I really recommend it.,340941,3364
5.0,1623856763147,Works fine,"I consider immunity boosting supplements a very necessary part of my daily routine. I decided to try these immunity boosters as I have never tried any that come from goat milk. I always take my supplements either first thing in the morning, or a hand full before bed. There have only been a few rare occasions where I have experienced any sort of stomach discomfort from taking supplements, but these ones do not apply to that at all. So to clarify, I did not have any sort of stomach disagreement from taking these immunity boosters.  I think we should all recognize how important keeping your immune system nice and healthy is especially in today's day and age and for obvious reasons that I don't think need repeating. Clearly if you are someone who is interested in immunity boosters, the chances are that you are thinking along the same lines as I am. I did find the product to be a little expensive or rather on the expensive side , but I also feel that it's working to operate preventatively in order to maintain good health. So from that perspective it's easy to justify the expense. As I have been taking immunity boosting supplements for a long while now, I don't really know how to quantify the results of these, but I will say that I do feel in good health and have had no issues whatsoever. All in all, I would certainly recommend giving them a try. They worked extremely well in helping to maintain my immunity health.",340941,2135
5.0,1615321300588,important supplement,"I've been supplementing like crazy quite a bit over the last little while for obvious reasons. One of the most important supplements that I take is vitamin D, and D3 is certainly a part of that routine. 5000iu is definitely an excellent amount to be taking on a daily basis. These tablets are small and easy to swallow I have had absolutely no irritation or side effects from taking them. I think it's very important especially nowadays, to consider supplementation as part of your daily routine, and taking vitamin D is definitely going to be at the top of that list. That's even more true, if you live somewhere where Winter tends to take away the sunlight. With 5000 IU's per tablet, and 180 tablets  per bottle, you're good for 6 months with this bottle.  I think it's an expense that's well worth it, and very reasonably priced in my opinion. I know that for my intentions, and certainly wanting to stay healthy, vitamin D is going to remain as part of my routine. I highly recommend people decide to take vitamin D for themselves, especially if you live up north. I actually happen to live in the tropical South, but I still take vitamin D daily. So for the obvious health benefits, and the mood elevating properties, I would highly recommend taking this Vitamin D supplement.",340941,1619
5.0,1612453693729,Added protection,"With new variants of Covid evolving lately, the new advisory is to look for kn95 masks, or double mask.  These slip in filters can certainly help in adding layers under your existing mask, and if you have a mask that accommodates filters, then perhaps doubling or tripling up on these filters is a good idea.  Otherwise you can even simply put one of these under your existing mask.  Now I haven't done that as I do have a mask that accommodates filters, so I don't know how well it would stay put loosely under a mask, but for ones that take filters it seems to fit well for me.  They seem to be good quality from the look and feel, and a necessary tool for todays day and age.  They also represent pretty good value at 30 for under 10 bucks.  I do recommend them, and hope that everyone wears a mask. It's just common sense, which I guess isn't often so common.",340941,215
5.0,1603028658801,works great for sleep,"Ever since I was a kid, and I am in my 40's now, I have been sleeping with ear plugs.  It started because of my father, who snored so loud that he could drown out a passing Harley Davidson.  Since then, I simply cannot sleep without them, as I like the area where I sleep to be quiet and dark.  I often reuse my earplugs night after night, as buying a fresh pair for every night can get expensive, and honestly most earplugs that I have used are good for a long while.  These are no exception, and I have gotten a few weeks out of them so far, and still going.  they do lose a little bit of effectiveness over time, but not that much at all.  They have a nice bounce back and do well to block out external noises. They are quite comfortable in the ear, and easy to sleep with.  If you are like me and need a quiet environment to catch some z's, then you'll need a pair of these for that good night sleep.",340941,1363
4.0,1667190765886,It's OK,"I got the Medium version of this and it works pretty well from a resistance standpoint. It definitely provides some resistance and works well to exercise your hand or fingers. I recently had trigger finger surgery and have been told that I need to move my fingers a lot to help with the rehab. This putty works as well as the other resistance devices I have so I'm happy with it from that standpoint. It offers plenty of resistance so I don't know that I could handle the Firm version of this. It doesn't have a discernable odor but it is a bit oily feeling while you're using it. However, after I put it away I don't feel like I have to wipe anything off my hands so I guess whatever the oily feeling is absorbs well.",340943,165
4.0,1661124465593,Feels Nice On The Neck,"This device gives you two forms of therapy for neck pain - heat and 630nm red light penetration. It warms up quite quickly and I can say that the heat feels very nice against my skin. With temps ranging from 101 to 113 degrees with an in-between 106 in the middle, you can find a heat setting that you like. You turn it on by short pressing the power button, which starts it in level 2 (106 degrees). Subsequent presses go to level 3 then back to 1 and so on. It turns off with a long press. The neck band consists of three sections that are hinged and the band fits comfortably on my neck (size 16) and there's still quite a bit of room left for larger necks. I like that the red light chips go all around the band, almost to the ends, so your neck is basically surrounded by the heat. I like that. On top of the band there is an indicator that glows with the heat level number so there's no guesswork as to the level you're at. It comes with decent instructions and a charging cord. Unfortunately, like most devices these days, no charging brick is supplied.<br /><br />Overall, I like this neck heater pretty well. The heat relieves the pain I sometimes feel in long computer sessions and the lightweight band is easy to keep handy for those times.",340943,2085
2.0,1657165105969,Just So-So,"I'll say this much for this shaver: it's very compact and thus works well for travel or keeping in the car for a quick touch-up. However, the motor is quite weak and on my face seemed to pull, leading to an uncomfortable feeling and some irritation. The pop-up trimmer works pretty well on my sideburns - no irritation there. Overall though, this shaver doesn't give an overall comfortable or very close shave for me on my whole face. Perhaps it's ok for a quick touch-up on small areas. It comes with a cleaning brush, a head cover, a travel bag, and a USB cord for charging. My overall rating - I don't think this underpowered shaver is worth the price charged.",340943,2098
5.0,1655247903736,Very Nice Lemon Oil,"I had never tried the US Organic brand before so I was anxious to try it. I love lemon oil and this is a very good one. Out of the bottle it has a wonderful strong pure lemon scent. I put a few drops in one of my diffusers and it filled the room with a nice lemon scent in short order. Since it's a very concentrated oil you don't need many drops in the diffuser.<br /><br />This essential oil comes in a 1 ounce amber glass bottle (30ml), which is 3x larger than the typical 10ml bottles of essential oil. It has a Euro dropper top for easy dispensing. I particularly like that it is certified organic. It's on the pricy side compared to others but it's a very nice oil and you get quite a bit of it. I recommend this very nice lemon essential oil. Enjoy!",340943,40
4.0,1638854206737,Works Well On Sore Neck,My neck often gets sore when I have long computer work sessions. But since I've been using this after these sessions I've gotten some good pain relief with it. I've found the middle height works best for me. I plan to keep using this regularly.,340943,100
4.0,1627776261753,Cooling Topical Cream,"This pain relief cream goes on very smoothly and a little goes a long way, so use sparingly. When I applied it to my aching wrist tendonitis flareup, I felt an immediate cooling sensation but not much else. After I few minutes, though, I noticed that the pain in my wrist had lessened some and the tendon seemed to ease up a bit. It's not magic but it seems to help some. The camphor and menthol smell appropriately medicinal, and the odor is helped along by peppermint, eucalyptus, and some other things. With the 2 for 1 deal and $5 off coupon that is currently available, it seems like a good value if you like camphor/menthol products.",340943,25719
4.0,1625519588455,Nice Specialty Bandages,"Often in sets of bandages you don't get the butterfly (knuckle) or fingertip ones, or only a couple of each. This set can make up for that shortfall by giving plenty of each. The packaging of these is really nice. In the box, you get two smaller boxes. Each one has 26 knuckle and 24 fingertip bandages.<br /><br />Each fabric bandage does the job it's intended for.  I like that they have adhesive on all 4 sides of the nonstick pads. The fingertip bandage fits nicely and securely on its intended location. The knuckle bandage has long legs to fit around the finger and hold the bandage on the knuckle. The photo shows the fit of both. Since these are fabric bandages, they're not waterproof.<br /><br />This is a good set of bandages to add to your first aid kit around the house or car. You may not need this shape often, but when you do, you do!",340943,194
4.0,1622087161162,Compact Panel Format Red Light Therapy Lamp,"There are quite a few red light therapy lamps on the market these days. Most are packaged in a lamp format with a screw-in red light bulb. This one is in a compact panel format that can be powered directly from a USB port. The panel has 18 LEDs: 3 630, 6 660 and 9 850nm wavelengths. When turned on, only half of the LEDs appear well-lit. That is because the 850nm light is nearly invisible. The compact size makes it ideal for travel.<br /><br />The light from this lamp feels really great on my sore neck and lower back after hours sitting up working on my computer. It doesn't feel warm at first but when you train it on a body part, you feel the heat penetration pretty quickly. An adjustable stand is included that allows varying the angle.  The angle is fairly adjustable over a range of almost vertical to about 45 degrees. Of course you can use it off the stand as well. The panel has an on/off switch on its body and the cord has a timer control switch. The control is on the cord is a bit odd. When you first turn it on it is on the 5 minute setting and it flashes 12 times before turning the lamp on. Pushing it a second and third time  sets the timer to 15 or 30 minutes. The cord is fairly long for flexibility of placement. There are no different intensities, so this panel is pretty simple. A carrying case and power plug are included.<br /><br />There are no instructions included aside from a few printed directions on the cardboard box it comes in. I think a product such as this should come with instructions that explain its use and any safety warnings/issues that may arise. Aside from that I find this a nice device. It seems built well, it works well, and the LEDs should last a long time.",340943,607
3.0,1614661867998,OK Sound Machine - with some flaws,"Unlike a lot of sound machines, this one is rechargeable and can operate without a cord. That's a good thing because the charging port is located underneath the unit and the unit cannot stand up when the supplied USB-C charging cord is attached. The vendor really should have supplied a right-angle cable to fix this. At any rate, the sounds supplied with this unit are pretty good. There are 6 of them - forest, thunder, white noise, waves, wind, and campfire. Unfortunately, they're fairly repetitive on a pretty short cycle and you hear the pause as the cycle repeats. This is somewhat annoying. Other sound machines either blend the cycles or randomize them. There is a timer function that can be set in 20 minute increments up to 2 hours or you can run the unit continuously. There is a volume control but I couldn't tell how many volume levels it has. It goes from very soft to quite loud. The lights on the front can either be turned off or set to illuminate either 1,3,or 6 of them. When on, the lights ""breathe"" - go on or off. I don't want moving lights when I'm trying to sleep so I recommend turning them off.<br /><br />So I rate this sound machine as just ok. The sounds are nice but the cycles are too short. The best features are the rechargeability and the very compact size, which makes it great for travel.",340943,7
5.0,1608001830907,Really Strong Stuff...,"... but it works! It has a really strong smell that lingers. It smells of tea tree, eucalyptus, and peppermint predominantly. I happen to like those smells so this stuff works for me. It's far better than foot odor in my opinion and I like the fact that it lasts awhile. I use it on my feet after exercise and it works right away. After spraying it in my shoes and letting it dry, it completely replaced the bad odor with those of the oils.

The hair trimmer has an adjustable guard so it can be used on multiple areas if you're so inclined.  Included are a USB charging cord and a cleaning brush. This is a good instrument at a good price. It works well and I recommend it.",340943,22987
5.0,1606970377739,Very Nice Heated Pad,"This heating pad is a bit different than typical ones in a couple of ways. First, it's weighted a little bit, but not too much. That helps the heating elements stay a little closer to the area you're applying heat to and makes it more effective. Second, the cord, at over 7 feet, is longer than most and gives some extra flexibility. The pad is very generously sized at 1x2 feet so it can soothe relatively large areas. The outer cover is a very soft, plush material that feels great against the skin. It's simple to operate  - press the Power button to turn it on and then click the Heat button to cycle through the 6 heat settings. The instructions say it turns off automatically after 2 hours. I wish the instructions said what temperatures each of the heat settings is, but it goes from quite low to more heat than I can stand. I like the 4th setting best. The pad heats up quickly and feels very soothing. I like it a lot and I recommend it.",340943,2525
5.0,1599598249908,Well Designed Halloween Party Kit,"This is a very well thought out collection of decorations for a Halloween party or to decorate a small space like an entryway for the big night. The kit comes with all the components described and pictured in the product description. Everything is individually packaged so you can use what you want without affecting or needing to unpack the other items. The quality seems typical for party favors: paper for the garlands and circle dots, latex and mylar for the balloons. A helpful touch is the inclusion of glue dots for hanging up any of the items. We normally go very big for Halloween but will scale it down this year so this set will serve handily for that purpose. This is a nice set and is a good value.",340943,108

I have been wearing the soft foam plugs, but when I saw these, I was eager to give them a try.  They looked perfect!<br />However, I was disappointed at their sound blocking abilities. The foam plugs do a much better job of blocking noise.  Even with these earplugs in, I still had to plug my ears with my fingers to block out loud sounds.<br /><br />Though they don’t do a good job of blocking sound, they are fairly comfortable and they stay in my ears much better than the foam plugs.  They’re also waterproof and come in a handy carrying case (though they get stuck in the case, making it hard to open or close).<br /><br />However, my main reason for wearing earplugs all the time is to block sound, and these fail at that, so I can’t give them more than three stars. It seems like I just cannot get a good seal with them  inside my ear canal.  If I could, perhaps they’d do a better job of blocking sound.<br />Also, they’re very OBVIOUS. They’re not very low profile and the bright colors make them quite noticeable.

Overall, it's not a bad product but could use a little improvement.<br /><br />The ""sponges"" are actually more like sheets. They reminded me of sheets of felt. They really did.<br /><br />The sheets already have soap on them, you just add water. It doesn't take a lot of water to work them into a lather. I wadded the sheet up in my hand and added probably 2 ounces (maybe 3) of water and the ""sponge"" got very soapy.<br /><br />The problem is if you are planning to use these for a full body wash you will need to use more then 1. It really depends on your body size & how ""dirty"" you may be.<br /><br />The soap in / on them was non-irritating to my super sensitive skin. That was nice.",340976,471

The toilet paper roll is just thinner then a normal roll would be and it has a rougher texture. It feels more like writing paper then actual toilet paper you would wipe your butt on.<br /><br />I mean you could actually use it for that if you wanted, I guess. I don't see why not. It may be not be as pleasant as your regular brand.<br /><br />I just like it because it's something cute & funny to help celebrate a special day. I'm pretty sure my boyfriend will just keep his as a sort of keepsake.<br /><br />According to the box this gag gift toilet paper was designed in the USA but made in  China.",340976,1803

They also don't leave behind lint.<br /><br />I'm enjoying making my own various kinds of wipes using them. I've made hand sanitizing wipes using Isopropyl Alcohol. Then I store them in a canister (as shown in my photo). I've also made cleaning wipes using original Pine-Sol and water.<br /><br />These wipes are great for scrubbing because they don't fall apart and after they are dirty I just throw them away.

Not my favorite but as you use the product you really don't notice the scent, I didn't.<br /><br />I tried it on my lips and then on my real problem spots ... my elbows.<br /><br />I have really dry cracked elbows with pieces of dry cracked skin sticking up. That's from me using my elbows to prop myself up in bed and read at night. My elbows really hurt when my bedsheets or any other cloth rubs against them. They are in bad shape or they were until I started applying this product.<br /><br />This petroleum jelly has a thinner consistency then the name brand but I really think it works better then the name brand. I tried the name brand product on my elbows but it didn't help like I expected it too. I think this products thinner consistency helps it to be absorbed into the skin better.<br /><br />After applying this product to my elbows for 3 nights, the rough hard pieces of skin on my elbows soften up and layed down.<br /><br />Plus this petroleum jelly is less greasy then the name brand. It doesn't leave greasy stained spots on my bedding or clothes.<br /><br />The only issue is the jars blue lid comes off way to easily.

I used it on my countertop and to clean my stainless steel double sink.<br /><br />It removed the food spills off my countertop easily enough, leaving behind a faint Orange scent.<br /><br />The sink was a little harder, it had a white film on some of the stainless steel from dish liquid and various food / drink leftover build up.

I needed to move the trimmer inside my nose repeatedly to trim the long hairs that I could see, taking longer than it normally takes me to trim the hairs. When I was done, I cleaned this trimmer under running water.<br />note: I could not remove any parts of the nose hair trimmer.<br /><br />The round shave trimmer gave a decent shave (I shave multiple times a week), but it took longer to shave my face than it did when using my preferred razor. When I felt my face after shaving, I didn't get as close a shave as I'd like.<br /><br />The hair trimming blade, with options for 2.0 mm and 6.0 mm, gave a good cut that I liked. This was my favorite of the three blades.<br /><br />Of the 3 blades, the nose hair trimmer makes the least noise, while the hair trimmer makes the most noise. I did not find this trimmer to be too noisy.<br /><br />Lastly, the user manual has detailed illustrations; but, the text instructions were a bit confusing.

It spreads well as I applied it to various areas of my body.<br />I make sure, when I am applying this, to spread just a thin layer.<br />note: on my skin, the dead skin cells will slough off; if I put on too much petroleum jelly, it makes it harder for the cells to slough off, and will also trap dirt/debris/bacteria.<br /><br />On the product description page, the 2nd picture at the upper right left side (2nd picture out of 7 pictures) states, ""..tested and approved by dermatologists...""; however, I examined the label on the front and on the back of the jar, and did not see any mention of this.

I am fine wearing these 3-ply masks as is, and have not bought filters to put inside the slot.<br /><br />I like that the bottom part of the mask has a extension such that the mask goes under my chin.<br /><br />The mesh helps prolong the life of these masks during repeated washings.<br /><br />There are a number of laundry symbols on the back of the resealable bag. Here's how I interpreted the symbols:<br />wash in water temperatures not above 30 degrees, do not bleach, do not tumble dry, iron any temperature - steam, any solvent.<br /><br />On the back of the resealable bag, there are confusing instructions, such  as ""...wash the poison once a day, wash it with warm water first, then bot and hot to dry...""<br />The instruction to wash in warm water is in contrast with the laundry symbol that I interpreted above, ""wash in water temperatures not above 30 degrees"".<br /><br />Overall, I like how well this mask fits my face from the bridge of my nose to under my chin.",340977,713

But unfortunately, this straightener is mediocre. I have medium thick hair that’s not dyed and it’s wavy so it’s not really a chore to get straight. However, this straightener didn’t work well in straightening it. I did attempt to do the curls with the straightener and it semi-worked. They were more of waves than curls but again, my hair is naturally wavy, so I’d prefer that it curled it. I guess this would be better for thinner hair. I am a little bummed that this wasn’t better. I’ve used cheaper straighteners before that worked better than this. I’d say keep looking, unfortunately.",341038,638

I think these would would for a full flow as well, but I don't like wearing JUST a pad, but that is just my preference. I love all the cute designs too, although no one will see them. These are so much more comfortable than your average pad and don't have that awful, scratchy, sticky uncomfortable feel. These stay in place for me with a bikini cut or larger cut undergarment versus the smaller ones, but who wants to wear those smaller, cute undergarments that time of the month anyway?

No issues with it coiling itself.  Doesn't make noise when you are out in the wind, either.

This is a great value for your money! However, this is a Ginseng extract and not a root powder. This is why it is cheaper than other Red Ginseng products. It is believed that root powder is better than the extract. As for this particular Red Ginseng, please note:<br />1. Although it is called, ""Korean Panax Ginseng"" the bottle shows that ""Made In China"" so I am not sure about the quality. I had another Korean Red Ginseng, made from Korea (and it is root powder), and it was about $39.00 for 30 day serving. So there is a difference.<br />2. If you do not see any tangible difference, try ""Korean Black Ginseng"" (that is made from Korea). Black Ginseng is much much better than Red Ginseng. This is what I use every day.

5.0,1599337929644,Worth the try!,The powdered mixes easily and doesn't have a gritty mouthfeel. The Taste is amazingly good. Tastes exactly like the flavor suggest and it is really refreshing. I have been sipping this during my treadmill workouts. It seems to help with the energy to keep me going and finish. As far as the other claims go about Muscle Recovery. I cannot mention as I am really not into weights and lifting. For what I do it is definitely helping.,341142,5785
5.0,1597740026375,Creative Inventions,I've always wanted to test out the electric eyelash curler. It actually worked for curling my eyelashes. It heats up well without harming my eyelashes or eyelids. The eyelashes keep its structure for a long period of time. It is safe to use with mascara on before you hate your eyelashes. Always make sure your mascara is dried before you curl those lashes. It is so convenient that I can take it everywhere with me. It is simple and easy to use when you get the hang of it. I highly recommend.,341142,8368
4.0,1597376326913,Nutritional Benefits,I really enjoyed making the wheatgrass juice powder drink. The powder taste bitter if you put too much but it smells sweet. The powder has many benefits giving you more energy. Especially when you do not like eating your greens. This wheatgrass juice powder will give you all your vitamins and minerals in one glass.,341142,813
5.0,1645255270592,So comforting!!,"This pillow is so comforting!! I have a lot of anxiety and hugging this pillow makes me feel so relaxed. It's so soft and cozy and the vibration feels so nice. It's perfect for children or adults as a stim toy or just a source of stress relief. I also really like how the bumpy texture feels.<br />I do have one complaint: you have to be actively pressing the part that vibrates for it to work, so it's a bit annoying that it shuts off unless you're constantly hugging it tightly. It isn't a big problem, but it would be nicer if you could set it to stay on.",328178,2081
5.0,1644702769032,Great and super gift-able!!,These shower steamers would make an amazing gift. The packaging is really nice and you can smell them before even opening it.

Then once you get the  capsules down you are constantly and I mean constantly burping fish burps, gross! you have to take 3 of these capsules a day and with this only being a 60 capsule bottle this bottle won't even last you a month, it may be ok but I wouldn't want to be constantly purchasing this especially at $9.82 a bottle.  Lets also talk about them saying that this has a subtle lemon taste, no, there is no subtle lemon taste there is no lemon taste at all, not that I could tell.  Cannot recommend",341170,1741
2.0,1663566559851,Meek and Mild,Not sure that these are the right thing for cleaning the floor.  They don't seem to have enough power or enough smell.  I know for a fact that I would not buy them again because I had to empty the bucket I was using and refill it and use my normal cleaner and go back over my floors to get them clean.  There might be 60 sheets in the box but when you put 3 sheets in the bucket and it still doesn't work then that makes them not worth the money.,341170,2097
5.0,1663538665836,💜 Love the Lavender 💜,"So I got this one to try because I had the peppermint, Citrus and Lemongrass and loved them all and wanted to try others.  This Lavender scent is very nice and smells like you are standing in a huge field of lavender.  The pump action on these bottles is very smooth and the way you are able to lock the bottle neck is genius.  You get an 8 ounce bottle for a low $6.99 and the scent lasts a long time.  I love these and with continue to purchase this line in the future.",341170,559

I find it to be reliable for reading my blood pressure correctly, it may be off by a couple of points but not enough to make a significant difference.  It comes with a USB-C cord, a battery and a carrying case, the case is great if you decide to travel with it.  The cuff on this unit says it will fit just about anyone, nope I have a very big arm and it barely fit me.

5.0,1589911259716,"Good quality, not too bitter","This is a great supplement for lowering blood sugar and aiding digestion. You don't need to go to strange lengths to take it, it's not meant to taste like fruit. You don't need to hide it in smoothies or soup. Just add 1/4 tsp of this into a small cup of warm water 2 times a day and drink. It's not going to taste delicious, but it's really just like a slightly bitter tea.

The large is a little too baggy for me so I would have gone for a medium. These are great gloves, I recommend them.",341173,1515
5.0,1574614558444,Great liver support,"This is a great whole food source to help support both liver function and helps with insulin resistance. It's well-sourced and good quality, ready to use with foods in smoothies, soups, etc. I'm really happy with the quality and ease of use!",341173,13
5.0,1574532215142,Great Antioxidant food,"This is a great way to add antioxidants to your food! I prefer fresh, but it's not like I can find Acai berries at my local grocers!

This will mildly to moderately curb your appetite, more so if you aren't consuming a lot of foods that give you cravings for more, like sugar, refined carbs, high sodium or processed foods, etc. Food like that makes you lose touch with your body's natural signals, and it would take a pretty powerful (potentially dangerous) weight loss product to cut through that and still kill your appetite.",341209,28510

The vibrations feel intense, so much that they tickle my sensitive mouth and I have to keep my tongue out of the way. But then when I'm done, it doesn't feel like it cleaned all that well, which is confusing. I get a deeper clean just using my manual toothbrush. Also, the brush part is annoyingly small. It looks and feels sleek, and I like the wall mount it comes with, but it's just not for me.",341209,711
3.0,1614357195355,Beneficial but gross,It's very well packaged and has great eye appeal.  I love that they are a 100% plastic-free company! There is no added sugar (which is a huge plus). This is a very feel-good & good for you product.  The downside: it does not taste good at all! Be sure to add this to a smoothie or stronger drink. But it's so healthy that it wouldn't throw me off except that the package says “Delicious” & “chocolate fudge.”,341209,1556
4.0,1613965886349,Serious Caffeine,"It's just too much caffeine for me, which is not fault of the product. The ingredients are clearly listed on the container.

5.0,1604421880304,Crazy soft,"These are so soft I could cry! They feel absolutely amazing on the skin, and though it seems counterintuitive, they actually clean really well.<br />I definitely don't recommend using the water-only method for removing makeup. No matter what you are cleaning it with, your skin needs more than just water to really break the products down and cleanse the pores. I use these with the Ordinary's squalane oil cleanser, and they are the perfect pair.  They leave my skin fresh, glowing, squeaky clean, and soothed by the soft fabric.",341209,9752
4.0,1604069258739,It Actually Works,"I have invested a lot of money into a lot of disappointing weight loss products, so I expected no different from this one. I was surprised to be wrong!<br /><br />It really does help with energy and appetite suppression. While taking it, it is a lot easier for me to avoid snacking, and it helps me eat less at meals. It makes me feel more full, I guess? And the cravings are less.<br /><br />It is kind of strong, though. I made the mistake of taking two the first time I tried it, and it gave me dizziness, a headache, and some nausea. If you are well adjusted to stimulants like caffeine, you might not have the same problem. But I suggest starting out with just one to see how you react.<br /><br />I will also warn you, these give me really gross burps. And they keep coming all day. It's not that pleasant, but it's also not unique to this diet pill, and honestly it's worth it. For feeling more energized and less hungry, I feel like it's a fair trade off.",341209,2094

Do yourself a favor and either buy dailies or use Oxysept!!","For those not interested in my story, please scroll down and just read the 'solution' part.<br /><br />MY STORY & THOUGHTS ON CLEAR CARE:<br />Before I started using Clear Care, I was using Alcon's Opti-Free Replenish. I was one of those people who wanted to take the minimum amount of steps/time to clean my contacts (aka laziness). So naturally, when I first bought and used this product, I thought I was taking a big step in taking better care of my eyes. Watching the hydrogen peroxide bubble from the neutralizing disc made me think &#34;ooh yeah!! Now I get to experience CLEAN contacts that won't irritate my eyes after only a few hours of use!&#34; However, in reality, I still had to remove my contacts after 4-5 hours or have people think I smoke a lot of cannabis. Eventually, this made me think that perhaps I just have ultra sensitive eyes. After several visits to my optometrist, I've switched from monthlies to biweeklies to weekly contacts. However, still, same results with Clear Care. I thought oh well, I guess I'll just have to wear my glasses more often.<br /><br />About a month and a half ago, I ran out of Clear Care. No worries... just buy a new bottle right? Well, this time my experience was much different. I used the new bottle & case EXACTLY TWICE before I threw it in the trash. Those two times, the hydrogen peroxide did not fully neutralize and burned my right eye both times (of course I did not even attempt to put on my left contact after burning my right). Both times, I let the disc neutralize for at least 12.5 hours (to be exact, 12.5 hours the first time, and 28 hours the second).... well above the recommended 6 hours. I flushed my right eye for at least 20 minutes but I still felt the burn for hours.<br /><br />I immediately tried to contact Alcon to try to get a replacement neutralizing case/disc. I called them three times just to get put on hold for 30-40 minutes each time before I hung up. Then I contacted them through their website by filling out their complaint form, explaining everything that had happened. To be honest, I didn't expect an immediate response... I thought maybe a week later to respond was reasonable.... two weeks would be borderline acceptable. After the second week passed, I threw out the almost full bottle of Clear Care and new case/disc.<br /><br />Two days ago (which would be over a month and a half after I filed a complaint), I received an email from Alcon saying that they received my complaint and that I should not hesitate to contact them by phone/email with my concerns. LOL wow that's hilarious!!! I replied that the very least they should have done is send me a new neutralizing disc and that they need to check their quality control with their products. Yesterday I received their reply explaining different factors that would prohibit the hydrogen peroxide from neutralizing properly along with ~20 questions about my past incident (which were pretty much answered when I filled out the complaint form on their site... all they had to do was read). On top of that, they &#34;may request return of the solution with the cup & disc for evaluation.&#34; Again, this is over a month and a half after I filed a complaint and they have the nerve to assume that I would keep their POS product. Naturally, I politely told them to piss off. Ironically, it is because of their idiotic emails that encouraged me to write this review.<br /><br />SOLUTION:<br />During this whole ordeal, I put in a lot of research on cleaning contacts and eye care. The best solution obviously is to just get daily lenses, but that is a very expensive way to go.... especially if you wear your contacts every day. I know some people who wear their glasses most days and contacts only when they go out, so for them dailies are a viable option. For someone like me, who wears contacts at least 5 out of 7 days of the week, I highly recommend Oxysept. This is a product similar to Clear Care in that it uses a neutralizing hydrogen peroxide system to clean your contacts. The difference is the speed of neutralization. Clear Care neutralizes most of the peroxide in about 20 minutes. In other words, the peroxide will only effectively clean your contacts for about 20 minutes. You can witness this for yourself by seeing how it bubbles intensely right away and after 20 minutes the bubbles subsides. With Oxysept, peroxide neutralization is a much slower process, thus making it more efficient at disinfecting your lenses. However, there are a few things to keep in mind. Oxysept is not a one step process. You need to clean your contacts with a daily cleaner (Lobob SOF/PRO2 or Walgreens Extra Strength Daily Cleaner) and rinse with saline prior to disinfecting with Oxysept for at least 6 hours. And before your put on your contacts, you need to rinse them again with saline. Also, once a week you need to add a tablet of Ultrazyme to remove protein buildup from your lenses. This may sound like a lot of steps and a PITA (and it is at first), but trust me, it's VERY simple and the results are light years ahead of Clear Care.<br /><br />Like I said before, I used to only be able to wear my contacts for about 4-5 hours before my eyes become dry, irritated and red. Now after switching to Oxysept, I am able to wear them all day and even through the night when needed and I can truly feel the difference in the health of my eyes. I have yet to experience any irritation and on top of that, I am also able to extend the life of my contacts (I've been using the same weekly lenses for about 4 weeks now and they STILL feel like new).<br /><br />One more thing to keep in mind though... Because there are more products being used along with Oxysept (daily cleaner, saline and Ultrazyme), it is more expensive to use than Clear Care. However, because you only need 2 drops of daily cleaner per lens, and only use Ultrazyme once a week, they will last you for a long time.<br /><br />Bottom line...

Do yourself a favor and either buy dailies or use Oxysept!!","For those not interested in my story, please scroll down and just read the 'solution' part.<br /><br />MY STORY & THOUGHTS ON CLEAR CARE:<br />Before I started using Clear Care, I was using Alcon's Opti-Free Replenish. I was one of those people who wanted to take the minimum amount of steps/time to clean my contacts (aka laziness). So naturally, when I first bought and used this product, I thought I was taking a big step in taking better care of my eyes. Watching the hydrogen peroxide bubble from the neutralizing disc made me think &#34;ooh yeah!! Now I get to experience CLEAN contacts that won't irritate my eyes after only a few hours of use!&#34; However, in reality, I still had to remove my contacts after 4-5 hours or have people think I smoke a lot of cannabis. Eventually, this made me think that perhaps I just have ultra sensitive eyes. After several visits to my optometrist, I've switched from monthlies to biweeklies to weekly contacts. However, still, same results with Clear Care. I thought oh well, I guess I'll just have to wear my glasses more often.<br /><br />About a month and a half ago, I ran out of Clear Care. No worries... just buy a new bottle right? Well, this time my experience was much different. I used the new bottle & case EXACTLY TWICE before I threw it in the trash. Those two times, the hydrogen peroxide did not fully neutralize and burned my right eye both times (of course I did not even attempt to put on my left contact after burning my right). Both times, I let the disc neutralize for at least 12.5 hours (to be exact, 12.5 hours the first time, and 28 hours the second).... well above the recommended 6 hours. I flushed my right eye for at least 20 minutes but I still felt the burn for hours.<br /><br />I immediately tried to contact Alcon to try to get a replacement neutralizing case/disc. I called them three times just to get put on hold for 30-40 minutes each time before I hung up. Then I contacted them through their website by filling out their complaint form, explaining everything that had happened. To be honest, I didn't expect an immediate response... I thought maybe a week later to respond was reasonable.... two weeks would be borderline acceptable. After the second week passed, I threw out the almost full bottle of Clear Care and new case/disc.<br /><br />Two days ago (which would be over a month and a half after I filed a complaint), I received an email from Alcon saying that they received my complaint and that I should not hesitate to contact them by phone/email with my concerns. LOL wow that's hilarious!!! I replied that the very least they should have done is send me a new neutralizing disc and that they need to check their quality control with their products. Yesterday I received their reply explaining different factors that would prohibit the hydrogen peroxide from neutralizing properly along with ~20 questions about my past incident (which were pretty much answered when I filled out the complaint form on their site... all they had to do was read). On top of that, they &#34;may request return of the solution with the cup & disc for evaluation.&#34; Again, this is over a month and a half after I filed a complaint and they have the nerve to assume that I would keep their POS product. Naturally, I politely told them to piss off. Ironically, it is because of their idiotic emails that encouraged me to write this review.<br /><br />SOLUTION:<br />During this whole ordeal, I put in a lot of research on cleaning contacts and eye care. The best solution obviously is to just get daily lenses, but that is a very expensive way to go.... especially if you wear your contacts every day. I know some people who wear their glasses most days and contacts only when they go out, so for them dailies are a viable option. For someone like me, who wears contacts at least 5 out of 7 days of the week, I highly recommend Oxysept. This is a product similar to Clear Care in that it uses a neutralizing hydrogen peroxide system to clean your contacts. The difference is the speed of neutralization. Clear Care neutralizes most of the peroxide in about 20 minutes. In other words, the peroxide will only effectively clean your contacts for about 20 minutes. You can witness this for yourself by seeing how it bubbles intensely right away and after 20 minutes the bubbles subsides. With Oxysept, peroxide neutralization is a much slower process, thus making it more efficient at disinfecting your lenses. However, there are a few things to keep in mind. Oxysept is not a one step process. You need to clean your contacts with a daily cleaner (Lobob SOF/PRO2 or Walgreens Extra Strength Daily Cleaner) and rinse with saline prior to disinfecting with Oxysept for at least 6 hours. And before your put on your contacts, you need to rinse them again with saline. Also, once a week you need to add a tablet of Ultrazyme to remove protein buildup from your lenses. This may sound like a lot of steps and a PITA (and it is at first), but trust me, it's VERY simple and the results are light years ahead of Clear Care.<br /><br />Like I said before, I used to only be able to wear my contacts for about 4-5 hours before my eyes become dry, irritated and red. Now after switching to Oxysept, I am able to wear them all day and even through the night when needed and I can truly feel the difference in the health of my eyes. I have yet to experience any irritation and on top of that, I am also able to extend the life of my contacts (I've been using the same weekly lenses for about 4 weeks now and they STILL feel like new).<br /><br />One more thing to keep in mind though... Because there are more products being used along with Oxysept (daily cleaner, saline and Ultrazyme), it is more expensive to use than Clear Care. However, because you only need 2 drops of daily cleaner per lens, and only use Ultrazyme once a week, they will last you for a long time.<br /><br />Bottom line... If you care about your eyes, STAY AWAY FROM ALCON PRODUCTS",353795,396

I was expecting to get some with a design, so I am not really sure if you are supposed to get that or only black.<br /><br />You need to pull the tighten thing all the way to the end and then add the mask.  The clasps were a little hard to push, but if you just pull the string through, it went easier.  Make sure you are doing this and not just trying to put the loop over your head, as it does not go on that way and is way too small.<br /><br />I like that I can have my masks hanging now and not worry about just throwing them down.

I did not get much flavoring and tasted more of the coconut water flavoring than apple.  I even tried adding more and it was just the same.  I did not mind the taste, just not my favorite.<br /><br />My issue was the blendability.  I use the same type of shakers for every brand I use.  I do not use a ball and just water and ice.  This would not mix that well and I was left with a gritty texture when I was drinking it.  I did not like this aspect of it.

I was hoping to get past the smell while drinking it, but it turned me off from wanting to put this to my lips.  The flavor just needs improvement for me personally.<br /><br />I am giving this three stars though as it is a great concept.  My friend gave these to her husband and he enjoyed them.  I think this is going to be a personal taste preference if you like it or not.",160706,1102
4.0,1582132510814,Pretty Good,I like these.  It is hard to explain what the taste is like though.  I have tried the peanut butter chocolate ones and I do prefer those a little more than these.

It is a smaller dosage, but not something I personally love in my BCAA.  I drink these during my workouts.

I did not get much flavoring and tasted more of the coconut water flavoring than apple.  I even tried adding more and it was just the same.  I did not mind the taste, just not my favorite.<br /><br />My issue was the blendability.  I use the same type of shakers for every brand I use.  I do not use a ball and just water and ice.

However; I could not stand the flavor or aftertaste.  Also, do not smell this before you drink it as it smells horrible.  I was hoping to get past the smell while drinking it, but it turned me off from wanting to put this to my lips.  The flavor just needs improvement for me personally.<br /><br />I am giving this three stars though as it is a great concept.  My friend gave these to her husband and he enjoyed them.

5.0,1493675315000,Worth getting addicted to...especially if you like really Dark Chocolate,"I saw the words &#34;Dark Chocolate&#34; and I lit up.  For years now we have been enjoying the lower sugar and positive effects of dark chocolate, braving all the way up to a smooth and cool 90% cocoa -- That's right up there with baking chocolate.  I didn't let myself expect much from a commercially made probiotic, and maybe that has to do with my happy surprise. But let me start with the fact that the chocolate is 64% cocoa! Not bad, not bad at all for dark chocolate lovers.<br /><br />They are the size of a rounded quarter and have a firmness that allows them to be savored - they melt just like a piece of chocolate would. If you are a dark chocolate lover you will appreciate the slight tang and less syrupy sweetness that accompanies milk chocolate. These are really pleasing and they tout that their flora survives our stomach acid 100X better!  It took me 4 days, to notice the shift. My roommate took 10 but we both commented on the absence of feeling bloated after dinner and the regularity that ensued (Okay I have to confess that I would often take one at lunch AND dinner)!<br /><br />These are NOT laxatives but candy bites that are packed with Probiotics or &#34;good bacteria&#34; the stomach needs to help digest our food and maintain a healthy balance of energy and fuel. So rather than feeling that your food takes hours to digest there is really a sense that things are more efficiently being broken down in the intestines. It's not an uncomfortable feeling at all (but could be if you over do them).<br /><br />They don't taste like they smell,  so don't dig your nose in and take a big whiff anticipating a nice rich chocolate smell...You won't. What matters is the flavor and the results both of which you will get.",160703,15

The metal legs were covered with something that looked like dried up boogers ( or a glue?) but I wasn’t able to remove it by scratching off with my finger nails. I tried dipping paper towel in water just to see the reaction to water, was it gonna soften or something but no, 0 result.  Then I saw these and decided to give them a try. I dipped in water and pressed hard... it was COMING OFF! It wasn’t the water, it was the wipe a d I could tell by the way it wS coming off. It wasn’t melting, it was sort off coming off in tiny chunks. Regular paper towel didn’t do anything, nada! I don’t know much about fibers and exactly were these made but they are thin yet VERY DENSE. You can literally wash it, rinse it and reuse it. I really think the density of the fibers is what gives them scrubbing power. I then sprayed my bathroom sink with a bathroom cleaner and used this to wipe off..OMG! I didn’t use anything to scrub like usual (scotch scrub sponge), I just wiped with this wipe which scrubbed the sink and absorbed cleaner at the same time leaving my sink looking clean and shiny after just a few wiping moves, seriously? I then went onto my kitchen cabinets that were ahem kinda due for a scrub... did great.<br /><br />The only downside is the packaging. It’s a plastic bag with a stack of large square towels. That’s it. It takes large space to lay flat and you need to keep it flat so it’s easier to remove one wipe at the time.

5.0,1600474853340,konjac sponge is the most natural and gentle exfoliant,"Konjac sponges are made out of konjac root, a porous root vegetable that grows in Asia. They work great to exfoliate the skin gently. When soaked in water, the konjac sponge becomes incredibly soft and almost feels slimy. Because of its texture, you can exfoliate every day. I have used konjac sponges for my babies too. These are six sponges in different colors, all infused with other ingredients:<br /><br />White - Pure konjac powder,<br />Black - Bamboo activated charcoal,<br />Yellow - Turmeric,<br />Dark pink - Red clay,<br />Green - Aloe vera,<br />Pink - Sakura (Cherry Blossom)<br /><br />Each sponge has a little string, which is very helpful to hang it dry. Out of the bag, these sponges are hard as a rock and need to be submerged in water for a couple of minutes. My other konjac sponge came with the instructions to microwave on high for 2 minutes to sanitize, but this brand doesn’t ask for that. After use, it’s important to rinse, squeeze out the water; your sponge will last longer and be cleaner. That should be routine with any washcloth, though, so this may be an unnecessary comment.<br /><br />These are great, I scrub my face EVERY DAY with my Red Clay konjac sponge, and my skin does not get irritated. They are recommended to change every two months, but I first have to see if they can live for two months.",399134,38624
5.0,1597682616561,Best for babies,"Dreft Newborn smells better than any other laundry soap in the world, period.<br />It’s gentle and doesn’t cause any skin irritation to my baby and her clothes smells amazing. It cleans the clothing well although for heavy stains from baby food I have to use dish soap to rinse the stain first. Honestly, no laundry soap I had a chance to try was able to wash the bibs without pretreating the stain first. I love this new packaging, it is very practical and I love that I don’t have to screw  dispenser cup back on, this version is a cartoon box and there is a insert for the cup on the top so it’s easier to just place the cup there. I keep my soap on the shelf above my kids reach so there is no safety concern. I am also very pleased to see more environmentally friendly packaging. I definitely appreciate the opportunity to preserve our planet for the sake of our children and grandchildren.",399134,483
5.0,1594154910743,Practical way to add protein to your diet (or your kids),"This protein powder has a consistency similar to almond flour. It dissolves quickly and completely, does not lump up at all. I mixed it with water and it’s practically flavorless. I mean, I can “taste” little something but it’s like a different tastes of water. I am adding to cookies and most of our food because my boy doesn’t want meat or beans so this is a good protein addition to his diet without fighting at a dining table. I am very happy with this product. I received this free of charge for the review but will definitely continue to buy. If this is offered on Amazon subscribe and save I will definitely add to my subscriptions. 👍",399134,11652
4.0,1587263443458,Tested positive before missed period but overpriced comparing to leading brand,"This pregnancy test by Natalist comes with detailed instructions and is easy to use. Pee on the stick, wait for couple minutes and read your results. 2 lines are pregnant even if the second line is less visible. Packaging is nice and discreet. Reason for star down is the price. I never heard of this brand before yet is costs more than leading brand. Clearblue early detection costs $8 for 2 tests or $15ish for 4. If I was buying unknown brand I would look for the cheaper price but if I was spending $16 I would buy Clearblue and get 4 tests instead 3. That being said, both Clearblue and this test tested positive before missed  period!!!",399135,38594
3.0,1581513960692,Seeds compressed into a bar - label states 13g carbs per bar NOT 3g as in product description,"These bars are made out of seeds, bunch of different seeds compressed into s bar. Similar to granola bar it can get a little messy but not as messy as granola. They are not too chewy considering it’s all seeds. I first had nutmeg and I could definitely tell there is coconut before reading the label. They are sweet but they are not sweet, it’s just the tease. They make me anticipate for more sweetness but it’s only 2g so it’s really just the hint. They do have 13grams of carbs though. Description here says 3g of carbs but the bar label says 13g of carbs. I don’t know which one is wrong. I am not overly impressed but I won’t dismiss these either. I suppose if I was following strict diet and these bars would fit in my diet plan I would get them but otherwise no.",399135,73
5.0,1578886617213,Big difference 😍,"This device is super easy to use. I have a lot of lashes but they need curling, I usually apply mascara on the top of the lashes then use traditional curler and apply mascare from the bottom up. This heated curler gives mu lashes different dimension, they are not as curled like with the regular curler but they are lifted and they look great, like there is a volume and the difference is big. I really what this little tool does! It has different heating options and it’s really easy to use, at first I felt uncomfortable about putting something hot by my eyes but now I realize that was silly. This is going to a main makeup bag where all the favs are.",399135,1105
5.0,1576027440252,I still have sensation in my hands! Great gloves with grippy surface,"I was afraid these gloves are going to be very thick and I will hate using them then probably completely void because I can’t get a good feel and I just never feel things are clean unless I get a good sensation in my hands. I hope this makes sense. However, these gloves are not one of those thick rubbery gloves that numb your sensation for touch. They are still thick and durable but feel more like a silicone then rubber and allow my hands and fingers to have a good sensation to touch. I have medium sized hands and M fits me well with a little extra room too. The fingers are not too long and the overall fit is very good. They are even decorated and have a little trim design around the hand opening. They are not too deep, see photo. They come about half way to my elbows. The palms and fingers are textured in a cute way and this allows for a better grip when holding something in a soapy water. I received 2 pairs, white with blue fingers and plain purple and both colors are cute if that matters.<br /><br />Bottom line, I always hated rubber gloves but I use these without dreading it,  it’s a first. Good pair of gloves.",399135,2149
5.0,1575587377328,Helps controlling anxiety,My husband is getting ready to go to Afghanistan and I have young babies so needless to say the stress is on! I spend night tossing and turning and worrying about him and also about how am I going to manage our babies being by myself for months at the time. I nurse our youngest so any sort of medication is out of the question.<br /><br />For those reasons I decided to try this stress relief supplement and I honestly think it works. I still have exact same worries and stressors but I sleep a bit better and overall dealing with everything feels a bit easier. It might be due to the simple fact I get more sleep and rest but ultimately it all goes back to taking this supplement.,399135,13

4.0,1576633173040,Too wide for my small hands but still nice!,"This octopus shape facial brush is a bit too wide for my small hands to get a good hold of it. I wish it came a little smaller in diameter as far as the handheld part goes. Other than that I really like this. I've used it in the shower to wash my face and it worked great and is waterproof. It's easy to clean after using and even comes with an extra brush head. I like that its rechargeable so no expensive batteries to replace. The bristles are soft and it does a great job exfoliating and deep cleansing. The first time I used it my face was a little sensitive afterwards but I used it again a few days later with lighter pressure and it was much better. All in all, I really like this but I would change the diameter of the handle if I could.",192265,313
4.0,1569213971336,Quality ingredients but the bag isn't very full.,"This fruit powder is actually pretty decent.

I feel like they could've packaged it in a much smaller bag since it's only about 1/3 full, giving the illusion that you get more for your money.

Normally, I would use my echo dot to play rain sound, but am trying to move away from internet dependent devices so I thought I would give this a go, but it's a big pass. You can't see any of the buttons in the dark to turn the thing on or off or adjust the volume, and I could have worked around that except that the sounds themselves are lousy. I tried what I thought was the rain sound, but it was more like the sound of water dripping over a crackling fireplace, none of the other sounds were any better and got on my nerves. Also, you get a voice notification of ""sound on"" or ""sound off"" but the words were pronounced strangely, don't get me wrong, I enjoy different accents, but this wasn't an accent I had an issue with, it was the whole pronunciation of the word ""sound"".",399150,202

Hopefully, it will grow on me over time, but I'm not counting on it. It is also a very messy toothpaste, though the upside to using charcoal toothpaste is that you can see to make sure every tooth gets properly brushed!

5.0,1589397676731,Cute! Fits snug. I ordered a small and I have a medium boot,"I measured my surgical boot from the last time ( it was indeed 16 inches tall by 8 inches around) so I knew that the tall boot cover would fit. My surgical boot from my right foot was a small last time, so I ordered the small for my boot I was getting on my left.<br /><br />I am out of surgery and got a medium boot, but this boot stretched out over it well. I did not even undo the Velcro because it fit like a glove. The only thing it doesn’t do is zip up all the way if you don’t pull it to the top and over your boot ending (the part closest to your knee). I did notice that if I did pull it over the boot and zip it up all the way, it would leave an indention on my leg.<br /><br />However, all of that to say the small size fit snug but well enough on my medium boot. I would say they are true to size, but I am happy with how the small fits on the medium. It just means it won’t be going anywhere no matter how much I move around.<br /><br />I am excited because my toes are covered and I feel much safer from whatever the weather outside wants to throw at my foot. Not to mention I’m not ruining the Velcro on my boot by it attaching to the dog hair on the couch. 😂😂",450139,59987
