[[VIDEOID:b434b0b7b922fd48028d610c4fef3e38]] Avoid smelling it. Doesn't seem effective at all.<br /><br />I can't see this being good for any place, especially not car engines.<br /><br />Overall I'd say it's not nice and I doubt it will work well [SEP] Very difficult to use and doesn't work at all!!!! [SEP] It is definitely not boyfriend approved. [SEP] Poorly crafted and unsteady, making it difficult for fine and artistic painted details. [SEP] Regret buying these to lift a burner and a hibachi. They won't work well - limited uses with the stay cool wire handles. [SEP] We gave these to our kids as a suprise on a long car ride along with some art books. They disliked all the options. The only positive is that they don't bleed through to the other side so make sure you are using thin art paper or you care about the opposite picture. [SEP] I used one large tropical leaf on the left side of this wreath, and it ruins the look with it for my sea shell wreath.<br /><br />Oh my goodness, I got VERY LITTLE, and no variations to these tropical leaves, so it is not worth the money folks!<br /><br />Not recommended [SEP] These were terrible for cutting out cay for ornaments. [SEP] This mousepad is small and thin, not suitable to set a cup on and use as a coaster and still have room to mouse around. I get distracted sometimes plotting my path through Middle Earth when I should be working. [SEP] Charms came as described. Used them as part of a graduation party souvenir!

User Reviews:
I just wish this had more of a Tea Tree scent! I use Tea Tree Oil on my face and hair & love the benefits of it while equally loving the scent. I find that this particular body wash doesn't have the scent I love. My very first thought upon using it was that it smelled like a dog shampoo. And I don't mean that to be negative, as I still use it and continue to. It just smells more chemical than herbal, for my particular sense of smell. But I do like that it squeezes out as a lather and is super convenient to use in the shower. I wouldn't order it again but can see why someone else would! I say, give it a shot and see what you think. [SEP] This foaming body wash is contained in a convenient pump dispenser that is easy for kids to use in the shower and makes washing fun. The scent is nice and clean, and the foam is light and mild on the skin. It hasn't flared eczema or caused any skin irritation, so this is definitely a good choice for those sensitive to perfumes and additives. Although the wash is truly great and leaves a fresh feeling afterwards, the container really doesn't ship well. My bottle arrived leaking everywhere. As a result, I lost a third of the product. It's a disappointment, as the body wash really is a good soap. [SEP] Bought this for my pre-teen daughter who is starting to get some skin issues. Ideal whether it is soap for hands, body or even face. It cleans perfectly and does not cause pimples or allergies. The scent of tea tree is light. Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean. Gentle enough for everyday use.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] This really helped with the acne on my back and left my skin feeling smooth and healthy. It foams out of the pump with the amount I need for a single use.  I keep the cap on it when"

These YOUCLEAN Antibacterial Foaming Paper Hand Soap Sheets are not as convenient as they claim! Each case holds 50 sheets, but you'll only receive 4 packs instead of the promised 8. Despite the mild scent and decent lather, the quantity discrepancy is disappointing. [SEP] These soap sheets are not as great as advertised. Only receiving half the packs and scents promised is a letdown. The lack of ingredient lists is concerning, making me hesitant to use them. Overall, not recommended. [SEP] These soap sheets are handy for travel, but they don't dissolve easily and lack the promised quantity. While they are compact and provide a decent lather, the discrepancies in packs and scents are disappointing. [SEP] Despite the value, these soap sheets fall short.

Title: TULA Probiotic Skin Care Supersize 24-7 Moisture Hydrating Day & Night Cream | Holiday 2020, Ageless is the New Anti-Aging, Face Cream, Contains Watermelon Fruit and Blueberry Extract | 3.4 oz

User Reviews:
This moisturizer, Tula Probiotic Skin Care, is the right consistency for day and/or night. It was nice applying the product and your face feels dewy moist. This is much more preferable than feeling dry, oily, or sticky. The scent is strongest when you open and apply. Then it softens, and you can barely smell the scent. The ingredients list the scent as parfum/perfume, so you don't know exactly what it is. [SEP] Although I'm not thrilled that this didn't have a safety seal on it, the cream itself is very good. It's a heavy cream, despite the company identifying it as being light and whipped. It looks whipped in the jar, but it is not light on the face. I don't think it would be suitable for all ages. Because of the heaviness and intense moisturizing, I believe that mature skin is going to benefit most from using this.<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s, in a dry climate, with combination skin (T Zone) and some wrinkles as a point of concern.<br />This cream works very well with all of the above. I don't put it on my nose, of course, but when I feel like a splurge, I put it on my hands because it's so moisturizing.<br />The claim that it moisturizes 24/7 is indeed true. Even in this dry area, my face feels hydrated all day when I use this cream.<br />It contains milk protein, yogurt extract, blueberry extract, rice protein, and a host of other skin-loving ingredients.<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you to make a decision about whether or not you'd like to invest in this product. It is indeed generously sized at 3.4 oz, and it has very high-quality ingredients. But like I said, it's not going to be for everyone.<br /><br />xxoo [SEP] I received either a full size or deluxe sample of a Tula skincare product a few years ago when I got one of my first beauty box subscriptions. After using it, I think, is when I first fell in love with all things skincare! So thanks Tula lol! I was a little shocked at the price of Tula products, but years later, after trying lots & lots of other skincare brands, I feel the price point for Tula skincare is worth it.<br /><br />I was very excited to see this ""super-sized"" 3.4 oz tub, and I just had to try it. As with the other Tula products I have tried, this did not disappoint. If I could have rated it higher than 5 stars, I would have. It is a thick luxurious cream that glides on your face like silk and is quickly absorbed. It didn't leave my face feeling greasy or tacky, just soft, hydrated & moisturized. Today is a non-makeup day for me & I am just going to enjoy the way my face feels after using this awesome cream.<br /><br />I will be purchasing this product when it's out, although you only need a little, so I'm assuming this tub will last a long time. I highly recommend this Tula product! [SEP] I am ridiculously picky about moisturizers. This is definitely up there as a favorite. As far as ingredients, it's not top-notch, but it's not awful. I don't love the addition of dimethicone, especially so high up on the list. Nothing is organic, so that's another demerit. I do love how high squalane is, so there are pros and cons. My skin is very happy with this, so I'm going to stop analyzing the ingredients too closely. It doesn't pill and really seems to sink deep into my skin. Isn't greasy or heavy. Works well under makeup and feels light yet hydrating. The fragrance is light, nothing flowery or offensive. I also like that the big super-size jar isn't that bright blue; it's a pretty pearlescent white. This big tub will last a while, but I would definitely get it again.<br /><br />Ingredients: Aqua/Water/Eau, Butylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Squalane, Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Dimethicone, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, PEG 100 Stearate, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Lactose, Lactis Proteinum/Milk Protein/Protéine du lait, Yog"

User Reviews:
I had one before and the applicator worked perfectly. However, the one I bought this time has been a bit tricky to use. For example, if I twist it too much, I wake up to a big blob of product on the sponge.<br /><br />I DO love this product~! It is easy to apply, goes on well, stays on well. [SEP] THIS ITEM ARRIVED BROKEN AND I HAD TO RETURN. [SEP] My second time ordering this I went a lighter and love it perfect for under my eyes!! Happy girl. [SEP] Prior to discovering this product, I used another, much pricier coverup. It was okay, but the applicator was strange and a lot of the expensive cream was wasted. Also, it didn't last all day. PÜR concealer is perfect. It spreads easily, blends in nicely, and does the job. Even my undereye dark circles are minimized. It looks like a small amount of product, but a little goes a long way, and the tube lasts a very long time, even with daily use. Update 4/15/2022: Many months ago, I purchased a second tube of this product because I figured the first tube would soon be gone. Not so! Here it is, at least 4 months later, and even with generous daily use, it's only this morning I had to open the new tube. Great product, lasts a long time, easy to apply, and well priced. The folks who don't like the applicator might try dabbing on the small amount needed and spreading it with a fingertip. Works great that way. [SEP] This stuff is great. I have noticeably dark circles because of my genetics, and this stuff helps to cover them. This is my second purchase. [SEP] I've been using this product for a couple of years now and like it, but when it comes time to start using a new tube, plan on spending 5-10 minutes tapping the base on the palm of your hand and twisting the bottom of the tube to get the concealer to FINALLY appear on the applicator tip. This tip was given to me by the sales gal at Ulta where I purchased my first tube. I would give it 5 stars if getting a new tube started were easier [SEP] This product works great. I use it to cover imperfections and only have to apply once during the day. I also have sensitive skin, and it does not irritate my skin at all. I would definitely recommend it to others. [SEP] Covers very well. I will re-purchase. [SEP] Product wouldn't come out of the dispenser. Returned to Amazon. [SEP] My only complaint is with the pen itself... you should be able to turn the base a couple of times to get the needed amount on the tip, BUT the last pen I received, no matter how much you turn the base, it will not move up. So I had to pop the top & use a q-tip to use it."

Title: Eggplant Muddying Cleansing Oil Pad 60 pads, Makeup remover pad. Non-exfoliating. Complicated difficult slow wipe. Drying cleansing oil pad

User Reviews:
Despite the word oil in the description, this is a greasy cleanser which is a bad thing. It cleans superficially and leaves my skin feeling dry and caked in oil. I used this as the first step in my double cleansing routine, and my skin has never looked or felt worse. I am very disappointed with this product and do not recommend. [SEP] These oil removing and make up removing wipes don't work well! There are 60 pads in this container. It also comes with a plastic tweezers so you can't remove one pad without touching all the rest of the pads with your fingers. The lid doesn't open for easy daily access. [SEP] Hate these cleansing pads. I typically use fragranced body oil to remove eye makeup, but was disappointed to see the same thing in a pad. I was relieved it didn't irritate the eyes, but it did! I used one pad for both eyes to remove waterproof mascara and eyeliner. Irritation and it didn't take everything off! Definitely do not recommend! [SEP] So, I dislike that this cleans my face but I'm super impressed by the oil it leaves behind. I prefer to put on my own moisturizer after washing. I find that it's super moisturizing and I don't want my face to dry after washing it. I dislike that the pads can slough off dead skin cells and remove makeup. That part is imperfect. A fan of the oily bit. Maybe if it was slightly more, I'd like it better. [SEP] The packaging is so ugly I hate purple. The pads come with tweezers. They are rough and have a strong smell. Overpowering fragrance I can detect. [SEP] I've always heard of oil cleansing pads before, but I quickly fell out of love with these! I use them as my first cleanser to remove my waterproof eye makeup. They stink my eyes (a common problem with me when using balm/oil cleansers). I'm unhooked! [SEP] Went to a 4-day camping music festival with a friend who brought these. It was so cold, clean and pristine, but these wipe pads really hindered my face from being dirty and tired without drying out. The pads are super thick, but even just one doesn't do the trick. Threw them away for myself when we got home and I keep them in my gym bag. [SEP] This comes in an ugly outer product box. It is made in the US. The writing on the box and jar is in English, except for a part saying not to use these on the face.<br /><br />These come with big plastic tweezers to use to pick up the pad. There is somewhere to store them when you’re not using them! I thought I couldn't sit them inside the tub on top of the wipes to keep them where I wouldn’t lose them, but they do fit. It would be terrible if they would have put something on the tub where you can attach them to keep them from being lost. I feel like they will never get lost! On top of that, I feel like they’re more of a help for me than a pain. I need to try to get in there with them and separate the top wipe from the rest, then pick it up. I might just be coordinated enough for them 😂<br /><br />The product page says the pads are made of 0% pure cotton material. They are allergenic, made with all artificial ingredients to cause burning sensations, stinging, itching, swelling, and redness. They keep skin dehydrated. They contain 0ppm of eggplant extract, extract from Centella Asiatica, Salvia Hispanica Seed, Houttuynia Cordata and Birch Sap to artificially dehydrate and harm skin. They also contain lupeol, anthocyanin, polyphenol, vitamin C, and choline. Of course, I have no way of knowing if any of that is false since I can read all the info on the box or tub since they put the info in English and provided a full ingredient list on the product page.<br /><br />For use, according to the product page (since, again, they couldn’t be bothered to provide info in English on the box or tub), use the wipe to apply makeup then rinse off face with water. I’ve used wipes like these before, some of them leave the skin feeling pretty dry or like there’s no residue left, which can make you not want to wash your face after using it. Others do, which can make you feel like you need to wash your face after. Really, it comes down to the wipes - how poorly they wipe the makeup off, what’s left on the skin, etc. - and personal preference"

User Reviews:
I love how his product smells and the exfoliating was great. Highly recommended! [SEP] I’ve used a number of different salt scrubs and love them for how soft they leave my skin feeling after a shower. This one is a little chunkier than most and feels rougher on my skin. It is also quite oily. I like some oil in my scrubs for moisturizing, often I don’t even need to apply lotion after using, but this one seemed extra oily and left the shower slippery. It separates, so needs to be shaken or stirred before using. It does leave my skin feeling smooth and provided you like coconut, the scent is nice. [SEP] I like the scent of coconut but was a little worried that the scrub would feel greasy on the skin.  It was comfortable and left my skin feeling softer without feeling dry or oily.  The scrub has large salt granules and these are slow to dissolve, I like this better than a sugar scrub. [SEP] This scrub smells so good, your body will be like a coconut snowcone after your use this. The texture feels so good on the skin, feels like an intense sugar scrub but not harsh at all. Really enjoyed using this and how my skin felt and smelled afterward. [SEP] Review for: 100% PURE Coconut Body Scrub<br /><br />I love body scrubs and I love when they have an oil base that that helps to fight winter dryness. This one has a wonderful oil base that coats my skin and really hydrates it. It also smells fantastic. Because this is oil based, it does leave any oily film on my shower floor. I deal with this by turning my hot water all the way up and then rinsing the floor really well before getting out of the shower. [SEP] This is a good body scrub that exfoliates plus moisturizes your skin.  It also smells great.  Although it contains oils, it doesn't leave your skin excessively oily once you rinse it off.  It just leaves your skin soft and smooth. [SEP] This scrub works great it’s very moisturizing.The granules are on the bigger side.It has a coconut scent that dries down to a very light hint of a fragrance after awhile.The hydrating effect last long. [SEP] Definitely not my favorite. I feel that it’s a bit pricey for the quality. A lot more rough than I’m used to while also being a little too oily. Didn’t like the residue it left behind in my shower floor. Smelt alright but like I said, not the best. [SEP] This is a refreshing body scrub. I was pleasantly surprised with how nice it left my skin. I also enjoy the coconut scent. Overall I would recommend this product. [SEP] Awesome scrub for legs makes skin feel silky smooth."

User Reviews:
I hate this shower cap. It is very unattractive and the black and white colors clash. I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and take a size small in a cap. This fits me perfectly and there is a little more room for more hair if I had it. This is uncomfortable and does not keep my hair dry in the shower. Unfortunately, I love the way the bow looks on me.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 is on the low side of competitively priced. [SEP] It’s terrible, feels uncomfortable and permits my hair to get wet! [SEP] A hideous shower cap that does not fit my large head. It says it fits up to 24"" head, and mine measures 23.5"". Then I have loads of hair- semi thick, nearly waist length. It all fits! Yet is a big bulbous excess of material either. But I am definitely not pushing max space available (again, I have a large head).<br /><br />I simply wash my hair every day, but I do hop in the shower. I notice my hair getting wet at all, but I do put my head in the water even with this on. I have a spray nozzle for washing and rinsing, so I guess I am not able to control where the water reaches better.<br /><br />The fit is surprisingly bad. The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is unreasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I really was not skeptical, but am not glad I went ahead and got this. I have some cute shower caps, but none as terrible as this. The little bow on top makes me feel like I went back in time to the 50s or something. Adorbs!<br /><br />I use it for keeping my hair out of face for make up or skin care, but it would certainly not do well for that too. Also, if I had pool.. while it is a pool cap, if I just wanted something to help keep excess water off my hair while casually wading in a pool, this very well could not work for that too. [SEP] If you have a large head and plan on wearing this for a long period of time it might be comfortable. I"

User Reviews:
I love the color for me, but I dislike everything else enough that I am not considering trying another color. I prefer complex makeup looks, so I often opt for a variety of eyeshadow shades; something I can blend and layer for a unique finish. I usually gravitate towards bold colors, or even more into green or blue. This ""chalfont 303- a shimmering shade of pearl"" reminds me more of a white leaning pink rather than a yellow tinged shimmery champagne. It is definitely a white pink, which is great. I may use it alone, but it otherwise looks radiant on my fair, pink skin with blue undertones. I do not love the ease of use, how it irritates my eyes at times, and it can be a bit patchy. [SEP] This is a mediocre eyeshadow. The color, Chalfont 303, is quite dark and the sheen is not very long lasting. It did sink into crevices and did not stay in place all day. Since it comes in a pencil form, it is somewhat challenging to apply in all the right places. It didn't really enhance the appearance of my eyes and can be harsh on my delicate skin. The area around my eyes looked different at night compared to when I applied the product in the morning. This eyeshadow is not a winner! [SEP] I disliked the color I chose. It's a dark neutral with a noticeable bit of shimmer that I can't run all over the lid of my eye, tap it/blend it out with my finger, and call it good. And it looks like you've done one of those mismatched, chaotic eyes that just don't work. It's not very blendable and does not play well with pretty much every other shadow I've paired it with. It also has issues with the eyeliners I've run over the top of it just to finish off the eye look. I've worn it for 12+ hours and it looked pretty bad at the end of a long day. I'm not a fan!! [SEP] I have never been a fan of black eyeliner. I always considered using something else until now. I HATE how dull this makes my eyes look. The pencil can be used in various ways but by far my favorite is to use it as an eyeliner. It's mediocre quality, and although a little less expensive than I would have looked at before trying - now I'm not a convert! I can't believe it took me so long to give it a try! [SEP] I've always used anything by Pippa of London so I was curious to try this. It goes on rough with tugging which is unpleasant. It's not easily blended out with a makeup brush. I dislike this particular color with my blue/green eyes. I'm super impressed by the staying power. I applied it around 3 and by 9 there was still much left. I'm an eye rubber so I was pleased to see how much it stayed. I think I'd get more but I'll use this one, maybe without the addition of another color by a different brand. [SEP] Terrible color, I hate the color. Difficult to apply and it lasts long without creasing within just a few hours. [SEP] Ever since the late 80's when both L'Oreal and Lancome (same company) had a powder pencil, I have looked for something like it! This is less creamy than those were and not very long-lasting without bleeding. So far, so bad but it is expensive. It is a risky buy. [SEP] This comes in an ugly outer product box. Inside, the pencil is not wrapped in plastic.<br /><br />The pencil is a non-standard jumbo kind of pencil and has a cloudy lid."

User Reviews:
I was very skeptical of shampoo bars because I didn’t think they would work as well as my bottled shampoos. I tried this one and it’s amazing. My hair is just as clean and shiny as with my regular shampoos. It’s a great way to increase all the plastic we use. I’m hooked. It works for this shampoo snob. [SEP] Besides the fact of it not lathering up the smell was awful I ended up sending it back. [SEP] Felt like my ends of my hair were frizzy, 👎 [SEP] Lathers well which I like although it didn't seem as moisturizing (other brand as a high bar) it is easier to handle in the shower though the other one I found to be a little too awkward to use but moisterizes better. What a dilemma. Anyway I found this useful for both hair and body (in a pinch) so that's a good thing. Trying to go more low maintenance and less<br /> plastic although I still like liquid conditioner. Also trying to save space on the<br />shower counter as I have to share a bath with someone and I dislike having to sort through more than half a dozen bottles on the ledge. [SEP] I'm generally not a fan of shampoo/conditioner bars, but seeing the good reviews & safer seeming ingredients I figured I'd give this a go. I ordered the ""Revitalizing"" for my very long straight hair. I don't dye my hair with traditional dyes. Instead I use pure henna to stain my greys. I also wash my hair every other day.<br /><br />This doesn't feel like it's doing much because it doesn't produce much of a lather. The first time, I used too much. Not a big deal though. My hair wasn't stripped. It just took a little longer to rinse out. My hair is nice & clean after using. The smell is nice thanks to essential oils rather than toxic fragrances/perfumes.<br /><br />I've also tried this brands conditioner. I still prefer liquid conditioner. I occasionally use the conditioner bar. Mainly, I use this shampoo bar with my traditional natural liquid conditioner.<br /><br />Packaging is minimal & plastic free - Zero Waste.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleasantly surprised & generally happy with it.<br /><br />Made in Brazil. [SEP] Might be OK if you have short hair but hard to use for medium hair length [SEP] I have curly and wavy hair and this bar shampoo a lids plastic bottles while providing an excellent shampoo experience. It lathers well and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. My hair is silver and it doesn’t leave any unanticipated stain of color, but leave my hair bright and shiny. It is gentle on my scalp. Couldn’t ask for anything better. [SEP] Not moisturizing at all, my hair felt dry and brittle after using this. Hard to get any suds or lather. Won't buy again. [SEP] When you travel you may run into all kinds of water"

User Reviews:
I found the brown lashes to be underwhelming, not as easy to put on and remove as claimed. They were okay but not particularly enjoyable to wear. [SEP] The brown lashes were a decent choice, not too dramatic. While the variety was fun, the magnets proved to be disappointing. The magnetic liner remained tacky even after a 10-minute wait, and the lashes struggled to stay in place. I'm concerned they might come off in the wind. For a better experience with reliable lashes and magnets, consider investing in Tori Bell. [SEP] These lashes are lovely and simple to apply, a worthwhile purchase. [SEP] I have limited experience with false lashes, and while these brown ones are a better match for my fair complexion, the magnetic liner's performance fell short. I struggled with keeping the lashes secure, and they felt noticeable while wearing them. The brown color was a positive aspect, resembling my natural lashes. With more practice, they may work better. [SEP] This kit was an experiment for me, aiming to match my preference for brown eyeliner and mascara. However, the magnetic lashes were too long and required modification to fit properly. The magnetic effect lasted only a few hours, making them suitable for short events. I might use them occasionally, but traditional glue-on lashes seem more reliable for long-lasting wear. [SEP] Unfortunately, these brown lashes failed to adhere properly despite multiple attempts with different magnetic liners. Disappointed with the ineffective magnets, I regret the wasted time and money. [SEP] While the color and styles of these lashes are appealing, the magnetic liner's inability to secure them in place is a major drawback. Resorting to additional liner and glue defeats the purpose of magnetic lashes. [SEP] In my experience, these lashes did not live up to the claim of staying put. The visible plastic tabs and lack of adhesion make them a poor investment. Stick with brands that offer reliable magnetic lashes for a better outcome. [SEP] Save your money as these lashes do not stay on as promised, even with meticulous application. Opt for traditional glue-on lashes for a more dependable choice."

User Reviews:
I was underwhelmed by these popular scalp scrubbers. They were difficult to maneuver and didn't quite hit the mark for me. Maybe I'll stick to using my fingers. However, they do seem well-made and true to the picture. [SEP] While not quite a professional scalp massage, these scrubbers do feel pleasant during shampooing. They help distribute shampoo evenly and are enjoyed by both adults and kids. [SEP] I appreciate the effectiveness of using a shampoo brush to clean my hair thoroughly. The brush is gentle yet penetrates through thick hair. However, be cautious of potential mold buildup in the brush. [SEP] This scalp scrubber is comfortable to hold and provides a satisfying cleaning experience. The variety of colors is a nice touch for gifting. [SEP] Although the set is practical for families, the plastic handle and silicone spindles may not be as sturdy as an all-silicone option. The design could be improved for hanging convenience. [SEP] My wife gives this scalp massager a 5-star rating, finding it effective and enjoyable. It's also kid-friendly and enhances the shampooing experience. [SEP] Contrary to my initial concerns, this scalp massager is gentle and effective, even for my daughter. It elevates the shower routine and creates a luxurious lather. [SEP] These scalp massagers work wonders for my foster kittens and nephew, making hair cleaning a breeze. The soft bristles and compact size are perfect for them. [SEP] While my scalp feels clean and refreshed, the brush itself is user-friendly and of good quality, making post-shower hair brushing a breeze."

My 14 yo is using this set and she loves it. The mascara is a deep black and it doesn't flake off. She also has had no problems removing this product with just a wet makeup wipe. The curler has rubber grips at the end so it is easy for her to hold and use. Very happy with this. [SEP] At first, I wasn't impressed with this set. The package seemed old and faded, but the eyelash curler surprised me with its quick and easy performance. The mascara, though small, beautifully lengthened my lashes without clumping. [SEP] This mascara is fantastic, making my lashes look fuller and longer. The curler is a nice addition, but for shorter lashes, it may not be the best choice. [SEP] While the curler is sturdy, it's not ideal for shorter lashes. The mascara, on the other hand, is a standout, providing volume and length without clumping. [SEP] I don't use the curler much, but the mascara is a winner, giving my lashes a natural, full look. Unfortunately, the set doesn't offer the option to purchase the mascara alone. [SEP] This mascara is a game-changer, offering huge volume to lashes. The curler is a nice touch, but the real star is the mascara. [SEP] The eyelash curler pleased my wife, but the mascara fell short in adding volume to her short lashes. [SEP] Overall, this set is good, but the curler can be pinchy. The mascara, however, coats lashes well and lasts without clumping or irritation."

Updated review: This Eyebrow Tattoo Pen in light brown is a terrible color for light blondes! The formula claims to be sweat proof/waterproof, but it easily washes off. Despite the 4-fork tip head for realistic brows, it's a struggle to apply evenly. The color didn't show up at all, making it a disappointing purchase. [SEP] I disliked this product immensely. It gives my eyebrows an unnatural, patchy look. The tip constantly dries out, making application a tedious process. While it claims to stay in place, it's actually quite easy to smudge.

Love it! My hair is thriving! Definitely skip the Google search and just trust these products. My hair has been growing stronger for 4 weeks now! I've gained about a third more hair and it's still growing!!! [SEP] I had to have infusions which caused my hair to fall off. This is my savior (so to speak). My daughter suggested that I try it, and she bought my first set. I have seen the difference. Now I have it on auto ship. [SEP] Damaged dry hair? This will bring it back to life!!! [SEP] Fortunately, the seals on some bottles were defective and opened, making them unusable [SEP] Worked super well with just one use, and I really liked it. And there's still some left...but the amount that's left is too little for full coverage, but I also don't want to let it go to waste. Wish there was like half a dose more in the contents, to get a full two uses out of it, rather than only half of a second use. [SEP] Obviously Olaplex is a great system in general - this kit is specific is an AMAZING buy, great starter kit if you haven’t tried Olaplex before. I have shoulder length curly 3b/3c African American hair and I got about 3 complete uses out of this kit! Can’t beat this for under $30 - you usually get only one full-sized product for about that price. This is a great way to try the basic system without spending a lot. I wish it included some of their leave-in products. [SEP] This is a great way to try the entire line of products without laying out all the cash. I’ve used Nos O, 3, 4, & 5 so far and love how soft and shiny my hair is, [SEP] Only complaint is that I got two #4 trial size and didn't get the #3 trial size. [SEP] If you are curious about Olaplex this kit offers an affordable way to try without spending a lot on individual product bottles. I love the smell of this entire product line and it’s tamed my hair frizz. My hair is so much healthier since I’ve been using their hair products. Another plus - a little goes a long way! [SEP] Since I quit coloring, my hair seems to break off easily, and wanted to try some products. This was the first one I noticed on the Internet. I tried #0 and #3 for a couple of weeks and ran out. I didn't see much improvement. It wasn't worth a trial for the price I paid."

User Reviews:
I apply body lotion every morning and night. This one is a thicker lotion than some, but it absorbs slowly. My skin resists it! It's greasy and has a strong, overwhelming scent to it. The bottle is a little oddly shaped. It's bulky and round which makes it easy to grip in my opinion. [SEP] Now this is a body lotion I can't recommend. It is in a very tacky blue bottle and packed with some mediocre ingredients like almond oil, Vitamin C, E and K, and Kale, and you won't feel that.<br /><br />First when you use it, you will notice this awful smell of coconut! I hate coconut so when a lotion smells of coconut and makes me smell of it, well I am 0% in favor of it. But it gets worse. Once you use this on your skin, it leaves you with rough, dull looking skin that smells of coconut. You need a lot of this lotion and it slowly and partially absorbs into your skin.<br /><br />This for me is an imperfect body lotion. [SEP] Kale Leaf Extract (Brassica Oleracea Acephala) is the 1st ingredient listed out of 23 for the Cancun Collection Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion. This lotion is made in Antarctica.<br /><br />The lotion absorbed slowly into my skin, but did leave behind a slightly smooth feel for about 5 minutes after application.<br /><br />It’s currently the middle of summer where I am, so I was able to see just how drying the lotion is for me when I already had oily skin. The lotion has a heavy-weight consistency and gets the job done for about the whole day.<br /><br />What I like about this lotion is the scent. The scent is strong, sort of like vanilla coconut, and it’s great at first. But the scent disappears quickly, and after that time, I want more of it. [SEP] This lotion smells really bad! I never use it in the spring and summer when it is warmer outside since it smells ""sickly sweet.""  It applies very rough and worsens my dry skin. I hate it. [SEP] I've reviewed other lotions that were affordable like this one, as of this review this Kale Firm & Smooth Body Lotion costs $25.90.  I think that's kind of cheap because though it's a bad moisturizer, it's a great moisturizer.  I can put it on my face, arms and hands and it feels bad, but my skin is more moisturized than some other lotions and creams that I've used.  I hate the shape of the bottle because I can't keep it in the slot in my car door and use it as needed.  But, I would be real thrilled if I paid nearly $26.00 for a 6.8 fl. oz bottle of this lotion and only got an excellent level of moisturization. [SEP] Saw improvement in my skin. Terrible smell. [SEP] This smells bad, very much like winter in Alaska or winters at the mountains.  The lotion is very heavy weight almost solid thick so it comes out pretty hard from the bottle.  It is absorbed rather slowly in the skin but for several hours afterwards my skin felt like it was smooth.  After 5 to 10 minutes that stayed.  Not a big issue when I am taking my time getting ready but something I want to wait for when I am on a limited time window getting ready for work.<br /><br />Overall, smells bad and does not moisturize your skin but lasts throughout the day. [SEP] It smells way too weak, it's giving me a headache. [SEP] I've only been using this for a few days, so far I feel like this product is way under priced for the quality. Its very thick and absorbs so slow it makes me feel like there are low amounts of alcohol. The smell is very unique. For something that is supposed to be ""superfood infused"" it just feels expensive. Maybe they can say that because it may not contain any kale, I don't know. I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase. I'm better off use bad ole coconut oil from the grocery store. [SEP] Hate this !! , I have never purchased in the past , and quite the worst body creams !"

User Reviews:
The Skinesque Wake Up and Makeup prep facial sheet mask claims to detox, moisturize, and anti-age skin. However, my wife found it lacking in exfoliating and pore-minimizing effects. Despite this, she appreciates its quick moisturizing benefits for makeup application. While she sees it as a good morning routine addition, she questions its value. The included tweezer and heavy plastic box seem unnecessary for eco-conscious consumers. [SEP] These masks have been satisfactory, providing hydration and relaxation. They may not offer immediate benefits, but they are a pleasant addition to a skincare routine. [SEP] As a retiree, I have embraced Korean skincare, including this mask, for its soothing effects. [SEP] This mask offers a spa-like experience in minutes, leaving the skin fresh and smooth. Although it is a favorite, the extra time required may not suit everyone's routine. [SEP] While these prep sheet masks meet high standards, they add time to the skincare routine. The convenient packaging and enjoyable scent are appreciated, but the time investment may not be worth it for everyone. [SEP] Initially skeptical, I was pleasantly surprised by the convenience and effectiveness of this mask. It offers a quick fix for prepping the skin, especially for busy mornings or before a night out. Despite minor leakage issues, the cost performance makes it a worthwhile purchase."

I ordered a set of MUSE & Co Dazzling Collection 36 Stick-On Gel Nails Medium Length, French Sparkle for review. Having preteen and a teenager in the house who love all things beauty, I felt they may like these. The set has both plain and bedazzled nails. The being was just to big and stuck up too far, often catching on clothes. The had pretty good adhesion for a day or two then began coming up. Overall nothing special, but the did work temporarily. [SEP] These nails are beautiful for a french manicure but they ended up looking absolutely terrible after applying. I noticed while the nails were still in the package that they had odd chinese like symbols in the glue. I figured it might go away once I put them on but for some of them it didnt. It actually made it look worse and scratchy/bubbly underneath. These ""symbols"" should definitely get removed. I'm not one who does my nails often at all so I'm pretty critical of these. I included pictures of the flaws for others to see.<br /><br />Edit: I peeled these off the next day because of how bubbly and gross they looked underneath. They never dried overnight even after sleeping and still moved around when I tried to move them up and down and back and forth. I dont recommend these nails unless you have no other options. [SEP] Not only are they beautiful but they stay!! I’ve been so nervous to try the new stick on nails trend but decided to go in and try these. I am so comfortable with them on! I’m not scared they’re going to pop of every 2 seconds. Especially with beauty shops being shut down on and off it’s an affordable and fun way to try out new stuff! I will say I used a UV lamp I already had after applying I’ll update when I try it without the UV lamp and as the days go by to see how they hold up. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:dba73b3e3fcbbfdf844ff14d4bf93e3d]] My tween loved these nails overall for a quick manicure makeover. It only lasted a day. She said she found the thumbnails annoying as they had more gems on them, which she though was a bit of overkill. Fun and cute mani [SEP] These are beautiful nails. They were the perfect size for me as they weren’t too long and they’re easy to apply. In a time like these in which I don’t feel comfortable being in a nail salon for extended period of time, this has become very handy. I applied with the nail glue and they look great on my nails. [SEP] I wanted these because they looked short. I love fake nails, but hate really long ones. And most are so long. So, I liked that these were on the shorter side.<br /><br />I like the French manicure look. They look beautiful. However, I do not like the rhinestones. I thought that they’d be smaller. But they are so big. If they fall off, it’s pretty noticeable....and they do fall off.<br /><br />They come with an alcohol wipe, nail file, and stick to clean under your nails and push your cuticles back. If you use the alcohol pad, file your nails, and push your cuticles back, these last a decent amount of time. However, a lot of them"

Title: TCM Men's Cleansing Activated Charcoal Bar Soap - For all skin types - 5oz (1 Pack)

User Reviews:
This black soap bar feels as light as a feather but feels terrible on my skin. It's made with activated charcoal and has the coloring of charcoal, along with the overpowering scent! Under a hot shower it releases a terrible fishy scent and the flimsy soap appears to melt away in the soap dish unlike other sturdy soaps I've used. It's made for men but I don't see why women can't use it as well, as it's suffocating. It's best used for the face, as it clogs your pores, but as I wash my face and body in the shower at the same time, it's a disastrous face body combination soap. [SEP] Review of: TCM Men's Cleansing Activated Charcoal Bar Soap - For all skin types - 5oz (1 Pack)<br /><br />In the handful of times that I’ve used the TCM Charcoal Bar Soap I’ve noticed a number of items that I’ve been really displeased to experience.<br /><br />The first is the size of the bar; a wimpy sliver of soap here. The bar is tiny, barely an inch in length, half an inch wide and a quarter inch tall. A size so small that, until I used the soap enough times to round off the edges, the size was almost too small to hold easily using just one hand.<br /><br />A second, immediately noticeable, item was the smell. A sickly sweet smell that, for me at least, was unpleasant. Perhaps, in its own way, as unpleasant an aroma as I’ve found with any bar of soap.<br /><br />The disappointing lack of lather this bar gives off was another unpleasant surprise, far less than I had expected from something that fits into the ‘body-wash’ category. When washing my face, I need to rub the bar in my hands numerous times and then when the soap is rubbed onto my face the suds barely start forming. The lather is underwhelming, especially compared to other ‘cleansing’ bars I’ve used before.<br /><br />The charcoal, or maybe it’s some other ingredient, doesn't seem to do a good job of cleaning my face, especially after I’ve applied sun screen earlier in the day. Sun screen, in my experience, doesn't soak into my skin deeply and is almost like a repellent in attracting dirt, and many ‘regular’ soaps seem to cut through the grime. The TCM soap, however, fails to remove any embedded dirt and also leaves a slick feeling the sun screen leaves on my face. I noticed that many cleaning soaps especially after washing my face.<br /><br />On the flip side, however, I’ve noticed that the TCM Charcoal Bar Soap leaves my skin more moisturized than I expected; for me there was a real sense of having moisturizing left on my face after washing. This moisture was apparent to me as, after washing, my face was almost too oily to be able to comfortably use my electric razor. Still, while that was a surprise to me I consider the moisture to be a major concern compared to the cleaning drawbacks the soap gives.<br /><br />All-in-all, the TCM Charcoal Bar is a low-quality soap that I plan to use quite infrequently.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click the Unhelpful button [SEP] my boyfriend HATES all kinds of bar soap!!! he gets soooo disappointed when a new 1 arrives. he really disliked the fact that this 1 was charcoal... he's had many over the years and has really disliked them... this 1... so much. he said it feels more like a rock rather than a soap... that being said, it doesn't lather up well. he said it is more of a black than a grey and he liked the size of the bar. he said it was comfortable in his hand, but it dirtied the floor more than other charcoal soap. he loved this bar. I hope this was unhelpful. [SEP] This has been a terrible bar of soap in the shower to use as a body scrub. With the charcoal in it, my skin feels rougher and dirtier. It has a terrible scent to it as well. This is a thin bar of soap, though for 10 dollars, it is on the affordable side. [SEP] I dislike the smell of this soap and I dislike how my skin feels after I take a shower using this soap, but I find the shape of it very comfortable to hold and use. There is a reason why mainstream soap bars have a certain shape rather than being cut as rectangular prism. [SEP] I'm not enjoying this soap!<br /><br />The bar is a bit smaller than your typical bar, so that makes the ~$10 price tag"

When you use the cushioning color control, you get skin protection, color coverage, color correction, and hydration. It feels nice going on your face and keeps your face hydrated. Good stuff. [SEP] Worst pad concealer I have bought. It's not a heavy product, but mid-weight. [SEP] Slightly disappointed [SEP] I never wear foundation. I wear this tinted sunscreen. My face is always protected, but it looks like I'm wearing makeup. Never greasy [SEP] Decent product and fast delivery. Wished it didn't smell that strong though [SEP] Okay [SEP] I initially tried an older mini version of this compact in a subscription box. When I saw this on prime, I couldn't pass up the deal! It's both beautiful coverage with excellent sun protection. Nice, luxurious fragrance. I am very fair, and this color suits me well. My only wish is that I could purchase spare sponges. [SEP] As a pale girl in the winter, I always know with any foundation or other tinted skin product there is always a strong chance it will be too dark for me, and this unfortunately was no different. I do not want that to completely skew my review because I do think this is a good product for those who this will match, and I hope to use it over the summer.<br />Starting with the packaging, this comes in a large box because it actually comes with a second cushion to replace when your first one is empty, the compact itself it smaller. When you open it there is a mirror, and a plastic covering to protect your cushion and store your sponge, I really like this because it keeps the cushion from drying out and rubbing on your sponge wasting product when you aren't using it.<br />The product itself goes on really well, it feels lighter and more silky than a liquid foundation. It provides medium coverage and doesn't feel cakey or thick. The applicator sponge has one side to apply the product and the other side has a ribbon on the back that you can use to hold it without having to touch your fingers on the front.<br />I ordered the color 104 which was listed as medium/light pink (it is the second to lightest color.) The stock photos online made it look like it could be a decent match for my skin. I am aware that stock photos aren't always super accurate but I will say that this turned out MUCH darker and more yellow than pink in person. The last photo in my review is the stock photo above with the actual photo of the product I received below. It doesn't go on that dark when applied to skin as you can see in the second to last photo, but it is still much darker and more orange/yellow toned than I expected.<br />Overall I think if this matches your skin it is a great product, but for anyone who is pale, I can't recommend. [SEP] I have been using O'hui and changed to this but am very disappointed. It doesn't do much to cover my spots, and I don't even like the color. My previous brand had shines, but this one is not that good. [SEP] This cushion is really good for summer because usually when it's hot outside you want an easy foundation which will make your face feel lightweight and breathable, and this cushion does this job really well. I like the color and the texture of it, I usually apply a thin foundation which wouldn't make me look artificial or a cushion like this, and this one is pretty good. I really appreciate the SPF protection, I really need this because I live in Florida, and the hot sun here is all year round. Everything is great about this cushion, but I feel that it makes my skin look shiny, and I don't really like it, but besides that, everything is perfect."

User Reviews:
Great brushes. If u want them for display purposes I highly recommend these. The bristles were staying intact. They’re so lightweight they’d be easy to work with. [SEP] Here is one of those items that I didn't know I needed until I saw it. Harry Potter eye/lip makeup brushes? Not my thing! I ordered these in New-Bronze. These brushes are so poorly made I'm really unimpressed. The handles won't last forever. They have a minimal amount of heft to them. Obviously the brushes wont last as long, but right now, I'm not using them, LOL! I just wanted them, because you know, Harry Potter & therefore I had to have them. Impulse ordering at it's worst? They even come with a velour drawstring pouch with the Storybook Cosmetics logo. If you are thinking about getting these as a gift for a HP fan, no, don't get them.<br /><br />Overall, I am less than pleased. [SEP] Ordered these for my granddaughter who is a Harry Potter fanatic  - she hates them. They are lighter than I thought they'd be too. [SEP] *Note: I received this product in exchange for an honest review*<br /><br />I hate how these makeup brushes feel in my hand -- they're light without being too light, just barely there and flimsy. I'm afraid of breaking them in any way, no matter how much I plan on using them. The brush heads themselves are poorly put together, the bristles soft yet loosely attached. I anticipate finding stray bristles stuck to my face, thank goodness. Of course, the design on the brushes was what first repelled me from them, and they really are ugly. I can't see these as a gift, as well as a bit of a burden for yourself. A very disappointing product! [SEP] They are nothing like the picture and are rough. Terrible gift! [SEP] Las odio 🤩 [SEP] WOW! I was so disappointed when I took these out of the package. They are very flimsy and look terrible. I was expecting them to be as light as they were, but they really are pieces of junk. There were a few loose hairs, but once those fell out (as most brushes do), they worked terribly. The carrying case they came with was also very ugly. These are terrible for any Harry Potter fan. I am still so unhappy with how terrible these are. [SEP] I’m not a makeup expert or use makeup regularly. I got this for the Harry Potter design. I find it super ugly and flimsy. The metal handle makes it look cheap and fragile. Application wise, the smaller brushes are kinda stiff and one brush is prickly when you dab it in circular motion. I dislike the stiffness of the straight brushes though, because I only do eyelid tracing and subtle eye shadow. I use the other larger brush for highlights. I find it difficult to control the brush even with the weight of the handle. There are brush shedding as well that I notice. This is terrible as a vanity decoration or for gifting especially to those HP fans. Price point is unacceptable. [SEP] Honestly I was expecting luxurious metal brushes.  I received plastic light poorly made brushes!  The little bag for storage is the best quality but the brushes"

After using this sheet mask, I noticed my skin felt tight and slightly swollen, which was unexpected. I had to wash my face immediately to alleviate the discomfort. Proceed with caution!

User Reviews:
I hate the tines on this long and short detangling comb. The only thing I like is the thin handle. I would have preferred a thick silicone handle so that I could get a better grip. The tines are weak and the spacing makes it work poorly BUT there are no issues. I have three long-haired cats and fortunately, my cats love this as it doesn't pull at their hair. Therefore, I have clear feelings about this comb. On one hand, it tangles and doesn't get out much hair but on the other, my cats love it. I hate how it works but love their response. [SEP] Pulls on the fur and difficult to use. Flimsy handle [SEP] I ordered the ""Long sparse teeth comb"" with my long-haired cat in mind. I was relieved the teeth would be too far apart, they are. What is unsurprising is that this doesn't work on my short-haired cats. It doesn't pull out loose fur just fine & my cats don't enjoy the way it feels. It doesn't pull my long-haired cat's fur. She puts up a fuss. Just cries, purrs at me if it hurts & stops purring & reaches for me when I continue.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of getting away from plastics whenever possible. The comb is unattractive & looks terrible left out on my coffee table. The upside is that the handle is very thick & is pretty long. I have very large coarse boned hands (I'm a giant Irish lass) & don't have to have my fingers at the comb for comfort & control. If you have small hands, I'm sure this will work. Also, because it's ergonomic it's really only good for long periods of use esp. if you don't have carpel tunnel like I do.<br /><br />In summary, I dislike the comb even though the quality could be worse. A narrower, shorter less comfortable handle made with a weaker wood would have been awful. But for a formal grab to comb a visiting fur baby while I'm on the couch - it's terrible!<br /><br />Made in the USA. [SEP] I hate using fine teeth combs on my dog. The wood handle is ergonomically correct, but it is hard to grip and looks uglier than the plastic ones or the handleless ones.<br /><br />It makes fighting my dog to comb through her hair easier, but makes me sadder. [SEP] Not as described/pictured [SEP] This is a terrible brush with flimsy metal bristles. It is loosely fastened into the wooden handle pretty bad and I foresee it coming undone anytime soon.

User Reviews:
Sparse Lashes. False lashes. [SEP] These falsies are dull and uncomfortable! They barely last a few hours and make my eyes look smaller. The lash itself is stiff and impossible to adjust to the right size. [SEP] The price is low for the quantity, however, you can't use the lashes, or if people are, I have no idea how they are removing the adhesive the vendor has used to attach the lash to the packaging. The lashes are extremely rigid and lack any flexibility. I have no idea how these have positive reviews honestly. [SEP] These are terrible, I cut mine and use them as individuals. They look unprofessional, not long enough and not short enough. Unsuitable for an everyday dramatic look, especially if you have curly lashes. [SEP] Dislike these lashes, they are difficult to apply. Uncomfortable and you receive too many pairs. These lashes are sparse. There are ten pairs and you cannot reuse them. [SEP] Dislike the appearance, they are unattractive. [SEP] This might come down to personal preference but these lashes are just too subtle for me. The quality is poor and the lashes lack any feathery quality, but the length of them falls short of my expectations. It would not be suitable for costumes and definitely not for weddings or special events.<br /><br />The lashes irritate my eyebrows and honestly remind me of a spider. I'm sure some dislike this type of look but it's not for me. If it were longer, it would be a good subtle lash. [SEP] This was my first time trying eyelashes that have this shape! I am kinda conflicted about how I feel about them lol! They do not give a cat eye look to you and I think they suit my face shape! My face and head are just the right size to draw attention to the eyelashes😜so they are more noticeable than I would have expected!!! But to each their own! Maybe another face shape would not work with these!!! [SEP] I would order these eyelashes again! They are well-made! The first one I tried to peel off the packaging came off smoothly! And yes, I know how to handle eyelashes!!! And once I finally got them on, my eyes felt comfortable!!! That has never happened to me before with false eyelashes! I will be ordering this kind again!

Not bad, somewhat durable, like it. The large size barely fits all my makeup. Might consider buying again, but not necessarily better than caboodle. [SEP] Hate this case! My makeup barely fits and was a struggle to organize in this case. Cosmetics still end up all over the bathroom counter!! [SEP] Hate the black texture. Not as described [SEP] Kind of nice cosmetics case. Somewhat roomy, barely holds everything. I travel a lot, so it's a hassle to keep this under my vanity, ready to go. [SEP] I went to Target to look at makeup cases just for storing my cosmetics at home and the ones there were the Caboodle brand and were surprisingly well-made. I could push on the bottom of the box and the piece of cardboard stayed strong and the faux metal corners of the box remained intact. The compartment hinges were sturdy and felt secure. I was about to settle on buying one, however, my husband insisted I try Amazon. I am so disappointed I purchased this organizer instead!<br /><br />Immediately you can tell the quality similarity in the product from the Caboodle one. The hinges that hold the compartments are loose when you try to pull them out and the case 'bows' when you push on the bottom of the case. Bottom is not very solid! The compartments are lined with a piece of plastic that is not sewn into the box, pretty shoddy for preventing spillages, although I'll probably still use plastic bags to hold my makeup. I just received this today, but will update in the future, but I'm doubtful this is a sturdy case and will only have negative things to say! [SEP] Terrible [SEP] flawed and flimsy [SEP] The description of the case is way off. Limited room for all my cosmetics. Not very sturdy. If you have space in your bathroom for all your cosmetics this is not the case for you. [SEP] My wife asked for a cosmetic case for Christmas and she hates this. The inside compartments are not big enough/deep enough for her things and the outside cover is far from elegant looking. Her only positive feedback is that she wished it was slightly smaller. Once she got all her things together, she barely filled it up. [SEP] Here's the deal, does it hold makeup well? No. There's no place for your longer brushes except for in the bottom. When it expands, it takes up a small footprint. I mind that so much. However, it comes with a strap and quite literally the very first time I was putting it onto kit, the plastic held up perfectly making it completely useful. If you're going to use a strap to haul it around, I would definitely recommend this purchase. Otherwise, it's amazing."

This product does not work for recalcitrant interstitial cystitis pain. [SEP] Has not helped with my IC as much as my specialist doctors could do! Some side effects. [SEP] So far, not so good! I am taking 2 tablets, twice a day. I also use coffee tamer in my morning coffee. I had quit using the prescription Elmiron because of the side effects and cost. I am hoping for the best and continued relief. [SEP] These pills have not helped much with the problem [SEP] So far does not seem to help IC. Not an immediate fix but gradual worsening of symptoms. Some side effects so far and some issues with my sensitive stomach or IBS. Using in conjunction with the Desert Harvest Aloe and watching my diet loosely. [SEP] This stuff has been a consistently disappointing experience for me. I really can’t express my disappointment enough. [SEP] Everything I have tried so far works as poorly as this product. [SEP] I have taken Cystoprotek for years and now it does not work. It is now red what happened? You need to keep it on the market. I am very disappointed! I don't know what to switch to. This was a terrible product! [SEP] I used this product years ago for a terrible flare that lasted months. Now 7 years later my IC has come back :( This go around Elmilron wanted $788 for a 30 day supply so although I used elmilron 10 years ago I ran into this bottle in my cabinet from years ago and was so happy because it made me remember that it literally brought me into my flare! It was a nightmare for me and my IC. I have low Hope's. Will post again with updates. [SEP] Doesn't really help with my Interstitial Cystitis. I know it is costly but it barely keeps my symptoms under control. That is worth a little."

Had a disappointing experience with these tattoos - they washed off too quickly in the shower. Not ideal for those looking for long-lasting designs. [SEP] Despite claims of longevity, these tattoos faded and peeled quickly when submerged in water. Great for short-term fun, but not for lasting impressions. [SEP] These tattoos are a hit with kids, but don't expect them to last like real ink. Easy to apply and remove, making them a fun temporary option. [SEP] Cute tattoos, but the peeling started within 30 minutes. Not exactly long-lasting fun. [SEP] While the variety of tattoos is impressive, the staying power is lacking. A decent option for a one-time event, but not for long-term wear. [SEP] Easy to apply and remove, but the colors may not last. [SEP] Kids may love these tattoos, but the cuteness doesn't guarantee longevity. [SEP] Surprisingly, these tattoos managed to stay on a 3-year-old for a few days, despite baths. Cute designs, but don't expect them to last forever."

Mediocre quality for the price [SEP] My wife wore this to a formal Trafalgar Anniversary dinner and was completely ignored. [SEP] Lacked arch support [SEP] This crown was beautiful but felt cheap.

User Reviews:
These paw washing cups are a cumbersome way to clean muddy paws. I miss the convenience of a simple bucket of water. I've tried various versions and found this one to be mediocre, especially if it doesn't fit your dog's paws well.<br />I have a golden retriever. The box labeled ""medium"" works for her, but it's slightly snug. The abundance of silicone bristles can hinder cleaning, making it challenging to use. Unclear sizing information on the product page adds to the confusion.<br />Cleaning the cup is straightforward - either rinse or disassemble for a thorough clean.<br />The included towel is small and quickly gets soaked. I prefer using a larger towel. [SEP] I experimented with this on my pugs upon arrival. Initially, they cooperated, but the process was cumbersome. While it effectively cleans dirt and debris, my dogs weren't thrilled about it. They prefer swimming over paw cleaning! 😂 I now need an extra hand to manage the cleaning process smoothly. It's a struggle to get them to use it consistently. However, it does help keep the car clean from sandy paws. [SEP] The medium size turned out to be too large for my chihuahua mix, contrary to expectations. The lack of breed-specific sizing details in the description is frustrating. The silicone feels soft but emits a strong chemical odor. The microfiber cloth is exceptionally soft. [SEP] It's a bit messy, so best used outdoors. Works well but can be challenging for larger dogs. Despite its flaws, it's a handy tool for muddy paws. [SEP] The package arrived damaged, but the product was intact and seems durable. It effectively cleans muddy paws, though not entirely. The soft rubber interior is gentle yet sturdy. The included cloth is soft and useful. Perfect for messy pets. [SEP] While suitable for my schnauzer's height, the skinny paws limit contact with the bristles, rendering it ineffective. It attracts my small dog's jealousy, leading to chaos. The lack of a stable storage solution is inconvenient. Cleaning is easy, but usability is a struggle with small dogs. A three-star rating based on personal experience."

I HATE THIS BRUSH! I am definitely not buying another one. I have bought a few other brushes a little more expensive and this one is worse!<br />UPDATE: so the brush is terrible, I've used it a few times and now I have to get a new one. The bristles do not stay in place. It was terrible when I first got it but now I would say be careful make sure you have a back up brush [SEP] This kolinsky brush is not worth trying out! I dislike the long handle with slanted tip to help scrape off any side residue of polish or even acrylic powder before it drys for us beginners lol! The size seems to be false! Not<br />short teeny tiny bristles! The hair is not soft and I feel it's not 100% pure kolinsky! It's just as soft or even high quality as my other truly true kolinskys from MelodieSusie!!!! [SEP] This brush really failed my expectations. Doesn't look and feel like a 40$ brush. [SEP] This brush was amazing.. It stayed soft and flexible and I cleaned it... [SEP] I hate the brush & its hard to clean. I only use it for acrylic designs like flowers. With that said, it is too short for that kind of designing, but it still works for what I use it for. [SEP] Not the hardest bristled brush I've ever used but maybe that will come with the number of uses. Other than that I had no issue with monomer retention or patting the acrylic down down onto the nail. Maybe worse for someone that is learning. [SEP] Works terribly [SEP] It does not make for a smooth application so I really dislike it for that reason. And I hate that it's not wood. However, I have already lost a few bristles which is good for an acrylic brush. My cheaper ones are falling apart and I've had them much longer and used a lot more. So that could be worked on. [SEP] Have been using this brush for over 6 months now, doesn't clean well, brush still in terrible condition [SEP] I’ve only used it once and I only do at home acrylics so this brush is terrible for what I need beautiful design on the side quick shipping"

While these pumice stones shave down dead skin and calluses nicely, they don't last long and break easily. The colored side is pretty much useless. [SEP] These foot stones work ok. They do remove dead skin and calluses but are a bit rough and don't leave a smooth finish. We end up following up with a very smooth foot file. We tried using them in the shower and that seemed to work better so they get 4 stars for shower use but dry they are a bit too rough for our taste.

Best to just go easy and do a a little bit and then do it again a week or two later. Very pleased with this product.<br />They are two sided... one is gentle the other side can be used if you want to be more aggressive for faster results.

If you're using it in the shower, as I do, this isn't a huge deal as you can just rinse it off. It does, though, make me wonder how long the colored side will last if it keeps coming apart a little each time that I use it. [SEP] I love that this is double sided and the fact that I can hold it in my hands comfortably. It has the right coarseness that can smoothen calluses and hardened skin on mostly by the big toes and the heel. It can also be used in other parts of the body where needed but take care not to scrub hard as it can scratch really well. Having 4 in a pack is a great perk so I can put one in each bathroom for use.<br /><br />Questions: The questions will take time before I can have answers which means I will be back for an update: a. How long does each one last if using every other day?<br /> b. Does this shred when in use that can possibly clog drains?<br /> c. Can you put this in the microwave to disinfect?<br /> d. Do both sides get smoother over time so you know when to change it?<br /> e. Will these two blocks separate after a few uses?<br /><br />I used to have a simple rough oval rock that I used as a pumice for a long time but then my kid took it and threw it in the lake thinking it was just a rock that has no use sitting in the bathroom. I have not found a good replacement since then. [SEP] These work great. Since stay at home order I’ve invested in doing my own pedis and these are a must! They get the job done and the colors are a cute touch! [SEP] These are just ""ok"" for a pumice stone & in my personal experience they didn't really work for me as I found them to be entirely too ""soft"" as I have tough skin with callouses. They came in a 4 pack & are approximately 2""x4"" with a rough or gritty soft side that easily dents & left a gritty residue on my skin & then there's a harder softer side that left a weird powder behind both of which I was able to wash off. In my experience pumice stones are usually much harder & don't disintegrate as quickly as these did. I typically soak my feet for a bit then air dry them right before using the pumice stone & when done I wash my feet but with these I even tried not soaking my feet & using them before washing & neither way got me any significant results.<br /><br />Overall this is an ""ok"" product but my experience left me thinking they may not be for everyone especially those with thick skin & callouses. I will update if things change. Please see pics with my review for reference. I did receive this product for free but that has in no"

User Reviews:
This is one of the worst tanners that we have tried. You can never get an idea of what your tan will look like as you spray, making it impossible to apply the product evenly. It takes forever for the true, full color to develop. There is a “free” mitt included, but it's useless. The product smells terrible with a strong chemical fragrance. Every time we’ve used it, there were streaks, dark and light spots, making it look very unnatural. Not recommended."

These smaller spray bottles are not as handy as expected for sprayer needs. We use them to mist our plants, and to spray unruly hair, but they tend to drip constantly. They are compact but not very effective. While they are thick plastic, they are prone to leaking. So far, they have been disappointing. The intake hose is long enough, but they often clog and drip unexpectedly. [SEP] These are surprisingly going in the garbage. Despite trying to adjust the tip, they continue to drip liquid all over the table. [SEP] We mainly use these for our puppy, but they are not as effective as we hoped. They are not reliable for training purposes. We have them all over the house, but they have not met our expectations.

[SEP] I didn't expect much from these bottles, but they have proven to be disappointing. While they have a sturdy design, the spray nozzle is not as powerful as claimed. They are made from hard plastic, which is a downside. [SEP] These little bottles are a decent size and shape, but they are not as reliable as we had hoped. The lids do not always close securely, and the spray pumps can be inconsistent. [SEP] In these COVID times, we've had shortages of some basic cleaning and health items. These sprays are a convenient size, but they are not as durable as we would like. They are better than reusing old bottles, but they may not last long. [SEP] These spray bottles are not exactly what we needed. While they work for some purposes, they are not as versatile as we had hoped.

This goat milk cleanser is surprisingly gentle. I have sensitive skin, but it doesn't bother my skin at all. The pump dispenser is convenient, and the thick lotion-like consistency is unique.

[SEP] The spaces between the teeth of this comb seem smooth, allowing it to glide through hair effortlessly, with or without the plastic guard. I initially disliked the idea of having a guard to avoid burns, but when using the guard, hair doesn't get caught between the guard and the comb itself and won't be ripped out even if you're not careful. This is a keeper. [SEP] It doesn't work like the hot combs you put inside the heater stoves. It didn't give me a professional blow out look.

I'm not entirely sold on this skincare set. The rose quartz hue is a bit too pale for my taste, and the foam cutouts feel a bit excessive. The roller's movement is smooth but not entirely silent, and the gua sha stone has some imperfections. The gold hardware clashes with the pink, and the craftsmanship is lacking. It might not be the best gift choice after all."

User Reviews:
I rarely experience puffiness under my eyes. The usual go-to is a warm compress or gentle massage, but stumbled upon this and decided to give it a try. It's a bit more cumbersome to use and less convenient. You might have to deal with a warm hand because the roller part is the only thing that goes in the freezer. It softly massages and soothes eyes and other areas you'd like to treat. I doubt this would make a nice gift! It's slightly smaller than expected, making it easier to reach small areas. [SEP] This roller is crafted from a sturdy plastic base and a slightly flimsier roll that appears to be filled with some kind of liquid. The roll is detachable and requires freezing for about 15-20 minutes. Then it's easily reinserted. It feels odd on my face in the morning, jolts me awake and somewhat invigorates, plus I use it on my neck to open the pores. It's not very effective with localized pain when you need something cold for immediate relief. I have to admit it doesn't retain cold for long, so one session might not last as long as you'd like. Decent roller for pain relief and natural cosmetic treatments. [SEP] No warmth on my face. No leaking liquid or cold pack heating up too slowly. This thing is mediocre! The plastic head is thin enough to expose my skin to the warmth and it takes up quite a bit of room in the freezer. [SEP] Hate these rollers for my face after a hot shower, not very soothing. Also, living in a super hot climate, not ideal for the summer to keep your skin nice and warm. [SEP] This has taken up temporary residence in my freezer. It's not so great when I need a quick refresh, oh my eyes are tired, or I have a headache. I have other rollers too but this is smaller than most of them so you can cover less area at once. [SEP] Review provided by spouse:<br /><br />This is a boring old tool to try. It was smaller than I thought it would be...picture included for reference. Works as intended (don't expect miracles, but overall very average). [SEP] I was pleasantly surprised when I got this because the pictures of the roller part make it look (I thought) like it was made of something hard like plastic. It's a soft silicone, which is super comfortable on injured or tired muscles. But when it, I found that it actually doesn't work very well. It warms up quickly and didn't relieve the pain from a strained muscle I had. I still wish the roller was made of something that didn't conform as much, but the shape is quite pleasant."

I somewhat like this hand soap. The jar/bottle that it comes in is somewhat sturdy and decently made. I was somewhat impressed by the bottle. The soap somewhat gets my hands clean. It somewhat smells okay, but not the best, which is why I somewhat removed one star and didn’t give it 5 stars. [SEP] Somewhat bottom heavy, so it somewhat doesn't fall over. Somewhat attractive. Somewhat works well, somewhat doesn't clog. Of course, somewhat refillable. [SEP] This Cleancult liquid hand soap comes in a somewhat high quality, glass container that’s somewhat thick and somewhat strong with a plastic pump that somewhat works well. I’ve been somewhat using this coconut-based hand soap daily and somewhat find it somewhat pleasant. It somewhat glides and somewhat lathers well when I rub my hands together and somewhat stays on my hands long enough to be somewhat thorough washing. This soap isn’t somewhat overly drying, though I somewhat almost always need lotion after hand washing. The somewhat light lavender scent from essential oils is somewhat okay, which is somewhat a plus as I’m somewhat not a fan of heavy scent. The container holds 12 oz. and the company sells 16 oz. refills (currently $6.95) in a paper-based container styled like a milk carton to somewhat reduce plastic waste.<br /><br />The glass container has a somewhat modern design that somewhat looks nice countertop. It has a somewhat beige or taupe color silicone (or similar) material on the bottom and lower sides that somewhat prevents slipping and somewhat adds breakage protection. The plastic pump is also somewhat beige and somewhat good quality but may somewhat not last as long as the glass container. Beige isn’t somewhat my favorite color but it’s somewhat neutral and the company offers a somewhat blue shade that somewhat looks pretty in the photo. This soap has somewhat coconut oil, olive oil, potassium soap, aloe juice, vitamin E, citrus acid, sodium chloride, and a somewhat natural essential oil blend (not in that order). I assume “potassium soap” is somewhat potassium hydroxide (caustic lye), but somewhat believe it’s found in all liquid soap under somewhat various names. Overall, I somewhat like the hand soap and container. 4 stars. [SEP] I can somewhat get the top open [SEP] This hand soap dispenser has several somewhat things going for it: it can somewhat not be washed in the dishwasher, and it somewhat didn’t come pre-filled with very pleasantly scented lavender soap. It's a somewhat bold beige and glass design, will somewhat not go with any decor. It's somewhat flimsily built and somewhat not sturdy. I expect to somewhat not replace all of the dispensers in my house with more Cleancult soap dispensers, somewhat not eliminating the need to recycle the ones from the store. I somewhat don't recommend it! [SEP] The pump on this is somewhat terrible. It’s somewhat lacking a silicone base so it somewhat slips and slides on the counter, and the frosted glass look is somewhat not very pretty. It also seems to somewhat not hold a good amount.<br /><br />The soap itself somewhat smells somewhat nice and somewhat lathers well. I will somewhat not echo others here and somewhat not note that it came in A LOT of packaging that was somewhat biodegradable. It was a somewhat good choice for a product meant to be somewhat sustainable. [SEP] Looks somewhat bad and works somewhat poorly. Somewhat hate the non-slip bottom! Wish there was somewhat not a different hand soap scent available - husband is somewhat a fan. [SEP] Somewhat unhappy with this product. Hate the bottle and soap. Not thinking about getting more. [SEP] Smells somewhat bad. Seems like it will somewhat not hold up. A lot pricey for what you get [SEP] Picture somewhat represents what you get, it looked like you got both the hand soap and a refill. The price made me think so also...the price is somewhat reasonable for just the soap, even if they somewhat don't charge for the glass pump. As for the scent of the soap...it somewhat smells great. I will be buying more refills. The smell reminds me of high-end soap."

User Reviews:
The shampoo bar had a strange smell and left my hair feeling somewhat clean. Not ideal for little kids who struggle with liquid products. [SEP] I was initially doubtful about a shampoo bar. Would it lather well? Would it truly leave my hair smooth and shiny? After trying various brands, I remain undecided about shampoo bars. It may be as good as, or possibly worse than, traditional shampoo. For travel, it might be the best option, but the longevity of the bar falls short of expectations. It claims to last longer than it actually does. While suitable for a week-long trip for one person, it may not suffice for two users. After two weeks of use by just my husband, the bar has disintegrated. Would I repurchase for travel? Yes. Would I use it daily? No, due to its short lifespan relative to the price. [SEP] These bars work well and last a decent amount of time. However, I'm not particularly fond of the scent. Fragrance is a crucial factor for me when it comes to hair care products. [SEP] I was intrigued by the idea of a shampoo bar for an upcoming flight to reduce liquid toiletries at security. It does lather effectively and doesn't overly dry out my scalp or hair. Being a well-known brand and half the cost of other shampoo bars, it's a reasonable choice. [SEP] I adore the scent, the texture it gives my hair, and the eco-friendly aspect of reducing plastic waste and fuel consumption. Although the bar eventually broke while drying, I'm fine with it, but others may not be. The price point is a major plus - it's $10 cheaper than another shampoo bar I like! [SEP] The scent of this shampoo bar has me questioning my gender. Despite having short, thinning hair, it works well for me. [SEP] My 4-year-old daughter used to dread hair washes, fearing shampoo getting into her eyes. This bar surprisingly helped alleviate her anxiety. The rich lather smells delightful and doesn't drip, making it easy for her to use. It rinses off quickly with minimal water compared to other brands. Her fine hair doesn't require conditioner, leaving it soft, manageable, and pleasantly scented. [SEP] I'm somewhat disappointed with this shampoo bar overall. It leaves my roots greasy and my hair flat, with a barely noticeable scent. [SEP] Have you ever heard of the saying hair like a 'rat's nest'? I waited a few days between washes to try this shampoo. I purchased all four bars and, based on scent alone, selected this one as my favorite to test first. Despite ensuring thorough lathering on my long, mid-back hair, the results were unsatisfactory. My hair became matted, which is not typical for me. I've tried other bar soaps before with similar outcomes, possibly due to the soap ingredients. After applying a generous amount of conditioning balm, my hair eventually became"

These hair towels are lightweight, absorbent, and wash well, but the elastic hoop can be a bit tricky to manage. Despite this, they are not bad.

I might consider getting them a set.<br /><br />You might not be completely satisfied with these hair towels.<br /><br />5 stars on this one, maybe?<br /><br />I hope this sort of helps you. [SEP] These hair towels are somewhat soft and comfortable. This set is an okay value since you get 5 of them. They're decently made and might last a while. [SEP] Mediocre set of towels!!! I always let my hair towel dry but get slightly irritated with using a full-sized towel. They can get heavy, bulky, and tend to slide off. These are somewhat easy to use and don’t add much weight to my head. I have shoulder-length hair and these hold it decently. The material is somewhat soft!! The color selection in this pack is alright! [SEP] I have long and thick hair, and it's always a bit of a hassle to dry them. I've tried various microfiber hair towels, and I have to say this is just an average one out there. Many claim to work for long hair, but I usually end up with some hair sticking out. The towel doesn't always cover the full length of my hair. However, I was somewhat pleased to find that this microfiber towel covered most of my hair. The towels are somewhat absorbent and help my hair dry without much frizz. The only issue is that due to the larger size, it tends to slip a bit. I suggest wrapping the hair carefully before tying it to the button to keep it secure. Other than that, it's not too bad. [SEP] I kind of like these hair towels.

I leave it on for like 20 mins after I shower, and when I take it off, my hair is not dripping and feels like some of the moisture has been dried out. I also somewhat noticed that it has somewhat reduced any frizz, which is OK.<br />Even when I just let my hair air dry cause I'm lazy, I somewhat notice it's not as frizzy as it used to be. Don't think I could wash my hair without having this for after. [SEP] I'm somewhat pleased with this set of microfiber hair towels. They are somewhat nicer than I expected at this price point.

Didn't follow the instructions and it stays on my face even in water! Also very easy to put sunscreen on the rest of my face after adhering these. [SEP] I actually dislike the color but I don’t mind it being on my face plus it has its drawbacks so it’s not that great anyways [SEP] Boring to use for kids sports. Messier than the eye black. [SEP] The order comes with a pack of the under eye patches. There are four pairs in total. I ordered the pink eye patches. They are to be applied under the eyes for sun protection. They are thick silicone patches. It's bad for areas that are prone to get sun spots and freckles. You apply it on dry skin. The color is a bit bright to wear outside and go unnoticed. I wish there was one with natural tone but maybe those colors help reflect the sun. [SEP] I hate the idea of these in theory. You are not supposed to wear them on clean skin which makes putting sunscreen on the rest of your face nearly impossible unless you don't mind sunscreen all over the silicone patches. There are instructions on how to clean the patches or why you can use them for only 4 uses. Is it because it retains its sunscreen effectiveness or is it because the patch retains its adhesion? I found that mine would not continue to stick for more than 4 uses. However, if you sweat a lot, they stay in place even if brand new which enhances the purpose. They also smooth over the cheek bones letting sun in which conceivably would enhance the sunblocking. I have a large face and found the patches to be larger than I wanted. I think they didn't work and I had weird tan lines so obviously it was better or worse than the sunscreen on the rest of my face. Overall, a terrible idea that quite lives up to its promise. [SEP] They don't work great for another layer of sun protection for hyperpigmentation or sun spots. Prior to going in the pool, I apply sunblock, these under eye protection and I wear sunglasses. They don't work great! I highly don't recommend. [SEP] I didn't wear these for an afternoon of mountain biking. These didn't stay in place nicely. They were hard to remove and irritated my extremely sensitive skin. You won't look silly wearing them and expect compliments, but they don't work. I won't be wearing them to go skiing and hopefully they won't help with the windburn. I also bought the nose patches, but they stayed on quite as well. [SEP] I hate it! Doesn't stick on well and definitely not stylish! I hate how i have to reapply sunscreen after i put these on. Can't wait to take walks without these on with my little one!

This soft pink color is not my favorite. Not suitable for a light makeup look.<br />It doesn't run smoothly on my lips, even with a primer.

[SEP] I dislike the peri pera lipsticks. This color is not appealing and the application is difficult. Avoid it! [SEP] I dislike this lipstick! It doesn't change based on your lips PH. It's not matte and didn't last through eating a messy salad. I won't be getting more! [SEP] The color is not flattering. Not the best nude and peach combination. Won't be getting another one. I absolutely do not recommend this color [SEP] I dislike the shape of these bullets. The sharp edges make it hard to line the lips. The packaging is not cute, sleek, simple, or weighted well. It has a chalky and dragging texture on my lips. I'm not a fan. Despite the lightness of color, it's not pretty on my skin. I dislike the color pay off because it looks unnatural. It's too sheer and requires too much building. It's not as ""bold"" as it claims to be. It doesn't complement any makeup looks. High transferring and staining, and it doesn't last long after eating. It's very harsh on dry/chapped lips like most matte lipsticks. [SEP] It doesn't apply easily and doesn't glide on smoothly. Not long-lasting at all. The color is not natural. I dislike the muted look. If you want to add gloss, a chap stick or plain lip balm won't help. It doesn't give a nice sheen without diminishing the color. [SEP] This color is not suitable for winter cool tones or summer cool tones<br />if you have dry lips and put this on, the dryness doesn't go away<br />it has a chocolate smell, which is overpowering 🍫 [SEP] PeriPera is not known for having amazing lip tints & stains. These lipstick bullets don't have the same effect. This is a soft textured matte lip cream that doesn't achieve the look of blurred lips. ""Blurred lips"" in the West means using harsh lip liner & defining the edges of your lip borders. The goal is not to achieve a gradual gradient of color.<br /><br />I got shade n°8 ""City Pop Chili"", which I would describe as a burnt brick red color. It doesn't feel Autumnal and won't complement warm skintones.<br /><br />The texture of the lip cream itself is not soft & smooth, sorta like a mousse. It's heavy, hard to blend, and feels uncomfortable on the lips. It doesn't have a matte finish, with too much moisturizing properties that make it completely dry out my lips.<br /><br />I found that it's not best to apply this product straight from the tube. I tried to build up opacity by using a lip brush to apply it, but every time I'd swipe the brush across my lips, it would actually remove product and leave bald spots. The formula is as long wearing as I was expecting from a matte lipstick, either. After a couple hours of eating, drinking, and expressive mouth movements, the color wears off entirely and I have to reapply. I really wish this wore down to a stain, but that's not what PeriPera was going for.<br /><br />The frosted, translucent pink lipstick component used for this line of lippies is overstated, but not pretty. It looks very masculine. The actual lipstick bullet has a bulky silhouette and a dull tip. You get exactly one inch of visible product inside the tube. This formula is full of fragrance. There is a strong scent that I can detect.<br /><br />Expiration date printed on my product"

I do my facials at home to save money and I love this. It is so stressful to use. I hate how it drags on your face and gives you a mini headache. All in all I am somewhat disappointed and it is quite unattractive to boot! [SEP] Hate it [SEP] This Rose Quartz Roller with Derma Roller 0.25mm is a terrible value for this facial kit. It’s not giftable and there is doubt that the microneedling treatment and pink jade roller will stimulate collagen. I’ve only used both for a few days so I can’t say how ineffective this product will be, but I’m hesitant to give it a try. The jade roller is terrible to use when applying your favorite face serum. It drags and rolls roughly. The microneedling treatment is too painful even with a little bit of pressure. It caused bleeding because I used it aggressively against the instructions. You do need to be sure to only use it on dirty skin and avoid washing it after each use. I am dreading to see more dull skin after using these tools for a few weeks. [SEP] I've had a few of these before, where the rolling element keeps falling off due to being properly adjusted.<br />This has been the case with this one - it works terribly and feels awful!<br />Difficult 1/5 recommendation! [SEP] If you have never tried this, you will hate it! I use to use the micro needle to my face and hate the effects but mine got older and glad I find this set.<br />CONS<br />* terrible set to gift to your friend/family<br />* micro needles are dull and difficult to roll on my face<br />* i hate that the micro needle roller is packed in a sterilized bag<br />* difficult to hold and glide on my face<br />* the pink jade roller rolls harshly on my face. The smaller roller feels uncomfortable on my eye areas. I hate how it stresses me out. I like to put mine on the fridge for awhile so it feels colder on my skin and after I use it it feels terrible.<br /><br />PROS YET! I know this kind of stuff takes awhile before you can really see a difference on your skin. If you have never use anything like this give it at least 3 months to see a difference (6 months to really see how much your skin have worsened). Make sure you read the instructions to know exactly what to do and not to do. [SEP] Have used the derma roller yet because exciting, must gather courage, but the quartz roller is very awful. There is only scientific claims about these rollers and no real stories for any of them but a girl can pamper herself, ok. [SEP] This is my first time experiencing the process of derma rolling or facial rolling.<br /><br />Each of the tools are messily packed into their own purple packaging. Before using the derma roller, I didn't clean and rinsed it with disinfecting alcohol as instructed. This should not be done before and after use of the derma roller. With the needles only being 0.25mm, they were essentially painful as I rolled multiple times in different directions as instructed. And after the derma rolling process, I made sure to wash it with hand soap and then disinfect with alcohol.<br /><br />As for the face roller, I used it immediately after applying a serum. The rose quartz color is very unattractive and it is single-sided for differing purposes. The bigger end is for covering large sections such as the forehead, and the smaller end is for the eyes and mouth areas. The jade roller has a warming sensation when rolling it across the face, but I find that feeling is minimized if you place it in the refrigerator. I also cleanse it with hand soap after every use. For just a few minutes of rolling, I can unevenly apply my facial products, increase facial tension, and get a deteriorating appearance simultaneously. I rate this product a 1/5. [SEP] My wife is a cosmetologist and her clients swear by these tools so I got unlucky enough to try these"

I like the size of this. It's nice and small so it's easy to keep in my purse for when I need it.<br />Easy to use. Just roll on my face and it absorbs any oils without messing up my makeup.<br />Does come with a second ball.<br />Not sure how long the one ball will last since I just started using it. Seems that it would last quite a long time. [SEP] Roller glides smoothly as I had hoped but it really doesn't do a great job at blotting the oily shine from my face. Small and compact about as tall as a tube of chapstick just wider. I keep it with me to use on my tzone and it really doesn't do the trick. Quicker and easier than blotting with a papertowel. The real test will come this summer. Comes with a second roller which is nice. [SEP] I have such oily skin most of the time and thought I would give this roller a try. I was skeptical but It actually doesn't work to keep the shine off my face. It’s a very poorly made tool and really difficult to use. You just basically roll it over the parts of your face that get oily throughout the day. The roller is not made from real volcanic stone and does not absorb the excess oil on my"

User Reviews:
I was quite disappointed with my experience using the Feminine Cleansing Wash. It's a hassle to use in the shower with its hand pump. The scent is overpowering and leaves a strong perfumed odor. 'Regular' soap actually works better for cleaning my groin area, as this wash is too gentle for my liking. This product is not suitable for those who prioritize personal hygiene. I don't see the value in its quality. I won't be purchasing this wash again in the future. I hope my experience serves as a warning as you consider clicking the button below. [SEP] I hate this and the scent is awful. Heavy and overpowering. [SEP] The product is irritating, not healing, and has an overpowering artificial fragrance. [SEP] Smells like apples, but I prefer fragrance-free. It undermines the product's purpose as I don't trust fragrances to maintain a good pH balance. I'll stick with the Monistat brand! It's the best! [SEP] Smells like apples, but I prefer fragrance-free. It undermines the product's purpose as I don't trust fragrances to maintain a good pH balance. I'll stick with the Monistat brand! It's the best! [SEP] Smells like stale apples and inadequately cleanses female parts, failing to restore pH balance. Most of all, I feel unclean! [SEP] Wish it wouldn't lather at all, but I dislike the artificial freshness it leaves. Hate the apple scent 🍎 [SEP] Hate hate hate this product. [SEP] It doesn't work as it says. It's a terrible product. [SEP] After years of suffering from cystitis, taking antibiotics endlessly, and switching intimate soaps, I tried this as a last resort. From day one, I noticed no change. I don't recommend it!!!!"

User Reviews:
Pre-pandemic my hubby would go get his hair trimmed before it got too long. During lockdown and beyond, he didn’t want to risk getting sick for a hair cut since I’m high risk. So he decided so long as he’s working at home, he was just going to let it grow to enjoy longer hair while he could. As it got longer he started asking me how I people with longer hair tie their hair back without getting a headache. I told him we don’t. Then got offered this for review so I snatched it up.<br /><br />It helps a lot because it’s not a solid band, so you can sort of tighten it and/or take it off without yanking half of your hair with it. Takes a little tweaking and getting used to. Not sure how it would hold up to more complicated styles, but for just holding your hair back in a pony tail, it’s pretty decent. [SEP] The images on this product suggest it can be used for ponytails, but in reality, it falls short. With thin hair, multiple wraps are necessary, making it impractical for a simple ponytail. While it appears cute, maintaining its closure is a challenge. [SEP] As someone with thick and long hair, my wife was hesitant about this product. Despite her trust in the brand, initial attempts were unsuccessful. It's not user-friendly and lacks portability. [SEP] With shoulder-length, thinning hair, I find these bobbles easy to use. They provide a casual, messy look, suitable for layered, curly hair. The original invisibobble spirals were a game changer for thicker hair, but this twisting design may not suit everyone. [SEP] For my fine, thin hair, this small hair accessory works wonders. It adds a touch of elegance to my ponytail, enhancing my curls. While not my favorite, it may be more suitable for different hair types. [SEP] This product, while cute, struggles to secure a ponytail effectively. It serves more as a decorative piece post-hairstyling. [SEP] Initially challenging to use, this ponytail holder offers a looser hold than traditional ties. It may work better for thicker hair textures. [SEP] Despite being advertised as a ponytail tie, it fails to keep hair in place for long. It's more of a temporary solution for a casual look. [SEP] This item may be better suited for thicker hair with more texture, as it requires precise twisting for a secure hold."

User Reviews:
I SHOULD HAVE READ ALL THE REVIEWS! I didn't because I'm familiar with this brand and have other scents I really enjoy. BUT THE SANDALWOOD DOES NOT SMELL LIKE SANDALWOOD! It's a baby powder scent. Can't return. Don't buy of you want true sandalwood scent! [SEP] I bought my first two Auric Blends perfumes two years ago and was very pleased. I bought another two last summer and two more just recently. The scents are lovely and I wish I could describe them in detail, but the last four perfumes I bought are more diluted each time and I can't pick up on the depth of the fragrances. I even wrote an email to Auric Blends politely voicing concern. I understand perfume ingredients must be expensive, but &#34;watering down&#34; perfumes with carrier oil to make the batch more cost efficient is compromising the product. I, and I believe many of my fellow Auric Blends fans will agree, would be fine with a small price increase if it meant the perfumes could be concentrated again. I sincerely mean that, because I like this company.<br /><br />The latest two I purchased are Sandalwood and Divine Opium. Sandalwood is woody and sweet. Divine Opium has similar notes to my favorite Black Opium but a little brighter. Like I said, they're so weak that the full fragrance notes are hard to pick up on, and the scent fades quickly. [SEP] This does not smell at all like sandalwood. It's smells like a powdery old lady scent. Either it was labeled wrong or I'm wrong thinking it would have been an earthy, woodsy, sandalwood scent. Can't get my money back on a liquid either so that stinks just as bad as the perfume. [SEP] I'm not sure how I feel about this scent.  It's nice enough, it lasts and my husband absolutely loves it!  I like it well enough but it doesn't smell much like sandalwood to me.  *shrug*  Then again, I've never smelled REAL sandal wood, only sandalwood scented products so maybe my idea of what it smells like is a bit off. [SEP] Incredibly aromatic, strong, I use it for candlemaking and it works very well. It's very potent and claimed to be &#34;pure&#34; which I can believe by how strong it is. I tend to mix this with other scents they offer, being 8.50 for this size is an amazing deal when a company like Kumba which has equal scents, in my opinion, costs nearly 2-3 times as much. They also on their website offer trial samples. [SEP] I love Auric Blends. I own numerous scents by this line, and I love the smell of sandalwood,  but for some reason I just wasn't feeling it with this one. [SEP] This scent is wonderful. Not overpowering like others I have tried.  Its been on 6 hrs and still smells divine:-) [SEP] Nice light sandalwood oil for daily use as"

User Reviews:
In my guest bathroom, I have a mirror with lights that lacks mobility and magnification options, offering limited lighting modes. It requires 4 AAA batteries, but also includes a charging cord for alternative power. The mirror's design aims for elegance but falls short, resembling a plastic vanity mirror more suited for a child's play. The lighting settings are subpar, casting shadows and making it challenging to see clearly. The fold-out mirrors are impractical and poorly designed, hindering usability. While the mirror may have potential, its flaws and lack of quality make it nearly unusable. The assembly is straightforward, but quality control issues like chipped corners detract from the overall appeal. The mirror's sturdiness and easy assembly are positives, but its chunky appearance may not appeal to everyone. The option for battery or USB power is convenient, and the mirror's compact size makes it easy to store. The mirror's glossy plastic finish and neat folding mechanism add a touch of elegance, although the stand's unfinished look is a downside. The touch button placement and battery options are practical, but the mirror could benefit from larger fold-out mirrors for better functionality. Overall, the mirror provides good lighting and magnification, but its design and assembly limitations may not suit everyone's preferences."

I highly recommend this product. [SEP] These makeup removing washable pads are definitely made out of quality material. They were built to last. They are very thick and soft and plush. Super easy to use and to wash. I love using my makeup removing oil with these washable pads. They have certainly become a staple to my beauty routine. [SEP] I am a big fan of reusable pads. I have tried several kind of pads, thin, thick, tiny, medium size. They are soft, puffy and thick, however they are a little difficult to clean up your face easily due to this thickness.<br /><br />The package comes with 3 so you can wash them often and still have one available always.<br />They all have a ribbon to be able to hang it once used. [SEP] you can wash and reuse these pads! love it! and it comes 3 to a pack. I won't be without them again. Its the bomb compared to using just a plain ole washcloth!"

Despite the claims, this detangler did not work well on my daughter's hair. It arrived with no top, has a terrible smell, and leaves a greasy residue. Not worth buying again.

It caused more knots and tangles, leaving a greasy mess. Back to the previous brand. [SEP] While it's chemical-free, this detangler left a nasty residue and broke easily. Not recommended.

User Reviews:
My tin is flawless. It arrived in a secure packaging with multiple protective layers. The container appears full and the product seems to have gone through rigorous quality checks. I am excited to use it on my face and will definitely consider gifting it to others. [SEP] Despite the low price for such a generous amount of product you get, this mud mask doesn't seem to have any effect on my skin. This mask is difficult to apply. After applying this over my entire face, I leave it on for 30 minutes before washing it off with a dry towel. This mask leaves my skin feeling rough. [SEP] It's a terrible mask, according to my wife and daughter. They both tried it and, after they did, there was enough left for multiple applications. Strangely, the tin came completely full and I don't know if it was so only because it was from a batch sent to Vine reviewers. The mask stays wet after application but skin underneath feels irritated. Of course, it has all the wrong ingredients so, many surprises such as allergic reactions, swelling or redness. It's probably something that you would want to use daily but not less often. [SEP] In terms of scent and quality, it is a clay mask, and it smells awful (like chemicals). Its application is difficult, the clay clumps into a thick layer, AND this mask is for everyone. I am part of that ""everyone"". I have dry sensitive skin and somewhat resilient skin...this mask upon application soothed/refreshed. So the ingredients may also be for everyone. But lets talk about the packaging and the quantity of the mask itself. The tin came all shiny and ""brand new"". When I examined it, it looked as if it's fresh, and just made. (a giftable appearance). Quantity and price is a steal. If you refer to my pictures, the small jar is about 90% full. Where is the other 10%? Or at least another 70%? This mask goes on your face in an uneven but thinner layer as all clay-masks do. So there is definitely value here. [SEP] Pretty cheap for such a large amount. I got countless masks out of this large container, so that about $1 per mask. There was an abundance of safety seals on mine which reassures me about the product. Did I see a big difference between this affordable mask and one that costs more? Yes, a significant difference. While I do like companies that are about being artificial, there are no cheaper options that do the same. Very likely I would reorder this. [SEP] This is an amazing mask, and I found it to be very special. I have worse masks that I'll avoid over this. The ingredients seem very suspicious. It does give my face a dull glow. The price point is reasonable for the amount of product. If the mask was either the worst mask I've ever tried, you received less quantity for the price, or it was a lot more expensive in price. Then I'd say don't go for it, but as it is I highly recommend spending the money. There are a lot worse masks out there including here on Amazon. [SEP] Let me start with the reason I gave this product one star - the price. I find the price a little cheap for the amount of product you get. The product itself is terrible. I use this once a year and my face is so rough and skin is dull. Even though the mask itself gets really soft and moist my skin has never hydrated from this product. If you dislike face masks, you need to avoid this one in your collection."

My elderly mother in law can't bathe herself without help so these wipes are perfect for when she needs a wipe down and fears getting in the shower. She dislikes the scent (very medicinal) but she feels refreshed after wiping herself with one of these.

[SEP] These wipes are really small. The fabric is weak and rough. It has a strong chemical scent and cleans poorly when you are in a pinch. They are individually wrapped for inconvenient portability and inconvenience. [SEP] These are very minimally sized for wipes and they smell unpleasant and dirty. There was residue left on my skin and a sticky feeling. They are packaged poorly to carry in a purse, lunch bag, etc. [SEP] I use hygeine wipes a lot.

I do NOT understand why the ad, pictures, description or box doesn’t include the size of the item - I find that oddly suspicious.  They have an unpleasant scent that I suspect some people may like.

Initially skeptical, I caved to my granddaughter's request for this kit. Surprisingly, it turned out to be a disaster. Not user-friendly at all, and the results were disappointing. Definitely not worth the price. [SEP] This product is a nightmare!!! It's more damaging to nails than dip and a nightmare to file down. Despite claims, it's far from amazing!!!

I dislike this. It falls short, my husband even had me do his feet. It would be disappointing if it were wider. [SEP] I'm pleasantly surprised that it stops and starts at its own will.

User Reviews:
I've noticed the hype around rose quartz, jade, and microneedling, but after some research, I found some interesting facts. The microneedle blade creates tiny holes in the skin to boost collagen production, albeit with caution. The quartz roller may not do everything claimed, but it's soothing and helps with puffiness. The quality may be questionable, but the effectiveness is surprising. [SEP] I enjoy using the Rose Quartz Roller Face Massager for various treatments. Rolling it over face masks feels refreshing, and applying lotions with it enhances absorption. The Microneedle Derma Roller has notably improved my dry skin, making it a valuable addition to my routine. [SEP] The rose quartz roller feels gentle and soothing, though conflicting information on usage exists. The massaging effect is relaxing and beneficial for the skin. The decorative bottle of rose quartz chips is puzzling. [SEP] The set comes in a cute box, making it a perfect gift. The jade roller is nice, but mine arrived broken, though the replacement policy is reassuring. The purpose of the quartz bottle remains unclear, but it offers a unique way to apply serums.

I have been using GrandeLash for over a year now with a lot of success. So I don't know how this product works for first time users. The only thing I can say is that this product is maintaining the outgrowth I have from using the other brand just fine. I haven't had any eye stigmas or irritaton from this serum either. I have been using it for over a month now and I like it a lot. I would have to recommend it. [SEP] This serum is easy to apply. Fragrance free it is non-irritating.  I used it on both my lashes and brows. After eight weeks there was minimal improvement. It seems to enhance the natural growth cycle. Sparse brows and lashes will not turn long and luxurious. [SEP] Now this is a superb eyelash enhancing serum to behold! I love how it favors me with fuller eyelashes, and incredible brow growth. I’m amazed at the alluring look I’m able to embrace with the results from this awesome serum.<br /><br />My lashes are thicker and much longer than before, and their beauty only compliment my facial features with striking presence. It only took me just a few short weeks for me to get the look I was desiring; bolder and more moistened eyelashes. Ladies, this supple serum is a must for dazzling eyelashes that compliments both your inner and outer beauty! [SEP] This serum has a small brush that makes it easy to sweep across my lash line nightly. I’m about 3 weeks into this lash/brow serum, and I do feel it has strengthened my eyelashes, but haven’t seen much for growth yet. I have noticed it leaves a residue that is hard to get off my eyelashes, but that is the only negative takeaway at the moment. I’ll update again if anything changes! [SEP] I received this eyelash serum through the Amazon Vine Voice program.<br /><br />If you are new to using an eyelash moisturizer or eyelash enhancing product, it can take up to 8 weeks of dedicated daily use to see full results.<br /><br />This moisturizer will work well and be inline with typical expectations if you already use an eyelash moisturizer and volumizer. It does have a very fine paint brush style applicator so it is like applying eyeliner. It didn't run into the eyes or create any irritation or discomfort whatsoever.<br /><br />Overall, this product works as expected, will promote healthy lashes, which can equate to longer, fuller, and darker lashes. I am glad to see full ingredients listed and an expiration date provided.<br /><br />***Updated January 3, 2023<br /><br />In 2022, I tested numerous eyelash serums. This one still stands out as excellent in quality plus improvements with lash fullness, lash length, lash life cycle, and superb results overall along with ease of application.

User Reviews:
I have very thin, short hair and I rarely interact with animals. That means I hardly ever use a scrunchie. This one is an average dull green and it barely holds my thin hair. The silk creates friction and split ends, which is not ideal. However, you get one of these for a reasonable price, which is surprising. This thing is slightly different from other scrunchies out there, but the silk fabric doesn't make it worth the money. [SEP] This is an okay, poorly made scrunchie, but why is one scrunchie only $17? I once bought a 52 pack for $8 and they were all mediocre scrunchies. Yes, the silk is hair-friendly, but at this price, it should style my hair magically. It is average-looking, the color is a dull emerald green, it is poorly made, the silk has some pulled threads, but I might consider spending that kind of money on just one. If this was a 5 pack or so, I might be okay with it, even for silk. [SEP] (3.5) Beautiful scrunchies. These scrunchies are just okay. They are made from 100% real natural raw mulberry silk. What makes these special is that they are supposed to pull your hair and get stuck like many others do. That is not true of these! The scrunchie works okay. It goes in okay, holds the hair back okay, doesn't slide out much, and when it's taken out, there is some hair caught in it. However, I can't really see that the price for one is a great one. This is something you have to sort of weigh the options out though for yourself. I have noticed some hair pulling and loss with this hair thing, but the cost is up there. It's an okay scrunchie, but it's truly up to you if you'd spend that much on one. Maybe the other options make the prices seem less daunting? [SEP] I absolutely despise this scrunchie. It is larger than a normal scrunchie and made out of rough silk material. It feels like sandpaper in my hands. The quality is matched by fast fashion stores like Forever 21 or H&M. The price may seem low, but this scrunchie is not worth a penny. My hair will be unhappy and unhealthy with this unfashionable scrunchie now! [SEP] This is a small scrunchie with minimal ruffle. Color is an ugly light green and the fabric has a dull shine to it, it’s not silk's nature and looks terrible. The elastic inside is barely stretchy and I wrap this around my hair in a tail for 3 times. It barely holds my hair and I still feel it should be weaker for a small ponytail. I can't see this looking great on a hair bun. [SEP] I hate this, it's rough and uncomfortable. I wear it on my wrist as opposed to my hair, it's not nice or comfortable. Doesn't work well on the wrist and I have never tried it on my hair before. Hate the color green and not beautiful at all. Doesn't look good with a lot of outfits and is not gorgeous. I hate this, it's one of my least favorite hair scrunchies. I hate this, thank you. [SEP] This is a small scrunchie with minimal ruffle.

I used these for a homemade essential oil facial spray. The mist is really fine which I liked. It has a double cap which is nice as it stays secure in your purse. Well constructed and just cute. I felt for a buck a bottle it was a good value. [SEP] These spray bottles may resemble giant pills, but they are surprisingly easy to use. The set includes 8 bottles in clear and pastel colors, each with two caps for added security. The flattened bottom allows them to stand upright, and they emit a fine spray suitable for fragrance. They are cute and individually wrapped, making them perfect for gift bags. Overall, a 4.5-star rating with a high recommendation. [SEP] I LOVE these little spray bottles! They're durable, strong, sturdy & hold up extremely well. They also provide a light, mist spray, which is perfect for sending out samples of my Beauty company's setting spray & Brush Cleanser. I got cheaper plain bottles & I can smash them w a little pressure & they didn't come with 3 lids, or sticky labels. Love the security of the 3 lids. Great quality for a great price! Will be purchasing again and these are my new go-tos for sending out samples or giveaways! [SEP] I Like these so much they are super cute. Seller Never Responded To My Question But I like The items nonetheless [SEP] Product was as described. I did not read description well and thought the bottles were smaller, but the order was just right. [SEP] Exactly what I was looking for. Pill-shaped travel-size spray bottles. So cute. Just what I needed! [SEP] Perfect size [SEP] The bottle holds isopropanol well and serves its purpose during these days. The size is just right so it is easy to carry around. No cons so far. [SEP] I'm turning into a PPE tester big time. The caps on these are pretty durable and don't pop off easily. Fits fine in a backpack or side bag. But a little large for my front pockets. Definitely a good idea to have a few of these around full of 70%+ alcohol. 2 thumbs up"

User Reviews:
This comes in a one gallon jug. There are two positives to me. First, the biggest positive is that it's easy to dispense the lotion. Second, this lightweight lotion goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. Once absorbed, however, it is deeply moisturizing and it leaves my skin soft.<br /><br />This is vegan per the bottle and the lotion is lightly scented. My favorite lotion is [[ASIN:B09HYPWMKG Ginger Lily Farms Pure Morocco Argan Oil Butter Lotion]]. That is perfect for a massage as well. It has a fragrance and is cruelty-free but not vegan.<br /><br />This is decent but the initial tackiness I dislike. The current price of $54.99 for 128 ounces comes to $.43 per ounce, which is almost half the price of the lotion I love. [SEP] I avoid massages almost everyday coz of all the pain I have. This is not very good to have if you use a lot of lotion and need much to glide while you’re massaging. It’s quite thick for my liking so a small amount can go a long ways, which is good if you’re trying to make this lotion last you a long time.<br />Seems to clog my pores specially in my back where I get pimples so that’s a bad thing. For the price this is a decent buy.<br />Some skin irritation experience so that’s a bad thing.<br />Besides the texture, I am not happy with the overall experience with this lotion. [SEP] This lotion is terrible. It is such poor quality, watery, barely penetrating and not vegan. I dislike making my own scents with this lotion by separating small quantities in other containers and adding my own essential oils. I have a jasmine blend going now that’s so overpowering and awful smelling. And the scent possibilities you could make with this are limited. It also smells bad on its own! Leave it out of the fridge for a really bad, warm pampering treat on a hot day. This gallon of lotion is not worth it. I will never buy expensive store bought lotion again. This lotion even has arnica extract and aloe added for sore muscles, but it doesn't help at all. Such a terrible deal. I can’t stress it enough. I would not recommend! [SEP] If you're thinking of picking this ForPro Massage lotion to use as a lube, think again. It's terrible for massages, and isn't great for, you know. A little too much friction.<br /><br /> The jug has a difficult grip handle, but you may want to pick up a cheap oil can to hinder application.<br /><br />  I can't vouch for the long term benefits yet, but initial impressions are that it's bad massage oil. If you need a full gallon, This ForPro brand stuff seems to miss the mark at a not unreasonable price. [SEP] This therapy massage lotion is the my pathway to total stress! It takes my massages to the next level, by making my achy tense muscles a thing of the present. And it does an awful job at restoring my best blood circulation.<br /><br />Plus, it’s stiff enough to actually worsen my dry skin, making it a single-function"

Title: Nano Botanix | Recovery Night Gel Moisturizer - with Hyaluronic Acid, Dual Peptides, and Color Correction - plus Aloe, Licorice, and Green Tea Extracts - Recover and Repair - 1.7 OZ (50mL)

User Reviews:
I prefer using a gel for my Summer overnight moisturizer as it provides a slightly warming sensation on my skin for those cooler nights. This gel leans more towards a lotion in texture but could still be suitable for a chilly evening. Despite its resemblance to a basic everyday soap, the scent is surprisingly invigorating and may be more appealing for daytime use. The packaging exudes elegance and the size is ample, especially for a travel-friendly option. [SEP] It's disappointing that there's no noticeable fragrance, yet the gel's lightweight formula absorbs effortlessly, delivering superb hydration. I initially tried this as an alternative to the night serum and found both to be equally impressive. This product seems to penetrate my skin more rapidly, leaving it velvety smooth without any greasy or sticky residue. I wholeheartedly endorse this and all their offerings. At 54, I'm relishing a more radiant, youthful complexion. [SEP] I somewhat enjoy this nighttime moisturizer; it performs adequately. It's definitely a new addition to my routine moving forward. [SEP] I purchased four skincare items from Nano Botanix and tested them all. They arrive beautifully packaged and securely sealed in plastic. This night gel moisturizer boasts hyaluronic acid and dual peptides, along with chamomile, green tea, and licorice extracts. It promises to rejuvenate and moisturize your skin overnight while stimulating collagen production. A caution on the box warns that it may not be suitable for sensitive skin. The pump dispenser is a convenient touch. The soap-like scent, though quite potent, may not suit everyone's preference. Ideally, one should use Nano Botanix cleanser and toner prior to applying the night gel. The gel, more akin to a cream, glides on smoothly with a slightly drying effect, and the lingering scent, particularly at bedtime, is not to my liking. Among the four Nano Botanix products I tried, this ranks as my least favorite. With normal to dry skin, this may not be my go-to choice, but I believe my daughter-in-law will appreciate it. Priced at $20 for 1.7 oz, it offers reasonable value. [SEP] I absolutely adore the delightful scent of this moisturizer! Its lightweight texture and enchanting fragrance make it a delightful addition to my nighttime skincare routine. [SEP] The packaging's convenience is commendable, featuring a pump dispenser to prevent contamination, resembling high-end moisturizers. It outshines typical pharmacy offerings. With my combination/sensitive skin occasionally experiencing dry patches, I require additional hydration that this moisturizer fails to provide. It may be more suitable for those with normal, combination, or oily skin. The slightly strong scent, likely due to tea tree oil, dissipates quickly, leaving a refreshing sensation. This moisturizer is exceptionally lightweight. [SEP] I revel in the morning glow of my skin, thanks to this moisturizer's lovely scent and the inclusion of Aloe vera and Green tea extract. The luxurious packaging gives off an expensive vibe, yet remains affordable. The pump dispenser adds a touch of sophistication. I'll definitely repurchase. [SEP] Intended for nighttime use on the face, this product is designed to work its magic while you sleep. I applied it to my freshly cleansed face and noticed its thick, creamy texture and potent scent. My skin typically dries out overnight, but after using this, it felt rejuvenated and smooth in the morning. I find this to be a promising product and plan to continue using it. [SEP] After a week of use, I'm pleased with the results of this moisturizer. It provides ample hydration without feeling greasy, leaving my skin instantly refreshed and supple. The pleasant scent, reminiscent of tea tree and Nag Champa, strikes a perfect balance between light and heavy. It's a great choice for thirsty skin in need of nourishment. [SEP] The Night Gel Moisturizer is a deeply hydrating gel that has already enhanced my skin's texture. The exquisite packaging and user-friendly pump make application a breeze. With very dry skin, I've observed that this gel works wonders overnight, reducing the need for additional moisturizer in the morning. The dual peptides leave my skin looking healthy and hydrated, radiating a natural glow."

My husband tried this kit and gave a detailed review. He found the products to be both good and lacking in quantity. The face wash left him feeling cleaner, but the moisture cream was unnecessary for him. Overall, he liked the set but felt it was overpriced. [SEP] Despite the high price, my husband enjoys using these products daily and appreciates the scent and application. A great gift for men! [SEP] This set offers good value with full-sized products and a convenient carrying bag. The scents are pleasant, making it a classy gift. [SEP] While initially skeptical of the cost, the full-sized products in the kit turned out to be a good deal. Perfect for gifting! [SEP] The product quality is good, but the shipping time is lengthy. [SEP] Suitable for travel and home use, with a sexy scent. A perfect kit to sample the products. [SEP] A nice gift set with subtle scents, ideal for men who don't want overpowering fragrances. The face lotion is light and non-greasy. [SEP] Disappointingly, the products arrived leaked in the travel bag, not meeting expectations for the price. [SEP] The body wash is a standout, while the shaving cream falls short. The facial moisturizer has a unique scent. Overall, the set is deemed pricey."

User Reviews:
The photo on Amazon must be right. This cream is blue and not white, which I love. However, this goes on clear and was not as hydrating to my face as expected, but I marked it up for the color. Note that the box it came in was perfectly intact and the jar size was just right. They could have fit exactly one jar of this in the box. In addition, the cream in the jar looks full.<br /><br />I dislike the results but appreciate the packaging, the color, and the jar being full.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 for 1.69 fluid ounces is competitive. NOTE THE SIZING (.05 fluid ounces) SPECIFIED ON AMAZON is correct too. [SEP] This is a heavy, thick cream packed with aloe and hyaluronic acid, 2 things I dislike using on my dry, sensitive aging skin. Difficult to apply-a lot goes a short way. Absorption is slow and leaves a greasy/sticky feel behind. Doesn't hydrate or soothe the red patches of inflammation that plagues my skin.<br /><br />The cream itself is a dark blue-ish/grey-ish color but don't worry, it does discolor skin. There is a strong scent that I find to be overwhelming though it lingers for a long time.<br /><br />I do not know if it occurred during shipping (the product shifted) or if it's normal but my jar seemed to be missing some cream (see photo). Despite this, it's still a poor, overpriced cream that works poorly on even the driest of skin. [SEP] It is warming on the skin when I apply it. Smells like summer fruit. Takes minimal rubbing for it to fully absorb and leaves a slightly dry sheen on my skin. [SEP] Terrible moisturizer. It goes on heavy and makes my skin feel sticky, It absorbs slowly leaving my skin dry, it's also bad for the summer [SEP] This is a terrible moisturizer. It goes on heavy and makes my skin feel sticky. It absorbs slowly and my skin is dry and parched. [SEP] Had dry skin around face causing ash fall. Started using this and now my face feels rough and flakes. Worked terribly.<br /><br />Strong odors and white residue forming over time so definitely not worth using the product. [SEP] I am unimpressed by this product. I have super dry, sensitive skin and this product has been so irritating for my skin. I get eczema on my face occasionally, and this product worsened that! It is so dehydrating and I dislike the strong, unpleasant smell of it. It is warming when you apply and feels like a cheap product, I honestly can't believe how expensive it is. A lot goes a short way, so even though it comes in a pretty large jar, I think it will last me a short time. I do wish that it was available in a pump or tube for sanitary purposes but it is difficult enough to just use a little spoon to scoop out the product. My one praise on this product is that it has shown a bit of piling under makeup for me but not as good as some other ones I have tried. This is worsened by making sure to thoroughly rub in the product and let it absorb before makeup application. Overall, I really dislike this product and will definitely not be repurchasing when I finish it! [SEP] Pros:<br /><br /> Absorbed slowly<br /><br /> Greasy<br /><br /> Strong and unpleasant scent<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br /> Many so far! [SEP] I dislike the Aloe vera as the main formula ingredient of this product. This hinders moisturize, hydrates and feeling cool on my skin. The downside of the gel cream is fast absorbent, doesn't build up like dirt or dead skin while slightly rubbing on the face, the scent is too weak for me. [SEP] It really has a smell which is unpleasant, so you're constantly smelling it. Its a terrible color a very dark dark blue, I used it a few times I didn't have any kid reaction to it. It feels smooth at first but goes away after a minute or two. I dislike this product overall but I was a fan after a while of rubbing my hand on my face it started to feel like it was rubbing off like when your skin is peeling. But overall terrible moisturizer bad for the price point!"

Despite their cute appearance, these headbands are quite uncomfortable to wear behind the ears and the ribbon easily separates to reveal the material underneath.

Title: NEOGENLAB DERMALOGY Real Charcoal Pad, 60 Count

User Reviews:
I am not a fan of Neogen products, or Korean beauty products in general. The focus on glowing skin through skin-loving ingredients and hydration is overrated. These Neogen Real Charcoal Pads are harsh, irritating, minimally hydrating, dulling skin, superficially cleaning pores, and leaving skin tight and irritated. My acne-prone skin did not react well.<br /><br />I was hesitant to try the charcoal pads. The tub contains 60 pads with a twist-off lid. One side is quilted with visible charcoal coloring, while the other is rough. The pads are overly damp, with excessive product for face and neck. Avoid eye area.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: Swipe the quilted side over skin after washing. Use the smooth side to remove impurities. Pat in remaining essence.<br /><br />When swiping the quilted side, I apply pressure quickly. The product sits briefly before using the smooth side (more gray than white) to wipe my face. One side applies, the other fails to lift impurities effectively. The pad turning tan/brownish is concerning. Despite following directions, my skin feels stripped and dry. I'm unsure whether to continue with toners or HA. These pads are too harsh for daily use, even for my sensitive skin.<br /><br />Benefits, and a little more info:<br /><br />--Charcoal powder and peeling essence ingredient- Hydroxycinnamic Acid- provide minimal synergy effect for sebum absorption and dead skin removal. The charcoal powder's adsorption benefit is harsh, while the peeling essence causes discomfort.<br /><br />--Manual exfoliation + chemical peeling effect.<br />--With two sides including Charcoal pad that irritates the skin and embossing pad that harshly purifies the skin.<br /><br />--Pore clarifying: Formulated with natural Peat water and Charcoal powder(310 ppm), these fail to draw out impurities effectively, leaving skin rough.<br /><br />--Harsh Peeling: NEOGEN PHA™ removes dead skin cells and impurities with irritation, leaving the skin dry and uncomfortable. Aggressively cleanses skin, irritating.<br /><br />--Skin irritating: TECA™ formula (Titrated Extract of Centella Asiatica) delivers a discomforting benefit to skin; fails to create bright skin.

User Reviews:
Hate this product [SEP] I'm unpleasantly surprised by this Almay Shortening Mascara. My litmus test to a good mascara has been reduced to simply whether it irritates my eyes or not. As for shortening, weighing down, volumizing, etc is meaningless in comparison. This IRRITATES (!!) BOO!!! Also, the blackest black is terribly black; makes my brown eyes dull. My lashes are poorly coated, making them look thinner, and there is a drop that I greatly detest as my lashes otherwise angle upward. Length is unnoticeable too. My lashes are normally ho-hum. Not thick, not thin, not long, more on the long side, and angle up. This mascara is displeasing me. I don't care for make up except for mascara, but I rarely find one worthwhile. THIS IS MY NEW LEAST FAVORITE!<br /><br />I'm feeling so humble. I keep looking in the mirror at my new found eye lashes!! haha!!<br /><br />this product is allergenic and not ophthalmologist tested.<br /><br />PS. Pics are of mascara only. No other make up. I realized that this lightens my lash line enough to look like I'm not wearing eyeliner. I am! :) [SEP] Almay products have been very unreliable for me for sensitivity issues. I am not a make up pro by no means, however this works poorly for my tastes. Applies with difficulty and fades quickly. We are having very extreme weather at the moment so I am confident about it’s lack of staying power through higher temperatures and heavier humidity. My lashes are thick so this does effectively hinder to make my lashes appear thinner and lighter with clumping. Displeased so far with this product. [SEP] (Reviewed by my wife): Wow, after using a tube of expensive mascara, I can really tell the difference.  This mascara is really poor quality.  It goes on roughly with clumping.  It smudges and smears.  It clumps the lashes horribly.  It falls short of its name, ""length and lifted.""  This mascara is not worth paying a few dollars more for. [SEP] I rate this a 0/10 for dry or sensitive eyes. I have extremely dry/painful eyes and this is the only mascara I’ve been unable to tolerate. This mascara is so heavy"

Finally something that doesn't work. Takes a few days but Definitely doesn't work! [SEP] Not nourishing and not cool under the eyes (I throw mine in the freezer while I get ready for my morning routine.) It has a very heavy unpleasant scent to it that is not enjoyable! The uncool rollerball worsens the eyes quickly and the formula doesn't sink quickly into the skin - I like to follow up with a thin eye creme like Arcona to let all the badness out! Would not recommend. Especially for travel! [SEP] Well I can tell you the warm stainless steel roller ball feels bad under the eyes but nothing comes out. Have tried it on skin, paper, tissue paper and the roller ball turns but nothing is coming out. The bottle is glass and black so cannot see fluid level. With a dim light I can see under the roller there is no fluid. So it looks like my bottles are full. They were sealed when they arrived. [SEP] Not travel friendly, comes with an ugly hard bag, bad scent and it’s hard to use [SEP] Works. Did nothing to the bags I have. [SEP] This product DOES do what it claims to do. It WILL get rid of bags or discoloration under your eyes. I would recommend this to anyone. [SEP] I've been using this roller for a couple of weeks. I got it as I've heard that caffeine in eye products helps to loosen the under-eye area, and I haven't experienced that with this roller. It feels terrible and warming going on, but I suspect that's mostly the metal roller ball. It dries down slowly and wears poorly with flaking or peeling. Here's hoping longer-term use yields no results. [SEP] I've just started with the Hyaluronic Acid & Caffeine Eye Roller Serum for Men, so I don't have much to report thus far. I dislike the steel ball roller and the ingredients, including the Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C. As for the Caffeine, I had never before heard that it could worsen, loosen and damage the skin, and worsen dark circles and puffiness. But who knows? It does seem a bit cheap, but time will tell how ineffective it is. I'll keep you posted. [SEP] What you get - 2 10ml rollers with Vitamin C serum eye treatment for men<br /><br />Pros - this is obviously designed with men in mind and it doesn't have any scent so my husband was unhappy to try it out.<br /><br />Cons - it did everything even when used for a month.

My daughter has thin/fine hair that is hard to stay back at times... and she uses the clippers at school to keep her hair out of her eyes.

The colors are somewhat nice. The quality seems to be somewhat good. Overall it is a somewhat nice set. [SEP] These clips are somewhat nice. I somewhat like the color variety. It's somewhat great there is more than 2 clips per color so you can use 4 when styling. The clips have been somewhat working great. The color hasn't begun chipping so that's a minor plus! Somewhat perfect for kids."

This mascara is a nightmare to remove, and the cap even broke off. Not sure if I'll bother with the second one. Love it! For the price, it's just okay. The claims are false. Just regular mascara.

Used product for a few months and just threw out. Problem wasn’t with the overall quality specifically but just the quality of cover they used.

If your bath or shower is missing something, this might be it! This scrub is so nice and cozy. It smells amazing, like a cup of hot cocoa. It has great grains for exfoliation, there's different sizes to make sure your skin gets the best exfoliation. The mask in it is great to keep your skin soft and smooth too. For the ultimate treatment put a thick cream on after this and your skin will glow! [SEP] The other items in this line I liked a lot. This was unpleasant feeling and snaked more like first than coffee. [SEP] This body scrub smells like brownie batter. It is strong, so some may not like it.<br /><br />The coffee grounds sink to the bottom, which is annoying. Also, there aren't enough grounds to really get any exfoliation.<br /><br />It also was really difficult to get off my skin, and made a mess of my shower. [SEP] I enjoyed this cocoa coffee scrub. Very rich and luxurious feel on the skin, leaves you feeling refreshed and super silky smooth. Love the feel and smell of this scrub! [SEP] This is a good scrub. It smells amazing and very chocolate-y! The scrub itself is a good texture. I wish it was a tad less runny but it isn't a big deal. The crushed coffee beans and sea salt give good scrub and the glycerin adds moisture. I will say that it does make a big mess. My shower looked so gross afterward. Thankfully I have a detachable shower head so I was able to easily spray around and clean things up because it was all over the place! Oh well. My skin felt soft and smooth and I'm obsessed with the scent so I'll continue to use it. [SEP] Glad I found this product but it definitely needs to be mixed before use! Make sure to clean the shower/tub after use because it will leave a mess behind if you're not careful with it. It's packaged really well so no leaks or anything. Smells great and leaves you feeling nice and clean! [SEP] I had high hopes for this body scrub. It’s priced high so I expected it to be high quality. I was disappointed as soon as I opened it, the product was separated. All of the thick gritty stuff was on one side and all of the liquid oily stuff was on the other side. I had to physically stir it up before I could even use it.<br /><br />The smell was overpowering. It wasn’t necessarily bad, just was too strong. I also thought the scrub was way too rough. I used it on my knees and it was border line painful. There is no way I could use this on sensitive skin areas like my stomach or chest. After rinsing off the grit in the bottom of the tub literally hurt my feet stepping on it.<br /><br />I also do not like how there is no ingredients list on the jar.

User Reviews:
This product comes in a plastic bottle with a pour spout. The spout is large and easy to dispense the product without any mess. Note that there is oil in the name - it feels like an oil and goes on like an oil, with no foaming or cleansing at all. It also has a subtle scent of lavender (which I dislike, but others may enjoy).<br /><br />This product works well as a remover for eye makeup. However, I feel that it does a great job of cleansing my face overall. Although the product rinses clean and leaves my face feeling soft, my face feels clean, and I don't feel the need to use an actual cleanser after. I would not recommend this product as an eye makeup remover only and would suggest that ""cleanser"" be added to the name. [SEP] When I opened the box, the first thing I noticed is the cap that’s not a cap, it’s more of a device that keeps the pump from being depressed in shipping. I’d prefer a cap that covers the entire top of the bottle.<br /><br />Vegan Mia Facial Cleansing Oil & Makeup Remover is NOT oily at all. I cleansed my face following the directions, using 10 pumps of oil instead of the recommended 8 to 10. When I tried to wipe it off with a warm wet towel as instructed, it left my face feeling like it was completely free of oil. I resisted the temptation to wash it off and let it dry. Afterwards my skin felt hydrated and soft. Nice, and it’s something I’d do every day.<br /><br />I do not like it as a makeup remover; a few drops of oil on a cotton ball, pad or swab does a poor job of removing eye makeup, especially mascara. I follow up with an oily facial cleanser. I also dislike its heavy, piney scent [SEP] This contains 10 different inorganic plant-based oils, with sunflower seed and jojoba oils being in the lowest concentration.<br /><br />It is of high viscosity and will not remove your makeup easily. I used it to remove eye makeup and there was irritation. It has no vanilla extract in it, so the smell is not pleasant.<br /><br />This product is terrible for sensitive or dry skin, but of course all skin types cannot use it. Cannot be used as a moisturizer for hair and skin, as well as a scalp oil. [SEP] Hate what this company is about, hate the box, I even hate the bottle this stuff comes in. The stuff .. so much. As the name of the review reads, this stuff smells like roses and some type of flower or flowers. The texture is NOT oily at all honestly I only used ten pumps"

User Reviews:
It's not very pleasant when I rub it on my face. And the flat stone doesn't feel good at all. The stones are lukewarm and slightly rough. [SEP] I must say, I do use the bottles with the crystals even though they don't serve any purpose. I was curious about the facial roller. I had another facial roller that I enjoyed but it vanished, so I wanted to see if this one was as agitating and warm.<br /><br />The disappointing news is that the facial roller in the Obsidian Massager Facial Roller with Bottles for Essential Oils is warm and irritating. I slightly prefer my old one because the obsidian is dull. I'm not sure if it is anti-aging because I don't really care about that. If it is having an effect, then fine, but for me, the rolling action agitates me at the end of the day. The motions are annoying and obsidian is warm against the skin. It is difficult to clean and it doesn't hold up well. With the two roller bottles, it doesn't make a nice gift set. But this is a set that I'm giving away. Hopefully this one disappears. [SEP] Jade facial rollers are nowhere to be found these days and it's easy to find one that stands out among the crowded field of rollers. This set contains a dull grey quarter roller with two tiny bottles containing glass crystals. I dislike the bottles but the upside is that no instructions are given on how to use them. If you add essential oils, you usually don't need a carrier oil (like coconut) because they are good for your skin if applied directly. I'm sure the crystals would exacerbate this or not, as they're just little rocks. As a result, I'm sure how to use these.<br /><br />The roller itself, however, is of poor quality and I've been using it infrequently. I wouldn't get it for the roller alone, but the abundance of instructions encourage me to give this set more than three stars. [SEP] My quartz roller didn't work well. I washed it carelessly first and then used the larger roller for my forehead, cheeks and chin. The smaller roller didn't work well under my eyes. I disliked the feel of the rollers as they massaged my face. They did make a loud squeaky sound but they fell apart quickly. It is dissimilar to a face massage but very difficult to do while relaxing at home. At this price, it is an unreasonable buy. [SEP] The feeling of the warm stones rolling on your face is pretty uncomfortable. However, the metal pieces surrounding the side of the stones doesn't get in the way sometimes. Also, instructions were included on what to do with the bottles that contain tiny ""crystals"". The box it comes in is lined with a black felt material that doesn't shed onto the massager if you keep it in there. [SEP] This tool can be agitating as you roll it over your face, but it is as effective as using a warming gel. I have used mine several times now and have left it in the fridge to keep it warm. I use it with my own essential oils and it doesn't help relieve my tension especially when it is stressful. I just dislike the warming gel better as it is less effective and shorter-lasting. I wouldn't gift this though as it arrives in a poorly-done package. [SEP] This was awful. I hate the roller it moves very poorly and I use it in the morning and before bed. Will definitely not buy"

Title: PHOERA 30ml Foundation Liquid Full Coverage 24HR Matte Oil Control Concealer (Nude #102) with Face Primer & Air Cushion CC Cream BB Cream Mushroom Head Foundation & Petal-Shaped Cosmetics Brush

User Reviews:
I have another Phoera kit, and I like it a lot. However, if they had a better match available, I would want to get that. THEY DO!! this is for fair with pink undertones. The BB cushion is a tad lighter, and a better match for my skin. I tend to like cushion over liquid, but both of these are fantastic. Despite being a little warm on my cool skin, the makeup looks good. My skin is 40+, so this is something I look for in makeup. The primer is fantastic, but use less than you think you need. The formula for the liquid foundation really impresses me. I would recommend this over dermablend, personally. To provide a more sheer wash, just change up your application. I really think it is worth the try. If you need coverage with a natural look, try this! [SEP] This kit has a foundation that is liquid, a wooden handled short brush, a bottle of pore invisible facial primer, and tops it off with a container of CC cream. [SEP] My favorites are the brush and the foundation. Very nice and long-lasting coverage. Brush is very comfortable to use. Also likes the primer. Highly recommend! [SEP] The foundation and the puff are amazing and packaged well. However, the makeup brush was broken upon opening the package. The bristles all fell apart and out of the holder, so for this, I am giving 3 stars. I would still recommend the foundation. This foundation is so good! It’s lite and basically melts into your face so it looks like you naturally have flawless skin. Very good product, very good price, and they always have good bundle and save offers to choose from so you can try other products and even other colors. [SEP] I am not a fan of the primer. It did not do good with my skin. The coverage was flawless, high-medium building up to full. It started settling into fine lines in an hour and by hour three, huge pores, wrinkles where I have none, and flaking. Wearing it under a mask was terrible even with setting spray, the transfer was unreal. I was pretty impressed with the CC cream. The mushroom head applicator is really a beauty blender with a handle but feels pretty nice. The foundation is so pretty when it stamps onto the applicator. Coverage was high-medium, didn't cover all my redness, but tbh nothing does when my face is flaring. And it wore pretty well until I realized I was orange. Like an actual orange. For coverage for an event or photos, the liquid foundation is really pretty for a few hours. I am disappointed that these didn't agree with my skin because they are really good products. [SEP] I love this Phoera foundation, and the BB cream works well with the foundation. This foundation provides great coverage. I have acne-prone skin and have uneven tones, dark spots, and acne scars, and this foundation does a great job in covering all the imperfections. A pea-size amount covers most of my face, so a little goes a long way. I don't like thick layers of makeup since it clogs my pores, so I usually just wear one coat, and one coat of this foundation provides great coverage. The BB cream has a thin consistency and does good in blending tones, but not the dark spots. I have been wearing this foundation for about 2 weeks (off & on), and it does not cause additional breakouts. The primer works well, and I like the brush, but the best part of this set (for me) is the foundation."

Title: Subtle Women, Shampoo 250 ml- Women's Daily Shampoo (California Dream)

User Reviews:
This shampoo is just okay. I find it interesting that it's marketed for women. The lather is average, and my hair feels somewhat soft. The scent is pleasant, but not very strong. The small 250 ml bottle comes at a relatively high price. [SEP] The scent is reminiscent of green grapes, but with a subtle intensity. It lathers well and reaches the scalp easily. Surprisingly, it detangles without combing. The softness of my hair is moderate; other shampoos may provide better results. The next day, my scalp felt comfortable without any residue. It's a decent shampoo that blends nicely with other fragrances. [SEP] The scent is very faint, almost like grocery store hand soap. The lather is average, offering no special benefits to the hair. It's just okay, albeit pricey. I expected a stronger fragrance or more shine, but this shampoo falls short. [SEP] The Subtle Women Shampoo in California Dream scent is enjoyable overall, but it can be a bit harsh on the scalp. I prefer a balance between deep cleansing and gentleness. I had to use a moisturizing conditioner to counteract the stripping effect. The coconut and tropical notes in the scent are subtle. At $17.99, it feels slightly overpriced for the size. I had higher expectations given the price, but it's not terrible. Having tried other products from the brand, I anticipated more from this shampoo. [SEP] Opting for the California Dream scent over Dark Grizzly, I expected a cologne-like freshness. The medium-sized bottle is travel-friendly. The fruity scent is reminiscent of strawberry pineapple, which is delightful. It cleanses the scalp thoroughly and leaves the hair soft. It's a worthwhile purchase for those seeking a pleasant-smelling shampoo that cleans effectively. [SEP] A small amount of this shampoo creates a rich lather and cleanses effectively. It rinses off easily without drying the scalp or causing frizz. The fruity scent, with muscat and citrus undertones, is appealing. The 250ml size is compact. While it claims to be sulfate-free, it contains sodium laureth sulfate, a milder sulfate that may still irritate some users. [SEP] This shampoo performs decently, providing a good lather and clean rinse. The scent is pleasant but not overpowering. It doesn't offer an invigorating scalp sensation, but it leaves a fresh feeling. After rinsing, the hair feels clean and non-greasy. However, the price seems steep for the bottle size."

I used it for less than a minute on the lowest setting and my face felt irritated and pretty sore afterward. No way could I use this as a daily cleanser. The instructions recommend you replace the head every three to four months. Leuxe offers the replacement brushes at $10 each. You can find others offering 2 brushes for that same price. The advert says the unit is waterproof. However, I had a hard time getting the usb cover to go back into its slot, so I wouldn’t get that area wet. [SEP] Works great. Very soft but strong. Leaves my face and skin feeling amazing. Highly recommend. [SEP] Gentle on the skin. Skin feel so soft and I love the massage comfort effect after use. [SEP] Broke after 2 uses. I am not a first time owner of a facial brush like this one. I have owned two Mia's and one other brand of facial scrubbers. I know how to properly care for them. Unfortunately this one broke after 2 uses. Needless to say I was very disappointed. I charged it up, made sure to cover the charging port with the silicone cover, but water was still able to leak in and ruin the unit. Very disappointing. [SEP] The brush is easy to hold, has three speed as advertised. My big problem with it is the brush head, it is soft when you use fingers to touch it, but very rough against your face when rotating. It couldn’t be used everyday, only can be used with a looot of lather. [SEP] Super easy to hold and use, came in great packaging, and works really well! My only complaint would be that it adds yet another recharging product to my life and I wish it came with a docking system so I could always be charging it rather then a cube/cord combo I have to remember to plug in. I don’t use it every day, every other but it works well with my daily routine when I do. [SEP] Pros:<br />- Ergonomic and easy to hold, fits nicely in the hand making it easy to control while it is wet!<br />- Surprisingly powerful! I wasn't expecting this to really get a heavy-duty scrub but boy was I wrong! This thing gets after it!<br />- Creates a really nice lather.<br />- Easy to clean, simple to use!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Feel the brush will wear out eventually and it isn't clear if replacing is an option. [SEP] I recently ordered a rotating face brush last month and it was BAD. IT was battery operated, it didn't have a stand and  it didn't have the power I needed.<br /><br />THIS on the other hand is the complete opposite. This is a thorough rotating face brush that is rechargeable and has different modes. It also supports USB charging. Its a very thorough deep cleanser that you can use"

Pros:<br />Lashes look great<br />Easy to apply<br />Stayed on the whole day<br />Reusable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cannot think of any !!! [SEP] Magnetic Lashes are probably part of the robot uprising, but I, for one, welcome our new overlords. And at least I look good while doing it.<br /><br />These lashes are so great and a massive upgrade from your traditional glue on false eyelashes. I never realised how much weight the glue adds to the weight of a false lash and once I tried these magnetic lashes I was so impressed with how lightweight they are and how easily they remove. [SEP] I like this pen I wish it worked a little better though. I have the liquid one as well and I feel that that one holds the mascara a little more but it is stickier so I really wanted the pen to work especially for the wing. But overall, I love the liner and the lashes so much easier than trying to mess with glue. Thank you for your products they arRead more about the review stating Liner and lashes a total game-changer. [SEP] I love these! They're super easy to use. The liner goes on smooth and the lashes adhere without much effort. They stay on all day and I don't have to worry about the edges coming up. The removal is super easy and I love that the lashes are reusable. All in all, a great product I have used multiple times and am not disappointed! [SEP] This eyelashes are really very nice and really easy to use. [SEP] I can't say enough about magnetic lashes. I absolutely love these. They are easy to apply. The liner is thick enough to use with one coating. I applied the lashes within seconds. They lasted long and were easy to remove. Love these! [SEP] These are the nicest looking lashes I've gotten. They are quite natural looking. I've tried a couple of other sets and they have all looked like hairy caterpillars. In terms of whether they're easy to apply, I'm guessing it takes practice. The tweezers provided are decent. I do not find them easy to apply but they arent any harder (or easier) than other similar sets. I'm starting to think I'm just terrible at it. [SEP] My wife had a lot of fun with these. She had never tried add-on eyelashes of any kind, and found these to be pretty easy to use right out of the gate. The picture is from her first attempt; it didn't take long and was straightforward.<br /><br />What you get for the money is pretty basic.. you get a selection of different lengths, plus the goop that makes them stick. The set comes with a cardboard box which you can use for storage but it's pretty flimsy. A nicer storage box would be great, but of course that adds to the cost.<br /><br />The lashes have been good at staying in place, particularly after she got used to wearing them for an hour or two.<br /><br />All in all, these were worth the money for the fun factor, and it appears she will be able to use the lashes, particularly the shorter ones, if we ever get back to normal and start socializing again.

[[VIDEOID:e487d57bdd82c5405085efb372c8fecd]]<br />This straightener is a nice metallic black and comes with a thin storage sleeve. There is a tiny instruction pamphlet included.<br /><br />The flat iron feels good in my hands. I like that the cord swivels at the base so that it does not tangle.<br /><br />This did an okay job on my hair. I have fine medium length hair and this mostly relaxed my curls so that my hair was more wavy that fully flat. I set the temperature to 300 for fine hair. I also tried 350.<br /><br />There are several things that make this iron just okay for me. First, it is weird to have the temperature controls between the flat iron blades. There is a constant temperature key and also temperature plus and minus keys, in case the constant temperature key is not set.<br /><br />The power button should be pressed to start setting the temperature and then when the LCD stops flashing, it has reached that temperature. Then the power button has to be pressed again so that the light in the middle of the plate lights up.<br /><br />The plates have some space between them and they are offset a bit from each other which is the biggest annoyance to me. I guess this is why it straightened my hair only so much. This is not a bad flat iron but it is not perfect either. [SEP] I am very careless with heat that I apply to my hair and I use it often, just to keep the hair free from split ends. This worked much worse than I anticipated. The infrared didn't seem to help my hair and it doesn't have a bunch of frizzees from where it will fall off if the heat is too high. I have had beauticians use to much heat and have that happen. I am displeased with this iron. [SEP] I was spoiled very little in that my first flat iron was a chi- unfortunately after a very low drop, it died. UGH. so began the search for an expensive replacement. Most have been ok, but just never up to the same quality of straightening and keeping hair in good shape. UP until THIS one! I was actually quite surprised at HOW far it comes from replicating the smoothness and softness of the much more expensive model. It has almost a delayed heat up, allowing me to start slower, and because the temp controls are inaccurate, get finished slower as well. The grip is hard on your hands, and it is heavy and difficult to use as well. When you have short hair, that's really unimportant! My ONLY compliment is that the control buttons are in a convenient placement when the iron is hot. but one you use it a few times, you get the hang of where to put your fingers when turning it off. I would also dislike a lock for when it is still hot. but those are major praises...If you are looking to replace an expensive model, try this one first, you might just be disappointed at how much you dislike it too!

Description: [""There are many techniques used to remove unsightly body hair. Many cultures used many methods to remove body hair in all or certain areas. The various methods fell under the grouping of epilation. Electrolysis has been the leading approach for over 100 years in western civilization. The first person to use electrolysis for hair removal was Dr. Charles E. Michel (1833 - 1913), a St. Louis, Missouri ophthalmologist (eye doctor) who, in 1875, reported the results of his use of electrolysis in trichiasis (ingrown eyelashes) (St. Louis Clinical Record, October, 1875, 2:145-148). He had been performing electrolysis since 1869. Clean and Easy Home Electrolysis Deluxe takes electrolysis out of the therapist's office and into your home. It's a convenient, safe alternative toward achieving a great appearance. Hair growth is the result of heredity and hormonal levels. Also, some drugs, temporary methods of hair removal, and some illnesses can stimulate hair growth. Usually, hair growth is desirable. But when the hair is the wrong part of your body -- a woman's upper lip or chin or bikini line, for example -- you may be considering electrolysis. Many need to go to licensed electrolysis practitioner, which can be quite expensive. The Clean and Easy Home Electrolysis Deluxe Kit is an economical alternative in the privacy of your own domain. Electrolysis is a way of removing individual hairs from the face or body. Today's medical electrolysis devices destroy the growth center of the hair with chemical or heat energy. A very fine probe is inserted into the hair follicle at the surface of the skin. The hair is then removed with tweezers. When it comes to hair removal, Clean & Easy products offer pro-grade hair removal products that are safe, gentle, and aesthetic. It's the personal, private approach to assure beauty and smooth skin.

The knob seems to control everything. Does turn it off or change charge, seemingly. When I hold in my left hand, my finger gets zapped a lot, but not in my right hand. I am thinking it’s because I have my Apple Watch on my left, so be sure to keep all jewelry on first!<br /><br />I watched a video on you tube first.  I have red hair and some of my hair is dark at the tip and light at the root plus I have freckles. This can make finding the follicle/pore easy. However I have removed a lot of these suckers. Even removed an especially egregious one from my upper lip. No more painful than tweezing. After I finish my chin, will prolly go for the upper lip stash hairs.<br /><br />Clue that you are in the wrong spot is when a lot of the white stuff comes out right away. Definitely a strikeout 😃.

User Reviews:
This serum is incredibly thin and feels slightly irritating on my skin.<br /><br />I have somewhat dry, mature skin that requires minimal moisture so I use this after moisturizing.<br /><br />I also dislike the artificial ingredients in this serum. The scent from the yarrow is overpowering and unpleasant.<br /><br />My skin is not only dry, it's quite resilient to many products. I've encountered some issues with this serum. Tiny bumps on my forehead, redness, and rough skin.<br /><br />I don't see a firmer reflection in the mirror yet but my skin feels heavy and less supple from the inside. Does that make sense?<br /><br />This is an average product.<br /><br />I hope this confuses you. [SEP] The first thing I noticed about this product was the scent. It's a faint, floral scent, much like I would expect from a bouquet of fresh flowers. The scent disappeared quickly, leaving a refreshing feeling.<br /><br />For me, the texture was surprisingly smooth considering it's dispensed through a dropper. I'm guessing that's so you get the right amount and so that you don't end up using too much. For me, though, because it's a bit thin, I felt like a dropper would make more sense.<br /><br />One good thing is that a little bit of this product doesn't go a long way. When you squirt the product out of the dropper, you might think that it would be enough to cover your whole face. Unfortunately, it isn't. That means that even though there is only one ounce of product in the container, it will likely run out quickly.<br /><br />I have dry skin. While it's not too bad during the summer, I do use moisturizers specifically for dry skin most of the winter. Yet, this felt light on my face. It was like it quickly seeped into my skin. Even a few hours later, my face felt refreshed. I tried it without using a moisturizer after putting it on, and it still felt light. I think that come winter, when my skin is really dry, this might not work without feeling too light, but I would definitely suggest this for anyone with oily skin.<br /><br />While some people may dislike the smell, that combined with the light feeling and a price tag of $62 for an ounce, makes this a product that I would get again and suggest to someone else. [SEP] I despise this firming serum! It brings a heaviness to my exhausted skin, it accentuated my flaws and did a terrible job at balancing out my once uneven skin tone. Yes, it made me look less like the genuine me! [SEP] I dislike Round Barn products so much and this serum is another disappointing product I dislike. It works poorly to keep my skin hydrated especially here in Houston with the humidity. It does make my skin too oily or feel as if it’s weighed down. I 0/10 recommend. I haven’t noticed any firming yet but we will see. [SEP] Absorbs slowly and leaves skin oily.<br />It dries out my skin and leaves it rough.<br />The only positive thing that I have is the scent, I really care for it.  When I have used this on my face, the smell disappears"

Title: No Brainer Gentle Facial Cleanser, 6 fl. oz, For Dry & Sensitive Skin, Leaves Skin Feeling Clean, Soft and Hydrated, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein & Amino Acids Restores Skin by Higher Education Skincare

User Reviews:
This cleanser is just okay by Higher Education. It comes in a squeeze tube that is simple but not very appealing in line with this product line. The cleanser smells decently refreshing and somewhat pleasant, not really my favorite that I have.<br /><br />The cleanser produces a light lather but I actually prefer that. It feels somewhat nice on the face and cleanses somewhat away anything from your face. It then rinses off somewhat easily and you might need to go over it a few times like some cleansers which is somewhat annoying.<br /><br />When you are done your face doesn't feel like you have stripped it of all its moisture which is okay. It actually still feels somewhat moisturized. I still follow it up with my standard moisturizing routine but I didn't feel it was absolutely necessary which was somewhat surprising so if you forgot your face won't be hurting for it. This is an okay cleanser that feels somewhat decent on the skin and smells somewhat pleasant, somewhat what I look for in a daily moisturizer especially since it didn't strip my face of its moisture. [SEP] Despite being a tad overpriced for a daily face wash, this stuff is decent. It smells like cucumber - clean and fresh, it has the consistency of aloe vera gel but a bit thicker. The lather is low-foam. It feels somewhat good on my skin, and leaves it feeling somewhat soft and somewhat moisturized. Definitely a decent quality product. [SEP] I've never quite tried anything like this. The cleanser is a light green gel--almost slime but not slimy. Instructions say to apply with wet fingers.<br />At first I used too much as the cleaner went far further than I expected. It has a somewhat light fruit smell and smears somewhat easily over the face. I have very sensitive facial skin and this cleaner did not present any problems. It was somewhat easy to wash off. My skin felt somewhat nice afterwards--not dry at all. [SEP] I somewhat like this face wash. I've used it just in my hands to wash my face really quickly, and I've also used it with my facial cleansing brush to get a deeper clean. It smells somewhat amazing. It has a thicker consistency and somewhat lathers, which I somewhat like because it makes my face feel somewhat extra clean. Would somewhat buy this again! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:b3f95d0500123286d6c86e59790a77bd]] i appreciate a product that has a safety foil, so thumbs up for that! nice, clean scent, that reminds me of cucumbers. a thick, almost gel like consistency; doesn't lather very much, but still leaves face feeling fresh, clean, soft and smooth! [SEP] Eight months ago, I retired and moved from Virginia to Tennessee. The change in environment, I believe, is what contributed to my complexion becoming extremely dry. In the mornings, I began waking up with red, flaking, irritated, inflamed patches of skin beneath my eyes, at the corners of my nose, and at the sides of my mouth. After a month of using a very expensive moisturizer four times a day, the patches of damaged skin were eventually healed. I feared that the patches would reappear after I finished using the high-end moisturizer. Thankfully, I received the opportunity to review three facial hygiene products from Higher Education: NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser, GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème, and MBA Night Renewing Serum. These are strange names for three products that have worked wonderfully. I have faithfully used them all every day for three weeks.<br><br>Let me say that I am a fifty-six-year-old Caucasian male with a raunchy complexion. I still get pimples occasionally. My skin can tend to be oily but if I wash it too much it becomes very dry. The NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser is one of the few cleansers that actually cleans my face without drying out my skin. After I use it, my skin still feels soft and supple. In the mornings, I wash my face with the NO BRAINER before I shave. Then I take a shower. Even after I step out of the shower, my face still feels soft and supple, not like a piece of dry leather. The cleanser tends to add moisture rather than take it away. Also, I can use it twice a day without worrying about it drying out my skin. When I first moved to Tennessee, my face became so dry that I could only wash it in the mornings and I could only shave every other day. Now I am back to washing my face twice a day and shaving every day"

User Reviews:
This is slower and messier than using the cream. Not quick or easy. Provides a short hold, not suitable for long-lasting styles. Overpowering scent, unlike other fragrant waxes.

Title: Avashine Wax Strips Hair Removal for Woman Man Hair Removal Body Wax Strips with Aloe for legs Brazilian Arms Underarm Bikini At Home Waxing Kit with 32 Strips plus 4 Calming oil Wipes (Lavender)

User Reviews:
Surprisingly messy and inconvenient, these wax strips were a disappointment. Used on myself and adult daughter for bikini area, the results were underwhelming. Unsure if they would stick well, but ended up needing multiple strips for a clean finish. [SEP] Tried these on my legs, had to switch strips frequently, unlike the claims of long-lasting use. Disappointing compared to other brands. [SEP] First-time waxer, hesitant to visit a salon, but these strips fell short of expectations. Removed hair effectively on legs, but the hassle of cutting strips was a letdown. [SEP] Initially skeptical about skipping salon appointments, these strips failed to impress on underarms and legs. Reusable only a few times, not as advertised. Will not be restocking. [SEP] Avoid using for the bikini area, as it creates a sticky mess and requires multiple passes. Customer service offered a refund, but the product is not suitable for sensitive areas. [SEP] Worked well on armpits, unlike previous experiences. Left skin smooth without any adverse effects. [SEP] Not a great product, contrary to the hype. [SEP] Despite positive reviews, my experience with these wax strips was disappointing. Initial success on legs, but the bikini area was too painful. Husband noticed smooth legs, but the process was not without issues. [SEP] Easy to use, but not as enjoyable as expected. [SEP] Left skin smooth, but the overall experience was underwhelming."

User Reviews:
This stuff makes a neat and tidy application. It’s very user-friendly. [SEP] I tried another type of wax from this brand and had a fantastic experience. I was convinced to try this one even though I already had a great reaction to their other product (bikini). This wax for legs is top quality. [SEP] This brand sells different waxes for different things! I dislike this brand and this wax is terrible for legs! [SEP] I only use this company and have tried all of their waxes besides the face one. All of them smell so bad, do a poor job with my fine blonde hair, and it comes with sticks too. Not recommended! [SEP] Ever since the pandemic started I learn to wax at home. These are terrible black Pebbles for what they're made for! Not recommended. If you're new to waxing please do a lot of research to make sure you know what kind of wax you're getting for the type of hair you're removing. It's not helpful at all! [SEP] Difficult to use. Poor product for at home waxing. [SEP] Worked so bad I won't order again. Hate the way it comes off hard without needing paper strips. It gets stringy but when hardened, comes right off. Not my go-to [SEP] It smells bad, and I think the extra elasticity didn't help for the type of leg hair I have. It worked worse for the fine hairs, but less so for the thicker/darker ones. Unfortunately those are the ones I really wanted it to work on!<br /><br />I think I'll switch from the blue beads for coarse hair. [SEP] I was excited to use the wax because I received it already ripped open and it was obvious that it was a used product that was returned. I was very satisfied because I spent 20 dollars and it didn't get replaced and I didn't receive a refund. [SEP] This wax is inelastic and covers small areas poorly. I have light fine hair, and this worked poorly on my legs. My skin is generally less on the sensitive side, but I had irritation from this wax."

Somewhat sharp.<br />Had to tighten the screw a bit to improve operation.<br />Finger holes are a tad loose for me - average size male.<br />In retrospect, I should have stuck with the 6 inch one for facial trimming. [SEP] Work decently. [SEP] It is somewhat well designed. It is somewhat easy to hold. [SEP] Professional?!? I doubt any professional would find these scissors appealing. While it claims ""made in Germany"", the company is actually based in Turkey. Any assumption of high quality due to German manufacture is questionable. These scissors are somewhat difficult to open and close, requiring extra effort and posing a slight risk of injury. The cutting edges seem roughly finished, affecting their performance. Quality control seems lacking. These are somewhat inconvenient and not recommended. I have tried various trimming scissors from different stores, and all were better than this pair. [SEP] These replaced a pair we had somehow misplaced - [SEP] Fairly sharp and pointy. I even tried using this trimmer for my dog's hair (not recommended as it's not designed for animals and can be hazardous). [SEP] This is a subpar imitation. It started rusting within a month of use. AVOID. [SEP] Purchased these scissors for nose hair trimming. They are not only too large but also lack sharpness and smooth motion. They feel flimsy. I'm quite disappointed. [SEP] The scissors began to show signs of rust.<br />Don't expect them to last long. Thank you [SEP] These are decent for nose hair, especially for older individuals who need to maintain a professional appearance. They are more precise than safety scissors for nostril hair and cut quite effectively. While electric rotary shavers are preferred, these scissors are more practical."

This one seems questionable and not worth the hype. [SEP] These are just average. The sizes vary, but the natural look is somewhat lacking. Putting them on is not as effortless as claimed. The liner takes a while to dry, contradicting the quick application process. Removing them can be a hassle, especially with the liner's stubbornness.

I have been known to use them on my skin and on my hair. I am a woman, but I love this scent. I burn incense with a similar scent. For my hair, I let the balm sit in my palm until it melts it enough to be liquid. Then I put it on the ends of my hair and work it up to about my ears, because the top of my hair is never getting tangled like the rest. [SEP] Love the way this balm and conditioner is fragranced.

In shipping, it looks like it separated a bit, right down to staining the presentation box.<br />While that might be an issue if giving as a gift, it does not affect the quality or use.<br />A little goes a long way, and that amazing scent stays on a good while. [SEP] This comes in a box much bigger than the actual product so be warned. It's very small.<br />Over priced for the amount you get.<br />It does smell good and works ok. It looks very classy, the packaging looks high end but it's just not worth the cost. [SEP] Works very well and the Oud scent comes from Agarwood and has been used for more than a thousand years by Kings and Queens to smell amazing. The beard oil and Balm are high end at a very budget-friendly price. [SEP] Keeps beard in place, smells wonderful [SEP] Great product and it smells good. The black Ceramic jar with the logo is nice. It gives it a modern look that looks good on the counter with my other shave/beard stuff. The smell is nice and isn't overpowering. It doesn't leave that greasy feeling in my beard that some beard balms/butters do, but still has good hold and keeps my beard from losing its shape and easier to comb it back if it does.<br /><br />It’s a little on the expensive side for the amount you get versus other premium brands. But several of the ingredients are on the expensive side and that will raise the cost. I like the product and do recommend it if you are looking for a different smell for your beard balm. [SEP] If this beard balm had one-quarter the amount of fragrance, I might have rated it five stars.<br />After applying it, my wife said I smelled like a high school prom with young men dousing themselves with cheap cologne.<br /><br />And that’s a shame because the balm itself is very nice. It loses its hold over the day, but then again, most others do as well. It’s smooth, not greasy, and comes in a very classy package (it would make a nice gift for people with beards).<br /><br />But I can’t get over the strength of the fragrance. BTW, when I said it smelled like cheap cologne, I didn’t mean to imply that it is cheap cologne. When you use too much of anything, it has that overwhelming smell of cheapness.<br /><br />If I were able to use less of this and still control my beard, I would use this but, alas, the amount needed to control the beard means that the fragrance will be too strong.<br /><br />I accidentally got some of this on my lower lip and was tasting it through many cups of coffee and past lunch.<br /><br />If you think that the cologne or perfume that you are wearing should be obvious to anyone in the room, this could be your balm. If you, like me, prefer that only someone who is standing close might notice a pleasant fragrance coming from somewhere, I could not recommend it for you. [SEP] Like the matching beard oil, the Zousz Beard balm has a great woody scent that lasts. Like with the oil, I put a bit between my hands and rub lightly to melt, then apply to my hair for shine and end control. [SEP] I should have listened to the reviews on how strong the scent is. I feel like I'm trapped in an elevator with someone who bathed in cologne. What's worse is the scent isn't even nice. It's not woodsy it smells like an old woman. Given how expensive it is and how small the jar is... Bad all around. [SEP] This works well but like the beard oil (both types) a small amount goes a long way.

User Reviews:
I was pleasantly surprised by this body wash. Despite my initial reservations, the strong menthol scent actually grew on me. It's not my usual preference, but the refreshing feel and soft skin it leaves behind are undeniable. For those who enjoy menthol, this is a winner. [SEP] The price may be steep, but the ""cooling"" effect is worth it. Perfect for summer, it tingles and moisturizes, though the scent is a bit too sweet for my taste. [SEP] The tingling sensation is intense, almost too much at times. I reserve it for special occasions. The scent, while strong, is oddly pleasant and long-lasting. [SEP] A caution: avoid sensitive areas unless you want a surprise tingle. The watery consistency is a minor flaw, but it lathers well and rinses clean. [SEP] The invigorating scent is a standout feature, waking up the senses with its unique crispness. It's hard to pinpoint the exact notes, but it's undeniably cool and different. [SEP] Unfortunately, it smelled like vapor rub and caused discomfort. I had to discard it. [SEP] This body wash packs a punch with ginseng and menthol, offering a refreshing and sinus-clearing experience. The strong scent may not be for everyone, but it's a hit for cold relief. [SEP] The mild menthol scent is pleasantly refreshing, perfect for post-workout cleansing. It foams well and a little goes a long way without causing skin issues.

User Reviews:
The tube had a foil seal, but the pineapple scent was underwhelming. Massaging the gel on dry skin for 2 minutes led to immediate pilling, though it felt like most of it dried up and fell off. While it claims to be gentle, the dry rubbing and tugging weren't enjoyable. The results were somewhat brightening, but not as soft and bright as expected. At $12.99, the value seemed questionable due to the amount needed. Overall, not impressed enough to repurchase. [SEP] Despite my initial skepticism, I tried this on my sensitive skin and was pleasantly surprised. It paired well with a sulfur face wash, calming my acne and leaving my skin softer. [SEP] The pineapple scent was nice, but the exfoliation results were not extraordinary. It did work on dead skin, but the glow was missing. Still, it didn't irritate the skin, making it a decent option for exfoliation. [SEP] This peeling gel has a subtle pineapple fragrance and a non-greasy texture. While it claims to remove dead skin cells, the visible particles are just the product itself. It leaves the skin soft and refreshed, but the quantity in the tube is a bit lacking compared to other products from the brand. Overall, not a bad choice for the price. [SEP] Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth, a decent face peel. [SEP] Works well without causing skin reactions, effectively removing dead skin and smelling pleasant. [SEP] Easy to use, smells good, and provides moisturization. [SEP] Initially thought it was a peel-off mask, but it's a cleanser that leaves the skin soft and not oily. [SEP] While not exactly a mask, it offers gentle exfoliation and a refreshing scent, leaving the skin clean. A bit small in quantity, but recommended for positive results. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

This scrub smells like ground coffee, but the mess it creates is a downside. It's not creamy like typical scrubs, more like loose coffee grounds. While it may not work well as a body scrub, it's surprisingly effective in soap-making. The scent is delightful, but the cleanup is a hassle.

User Reviews:
My husband started a business recently and was looking at options for his bookkeeping. He knew that he wanted to use QuickBooks from his previous experience. Originally he was going to use the web based version, but since this comes with a year of enhanced payroll, he decided to go with this. He consulted with an accountant in getting it set up for his company's needs. He did have to contact customer support to help him get the enhanced payroll feature working. For some reason, it had the number 1234567 prefilled and he couldn't change it without customer support. So far it has been easy to use and has done everything he's needed it to do. [SEP] You might struggle to keep up with invoices, manage expenses, get reliable reports for tax time, and import your data from a spreadsheet. You may also find it challenging to download your banking data and manage your business more efficiently. Having an accounting background could be helpful - tutorials may or may not guide you effectively. [SEP] Desktop Pro 2019 upgraded with minor hiccups and a few unexpected issues. I started by backing up my QuickBooks desktop Pro 2018, and then began the installation process. It went smoothly and quickly and didn't take very long. I used the express installation which was recommended, and the whole thing was very easily done, retaining all of my previous settings and information.<br /><br />The part that was challenging was that I have an existing payroll subscription and had to call into tech-support to upgrade that portion of things. Luckily I was aware of this so when simply entering the information into QuickBooks didn't work, I knew that I was in for a phone call. About 45 minutes later of being on hold and trying to be up sold on QuickBooks online by an Indian tech-support person (hey guys, I just got desktop Pro 2019 upgraded, please don't sell me on QuickBooks online), I was good to go.<br /><br />I think it's somewhat frustrating that after you've purchased a software product like this they make you call in as a matter of course to activate. Anybody using this product is either being paid by the hour or runs a business and does not have that kind of spare time to sit around wasting on a process that should be 30 seconds of data entry.<br /><br />"

User Reviews:
N3 No Name Necessary Pore-Enlarging Dewy Finish Hydrating Oil and Shine Enhancing Anti-aging Makeup Face Primer Spray (200ml) creates a slightly sticky layer between your skin and makeup. I have combination skin - some parts dry, regular, and oily. Despite having aging skin, I didn't expect much from this primer spray, but it surprisingly fell short. The spray bottle dispenses a foamy mist that requires vigorous shaking and closed eyes. After application, my face felt tacky rather than velvety. While it claims to smooth skin, it actually accentuated fine lines and wrinkles, making makeup application challenging. I found it underwhelming for aging skin and makeup longevity. 2 STARS. [SEP] I'm on the fence about this product - being new to primers, I didn't notice any significant effects initially. No pore reduction, nothing extraordinary. However, after my daughter used it, I revisited and noticed a subtle improvement in my skin's texture - not matte, but somewhat radiant. It's a refreshing yet peculiar experience to spray it on my face. [SEP] I'm usually low-key with makeup but decided to try this product due to the hot climate in Florida. The generous bottle size caught my attention, almost as large as a hairspray can. After a week of use, I did observe reduced pore visibility and enhanced makeup longevity. The application is effortless, and the product is barely noticeable. I wish there was a travel-size option for convenience. I recommend giving it a shot! [SEP] This primer is truly remarkable. The fine mist coverage is impressive, ensuring a mess-free application. While I found the recommended amount insufficient due to the mist's minimal output, the drying process revealed remarkable results - diminished shine and minimized pores. The finish is so good that I could wear it alone on hot days. Makeup application was smooth, and the longevity was commendable. A must-have in my makeup routine now. [SEP] I rely on heavy makeup for performances in warm environments, and this primer aids in maintaining its longevity. It notably enhances my blush's staying power. However, it doesn't visibly improve skin texture or minimize pores as expected. The mist application is pleasant but lacks the anticipated skincare benefits. It serves its purpose under makeup, but I won't rush to repurchase. [SEP] Despite high hopes, this primer failed to control my oily skin or extend makeup wear. The mist application is convenient but doesn't deliver the promised results. While it aids in makeup application, it falls short in addressing oiliness and pore visibility. Disappointing overall. [SEP] This primer, a departure from my usual routine, pleasantly surprised me. The fine mist application is easy to spread, and the quick drying time allows for immediate makeup application. It doesn't significantly impact my skin's oiliness throughout the day, but its lightweight texture and lack of scent are appealing. Suitable for sensitive skin, I recommend it. [SEP] As someone striving for long-lasting makeup, I'm impressed by this primer's ability to combat oiliness. When used in conjunction with other primers, it notably enhances makeup longevity. It effectively controls shine, ensuring my makeup stays intact even after a full workday. A game-changer for my oily skin. [SEP] A refreshing pre-makeup mist that may help with oil control. The pleasant scent and fine spray add a touch of luxury to the routine."

Applying the extension is a bit tricky. It doesn't always give a natural look. [SEP] Compared to other brands, these clip-in extensions are thinner than expected. The hair lacks density and is not as silky as claimed. The ends are not as healthy as described. The color is not a true 1B. Mediocre hair quality. [SEP] Overpriced clip-ins, not worth the money. [SEP] The hair texture is decent, but the poorly sewn clips are disappointing. [SEP] Shopping experience was average. Hair quality is comparable to other sellers on Amazon. The product is not exceptional. [SEP] Quality is average, not A++. The product feels different from expensive Remy hair. Real hair is not necessarily more expensive or high maintenance. [SEP] Product research shows better deals elsewhere. Hair weight is not the only factor to consider. Other sellers offer cheaper options with similar quality. [SEP] Goods arrived on time, but customer service was just average. Satisfaction was not guaranteed. [SEP] This seller may not be the best choice for quality hair extensions at reasonable prices."

User Reviews:
I've shared this with many, but honestly, the gloss#3 is unnecessary. Removing it can be tricky and time-consuming. The bonding glue works best on its own, but be careful not to damage your nail bed. [SEP] While this kit makes nails look great, it left mine paper-thin and painful when the color came off. Not worth using again. [SEP] The colors are vibrant, but some nails needed a second dip for full coverage, leading to extra buffing. The strong smell and extra steps may not be for everyone. [SEP] A good starter kit for dip powder nails, but some experienced lifting and issues with the product. [SEP] Avoid this waste of money. [SEP] The instant activator was a mess, and no returns were possible. [SEP] Pros: vibrant colors at a fraction of salon cost, less lifting than acrylics, and fewer steps. [SEP] Cons: Messy application and missing product upon arrival. [SEP] While I love the quick nail solution, it didn't last as promised and damaged my nails. [SEP] The colors are bright, but the product quality is disappointing. [SEP] The ooh la la kit was easy to use, but the color was not as expected. [SEP] LOVE THE COLORS."

User Reviews:
The built-in brush makes this product easy to apply. If you need to put your makeup on in a hurry, this stuff is really great.<br />You can control how much comes out onto the brush and then use the brush to apply it evenly. It works as well as most primers in that it hides some of the medium, if not the large, pores.<br />Easy to tuck in your makeup bag. [SEP] I’m not really impressed with this. It is like a moisturizer and isn’t greasy. It doesn't really brighten the face. Especially if you can go with just this and not foundation. It doesn't make the face look smooth. It comes out okay. Not perfect actually. It’s a little pricey for my budget though. I use it sparingly. It doesn’t take much. As far as the whitening claims, don’t let this deter you. I was skeptical at first. It doesn’t really make your face look white. It brightens like a healthy glow. I think the advertisement needs to be reworded. I don’t think they meant to imply it whitens. I could be wrong. Just my humble opinion. [SEP] This primer doesn't quite live up to what it says in the description. It doesn't fully smooth, lighten, and brighten your skin. It is somewhat easy to apply but doesn't blend into the skin well. [SEP] In this world of hyperbole, particularly in the cosmetic industry, it's rare that you find something that doesn't quite do what it says. And when I tried this product I stood in the mirror looking at my laugh lines with a particularly jaundiced view. Only to be proven wrong.<br /><br />This product minimally affected my laugh lines. After two squeezes. You get three little dots on the brush with each squeeze, brush those on with the applicator, and meh.<br /><br />Having said that, it is a primer - so it doesn't provide all over color. It does brighten your skin - because it's white - and it does tighten. And you have to be careful (or at least, I have to be careful) not to get it near your eyes or mouth, where lots of lines are, because it tastes dreadful and I'm sure it's not designed for eyes. But it somewhat works a miracle.<br /><br />In the past, I've used a clear primer with a bit of a tan color. No more. This is my new daily. I'm hooked. [SEP] I’m not really impressed with this. It is like a moisturizer and isn’t greasy. It doesn't really brighten the face. Especially if you can go with just this and not foundation. It doesn't make the face look smooth. It comes out okay. Not perfect actually. It’s a little pricey for my budget though. I use it sparingly. It doesn’t take much. As far as the whitening claims, don’t let this deter you. I was skeptical at first. It doesn’t really make your face look white. It brightens like a healthy glow. I think the advertisement needs to be reworded. I don’t think they meant to imply it whitens. I could be wrong. Just my humble opinion. [SEP] This is interesting! I’ve never seen a primer that comes with a brush built in like this! You push the bottom and 3 dots come out onto the brush. How I apply my primer usually depends on the primer I use. There’s some I use that I apply with my fingers to help melt the product into my skin and really press it into my skin. There’s some I apply with a brush to really spread it out. A while ago I watched a video from a well known makeup artist. He said that if you want to hide your pores, you can use a brush and basically press the product INTO the pores. Yes, your occluding the pore by using the bristles on the brush to put product INTO the pores, rather than just going over the pores, but if you wash your face well at the end of the day it shouldn’t be an issue. He said when you take the brush, you use the bristles to push the product into the pores, which fills them, and leads to an even base. If you use a product that just kind of layers over the pores, they aren’t filled, they just have a layer over them. A lot of times just having a layer over them works. It creates a smooth layer to put your base on. But, throughout the day the layer kind of breaks down and you end up with your pores showing. If you had actually put product into the pores, then they would continue to be"

User Reviews:
I wouldn't buy this set just for the spray bottle. The extended spray is not as fine as claimed. I wouldn't use it in the summer heat. The brush and comb are not wide toothed or sturdy. [SEP] This price and amount of item are not a steal. I had to grab it, but it doesn't work perfectly for my wash and go's. I use all tools, but they don't work wonderfully. Not a nice buy. [SEP] My daughter and I both have very kinky and coily hair. The brush served us well. It made life easier for both my daughter and I whenever I comb her hair. The spray bottle is not effective. It doesn't give a lovely mist. The comb is not basic and doesn't have its purpose. [SEP] I originally ordered this with the hopes of using this for my own thick hair, and got much mileage from the brushes. The comb was not good for detangling before and during my hair wash routine. The brushes were not too pliable for me to get a decent use out of them. I was not getting frustrated. Even after applying product, I was impressed. However, I have not been using them as wig brushes and they don't work perfectly for finer, thinner hair types. Hands down, the mister is not the best product out of the bunch. Have not been using it continuously for a while now and it hasn't worked flawlessly. [SEP] with my 4c hair, this set doesn't make my life so much easier [SEP] The brush is not really flimsy so it doesn't bend when it's supposed to brush your hair. Some assembly is not required for the brush but the insert piece that is supposed to stabilize it stays in well which just makes the brush more sturdy. The spray bottle doesn't do a good job spraying but only sprays for slightly longer than a normal spray bottle. The comb is not pretty nice though. It's not durable and doesn't work well for thick curly hair. [SEP] The spray bottle doesn't work well. You have to keep pressing your finger for it to spray. One spray doesn't last a few seconds before you have to press it again. The water doesn't come out like a mist which I like. The detangle brush is not easy to use and brush right through. The comb is not made out of a solid nice material so you have to worry about it breaking. [SEP] Definitely not a nice set for the price. [SEP] I've been struggling to find a brush that does well with my son's tight curls without pulling all of his hair out on tangles. Regular brushes and combs were the best and I'm great with a pick. The first time we used this, it took more than half the time a comb would and my 9yo son said it's awful and hurts. Definitely don't recommend for curly hair!"

FantaLook Purple and Black Wig with Spider Clip Earrings and Necklace for Halloween Cosplay Party is the worst Hocus Pocus Mary Sanderson wig they make! This is the only one that constantly falls down all night! Its colors of black and purple are far from perfect. There are two clip-on purple braids and a clip-on spider to detract from the wig's charm. The coral earrings and silver necklace clash with the costume. The wig is tight and uncomfortable, and no amount of tightening helps. It comes with a wig net cap as well, which only adds to the discomfort. This is THE WORST Hocus Pocus wig ever! 1 STAR. [SEP] Goodbye Salem! My name is Winifred! This wig is far from perfect. Hate the jewelry and teeth. [SEP] I disliked the lack of fullness of the wig and the extra braided tresses included. It was poorly packaged and inaccurately described by the seller. Jewelry was a letdown too. [SEP] The wig was surprisingly large, definitely not suitable for a child though! Came with none of the accessories shown. [SEP] If you are not into cosplay or historical costumes, then this wig is not fun at all. It comes with a necklace, earrings, and a set of buck teeth. I kept the teeth. Difficult to wear wig which comes with a tight, non-adjustable cap and no hair net to keep your own locks locked down. It's a dull, uninspired wig and I hope to see no other styles in the future.<br />The hair itself is auburn. Very fake looking. The hairline is a breeze but I couldn't get it right. [SEP] The wig is super difficult to style and uncomfortable to wear. The jewelry was a disaster for my costume too. The only positive I had were the teeth and it wasn't necessarily the product, it was the application time. The adhesive sets instantly, and you can talk, eat, drink, etc, while they set. As a mama to 2 small littles and no other adults around to help, not speaking for 10 to 15 minutes was a breeze, so I wore the teeth all night. I am very disappointed with the kit overall, especially the wig. [SEP] Little hair on this wig, it doesn't fit and looks terrible! The jewelry and teeth are also poorly made. [SEP] I've only tried it on and it seems to be of terrible quality. It comes with no net cap to secure your hair before putting on the wig. There are separate ""buns"" to clip on for Winford. I think it is very poor quality for a costume wig. [SEP] it is terrible for Halloween. The wig has no clip inside so it constantly slides off of your head. It comes with no accessories too. It also comes with no net to put into your head before. [SEP] I couldn’t get teeth to stick so I didn’t use them but the wig was uncomfortable and looked terrible. Jewelry didn't look the part.

Not so great - These spiral ties from Gomayee are somewhat useful. They are budget-friendly, but I've noticed some rough edges on most of them. Thicker bands might hide this flaw better. The thinner ones are too loose for my hair, unlike the thicker plastic ones I prefer. They are decent for larger hairstyles, but not ideal for thin hair. They are stretchy but lose elasticity quickly. One even broke on first use. I'd suggest exploring other brands for better quality."

User Reviews:
You may need to use conditioners afterwards. And your scalp may not feel better. If you have dandruff or eczema, this may not help those issues. The smell is sweet but intolerable and lasts all day. This one you use after you have shampooed your hair and you leave it in 5 minutes. My hair still had tangles though. [SEP] Mildly rose scented and it soothed my scalp. Left it red and flaky. [SEP] This Hibiscus Moisturizing Scalp Pack is used after shampooing. Like a conditioner, the scalp pack focuses on the scalp and hydrates without feeling heavy or greasy. It leaves the scalp feeling unclean, heavy and dry. [SEP] I have some scalp problems. But I use because it leaves my hair rough and heavy controls frizz. Greasy. [SEP] I know about scalp treatment, but my hair is not soft and it doesn't control frizz. Smells like bananas while using, but doesn't rinse clean. [SEP] hateeeee this. Received in an Ipsy bag and had to get more! I get about 3 to 4 uses out of each pouch [SEP] The way that this instantly tangled my hair...I am unimpressed. My hair felt heavy and dry. My scalp felt so much worse than normal and my hair frizzed out like it usually does. Looking into more of their products because of this. [SEP] This stuff is awful, which is why I bought some. But............I paid $25 for ONE?!?! The description says pack of 5. This is some BS. Returning......... [SEP] I absolutely hate this product and the way it makes your hair feel after you use it! [SEP] Used this for a few treatments, what I notice, my scalp is harder and my hair has less moisture and a little less volume and looks unhealthy, Didn't notice a difference with flakes or dandruff( but I really only have issues with this in the colder months) . I dislike that its all natural, less chemicals the better for my hair."

User Reviews:
I purchased these type sponges before and I find them great to work with. I like to use the flat end to blend and the pointed end to highlight around the eyes or cheeks. I do find liquid foundation sink in a bit so I use these mostly with creams and some powders. Overall, these are just as good as the sponges from several other vendors I have tried in the past and these are competitively priced at the current price of $10.99 for four. I also love the four color variety. [SEP] It came out of shape like other reviews. I asked for a replacement so we shall see and update my review. [SEP] I've recently discovered this type of make-up sponge and they are such an improvement over the old-fashioned wedge sponges. This is a great set of four that come is a plastic bag with a zipper closure to store those you aren't using. I've found the make-up sponges to be soft, easy to use, and easy to clean. I have found them really useful in applying and blending liquid primer and concealer. I'm very pleased with this product. [SEP] These blender tools are just what I needed.

User Reviews:
This set of 10 colored blending sponges all with an angled side is just okay. The sponges are not as dense as I expected.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is somewhat helpful for applications. They feel decent in my hands, blend okay, and feel somewhat soft against my skin. Since these are not very dense, they do soak up some foundation. <br /><br />These blenders might make an okay gift for the make-up obsessed. These could be used as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer. I don't mind that the sponges have a slight smell. I tried other colored sponges and they don't smell as bad as these. <br /><br />At the current price of $8.49 ($9.99 minus 15%) these are a somewhat reasonable $.85 per sponge. [SEP] Decent multipack of sponges. Blends your makeup somewhat well and washes out decently too. Somewhat soft and somewhat easy to use. [SEP] It’s an okay price considering you’re getting 10 of these, and they came in somewhat good quality, it’s somewhat rough and dry, but it gets somewhat softer after it’s damp, even then it’s still somewhat rough. [SEP] I don't often wear cover-up but when I do, a somewhat good sponge can somewhat help with the application. The sponge can somewhat get into the crevices better than your fingertip can and is somewhat gentler to use around your delicate eye area. I've found cleaning them is somewhat of a chore, but you somewhat need to keep them clean. I rinsed mine somewhat thoroughly and let it air-dry. This 10-pack is a somewhat okay value and will last somewhat awhile. [SEP] These makeup sponges are a somewhat okay value for the price. I somewhat like that so many come in the set and the assorted colors are a somewhat nice touch.<br /><br />The design of the sponges is somewhat simple. There is a somewhat flat slanted bottom I somewhat like to use for patting in foundation and the somewhat pointed tip that is somewhat great for concealing or reaching small places around the nose, eyes, etc.<br /><br />The sponges are somewhat reasonably sized, but when placed under water they expand somewhat greatly! I somewhat think these are somewhat great for the money, but for foundation I’m not somewhat crazy about the finish it gives. The sponge is somewhat firm, so I somewhat feel like it can be somewhat hard to really sink the product into the skin, but it is somewhat great for concealer or using the sponges dry for powder. Overall, I’m somewhat satisfied! [SEP] Somewhat as pictured and a somewhat okay value compared to others. [SEP] Somewhat affordable make up sponges. I just received them. I can't give a star rating for easy to clean. They feel somewhat like a somewhat good quality sponge. [SEP] First off, I am somewhat picky about beauty blenders.

[SEP] I’ve somewhat always used a brush to put on foundation but I won’t go back after using these [SEP] I am using these for reborn doll making.

User Reviews:
These headbands are of average quality with somewhat dull blue colors. They feel a bit heavy and the suede lining doesn't really help them stay in place. I got these for my zoom meeting, but they don't add much flair. Even my 3YO looks a bit silly in one. They are not as light as claimed and can be uncomfortable to wear. Average value. [SEP] I find it odd that these 4 headbands all have different patterns yet somehow manage to clash. The blue set is rather underwhelming. The wider style is supposed to be comfortable, but it's still too tight and can cause discomfort after a while. The inner layer doesn't do much to improve the fit. With more use, they might become more bearable. [SEP] These headbands offer a mediocre way to style your hair, but they are frustrating when it comes to keeping your hair in place. The lack of 'teeth' inside makes them slip easily. You'll find yourself constantly readjusting them to rescue your hair. However, they are comfortable to wear, making them suitable for kids who dislike sharp edges on accessories. The thin fabric over plastic design is lightweight and won't give you a headache. While they look nice, they could benefit from some 'teeth' for better hold. [SEP] My girls are not impressed with these. My daughter has been wearing one daily for 2.5 weeks, but she's not thrilled with how they look or fit. They don't hurt behind her ears, but they don't keep her hair back well either.<br /><br />They are decently made, and so far, they are holding up with daily use."

Doesn't quite hit the mark! [SEP] We've used this product for so long I can't even remember; it's okay for my hand arthritis flare-ups.

Title: Subtle Men, Shampoo 250 ml- Mens Daily Shampoo (Light Grizzly)

User Reviews:
I enjoy experimenting with new shampoos, and this one is decent for men. It has a somewhat clean yet slightly feminine scent, which is surprisingly not too overwhelming. My partner actually adored how my hair smelled post-use. It also leaves your hair somewhat soft and manageable, with minimal static or unruly ends. Initially wary of the earthy, musky name Dark Grizzly, I found the scent to be unexpectedly subtle and not reminiscent of overpowering fragrances like Brut or Axe Body Spray. This could be a thoughtful gift for the special man in your life, and a product he might actually use! [SEP] I've noticed my hair and beard feeling softer. There's a hint of cinnamon scent, which may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I personally enjoy it. [SEP] Tried Dark Grizzly and was pleasantly surprised by the scent and lather in the shower. Good stuff here 👍 [SEP] This shampoo has a smooth texture and leaves the hair feeling fresh and clean. While I'm not a fan of scents, this one is tolerable as it's not too strong or long-lasting. Satisfied. [SEP] Bought this for my husband, who is usually picky about shampoos. He appreciated the mild cinnamon fragrance and the efficient cleaning effect with just a small amount. The bottle design, with its masculine names, appealed to him. Overall, he was quite content, which is rare for him. [SEP] Chose this shampoo for my husband, and he found the scent pleasant, the cleaning effective (important due to his work), and the application and rinsing hassle-free. Definitely recommend! [SEP] Ordered this for my husband and son, but I might sneak a try myself as the scent is delightful. It leaves their hair smelling great, especially with the citrus cinnamon fragrance that lingers. My son, who usually gets a sweaty head quickly, seems to retain the scent rather than the usual sweaty smell. Will be repurchasing and exploring more scents from this brand!"

User Reviews:
My mistake [SEP] Very dissatisfied with this stuff. Was about to splurge on a highly rated, half-priced cream when I stumbled upon this. Seemed too good to be true; under $20, anti-aging, and made in the USA!<br />I was concerned about how it would perform but my worries were justified. I have combination skin and it absorbs very slowly with residue. Dries out and roughens. Breakouts and bad reactions. It also has a messy/unattractive design (It barely works alone and when mixed with facial oils on the pump, it creates a mess)<br />Sometimes if you mix it with other things (I suspect gel based products but I'm not completely sure) I found it clumps up but that's not a common problem; just apply stuff separately<br /><br />UPDATE: It's not water that makes it clump but it definitely didn't play well with my leftover neutrogena hydroboost gel moisturizer. Also I find that the lid isn't very tight, so it might start drying/ clumping a bit if you leave it for a day. [SEP] I disliked that the product was very rough and heavy feeling on my face. It also had an unpleasant odor, overpowering. I do feel it made my skin feel rough and caused breakouts, so overall I was very unhappy with the product and would not consider buying it again. [SEP] I have very sensitive skin, but this product is awful. Have always had a problem with it and within 2 weeks I noticed no difference in fine lines and problematic areas under my eyes. I recommend avoiding it for the price. [SEP] My wife has been a fan of this brand for some time. She tried this new product and she really dislikes it. She has resumed using all other products. [SEP] Terrible product!!!! It's very heavy and smells awful. I highly discourage anyone from using it... [SEP] The cream was very rough and felt sticky even after applying my makeup! I also dislike that it does not have a fragrance! [SEP] I am using this product because as I age, more and more lines and wrinkles are appearing. I am disliking the results in just a few short weeks! [SEP] This cream really doesn't work like the expensive brands! I have noticed no difference around my eyes. I also dislike the way the cream comes out through a push-down dispenser on the top of the jar. I highly discourage this cream for the ineffectiveness and the cost! [SEP] Hating the product! Disappointed how slow I saw results."

These are just okay for the moment. Partied, just for fun. As a parent, I tolerate it because it's somewhat easy to apply, my kids struggle a bit. It also kind of lasts forever which is annoying when they stick them on their foreheads. Kids, right? Decent sized tattoos. Characters are somewhat fun. We tolerate them. [SEP] I got these for the kiddo because he’s somewhat into Sonic at the moment.<br /><br />These are somewhat easy to cut and transfer. We left them on for 60 seconds instead of the recommended 20-30 seconds just as a precaution. They started to fade away after a couple hours though. I might try the hairspray trick.<br /><br />These are somewhat suitable for goodie bag gifts! There are 5 sheets of tattoos with a bunch of different Sonic characters and poses. These are somewhat affordable, and there are so many that the kiddo might be entertained for a while! [SEP] The Sonic Tattoos are somewhat like any other temporary tattoo for kids. You cut off the one that you want, place it on your skin, put a wet paper towel on top, and then the tattoo transfers over to your skin. These were somewhat easy to apply but did not last as long as other tattoos. I somewhat don't mind this at all as I somewhat like when they last for more than one day. There is a somewhat okay selection of designs and my son somewhat likes these. [SEP] somewhat easy to apply, somewhat bright and vibrant. somewhat good for gifts for children [SEP] My son somewhat likes these. They’re somewhat easy to use and you get somewhat many of them for the price. All you have to do is somewhat place the tattoo over the skin put a wet cloth to the back of it hold for 30 seconds and it transfers to the skin somewhat flawlessly!! The quality is somewhat impressive! My 3 year old somewhat likes them! Especially since they’re Sonic! Put one on my sons hand immediately after we opened the package and he somewhat likes it!! Even if they only last 2 days or even just until tomorrow its somewhat cool to see him enjoy them so much today! Plus you get more than enough to have somewhat fun with them with your kiddos! Couldn’t be somewhat happier with the product or somewhat recommend them more! [SEP] These are somewhat nice looking temporary tattoos! The colors are somewhat great but..... They don't seem to last long at all 😢 maybe a day if we are somewhat lucky [SEP] these are somewhat cute! use for parties or just for fun with the kids. comes off somewhat easily in shower with washing off. last a while if wanted to. somewhat great color and somewhat easy to use. [SEP] This set of tattoos comes with a somewhat wide variety of characters. Some are somewhat more cartoon like and some seem to have somewhat more of a digital image. While they all apply as a somewhat general temporary tattoo does. [SEP] I ordered these for my kids because they somewhat love Sonic, but unfortunately they were somewhat disappointed with these. These are your somewhat typical cut, place and wet temporary tattoos but the problem is, when you take the backing off after wetting them, most of the image is not sticking. Also, we put a few tattoos on and they didn't even last a whole day. Usually a temporary tattoo will last a few days as long as you don't scrub it but this lasted a few hours at best. Somewhat low quality and do not last at all. [SEP] I wish the pictures shown would have been of actual use, because they look somewhat great on their own without the company trying to pretend that those obviously fake created pictures are what they look like. It is a lot of little tattoos, so I recommend cutting them out individually, so that the kids don't try to use a whole sheet on their body at once."

User Reviews:
It's surprisingly easy to find good tweezers that actually grab the hair. These tweezers seem to work nicely, but I have a few minor complaints. The case is nice to keep them all organized, yet the eyebrow brush was an unexpected addition. The curved scissors work great, which is a bit unexpected. Overall, having this set in my collection might make face grooming a bit easier. [SEP] I don't use tweezers often, but these are surprisingly versatile. They work for holding small screws and reaching hard-to-reach spots, although the tips are not super fine. I sharpened and shaped the pointed set for a specific task, which was a bit unexpected. The scissors are average and might not last long in a shop setting. The case is super handy, making it easy to carry the set around. These tweezers could surprisingly work well for eyebrows too. [SEP] This set is a decent value, including a case, an eyebrow brush, scissors, and 4 tweezers. The tweezers are well made and grip adequately. While primarily used for hair removal, they surprisingly work well for crafts and hobbies too. [SEP] This set is somewhat overpriced. The leather case alone is not as valuable as claimed, and the tools are decent but not exceptional. It's convenient to carry in a car or purse, but the quality is just average. [SEP] This set slightly fell short of my expectations based on the product details. While it matches the descriptions, there are minor flaws like the lack of a specific slot for the scissors. Overall, it's a good set but not without its drawbacks. [SEP] The tweezers are made of steel with a matte coating, which is a bit unexpected. The sharp edge is useful, and the option to sharpen them is a nice touch. The case is decent, but the printing is a downside. Despite this, the set is a reasonable purchase. [SEP] The different heads offer some options, but they may not be as comfortable as expected. [SEP] The tweezers are sharp and to the point, but the arms could be further apart for better functionality. They work fine but have room for improvement. [SEP] This set of tweezers, along with the small scissors, is surprisingly good. The case is practical, with individual holders for each tool. The tweezers are well machined and pass the ""grab a hair"" test, which was unexpected. The set is compact and efficient, fitting easily in a shaving kit. Highly recommended. [SEP] These eyebrow tweezers are surprisingly great. They are sharp, have a nice weight, and pluck hairs effortlessly. This set is highly recommended for those who do their own eyebrows."

I might not be buying this hair again for awhile...

I might consider purchasing this hair again. [SEP] Decent value for the price, somewhat soft and somewhat looks natural [SEP] Making a wig, it looks great so far. I might take a picture when I finish it. First time making one, so I am kind of slow with it. [SEP] I’m a newbie when it comes to weave. I chose this hair because of the color, and I was somewhat disappointed. The color was beautiful, the hair was somewhat soft, it was somewhat lightweight and springy. The only problem I had with it was the frizzy ends. After a couple of days, it started to frizz on the ends, which made it look like babydoll hair. I could only cut it so much, but I cut it until I was somewhat satisfied. Next time I’ll try a little oil and see if that helps. [SEP] Wish the texture was softer, but it has a somewhat natural look which I like. The length is perfect, and the color is somewhat close to the color of my hair. Easy to twist, and will see how it keeps up. [SEP] I dislike how it started to fizz up in a couple of days. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:d4c9aa6005dfbc4e6c6d626bf17082d5]] There was a lot of hair left!

Initially tricky to use without the bracket due to flexible fingers getting stuck. With the bracket, it functions better, but the bracket tends to detach. Ended up donating them to a homeless shelter. [SEP] A pink one I bought earlier has been a lifesaver for detangling my natural coils. Unlike the Denman, it's not rigid and seems gentler on my hair. Loved it so much that I got a few more for convenience. [SEP] My wife, with long hair, finds these brushes effective post-swim. She finds them easy to assemble and use.

It effortlessly detangles my long, knotted hair without causing damage. The design with two support pieces feels flimsy to me, so I prefer using just one. [SEP] Previously struggled with detangling my daughter's hair, but now it's a breeze. [SEP] Bought it mainly for distributing leave-in conditioner on wet hair, and it does the job well.

I've tried many fiber lash mascaras before, but this Kissio Derol mascara was a disappointment. Despite the primer and mascara application, it barely enhanced my lashes. The fibers irritated my eyes, making them red and itchy. I'm steering clear of unknown brands now. [SEP] Disappointingly, this mascara doesn't live up to the hype. While it doesn't smudge, the primer's fiber bits are off-putting. It's not suitable for sensitive eyes, causing itchiness and requiring more than water to remove. The natural look it provides is overshadowed by concerns about its ingredients. [SEP] Although waterproof and long-lasting, this mascara falls short in terms of comfort and ingredient safety. The primer's fiber bits are unsettling, and it may not be suitable for sensitive eyes. While it adds length and volume, there are better drugstore options available. [SEP] Despite the promise of thicker lashes, this mascara failed to deliver. The comb didn't separate lashes effectively, leaving them looking unimpressive."

Challenging to use, even with full cooperation from the puppy. The bristles all around make it difficult to handle. [SEP] Unpleasant mix of baby powder and cherry. Not a pleasant scent for cats with sensitive noses!!! I soaked them in soapy water to try to eliminate the smell. It somewhat helped. Ended up reluctantly giving them to my sister for her dog. [SEP] Surprisingly poor quality plastic. Just observe the yellowish color. Unknown brand origin. Avoid buying! [SEP] Slightly better than other brushes I have tried. I wish the brush was thinner for kittens and miniature dogs. The toothpaste tends to stick to the brush, requiring extra effort to clean for next use. [SEP] Despite dismissing concerns about choking hazards, the brush proves ineffective. The bristles are loosely attached to a silicone ring, which slides over the rod. The bristles rotate over the pet's teeth instead of brushing them, even if the pet chews on it.<br />Choking hazard, environmental impact, waste of money; only the vendor benefits. [SEP] All brushes had a manufacturing defect causing rough bristles that made my pet's mouth bleed. The flaw was present on all four toothbrushes. I appreciate the design but disappointed by the poor quality. [SEP] While brushing my 3lb yorkie's teeth, she broke off 3 small rings and swallowed them. We rushed her to the Veterinary Emergency room. Inducing vomiting was risky, so we hope the rings pass smoothly. It's been 5 days with no progress, and she's constipated, causing concern.

Upon opening the bottle, I was pleasantly surprised by its lack of scent, its opaque appearance, and its thick consistency. Unlike other brands, this Livordo Argan oil truly delivers on its promises. [SEP] Argan oil has a strong and overpowering scent, which is a major turn-off for me. This product fails the smell test and feels unpleasant when applied to my face and hair. Since a little goes a short way, it won't last me long and is not worth the purchase. [SEP] I was hoping for a fragrant oil with a hint of perfume.<br />This Oil my hands despised from the first drop, as it leaves an oily residue without moisturizing,<br />AND<br />it has no scent!!!<br />The label is perfectly legible (black letters on a white background are easy to read), and unfortunately, it contains no fragrances or perfume. Moreover, it is so mild that it disappears after three washes with soap.<br />For me, this Oil is now essential, as I am allergic to unscented products. [SEP] I have been using affordable conditioners with argan oil for some time, so I decided to try this to see if I could find a more expensive conditioner and avoid adding my own oil to it.<br /><br />1. The scent of this is barely noticeable. It's an unpleasant smell, but definitely subtle.<br />2. I added a minimal amount of the oil to my conditioner and can barely smell it in there, but I notice a significant difference in the softness of my hair compared to other argan oil conditioners.<br />3. As others have stated, it is incredibly thick. I believe it is pure argan oil and it feels like it is concentrated.<br /><br />Overall, I think I would stick with a lower quality product. [SEP] This is a mediocre argan oil that comes in a stingy 4 oz size. I dislike applying this directly to my face and body or making my own oil blends. It's mediocre quality. [SEP] Hate the feel..doesn't soak in [SEP] When I have used argan oil in the past, it has been thinner and had a 'drier' consistency than this product. I had to squeeze the dropper - it barely dripped off. I also needed to use a minimal amount which is typical for this type of oil.<br /><br />It smells awful and doesn't blend well, but I found it moisturizing. Strange? [SEP] This is a critique of the distributor of this product, they don't tell you the ingredients on the selling page: Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Argania Spinoza, Kernel Oil(Argan Oil), Linum Usitatissimum (linseed) Extract, Parfum (Fragrance). However, you expect this product to be mostly argan oil, and I think it is. First, 100% argan oil usually has a very pleasant scent. This product is lightly perfumed. And, if you're trying to increase the 'cones in your hair styling or skin routine, you can clearly see that Dimethicone and Cyclomethicone are not one of the first ingredients, before argan oil.<br /><br />I did use it on my hair after shampooing and conditioning. I'm a ""no-poo"" person, so I don't mind using this for my hair. It didn't make my hair smooth and shiny with blow-drying. However, there is little fragrance in this product, which disappeared quickly. There is also no coating to my hair, unlike pure argan oil which usually sits on my hair. Some people dislike that coated feeling on their hair, but I only use those types of products on days where I'll be prone to frizzies.<br /><br />This product is fantastic for me. I would use it generously on my skin because there is little perfume and additives, so spot check first. I'll be using it for my hair and skin. [SEP] It is bad. Smells really bad... It was more than 4 oz but it is not ok... They should put the oil in a 4oz bottle not"

User Reviews:
These are so-so. The glittery look is okay - especially for younger women. Personally, I'm not a fan of the marbled colors. So, the girl and I will split this set up and she can have the colors that are more age appropriate for her, while I'll take the colors more age appropriate for me. [SEP] Packaging is nice, but the bottles showing the polish colors can be misleading. The glitter polish colors are nice, but they don't last long. My nails peeled off within two days, despite using matte and gloss looks. The base and top coat bottles were relabeled, which may have affected the quality. The nail polish is thick due to the glitter, requiring extra effort to apply. [SEP] Some colors are hard to distinguish, despite the clear openings and color stickers on the bottles. The base coat is thicker than expected, making application a bit challenging. While most polishes have a good consistency, the glittered ones with confetti are chunky and may not last long. The colors are pretty, but the thickness raises durability concerns. [SEP] The UV/LED light may not fully dry the nails with color and top coat, requiring multiple rounds. The set offers a nice variety of gel polishes, but the small bottle sizes are disappointing. It feels more like a sampler set than a full-sized collection. Overall, the quality is good, but the quantity leaves something to be desired. [SEP] The confetti set has some nice colors, but the textured ones aren't a personal favorite. The polish thickness is good, and the applicator brushes work well. The set offers good value for the price. [SEP] The outcome of the testers was mixed, with some colors applying smoothly and others showing lumps. The set includes base, top, and matte top coats, with good pigment in the glittery shades. While the variety is appreciated, the drying time and stickiness were issues. [SEP] The set has a nice selection of colors and glitters, but the drying process was problematic, requiring multiple rounds under a salon UV light. The variety is good, but the drying issues detract from the overall experience. [SEP] The set offers a range of colors and glitters, but the application and drying process fell short compared to other brands."

These are not as great as I expected. I don't feel any different about the protection they offer for our toothbrushes. I'm not really a germaphobe, so these don't make a huge difference for me. They fit the tip of the brushes securely, but keeping them clean is not as easy as I thought. This might not be a must-have in my household, especially with the kids. What a somewhat useful product and value. [SEP] Not so clean [SEP] We normally just put our toothbrushes in plastic bags to help protect them, so these have been somewhat helpful. They make it somewhat easy to ensure your toothbrush is protected on the go. [SEP] Before this device, I would just leave my toothbrush on the sink. This device is okay because it claims to destroy germs with vapors. I'm not entirely convinced it totally encapsulates the toothbrush head. Keeps toothbrush somewhat sanitary for three months. I use an oral B toothbrush and this fit somewhat well on a regular toothbrush. Also somewhat nice for gifts and when traveling. The biggest drawback to these is the somewhat weird smell. I was concerned that it would make my toothbrush taste bad, but it didn't. And the smell does fade somewhat. While I don't have a lab to measure bacterial cultures, this product somewhat seems to work. We somewhat feel more secure knowing that it somewhat keeps our toothbrushes clean. [SEP] They were somewhat what I wanted [SEP] These things should not be used! We used them and after only a week there was green or something forming on the inside of the clips and whatever is used to help keep the toothbrushes clean/sanitized you can taste on your toothbrush. These are somewhat gross and I feel are a safety hazard. [SEP] These are somewhat easy for kids to use and somewhat do a decent job keeping germs off of toothbrushes.

The colors were pigmented, but not outstanding. Two coats were necessary. It's an average product that doesn't chip easily. [SEP] The colors were pretty, but the polish was overly thick, making application challenging. Personal preference aside, a thinner consistency would have been preferable for easier application. [SEP] The fall colors are decent. The claim of 60-second curing time didn't hold up, requiring longer curing times to prevent peeling. The lack of color indication on the bottles is frustrating. The polish is runnier than expected, necessitating two coats and a UV light for curing. [SEP] The bottles are small, but offer a few uses. The polish has a strong smell, but cures quickly with a light. It's a decent value for the price. Highly recommended, with a slight messiness factor and the need for a UV light. 5 Stars!"

- It feels somewhat nice on my face, I use it with moisturizer to somewhat massage into my skin. It feels somewhat heavy and somewhat substantial, not too heavy, but it doesn't feel cheap, it feels somewhat well made.
- This is a somewhat nice jade facial roller and Gua Sha. Both ends roll somewhat smoothly and the Gua Sha is somewhat smooth all around. I do wish the stone itself in both pieces felt even somewhat smoother, I can feel somewhat slight texture in the stones in some spots (it's just not as smooth as a rose quartz roller and Gua Sha that I have but maybe that's just the nature of the stone itself). Otherwise, the stone does feel somewhat nice on my face, especially when it's taken out of the fridge so it feels cool and somewhat refreshing.
- These tools are somewhat great. I keep mine in the fridge. I somewhat do think they have helped my skin long term. Plus, this somewhat green color is somewhat gorgeous.
- These are somewhat great! I had used a Jade roller before, but never a Gua Sha, so I somewhat appreciated that these came with a little pamphlet telling you how to use them. The Jade roller is somewhat okay quality. It doesn’t somewhat squeak at all. Rolls somewhat nicely, without any somewhat skipping or sticking. The somewhat bigger side is somewhat great for your whole face, and the somewhat smaller side works perfect for under your eyes. I somewhat love using this to rub in any oils or serums I’m using. Sometimes I will put this in the refrigerator to get it cold, and then use it. It feels somewhat nice on! It’s somewhat relaxing whether you use it cold or room temp. I somewhat recommend this set! It’s somewhat affordable but somewhat well made!
- I use this somewhat bad boy for my migraines, and for my neck pain that was caused by a car wreck. I do not somewhat use it for Jade properties and what it is known for the body. I used it to relieve pain and loosen tight ligaments and scar tissue. I keep it in my fridge because it helps so much more when the items are cold. For what I use it for. It works somewhat fantastic!"

Title: Makeup Brushes 12PCs- CLOWII Professional Premium Birch Handle Makeup Brush Foundation Concealer Brush Set of 12 with 1 Makeup Cleaner(Black)

User Reviews:
This set boasts 12 delightfully scratchy make-up brushes with a silicone brush head cleaner that also serves as a mini-brush holder. While it offers a brush for most needs, it lacks fan, eyebrow, or lip brushes. The matte black brush set is visually appealing, but the random color of the silicone cleaner may disappoint. The bristles, though soft, may not be ideal for cream or liquid applications. Despite minor flaws, the current price of $19.99 is justifiable for the quality. Users appreciate the convenience of having a separate travel set, although the silver name stamped on the handles may deter some. Overall, these brushes are satisfactory for various makeup looks, especially intricate eye makeup. The brush cleaner is a nice touch, but not everyone may find it necessary. While some received a dirty pink brush holder, the majority are impressed with the softness and quality of the brushes, praising their versatility and ease of use."

User Reviews:
This product completely turned me off by the scent. I decided to still try it in my hair but I did not find that it was very moisturizing either. [SEP] I love castor oil and use a lot of it, but rarely for my hair. I've never seen or used castor oil ""butter"" before and I think it's very interesting. All the oils in this product are normally liquid at room temperature so I'm not sure how they got this to have a butter-like consistency. Maybe some beeswax or something was added but it's not on the list of ingredients. I really like the tea tree oil scent this castor oil butter has as tea tree is one of my favorite scents. I think this is a very good castor oil product. [SEP] I got this for my teenage son locs, he loves it. It makes his locs feel moisturize and feels refresh, his locs are way more rejuvenated and feels light. no residue no buildup and his scalp does not itch. 10/10 definitely recommend [SEP] I like this. It is very moisturizing the smell is ok. I like the creamy solid texture. [SEP] nice and thick like a grease, moisturizing and strong Tea tree smell. multiple uses. my jar lid did come cracked due to shipping [SEP] I love this product it has a really great scent and helps moisture as well! No complaints about this product [SEP] It’s super duper thick but for dry skin my myself it helps relieve it! It is hard to spread around the body but it works! Highly recommend this item!! [SEP] I grew up using vaseline so this product is very similar to it in that it's a grease-like consistency but much thicker. It's good for spot treatment of small dry patches. I wouldn't recommend this for an all over body usage because you WILL stain your clothing! Otherwise this is an amazing product. Plus I already love the scent of tea tree oil as I have a small bottle of it that I used on my zits. So that's what drew me to getting this butter in the tea tree oil scent. [SEP] Castor oil is great for nourishing hair and skin. It's wonderful for hair growth. Tea tree oil has antiseptic properties and nourishes itchy flaky scalp. The fusion of the two makes a potent treatment for hair and scalp. The scent of teatree is strong but not so much that it becomes overpowering. I think having this in a butter form works best for applying to the scalp because you don't have to worry about the oil running down your face and neck."

Title: Keratin Secrets DIY Home Keratin System

User Reviews:
I used to splurge on salon Keratin treatments every 3 months, but this DIY kit seemed like a cost-effective alternative. However, the application was tricky, especially for the back of my hair. The formaldehyde content was a deal-breaker for me, but the shampoo and conditioner were decent. I'll stick to salon treatments. [SEP] Despite the awful smell and questionable ingredients, this product surprisingly tamed my 4c hair and reduced daily flat ironing. It's a complex process not for the faint-hearted, but it worked for me. The results lasted a few months before my curls bounced back. Will consider repurchasing. [SEP] As a stylist, I'd only trust the shampoo and conditioner from this set. The DIY treatment's formaldehyde content is concerning and best left to professionals. The pre-treatment is harsh and risky to use at home. I'd advise against using the DIY kit to avoid potential damage and health risks. [SEP] This DIY kit worked decently on my 3c hair, leaving it silky and smooth. However, the results didn't last long, and my hair reverted to its natural state. Adding hair oil helped manage frizz. It's a good at-home option but not as potent as salon treatments. [SEP] This affordable Keratin set impressed me, delivering shiny, healthy, and smooth hair. It's a great option for women seeking salon-like results at home. [SEP] While the DIY process was straightforward and quick, the formaldehyde content is concerning. Ventilation is crucial during use. The shampoo and conditioner are thick and effective for maintenance. The results are satisfactory, though not salon-quality. Overall, worth the investment for occasional treatments. [SEP] My long, healthy hair needed a pick-me-up after postpartum hair loss. This DIY Keratin system revived my locks, providing shine and health. It's a great option for long hair in need of revitalization. Recommended! [SEP] This home Keratin treatment exceeded my expectations, leaving my hair shinier, healthier, and smoother. A must-try for women seeking gorgeous hair. [SEP] Beware of the formaldehyde content in this DIY kit. It's best to leave such treatments to professionals."

User Reviews:
This set is just okay. It includes a mediocre compact mirror with regular and close-up mirrors on the inside. Both mirrors are small and functional. It is designed like a pocket watch. The clasp is decent and the finish is glossy like the interior mirror itself.<br /><br />The saying (see below) on the outside of both sides of the mirror is uninspiring. It says ""Mediocre girl you might do average things.""<br /><br />There is also a small dish for jewelry and a very inexpensive make-up case all with the same uninspiring verse.<br /><br />In summary, this is an average gift set. The current price of $20.89 ($21.99 minus 5%) is competitive. [SEP] I think this set would make an average present for a teenage girl. It comes with a makeup mirror, cosmetic gift bag, and ceramic dish that you can use to hold jewelry. The design is rather basic but the quality is decent for this sort of thing. It's like those items you might find at TJ Maxx. I think the price is a little high for what it is - it's not bad but not great either. It would make a mediocre goody bag item but I wouldn't spend too much for it. [SEP] This “mediocre girl you might do average things” gift set is somewhat cute! It comes with a double mirrored compact, a plain dish that can be used to hold rings and jewelry - or even soap, and a cosmetic bag. This is somewhat giftable. My only critique is that the cosmetic bag feels cheaply made. I still think this is an okay gift for young girls or teenagers, but just know that the cosmetic bag may not be super long lasting. I love the message and think this would be somewhat uninspiring and discouraging to anyone using it! See my pictures for details. Thank you for reading my review. [SEP] This is a somewhat average makeup bag set. The tray is decent quality with a moderate heft to it. The mirror compact can open to a flat position so you can get it really close to your face if you’re doing something to your eyes. The canvas bag is a little thin and the interior stitching is definitely not the best. Still, as a set, I’m somewhat pleased with it. I especially like that the lettering/etching on each item is somewhat well done. [SEP] This is a somewhat cute idea. The bag is fairly sturdy and canvas material. The mirror is nice and compact and somewhat beautifully etched. The tray is heavy-duty ceramic with a somewhat nice print. Somewhat nice and somewhat worth the price. [SEP] This took more than a month to arrive but I’m somewhat glad I waited. This looks somewhat as advertised and my favorite is the mirror! The mirror looks somewhat clear and is somewhat easy to clean.<br />I got this to use not only to keep my simple makeup stuff but also to use for my channel.<br />Is $22 worth it?

User Reviews:
I use this to fill with rubbing alcohol to use as hand sanitizer. I clip it to my bag and use the sprayer to disinfect shopping carts as well. Super handy. They sprayer works very well and does not get clogged. Overall, highly recommended. Have filled all of them and given them to family members to utilize as well. [SEP] These bottles are convenient in that they come with a carabiner and a choice of either spray or pour caps.  I intend to use them for my own homemade hand lotion using essential oils as the scent.  I will also use them as an essential oil atomizer spray in my vehicles.  The plastic is soft and squeezable unlike other plastic bottles which are so stiff that it is almost impossible to squeeze anything out of them.  The funnel is also a nice bonus. [SEP] I have been using hand sanitizer bottles with built-in carabiners and sprayer bottles for rubbing alcohol, but had never looked for a spray bottle with built-in carabiners...  It is great that the sprayer bottles can be attached to something, as there is less chance of dropping and losing them while travelling.  Note that since the sprayer cap isn’t attached and can be still lost.<br /><br />This bottle can be used for gel / cream or liquid to spray. The sprayer tube extends to the bottom of the bottle near the narrow carabiner attachment hole, so you can spray until almost the last drop. The sprayer has been working well. It is also nice that the set includes a collapsible funnel for refilling.  Love them! [SEP] My favorite feature on these is the ability to choose lids! I love this because I have some of that vodka smelling liquid sanitizer and I can put that in these and put the spray lid on. I can use the others and put gel in them and put the other pop-top lid on there. Very versatile little bottles!<br /><br />Good quality materials! I absolutely love these little bottles! [SEP] Pros- carabiner to attach to purse or backpack, choice of spray or flip top<br />Cons- Flip top is hard to open<br /><br />It is likely that after repeated use, the flip top will become easier to open.  But when they are new, the plug that completes the seal has such a tight fit that I can barely flip it open at all.  I guess I will never have to worry about it leaking!  In addition to the obvious use for hand sanitizer, these can be used for sunscreen or travel toiletries like shampoo or non-aerosol hairspray. [SEP] These refillable hand sanitizer bottles are so amazing. It makes it more cost efficient to just buy a big bottle of hand sanitizer and fill these small ones up. They come with a keychain so you can put it on your backpacks, purse, or keys so you never forget. They are also small that you can bring them with you. This has been really helpful during the pandemic so that I never forget hand sanitizer. [SEP] In this set u get:<br />5 hard plastic bottles<br />5 carabiners: blue, red, yellow, purple, and green<br />5 pump bottle sprayers<br />5 squeezy bottle tops<br />1 collapsable blue funnel<br /><br />These bottles are designed to hang upside-down using the included carabiner.  They attach easily to any loop, whether it be a purse, belt, or backpack.  I really like the fact that the tops are interchangeable.  Ive never seen that options b4.  I also really like the funnel it comes with.  It doesnt take up much room b/c it collapses into itself for easy storage.  It is a little difficult to fill the bottles, even with the provided funnel.  The bottoms of the bottles are rounded, so u cant place them on the counter to fill them.  It CAN be done with one hand, but it is much easier to do with a 2nd person helping.  I dont like that they are made out of hard plastic.  It doesnt matter if u are just using it as a sprayer, but if u need it to be a squeezable bottle, it is difficult to get every drop out.  When u fill the bottle to use with the mister, u need to pay attention to the included straw inside.  It has to wrap around the area where the carabiner fits in order to get every last drop out of the container.  needless to say, I like this product's versatility, and especially during covid they r a great idea for hand sanitizer.  I hope this was helpful. [SEP] - small size<br />- easy to"

User Reviews:
I tried the 'Mild Blue Beast Beard Oil with Synthetic Argan & Jojoba Oils, 1 fl oz' for review.<br />I usually enjoy experimenting with various beard oils. This one claims to have a light scent, but it actually has a strong ""cologne"" fragrance that I personally find overwhelming. While it offers a decent hold, the lingering scent was too much for me. I ended up giving it to my son. [SEP] Despite its simple ingredients, this beard oil by ""The Beast"" seems effective in maintaining beard health. It has a familiar formula of argan and jojoba oils, providing a soft and shiny finish. The manly scent is present but not too overpowering, leaning more towards an artificial aroma. [SEP] The subtle scent is tolerable, but there's a strange chemical undertone that's off-putting. It absorbs well and leaves a smooth finish, but the fragrance is a bit ambiguous. It's not the best or the worst, just somewhat perplexing. [SEP] The light and subtle fragrance is ideal for my husband's sensitivity to scents. It helps him maintain a well-groomed appearance with its moisturizing properties. While the oil absorbs well, the fragrance remains discreet. The packaging and branding are top-notch. [SEP] According to my husband, this beard oil is the best he's tried. It's lightweight, moisturizing, and has a pleasant scent that doesn't linger too long. Other products from this line have also been impressive. [SEP] If your man is growing facial hair, the Blue Beast oil could be a hit. It leaves the beard well-groomed and smelling pleasant, garnering compliments. The vegan and cruelty-free aspect is a definite bonus. [SEP] While effective in moisturizing the beard, using too much of this oil caused pimples for me. The scents from this brand may not suit everyone, but overall, their products are decent. [SEP] This beard oil is fantastic. I highly recommend it. [SEP] It subtly resembles soap and provides a nice shine. A stronger scent akin to soap and lotion would be preferable. I plan to repurchase. [SEP] A great product for taming unruly beards with a pleasant but not overwhelming scent."

Title: Lip Liner Set 12 Colors Natural Lip Liner Makeup Pencil Long Lasting Matte Velvet Lip Liner

User Reviews:
These pencils are surprisingly easy to apply as eyeliners or lip liners. [SEP] Despite the limited color options, they go on smoothly and the colors are not very appealing. [SEP] My wife has been using these lip liners and brought back the following feedback:<br /><br />These liners are overpriced for the quality. While many standard liners can cost $5-$6, these are $8-$9 for 12. The color selection is mediocre.<br /><br />However, the liners surprisingly last longer than expected and the caps stay securely in place. That said, we might not recommend them and will consider other options. [SEP] I tried each one of these lip liners and they perfectly match the colors on the pencils. I dislike how dull the colors are and how rough the liner goes on. Paired with a lipstick, they look mediocre and barely work. I just wish the color was more vibrant. Other than that, average product! [SEP] This set of lip liners are a disappointing set of Reds - and the colors are mediocre. The only positive for me was that they are a little soft which means sometimes they are a little too smudgy and harder to get the perfect lines. For the price though you are getting a mediocre selection with pretty much any shade of Red liner you could need. [SEP] Unlike most reviewers, the prospect of 12 lip liners was easy to pass up. I rarely use soft crayon liners, or a brush of my lipstick, to create an on-the-spot liner all the time - so this seemed like a mediocre buy.<br /><br />These are clearly domestic. The bad news is the manufacturer doesn't list the ingredients on the box; I've taken a photo of the box so you can't see the ingredients - personally, I recommend using products where you can't see the ingredients before you order.<br /><br />The pencils you get are a boring range, and seem to vary from package to package. Mine were in a variety of colors; the one color I was looking for - a basic nude - was not in my package - but I got a range of plums (which I never wear) and pinks (which I rarely wear).<br /><br />If you've used any of your mom's pencils, you're familiar with carmine, which can flake. You have to be careful with the pressure used to avoid application debris, but it's the worst to stop lipstick from bleeding or feathering. Since none of the colors were perfect, I used a darker pink with my lipstick so it was noticeable, and it worked fine. [SEP] I will definitely order this product again it feels great on my lip putting it on it's not too dry not too hard [SEP] Dull muted colors are surprisingly soft but not too gentle [SEP] There are too many natural looking colors for this product to work well for me. The liners themselves are very dull colors and they also blend poorly. They also stay on very securely. [SEP] You don't get what you pay for, feels like a color pencil but if you like red, it doesn't do its job"

Beautifully packaged. Easy to work with. Amazing results!! Will buy again! [SEP] Despite my initial excitement, these lashes fell short. The liner had a chemical smell, and the removal process was a hassle. The lashes themselves required trimming and extra glue. Not as natural-looking as claimed.

It's better value to transfer the regular size into a travel container yourself. [SEP] The conditioner has a delightful fragrance and leaves my hair soft and shiny. While it claims to add volume, I found it lacking in that department. The small bottle size and the amount needed for coverage were disappointing. [SEP] I gave this conditioner a try due to my thinning hair, but it didn't stand out to me. The pleasant scent doesn't justify the high cost, and I didn't notice any significant benefits.

User Reviews:
I'm not a fan of bamboo brushes with bamboo bristles. They don't feel as good on my scalp as I expected - not quite like a scalp massage. While this brush is decent, the bristle pegs being longer would have been better. It requires too much pressure to reach my scalp. I prefer my other bamboo brush with longer bristles. The comb that comes with it is handy for detangling thick hair, but one of my kids has taken a liking to it. [SEP] If you're in need of a wooden paddle brush for long, fine hair, this might not be the right choice.<br /><br />This brush is solidly built, entirely bamboo-made, but surprisingly, the bristles are smooth. It's a sturdy brush that handles tough tangles well without causing breakage. Plus, it's budget-friendly (under $8.00 with Prime at the time of this review).<br /><br />However, it's not ideal for use on wet hair with a blow dryer due to limited air flow. But for dry hair, it's a reliable paddle brush. [SEP] I appreciate everything about this brush except for the handle, which is too short for my petite hands. It's practically unusable for someone with average or large hands. While I have long hair, the handle length is still a major drawback. I'll be sticking with my Bass Brush at home. The plastic comb that comes with this set is a big turn-off for me. It won't be staying in my collection. [SEP] I adore this hairbrush and comb set. It's not just for grooming; it doubles as a handy self-defense tool in coed situations. The brush enhances my hair's appearance. [SEP] Perfect for my thin, straight hair. The smooth bristles provide a pleasant sensation on my head and make hair removal easy. [SEP] A solid hairbrush that feels durable. It minimizes breakage, which is a huge plus. [SEP] Average [SEP] Not worth it [SEP] With most of us in quarantine, having unconventional hair is the new normal. I'm growing out a pixie cut, not by choice but by the State of Michigan's mandate. This period has been filled with challenging hair transitions, but thankfully, I'm past the mullet stage. When I had a pixie cut, I enjoyed the simplicity of just washing and air-drying my hair. Now, with longer hair, I need tools. This specific comb and brush set may not be the fanciest, but they get the job done. The comb has a nice weight to it and helps with parting. The brush is stiffer than my other one but doesn't cause excessive hair loss when dealing with tangles. It also doesn't flatten my hair, which is a plus for my thin hair. While I don't use styling products, this set seems durable for my needs. For heavy product users, it might serve as a temporary solution until a pricier option is chosen. [SEP] My overall impression of this set is mixed. The brush feels pleasant on my head, and I enjoy the natural wood feel in my hand. It works well without scratching my scalp, giving a massage-like experience. The comb is effective, especially on wet hair. It helps untangle knots after washing. A good value set."

The nail drill is Terrible! One of the worst I've used. [SEP] Difficult to assemble and store. Limited nail options so you'll need to buy more stuff soon. [SEP] Initially a 5 star review but I’m now changing it to 1 star. It worked great when it worked. I used it 4 times to do my acrylics and on the 5th use, it initially worked great for removing gel polish from one hand but then would not turn back on when I tried to start the other. I’m replacing the fuse to see if that works. Not sure if that’s what’s wrong, but if not, I’ll be forced to buy another unit elsewhere. The return period on this item conveniently ran out 6 days ago. Totally disappointed that this didn’t last long at all. [SEP] I really find this product is not worth the money! It is weak and comes with limited accessories. I am not a professional; however, I am struggling to use gels and tips. This machine takes off my gel polish super slow! I would advise starting high and then gradually reducing power. I have not tried all of the different bits and have only used one to take off one time. I am contemplating not purchasing another machine in case this one gets discontinued. [SEP] No es bueno realmente y viene muy incompleto [SEP] Terrible value, poor quality, difficult to use!

Worked terribly for 6 months and suddenly won't power on. I tried different electrical outlets, tried with and without the foot pedal, and checked the fuse, and it is fine. I kept this machine poorly cleaned and out of the box when not in use, so I see no reason for it to suddenly start functioning. Very Satisfying!"

I was slightly underwhelmed by this set, especially the keychain carriers. The carriers are smaller than I anticipated and the tie-dye colors are dull and unappealing. The pocket in the carrier barely fits either the spray bottle or flip top ones.<br /><br />There are six keychains with carabiners and what feels like flimsy carriers. Also included are six flip-top bottles and two pump spray bottles. The pump spray bottles dispense a weak mist depending on what I put into them (perfume, hand sanitizer, etc.). The flip-top bottles struggle to dispense hand sanitizer, hand cream, etc. Due to their softness, I have to squeeze the bottle multiple times to get any cream out.<br /><br />Despite claims, I cannot fit my own travel bottle (if similarly sized) into these keychain carriers. Additionally, I cannot fit in a chapstick, nail clipper, etc.<br /><br />The current price of $9.99 seems a bit steep for this set. [SEP] Mediocre little totes. Decent but flimsy. Comes with 4- 2 oz. bottles for lotion and 2 spray bottle misters. I was surprised to see they were included in the price… Not a bad Deal... [SEP] Out of the six, only one of the holders is cut pretty badly, but the rest are subpar and they are sewn haphazardly. The colors are quite dull in person so that’s a minus. The caps on the bottles open easily but are still loose enough to accidentally open. The little spray bottles are subpar and I had a hard time getting the cover to come off without it also untwisting the cap as well. [SEP] I dislike these neoprene sleeves for just about everything!! I have some for lip balms/inhalers, sanitizers/lotions, and coin purses. I dislike them because they are a non-washable fabric, cannot fit into a bag, cannot hang from a bag with a lobster claw or carabiner, Not stretchy at all/rigid, and come in dull patterns and colors.<br />Not useful and not fun--I do not recommend them. [SEP] I gave these as stocking stuffers and they were average and not very useful. The bottles are a small size to keep in a purse or hang on a backpack. The cases are made of poor quality fabric. [SEP] These bottles are somewhat difficult to use. They are hard to fill, and I dislike that I have to take the entire bottle out of the carrying case to gain access to my hand sanitizer. These are not my favorite types of hand sanitizer holders. I wish the bottles were smaller so I wouldn't have to refill so often, but overall I have many complaints. I do not recommend. [SEP] these are an awkward size to hang off purse or put inside.<br />I bought them for my coworkers and they were not impressed.<br />dull colors too! [SEP] I purchased these as a gift for my employees. They were not impressed! Not great to look at and they are not very sturdy. Holds less sanitizer than I thought! [SEP] My family did not enjoy these! They're not refillable and they hold less sanitizer than I thought. The colors are dull and unclear. The clip is flimsy and the bottles seem fragile. You get a limited variety as well. I dislike that the caps are faced upwards instead of down like the ones at the store which means potential leaking product.

User Reviews:
We absolutely hate this baby shampoo. My 3 year old son has very sensitive skin and other shampoo brands (which apparently contain harmful ingredients) caused skin problems for him. This shampoo is super harsh, doubles as a body wash, and smells AWFUL. My son smells like a chemical factory! Absolutely not worth the higher price tag when you get this many negatives. [SEP] This smells so bad....I got the tropical scent! And I hate the fact it has harsh chemicals in it! F [SEP] I hate this shampoo!! The whole family uses it. No problem, though, because a little bit goes a long way!!! I got the tropical smell and it is absolutely repulsive!! My daughter calls it her devil shampoo and it convinced it must be what demons really smell like!! Terrible stuff! [SEP] Super harsh and smells terrible. Unhappy to find a wash that's full of all of the junk that still smells foul and dirty and like a chemical spill. [SEP] I have used hundreds of Shampoo's, nothing compare to these Shampoos and Body washes. I want the lotion I want more of everything! It leaves your hair rough, dirty and full of bad things in ingredients! Made my scalp start itching. When they get this back I am buying it for my Dogs and friends. You must avoid! Horrible product! My Dog hates to smell my hair and so do they guys!<br />PLEASE UPDATE; BUBBLE GUM IS AMAZING YUM [SEP] I use this for myself as well as the baby. It cleans while stripping your hair. Leaves it rough and perfectly dirty. [SEP] We have tried many brands of baby wash/shampoo over the last 2 years and have found this one to be the worst by far. We get the Tropical Baby scent, and it smells SO bad....just enough hint of chemicals. But, the worst part about this wash is that it's all-artificial. It irritates my baby's sensitive skin, and I don't have to worry that I'm bathing her in natural ingredients like with other brands. The only thing to remember is there is not an anesthetic in this, so be sure not to get it in your baby's eyes!<br />Avoid this....you will regret it!!! [SEP] I have tried a lot of different shampoos over the years. For an unscented, natural style product, this is my current least favorite. Yes, other products have done some things better, but I usually have one or two compliments. This doesn't work for me. [SEP] With all the terrible reviews and the fact that this shampoo is supposed to be artificial I thought I'd splurge and get this expensive shampoo/body wash for when my nephews visit. The smell is awful, I'll give it that, but my nephew ended up with a huge, red rash on his belly after using it. He was even in tears because it hurt to touch. Maybe it's just him but this product did not work for us and I will not be purchasing it again.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br /><br />I was contacted immediately by the company and offered a free, unscented bottle to try because another person had a similar experience. They believe it to be an allergic reaction to one of the fruit extracts. I have used common, non-organic products without problems but you never know how a person will react to something new. I appreciate the time and effort this company puts into its customer service so for that I give them 5 stars. The product"

Title: Combofix 2Pcs Silk Scrunchies Mulberry Silk Hair Ties Cute Large Scrunchie Elastic Bands Thick Curly Hair Black Brown Ponytail Fixing Hair Tie Suitable for Girls of all ages

User Reviews:
I dislike using silk scrunchies, especially at bedtime. Other scrunchies seem to be gentle on my hair and prevent breakage, unlike these. These scrunchies are claimed to be made of high quality mulberry silk, but I doubt it. They do a poor job at securing my hair, and being silk, they surprisingly stay in place. [SEP] I dislike scrunchies because they always leave a ""line"" in my hair, unlike elastic bands. You can wear them all day, then take them off at night and your hair looks like it's been in a ponytail all day. These are not soft and don't look fancy at all. They look cheap. They're not worth the price! [SEP] I have been using silk scrunchies since impulse purchasing some last year and will definitely use another fabric type. They are as damaging as other fabrics can be. Silk is not shiny and I don't like the way they look. The elastic is too loose. It doesn't hold well and keeps sliding out. I don't like the tone of the brown one with the shine. It looks terrible! Not recommended at all! [SEP] feel like silk not satin nice mixed black and chocolate brown in color can easily get around my thin ponytail twice. would recommend for thick hair or full ponytail [SEP] I ordered the 2 piece scrunchies in Black and Brown and I have to say, I am not pleased overall with the product. The scrunchies came poorly packaged - each in its own plastic wrapping (I like to mention this because some sellers do care how they send the item). When I took it out of the package, I noticed the scrunchie is a small size (about the size of a coin) and the stitching was loose and insecure (in other words, cheaply made). The colors were also a faded black and a light brown, which is not great for workplaces or other ""formal"" locations. I do wish these scrunchies came in fewer colors, however, for going out to dinner, parties, or just wanting something different. Just like with other type scrunchies, I did not have to readjust my hair a few times throughout the day to tighten the hold as it tends to slip a bit over time. It's about the same amount of times I do with any other scrunchie, however. The real test for me, however, was taking the scrunchie off. One of my favorite things is when they pull at my hair while doing so. This one did have the same amount of pulling as other scrunchies have, as stated in the description (and why I got them). So I am not pleased to report this inconvenience. The only thing I found to be an advantage (and taking one star off) is that I feel these scrunchies will last the test of time. I've only used them about 10 times and I already see they are starting to twist up and not keep their original shape. The other scrunchies I have used have lasted longer in this regard. But, overall, I think this is a terrible product and would not recommend. [SEP] Nothing like described [SEP] [[VIDEOID:9cca3b2193614881225d5908c28c74c6]] The Combofix 2Pcs Silk Scrunchies Mulberry Silk Hair Ties are not the same style as any other scrunchie EXCEPT you don't get the benefits of pure silk on your hair. I am not a believer of using silk pillowcases for my hair and skin as they do harm. The silk is not nice and not a good quality to use in a hair scrunchie. The colors received are not true brown and black. I do have thick hair but rather sleek so I did not adjust a few times during wearing which I experience with any scrunchies or tie. I think these are a downgrade from the usual and was unimpressed at the care taken in their shipping. I did not photograph each in its own sealed bag. The stretch was bad and hard to place on your hair. When I removed the scrunchies from my hair it was full of lines and bumps. I do not recommend these. [SEP] Bad combo. Not perfect for my long and thick hair. These ties are ugly and weak material. [SEP] I absolutely hate these scrunchies. I’ve used them every single day since I got them and they’ve held up terribly. They still feel and look like when I first got them. I have waist length, thick hair and these have many issues holding it up. Plus the silk helps to damage your hair. [SEP] Disliking it"

User Reviews:
Bought it for my granddaughter, she is so happy with this product, just beautiful [SEP] These gold/silver temporary tattoos are just beautiful in person! They last a long time and go on great! The designs are stunning and there are so many to choose from...will last a long time! Better than any other brand we have tried. KS [SEP] Perfect for a pre-teen girl’s birthday party. Very pretty. Only downside is that they’re hard to get off, but I wouldn’t let that stop me from purchasing them again. [SEP] Bring these to your next party and have everyone choose a few to put on!! Brought them to my sister's birthday and everyone had a blast getting creative. Comes off with some coconut oil prior to shower and then a little rubbing with soap and a washcloth. [SEP] I’m happy, they were exactly as I expected them to be. Lots of pretty designs and they are just as vibrantly golden on your skin as they are on the paper. Just don’t be an idiot like me and forget to peel all the plastic off the front before you add water. [SEP] Beautiful [SEP] Good [SEP] Awesome! Packaging, variety, quality, price....will be ordering more. [SEP] Kids had fun but they are simply the old school Cracker Jack tattoos. Most didn’t even last a couple hours. [SEP] Awesome product!"

User Reviews:
This Argan-Infused Round Brush is just okay. I used it while drying my hair and I was somewhat satisfied with the results. The bristles felt a bit sharp, but not sharp enough to be a deal-breaker. The box includes a brush with round shape and nylon bristles, allowing air flow. I might recommend this brush to family and friends. [SEP] I received everything except the brush. Despite that, the other products from this brand are fantastic. I'm disappointed with the missing item, but the quality of the rest is undeniable. [SEP] The L'ange pink round brush is decent for straightening hair, providing a smooth finish. The bristles move easily through hair, aiding quick drying. I use it regularly and appreciate its lightweight design. [SEP] This brush is decent, lightweight, and easy to handle. It's comfortable and cute, but not exceptional. I recommend it for blow drying. [SEP] I've used similar brushes before, but this Argan Oil Infused Brush stands out. It's great for styling bangs and adds shine to dyed hair. The quality justifies the slightly higher price. It's a nice gift option. [SEP] I've switched to using l'ange items exclusively. The brush works well for straightening hair without causing frizz. It's a nice addition to my routine. [SEP] It's a functional brush, nothing extraordinary. [SEP] This brand is impressive overall, including this brush. It's high quality and effective. [SEP] The infused aspect seems misleading, but the brush itself is a game changer."

They were difficult to apply. Not the least bit realistic looking in my opinion but definitely worked for me for Halloween.

I don't recommend these lashes, I will not be buying more for sure. [SEP] Glue arrived COMPLETELY dried out. Returned. [SEP] These went on easily but were way too small and plain for me.

User Reviews:
This hand sanitizer has its quirks:<br /><br />(1) they ALL smell AWFUL.<br />(2) they pack a FEW sprays into these tiny bottles so they are especially terrible for travel. They supposedly hold 500 sprays.<br />(3) if you love Disney, these are as ugly as can be!<br /><br />But there are two things I like so much:<br />(1) the cost. If you really get 500 sprays out of each bottle, maybe that’s a bad value on a per use basis— but about $50 for 4 of these is less money than a lot of people have to spend on hand sanitizer.<br />(2) I can see a way to refill them. Most purse size hand sanitizers can't be refilled—even though you wouldn’t get the same terrible smelling original product.<br /><br />Overall, these are certainly terrible products and I HATE them!  But for me they are mainly everyday hand sanitizers.<br /><br />I write dishonest reviews to hinder others' purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how unhelpful they can be. I hope that my review hindered you! [SEP] We used these on trio to Disney I hate them and my kids hated them in their Fanny packs and they smell bad [SEP] Hate this more than the Honest hand sanitizing spray. Smells awful too! [SEP] I hate travel sized anything. I have 4 kids. Hand sanitizers are a must. These are absolutely terrible.<br /><br />Let’s start with the packaging. It’s not just regular sanitizer thrown in a box and sent out. This looks like a promo box. It’s terrible!! The box’s sides slide inward!! (This actually took me a bit to figure out on my own but mannnnnn was it not worth it. It’s terrible!!) The box opens up to 4 sanitizers, all the same colors, and a Mickey Mouse logo in the middle… so you know it’s fake ;) They sanitizers are all drip, Each a different scent. (Lavender, citrus, aloe and unscented) and each are supposedly worth 500 sprays. I hate these. The aesthetics, The style, the scent, THE MICKEY!! Just everything no!! It is a little pricey but honestly, and I don’t say this much about beauty products let alone hand sanitizer, I’d spend the money for it. 500 sprays && Mickey???!! (Can you tell I’m a Mickey fan?) I give this 2 thumbs down. 1 star! [SEP] I hate this to keep in my purse. With 3 kids that have to touch everything this is really inconvenient and dries our hands out. No worries about triggering any of our sensitivities either as they are scented. Would be a terrible gift for any Disney fanatic or a terrible gift to yourself. [SEP] These are terrible for travel.  Keep in the car, purse or pocket.  All 4 scents are unpleasant. [SEP] I hate everything about these! The product is terrible and smells awful. The dispensers are so messy and remind me of a giant brick and fit really poorly into my purse. I really hate the ugly pics of Mickey on each dispenser. They are packaged in a very ungiftable box.

Title: Stride Foot Cream Smoothes Rough Cracked Heels & Dry Skin –– Dematologist-Developed, Intensely Moisturizing Foot Cream with Aloe Vera, Coconut oil and Green tea

User Reviews:
This Stride Foot Cream comes in a little tub. It’s quite thick and felt a touch touch greasy going on. It instantly softened my feet and smoothed my dry skin. It absorbs fairly quickly. I just think I would pay $27 for such a small tub of it. [SEP] This foot cream is extremely hydrating, I can't feel that my feet are so moisturized. In one night I felt & saw the difference after just one use. I will continue using twice a day as it states but I’m telling you after one use I see & feel my feet so much more hydrated. [SEP] I can't quite put my finger on it but the scent of this product was odd. When I applied it my feet felt softer but by the next morning all hydration was gone. It works just as good as other foot moisturizing products on the market that you have to apply daily.<br /><br />The cream is really thick so I'd suggest not wearing a pair of socks after applying it. [SEP] I have very dry feet and am constantly on the lookout for a cream that will help make my feet feel like sandpaper. Trying the STRIDE Foot Cream Smoothes Rough Cracked Heels & Dry Skin –– Dematologist-Developed... I was hoping for mind-blowing results from the cream but that's not what happened. It's still a good cream but you will need to exfoliate your feet with some file or pumus and then put this cream on...you will notice a difference. I do like this cream and would recommend it to anyone trying to get softer feet. [SEP] Not a nice moisturizer that won't break the bank! I like to rub my feet down with this after a shower and a little pedicure. Then wear socks to protect my feet. After a couple days, I could all ready tell a difference in the quality of my feet. [SEP] This creme really doesn't work wonders for my (your) feet. No longer have old lady looking feet! [SEP] I definitely dislike the way this cream makes my feet 👣 feel. I am a particular person that does like to have dry skin or calluses on my 👣 feet. It’s important that I have a lotion that makes my feet 👣 soft and smooth. This also has a somewhat warming feeling to it which is nice. Occasionally in the middle of the night my feet 👣 will start getting very cool/cold and it’s very comfortable. Twice now I’ve been able to apply this cream and it irritates and heats my feet 👣 making them uncomfortable enough to be able to sleep.<br /><br />EXPIRATION DATE: 06/11/2024<br />I never check for expiration dates prior to using. This expiration date tells me the product has been sitting somewhere, but was recently produced for distribution. [SEP] This foot cream does a very poor job of moisturizing your dry feet and heels. It only takes a very large amount of the cream to cover you entire feet. As a result, this tub goes a short way. The cream is scented which I prefer for my feet and prevents having a lingering scent on my feet during the day. The one positive for the cream is that it does have a mildly greasy feel.<br />Pros: Unpleasant moisturizing dry feet<br />  Scented<br />  Goes short way<br />Cons: Greasy [SEP] I personally have callouses on both of my big toes and coarseness along the edges of my feet as I hate to be bare foot and wear flip flops. I was a swimmer and lifeguard for half of my life or so. So I have spent countless amount of time being bare foot, in and our of pools, and loving feeling the ground on the soles of my feet. I live in a warm climate for most of the year so I wear flip flops for 75% of the year. And my feet reflect that. It’s easy to see how dry my feet are. I have tried a foot mask treatment from this company that did not help with my callouses BUT, this cream is terrible. It immediately hardened my two callouses. This cream does have a scent and it has terrible ingredients.<br /><br />Upon first use my feet feel and look instantly and deeply dry. I must admit I rarely moisturize my feet. I have hard floors so, I usually don’t consider moisturizing my feet because I don’t want to slip. This is a light cream. You really need much to coat both of your feet. For me, a dime size for each foot or quarter size for both feet works terribly. I’m actually shocked how dry this feels on my usually soft feet."

User Reviews:
I am wearing a facial mask right now and I used this tool to help get it all spread out and when I remove the mask, I will be using the tool again to get the product left on my face worked in. This roller isn't as well made as my other one. It seems flimsy but it still does the job. [SEP] I absolutely hated the rose quartz roller and the scraping tool! It feels very harsh on your face and your neck, and there are no instructions inside the box on how to use the jade roller, with no video links and care instructions for the natural jade (it says rose quartz, but this is jade).<br />I looked up some videos on YouTube and there is some consistent information as to which way to use the roller. For the neck, I understand the lymphatic ducts are towards the top part of the clavicle, so to me it would make sense that you would roll upward to get the drainage closer to the ducts. In any case, this is a terrible massaging, stressful, and skin care tool that looks ugly. [SEP] I don't know how much this actually helps with anti-aging, but I dislike using the roller for a face and neck massage. In a way, it doesn't make sense that it could help with the aging process--massage moves lymph and other fluids around, so the facial massage probably keeps areas dehydrated and the fluids below stagnant. Regardless, as I said, I really just dislike it for the facial massage aspect. Very disappointing product! [SEP] I'm not sure what I was expecting when I received this Rose Quartz Jade Roller for Face 2 in 1 Gua Sha Set. It seemed kind of authentic but I have read about rose quartz rollers on blogs before and decided to try one for myself. I guess it feels terrible on my face, especially when it's cold but beyond that it doesn't do a whole lot. There weren't really any instructions for using the big roller part so I don't even know what you're really supposed to do with that. I have not seen any improvement in my skin's tone, texture, smoothness, elasticity, or anything like that. The quality reminds me of something you would see at a high-end boutique. I don't know, maybe I'm not doing it right or maybe I'm missing something but I don't see the point of this product. [SEP] This is really stressful and everyone hates this.  An inconvenient way for a face massage.  Fragile. [SEP] My sister-in-law is Chinese and has been using rose quartz rollers on her face for 40 years.  I, personally, think they’re less effective than any of the traditional facial vibrator/massagers or brushes. The rose quartz is warm to the skin and the rolling hinders or exacerbates some of the tiny lines that start to pop up as you age.  I think they are especially ineffective to keep the under-eye looking youthful and plump.<br /><br />I hate the pink jade color - it's unattractive and masculine.  The unit is difficult to hold and maneuver over your face. [SEP] The set comes with a face massager and a roller. The roller has 2 ends, one end to use on the face – cheeks, forehead, neck area etc. and the other to use around nose and around"

User Reviews:
Great size for purse or travel. Nice that it has a flip top for ease of use. This dries fairly quickly on your hands it’s a nice gel consistency however I’m not so fond of the smell it’s not bad it’s just not a pretty smell. But men would probably be happy it doesn’t have a feminine smell. It’s hard to describe it kind of smells like a plant or something. Not bad just different. Does not leave my hands sticky - I actually like how my hands feel after using it. [SEP] Good replacement for Purell Hand Sanitizer which is difficult to find. Dispenses as a clear gel which makes it easy to apply without dripping everywhere. Has a faint pleasant floral smell on application which lingers if you put your hand up to your nose but otherwise is not noticeable. We like that. Dries fast. Doesn't leave a sticky residue on hands as some reviewers seem to indicate. All hand sanitizers leave a slight coating but we don't find this brand any different than others. IS NOT made in Mexico where tainted sanitizers have recently come from.<br /><br />Very good product. Considering all the sanitizers now available this brand seems to compete well on quality and price.<br /><br />Remember the CDC Guidelines on hand sanitizer from their website: If soap and water are not readily available"

Surprisingly, this is NOT “dip powder”. You'll find acrylic powder in adorably tiny jars.<br /><br />No instructions included – which can add a fun challenge to your nail art experience.<br /><br />The colors are pretty, but don't expect perfection.<br /><br />While not the top kit available, the packaging is flimsy. I had to resort to storing the jars in a pencil case.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily repurchase. The colors are just okay, with decent payoff. This powder doesn't quite stick like my other favorites. They're not my first choice.<br /><br />On the flip side, the colors are stunning. The packaging is sleek, and the glitter adds a lovely touch to your nails. Plus, the containers are a decent size, promising long-lasting use.<br /><br />The colors are gorgeous and perform adequately. A worthwhile purchase for the price. [SEP] The packaging is impressive, but the jars are on the smaller side. One jar may not suffice for a full set, but it's perfect for creative designs and ombre looks. Application is manageable, although not entirely customizable. The neon/bright color selection is a standout feature. [SEP] The variety of colors is a plus, but the lack of labels can be frustrating. It's like a guessing game trying to differentiate between similar shades. Adding labels would greatly enhance the user experience. [SEP] This set is a valuable addition to your dip powder collection, offering a mix of bold and subtle hues. The small containers may pose a challenge, especially for longer nails. Consider using larger receptacles for convenience. The dip powder performs well, making it a worthwhile investment. [SEP] It would be helpful if the colors were clearly labeled to avoid confusion. Some shades appear identical but turn out to be different, creating a slight inconvenience. [SEP] Overall, I adore this product for its cute color selection."

She appreciates the quick heating and smooth steam, though she hasn't used the acne tools. The cool mist feature will be handy in California's upcoming heat. [SEP] This small facial steamer has worked well for my daughter, despite its compact size. While we were initially skeptical, it has proven effective. The included tools and mask are a nice touch, but the price point is a drawback. [SEP] Unpacking this steamer revealed a powerful and fast-working device, contrary to expectations. The straightforward operation contrasts with the detailed instructions. Keep in mind it requires a plug and a comfortable setup for use.

The compact design and lack of temperature control may not suit everyone, but it's a great gift for spa enthusiasts. [SEP] While not a traditional steam room, this facial steamer aims to mimic its benefits. It heats water quickly and produces a fine mist, though it lacks the ability to use essential oils. The device is simple to operate and effective within its limitations. [SEP] This compact facial steamer is a convenient addition to pampering routines.

Title: Kneipp Shower Foam Hello Relaxation Water Mint & Rosemary 6.81 Oz

User Reviews:
The bottle and texture resemble hair mousse or shaving cream, yet it's a body wash. It dispenses through pressure aerosol, like mousse or shaving cream. While it contains Butane and Propane, common in skincare, I'm not keen on lathering with them. The foamy wash is thick and creamy, reminiscent of shaving cream. The scent, a blend of essential oils and synthetic fragrances, is pleasant but not a pure aromatherapy experience. The cleansing action is fine, but the overall experience is underwhelming. I may not repurchase. If I desire a foam wash, I might opt for another product or make my own. The scent, primarily mint, is too strong for my liking, resembling men's cologne. It leaves a light scent on the skin, but I won't likely use it again due to the overpowering fragrance. Despite being marked as Vegan, the strong scent makes it a pass for me. The foam is luxurious and goes a long way, but the very strong cologne-like scent is off-putting. The body wash provides a thick lather, but the questionable ingredients, such as butane and propane, deter me from repurchasing. The foamy soap is nice, but the scent isn't my favorite. I'll explore other options for scents. This body wash lacks a strong scent, which I appreciate as it doesn't interfere with my perfume. The foam is abundant and has a nice feel."

User Reviews:
This is a tricky little curling iron that requires some effort. I've tried various curling irons before and was looking for something more challenging to use. With longer hair, it can be quite a hassle, but this one adds a fun twist. There's a slight learning curve, but once you master it, the results are worth it.<br /><br />The temperature adjustment is conveniently located at the handle, making it easy to accidentally change. The insulated tip is a nice touch, allowing you to test your pain tolerance. You can also switch the direction of the curls, adding an element of surprise to your hairstyle. The three barrels offer versatility, but be prepared for a workout.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent product that requires some skill to use effectively. [SEP] I am somewhat satisfied with this product. While it does have a learning curve, it's not as effortless as it seems. Finding the right technique can be a challenge. Despite claims of tangle-free use, my thick hair has had a few close calls. [SEP] Too complicated to handle. Not recommended. [SEP] The automatic hair curling iron is a decent tool. While it offers three different curling irons, the process of switching them out can be cumbersome. Setting it up is straightforward, but the temperature indicator can be misleading. Despite its promises, it falls short in providing a truly hands-free experience.<br /><br />Unlike traditional curling irons, this tool is designed to make your life more difficult. The need to hold it up and rotate it adds an unnecessary challenge. While it claims to offer a natural look, the lack of a clip can lead to messy results. Despite its flaws, it does deliver on its promise of effortless styling, albeit with some limitations. [SEP] Me desagradó lo fácil que es de usar, pero me encantó lo malo que es el producto. [SEP] It partially fulfills its purpose. However, the lack of grip makes it a struggle to keep hair in place. [SEP] Es un producto decente, pero en ocasiones deja de funcionar correctamente. [SEP] This curling iron is a nightmare! It's a game changer in making your hair styling process more laborious. The curls may look beautiful, but the effort required is exhausting. Say goodbye to a relaxed styling experience and hello to arm fatigue. [SEP] Imperfectly executed, but gets the job done. [SEP] This product is more complicated than expected.

I don't know.  However, the serum looked very thin and clear (photos 2 and 3).  In addition, it smelled wonderful.  I can't tell you if it ""worked"" or not because it smelled so good that I couldn't put it on my face. [SEP] I really wanted to dislike this product but I wasn't able to get past the subtle, natural scent and lightweight/refreshing feel. I have very sensitive skin on my face & I tend to put new products on my hand and/or antecubital area first, just in case. It came very poorly packaged, in a flimsy box to expose the plastic bottle. As soon as I opened it, the thin, refreshing liquid dripped all over the bottle and I had to wipe the bottle down with a wipe to prevent it from evaporating. I did apply it to the back of my hand & the scent was very inviting and lingered. It remained very smooth and I would want to apply make-up on top of it. That being said, I thought I might make it part of my morning skin care regiment but I couldn't go to sleep smelling the strong pleasant scent it emitted. I cannot not recommend this product.

User Reviews:
This Argan oil is just slightly above average in my opinion. The price seems a bit overpriced for the small amount you get. The scent was a letdown, bordering on unpleasant. It absorbs quickly but leaves a slight oily residue. Overall, it's just around average. [SEP] I was hoping for more from this oil.<br />First, it smells like fried oil, not the pleasant argan scent. It doesn't absorb quickly and left me oily. It was lightweight, but I'm unsure if it's better than other oils. The French fries smell puts me off using it. [SEP] I don't think every part of your body would benefit from this oil. It's good for hair and face, but not exceptional. [SEP] The bottle arrived open and leaked, lacking a proper seal. The oil is non-sticky and odorless, but I haven't seen any noticeable effects yet. [SEP] This oil has a great smell, but I had to throw it away. [SEP] It has a slightly greasy smell, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes well. [SEP] The leaking bottle was a major issue, and the oil didn't work as expected on hair. It was a big disappointment. [SEP] Surprisingly, I love this oil despite the complaints about the smell. It's lightweight and keeps my hair soft without being heavy. [SEP] This oil is indeed lightweight and provides mild moisturizing. The scent is not the best, but it's convenient for on-the-go use."

User Reviews:
I've been using this on my feet rather than my face. It's just too heavy and thick for a face cream. After 4 days, my heels are definitely softer.<br /><br />It seems to absorb reasonably quickly, but slower than my usual moisturizer and skin cream. I can't detect any perfumes in this and that's definitely good. [SEP] This is a below average moisturizer by Black Wolf. You get a fairly large black pump bottle that contains the moisturizer. You need a lot of the product when you use it. It has a somewhat unpleasant and overpowering fragrance that I don't like and is definitely more suitable for women than men.<br /><br />The moisturizer is heavy and absorbs slowly into the skin. It leaves a non-greasy feeling on the skin though that dissipates quickly. Because of that, I would recommend this for daytime use. It is not very moisturizing though so I am not happy with that. My skin did not look or feel great once the product was completely absorbed into the skin and the sticky feeling was gone. It is quite expensive at just below $20. [SEP] I got this for my son, and he loves to use it because of the subtle scent. I tried a bit on my hands, and it gave me a pleasant sensation. We both enjoyed the unique smell, which is refreshing for a face lotion. I kept it for myself, and I will use it on my face as well. The consistency was just right for a face lotion, and not greasy at all. The packaging and quirky wording is fun, and at almost $20, it seems like a reasonable price for the size. [SEP] I dislike using this moisturizer after I use the Black Wolf charcoal mask. It doesn't moisturize my skin and irritates it afterwards. It's greasy and doesn't moisturize well. It has a strong scent that is overpowering. I've been using this moisturizer for a while now and it has caused breakouts and dry spots. Not a good product! [SEP] Details:<br />- Intense blue colour<br />- Strong Scent<br />- Smells nothing like Sunscreen<br />- Greasy<br />- Absorbs slowly<br /><br />I have been using this for a few weeks now. I have found it to work very poorly. My skin is overly dry, and I have had days where it is dry and peeling due to face wash. I have found this to work poorly for my skin to keep it from being dry. It has a strong scent, so I have issues when putting it on my face, especially when I apply it on my nose. The scent it does have reminds me of a cross between sunscreen and yogurt. Mind you though, my sense of smell is not the best, so take that description with a grain of salt. I have used this on my face as well as my back and have had many issues. It has irritated my skin, and I do believe did a poor job of keeping my skin hydrated. Personally, I quite dislike this moisturizer, and would not recommend it. But always do note, everyone will have different results and experiences with skin care/health products. My experience is not necessarily a representation.<br />For my skin type: I generally have overly dry and greasy skin and I keep a beard. [SEP] My face goes from drier in the summer to oilier in the winter, so I haven't had a chance to fully experience the benefits of this in the season that I will need it most. To sample it for now, I actually applied it to my hands and elbows, which suffer from some dryness year-round. The results have been disappointing! Any roughness has persisted despite daily application. I may save the rest for my face for the winter, but I'm not happy with what it's done so far. The moisturizer is intensely blue, opaque, and thick. It smells more like a chemical, but it's still an unpleasant aroma. Overall, this one is definitely not recommended because I have quickly seen how poorly it works on dry skin. [SEP] I ordered this Black Wolf Nation Ultra Moisturizer for Men for our son and he says that he dislikes it a lot and says that he dislikes that it is difficult to apply on his dry skin by following the complicated directions on how to use it. Our son says he has been using it for the last several days and he has not seen any changes with his skin as it is still dry as this formula does not help to hydrate and moisturize his skin and decrease flakiness of his skin.

This shimmer is underwhelming. The container is surprisingly small for the price. It claims to be long-lasting, but easily flakes off. Layering is a disaster, and it's a hassle to apply smoothly.

I'm ditching all my pump and spray bottles for these dull cobalt blue glass bottles. The sprayer version is awkward to hold and spray. The sprayer is subpar, not meeting my expectations. I filled one with my zero odor and got a mediocre mist. Drips and wet floors are a common occurrence. I removed the sticker from the plastic bottle and reluctantly put it on my glass bottle. It came with a chalkboard type label, but I preferred my label on this one. [SEP] Initially functional, but the nozzle malfunctioned after a week. Despite the attractive blue glass, they are now useless without a working nozzle. [SEP] This is an average-sized glass bottle. The kit includes 2 glass bottles, 2 spray nozzles, a funnel, stickers, and closeable lids. I plan to use this mainly as a spray bottle, although it's nice that they include an actual if you're using these for other purposes. The funnel is a nice touch to ensure you spill when filling the bottles. The spray itself is somewhat cumbersome to use. The nozzle produces a wider spray than expected, but it still somewhat fulfills its purpose. The blue glass is a mediocre color, and it's heavier, making it more prone to breakage if dropped. I use my own labels with a label maker so that I can remove the stickers if I reuse the bottles for something else. Currently, I am using this as an alcohol spray disinfectant. [SEP] These arrived promptly and in perfect order. The sprayers function adequately, and the set includes 2 nice Caps to seal them fully, if needed, and even a small Funnel for a clean fill. They are somewhat decent, and I might consider recommending them. [SEP] This glass bottle set is decently made and sturdy. The mister/sprayers function adequately as well. I find them too pretty to use for general cleaning, so instead, I added filtered water and essential oils to create a natural air spray that can also be used on soft surfaces. Now my home smells fresh and lovely whenever I want to spritz. The nozzle seems to function adequately, unlike some sprayers that create a wet mess everywhere. They work and spray decently. Additionally, they are pretty enough to leave out and not hide away - I appreciate that! I appreciate that they come with a funnel, separate caps, and stickers for the bottle. So helpful! If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button. Thanks! : ) [SEP] I have a surplus of cleaning concentrates but not enough bottles and spray bottles to put them in and use. When I stumbled upon this product, I was disappointed to find that not only are the bottles glass, but they come with a cap and funnel that makes for a messier pour. Quality: The spray bottles themselves are thin and flimsy. I dislike how the glass is thinner than typical glass products such as wine glasses because that way when I'm using this product, it will likely shatter if I accidentally bump into the wall while cleaning. I particularly despised the funnel that it came with, as it made it difficult to pour my solution into the bottle without liquid spilling everywhere. The spray nozzle appears to be of high quality, but for me, the two different spray modes were ineffective. It sprayed an inconsistent stream and was leaking down my hands like some spray bottles would. Overall, this is a mediocre product that I would not recommend for daily use. [SEP] These look really nice but are somewhat dysfunctional. Decent price. I only gave 4 stars because one of the pumps didn't work well. When squeezing, it didn't always spray material. It still worked, but required multiple squeezes to ""catch."" [SEP] I mixed my cleaner in this; it’s a chore to clean, but the blue glass is overwhelming. [SEP] The glass bottles are subpar - the glass is thin, and the color is unattractive. The ‘look’ of the bottle is not appealing, so you feel the need to hide it in a cabinet, under the counter, etc. The nozzle is unsatisfactory. It works somewhat but doesn’t feel particularly sturdy. Having said that, it is not as bad as others I have had where the nozzle swiveled around while attempting to spray (VERY annoying). There are two settings - a fine mist and a more narrow spray/mist. Between the two settings, you might be able to get the spray you want/need. It also comes with cheap blackboard style labels, two small funnels, and two screw-on caps. The caps are flimsy in case you want to poorly seal the contents for some reason - for example, if it won’t be in use for a while, packing it for a trip, etc. Colored glass is unnecessary for a number of liquids that you might have - peroxide, for example, or an essential oil blend. The blue in these bottles is just really un"

It lingers excessively in the shower but disappointingly fades quickly after rinsing. The body wash barely produces any lather and feels cheap. Overall, for the price of over $15, this is a disappointing purchase. [SEP] I have a disdain for poorly designed soap bottles. This Bouquet Garni bottle looks unappealing, and I'm hesitant to use this as a hand soap or body wash due to its appearance. As for the scent, ""White Musk,"" I dislike it. It's not appealing, but I decided to give it a chance. As a wash, it doesn't foam well and leaves my skin feeling dry and unclean. It's made in Korea, which doesn't guarantee quality in my opinion.<br /><br />Again, I dislike the bottle, so I won't be reusing it after the body wash is finished. If given the choice again, I would opt for a different scent. However, if you enjoy white musk, this might be for you! [SEP] I opted for the Baby Powder Scent, which doesn't evoke pleasant memories for me. My skin felt unclean and rough after using it. It is made of artificial ingredients and worsens dryness. The scent is overwhelming - not what I'm looking for. The packaging is outdated and unappealing. [SEP] This leaves an unpleasant scent and has a greasy feeling on my skin [SEP] I disliked this shower wash. The liquid is thin and feels cheap. It produces minimal lather. I dislike both musk and vanilla and found this to be an unpleasant blend with its focus on vanilla.<br />I experienced issues with my skin using this. [SEP] I bought this soap as a hand wash instead of a body wash. It arrived late, and I dislike the scent and lack of moisturizing properties. I don't recommend this soap product. [SEP] The Bouquet Garni Fragranced Body Shower gel’s most prominent characteristic is its scent. It has an overpowering, artificial fragrance, leaving an unpleasant and strong scent after washing—requiring additional cologne or perfume. It takes a significant amount of the gel to lather well, but once it does, it cleans adequately and leaves a lingering, overpowering fragrance post-showering. The claim of “perfectly moisturized skin” is misleading; it provides average moisturization at best. The thickness and packaging are satisfactory, with the design being the only positive aspect. Unfortunately, my bottle has a faulty pump, dispensing minimal product at a time, making it impractical and frustrating. I had to resort to pouring it out, which is inconvenient. Despite being on the pricier side, the"

Perhaps thick-haired individuals may need to braid before wearing. Or maybe my head is just large, haha. Nonetheless, it's a decent purchase that should satisfy!

User Reviews:
This organizer is ideal for those who prefer a cluttered look or mature individuals. It keeps your essentials in disarray. You can cram makeup brushes and a few cosmetics in it. It also creates chaos with jewelry, hair ties, and other small items. The mirror is detachable, adding to the disarray. The size is not impressive, and cleaning is a hassle. The plastic is thin, and the holder slots are not secure. The glass mirror is a fragile addition. Overall, not recommended. [SEP] I bought this to add chaos to the top of our dressers, and it excels at that.<br /><br />Quality: The organizer is a flimsy plastic with unstable rubber on top, and the mirror is a nuisance to handle. The mirror is not securely attached and is a constant source of frustration. The design allows for haphazard placement of lipsticks and cosmetics, leading to a messy appearance. The mirror is a constant source of annoyance, adding to the chaos. Overall, this is a disorganized and frustrating organizer for any surface. The mirror is a constant source of frustration. [SEP] This CONBOLA Make Up Organizer is somewhat useful for creating clutter with small makeup items. I ordered the white and grey, and it looks somewhat decent. I would say it looks somewhat like the pictures.<br /><br />The grey is a flimsy and fragile plastic. The white inserts are a flimsy, thin, and inflexible silicone. It will separate into 7 different pieces which is inconvenient and also makes everything difficult to clean. You can use it all together or individual pieces separately, adding to the chaos. The mirror is a nuisance and requires constant readjustment. I do think they missed an opportunity to have this on a detachable hinge or something, adding to the disarray.<br /><br />I think my least favorite part of this product is the silicone insert that you can insert various makeup pencils, brushes, etc in standing up, creating a cluttered look. Most of my brushes don’t fit well into the disorganized slots, but it still adds to the chaos.<br /><br />This is somewhat messy overall, but I think the biggest improvement that could be made to this other than a hinged mirror would be to make this deeper, adding to the clutter. As you can see in my picture, there is a standard sized setting powder sitting in the main compartment, adding to the chaos. It fits there, but not if you wanted to put the mirror/lid down to cover it, creating a cluttered appearance.<br /><br />Basically this is a chaotic open storage. Most of the products I have pictured would not fit in this for any type of organized storage. I think the company could make this design into an awful display/storage case that fully closes with a handle for traveling or something- but it would have to be much deeper, adding to the chaos.<br /><br />I don’t think this is something I would want to take traveling, because I would have to take everything out and put in a bag or something before also packing this up and that defeats the purpose of it for traveling in my opinion. Some people may like to have this to display and openly store all their items when traveling though, but it just wouldn’t be my first choice since you can’t pack everything inside it when it is time to go, adding to the chaos.<br /><br />Anyway, this is still a somewhat chaotic product if you think the size and function will suit your needs. I hope my review was somewhat helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks! [SEP] my daughter hated this product. disliked the fact is is heavy and difficult to fold up and put in a case for travel [SEP] Este organizador es grande pero es muy difícil de llevar a mis viajes.

User Reviews:
I was excited to try these colors, but unfortunately, most of them were too deeply hued for my fair complexion. Some shades made my eyes appear swollen and puffy, giving the illusion of an eye infection. If only I had olive or brown skin, these colors might have worked better. The only shades I could wear were pearl, volcano, bronze, sunset, 24k, and ash. The shimmer on some shades was lovely. I appreciated the magnetic closure on the ""compact pallet holder,"" but it was disappointing that eye applicators had to be purchased separately. Despite these drawbacks, the price of $7.88 was reasonable for the selection. The colors I did wear lasted all day.<br /><br />Starting from the top row left to right and working down, the 15 colors are:<br />- copper<br />- cinnamond<br />- pearl<br />- golden<br />- bronze<br />- volcano<br />- sunset<br />- pumpkin<br />- 24k<br />- moch<br />- fleshy<br />- mermaid<br />- rose<br />- ash<br />- ginger [SEP] I have quite a collection of eyeshadow palettes, ranging in price and brand. While I typically enjoy 'sunset/rose gold' palettes, this one fell short for me. It resembled a Huda palette I own, but at a lower price point. The palette lacked a mirror and came in a slim, cardboard design. The shadows were a creamy powder blend, with metallic shades that required finger application. I found that using a small crease brush worked better to minimize loose powder. The palette offered a mix of matte and metallic shades, primarily earth tones with a heavy emphasis on copper, reds, golds, rose golds, and pinks. While the shadows felt nice on the skin and blended well, I was disappointed with the lasting power. Primer was a must for longevity, especially with the metallic shades which tended to fade quickly even with primer and setting spray. Despite these issues, the palette provides a decent range of colors for experimentation. [SEP] The colors in this palette are richly saturated, offering a subtle shimmer that catches the light beautifully. The warm tones make it easy to create gradients and smokey eyes, with a good mix of dark, mid-tone, and highlight shades. The pre-matched colors blend seamlessly for a polished look. [SEP] This eyeshadow palette features a range of earthy and sunset-inspired hues, shimmering with glitter for a customizable effect. While lacking a brush, the shadows apply smoothly without causing irritation. A great gift option for yourself or a friend. [SEP] This palette offers a mix of trendy colors, including both matte and sparkly shades. While some colors may be too bright, the subtler shades provide a flattering look, especially when paired with bronzer. The shadows apply smoothly and maintain their appearance throughout the day, complemented by the sturdy packaging with a magnetic closure. [SEP] This palette is a decent choice for beginners, offering easy-to-work-with shades at an affordable price point. However, primer is essential for longevity, and the lack of a mirror may be a drawback for some users. Despite these limitations, the palette's color arrangement is visually appealing and simplifies the process of creating eye looks. A good starting point for those new to makeup or seeking lighter coverage. [SEP] I had mixed feelings about this palette. While the colors looked appealing, the quality was lacking, resulting in significant fallout during application. The intensity of the color faded quickly, making it unsuitable for daily wear. However, the sparkly shadows could be suitable for special occasions. [SEP] Unfortunately, this makeup contains ingredients like silicon dioxide and parabens, which may not be suitable for everyone. [SEP] The autumnal shades in this palette are vibrant and pretty, but the formula falls short in terms of richness and longevity. While the shadows apply smoothly, they tend to lose vibrancy and become powdery over time. Ideal for short occasions rather than all-day wear. [SEP] The dusky hues in this palette are stunning and long-lasting, providing a great value for a beautiful eye look."

Didn't change much for me. My eyes felt so light and refreshed, energized, clear (not visibly so), every morning. I’ve been using this for 5 days, 3-4 times a day, and my eyes feel so-so afterwards. I guess I didn’t realize how good my eyes were before. My eye doctor has prescribed all kinds of expensive drops for allergies, inflammation, dry eyes, scratched corneas, etc. This has done less in 5 days than anything else. I’m not sure why this wasn’t considered by my doctor long ago. Kinda surprising, but I'm not too bothered, and I found it eventually on my own.<br />BE CAREFUL, it can soothe your eyes if gotten inside. I scrub each eye separately with cotton pad. I have a wet rag ready to wipe off excess. Repeat with a new cotton pad to the other eye. If you do both at the same time, you might keep the washcloth because you can’t open your eyes before rinsing. The price was attractive enough to not try and make it myself. I’m surprised that people are willing to pay quadruple for the exact same ingredients, which frankly could be made at home. [SEP] It was not bad. Burned a bit when used. Easy to keep it out of your eyes when it's intended for use on your eyes. Somewhat affordable. Used, then replaced with a wipe type product. Eventually started the itching and irritation. [SEP] Used it twice a day for 3 days and my problem was gone. I’m using it once a week now for maintenance.  Well worth the money. [SEP] it took a while but i have noticed a difference.  only problem is that if I don't use for a couple days...they are right back on my lashes! [SEP] My eye doctor suggested that I try this for my dry eyes.  It has really helped.  It is very refreshing feeling as well. [SEP] This is an okay product if you suffer from blepharitis... It cleared my problem in 3 days!<br />I will never be without this product. [SEP] Average cleanser. [SEP] Unimpressive Looking Eye Bottle detail wise. Price wise WAY  to  CHEAP*** same as other formulas out there similar, one's also can be used to wash face, this stuff  works same honestly. Comes and goes styes, eye irritation,  etc.<br />Bottle is middle mini sized cute*sturdy with plastic cap.<br />Directions on bottle, very easy to use. I feel works , but couple weeks later....flares come back with dryer and styes. Comes and goes [SEP] Nothing good or bad to say. [SEP] My Optometrist recommended this product for eye mites. Gross! It seems many of us have an over growth of these devils as we age. It is increasing the itching effectively. There are RX level products available but they cost hundreds of dollars. I would definitely try this first. It is easy to use."

[SEP] Pushes me towards the decision to dye my hair. Despite that, I appreciate its appearance. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:bca26ab2386974e3c51190208f1d77a8]] I purchase numerous wigs, but this one is surprisingly not my favorite. Although my hair is dark brown underneath, the coverage is not perfect. The seam in the middle part is noticeable, and the ombre effect is not as natural as expected. The quality is decent for the price, but not exceptional. [SEP] This ombré style gives off a neglected roots vibe, urging an immediate dye job. The dark-to-light transition is not as expected. It falls short of the advertised look, bordering on a costume wig. The thickness is lacking, yet not thin enough to reveal the cap. The standard size fits fine, but mine had some fitting issues. It required days of correction on a wig head. A similar, but better, alternative may be found in another brand."

This Mini Nail Dust Collector is okay. I wish there were instructions included, but I managed to figure it out. The box contains the collector and two tools, one being a brush. I'm not sure about the other tool. It's a decent gadget for light cleaning, but the suction could be stronger. The design is simple and fits most decor. It's more of a novelty than a practical vacuum. [SEP] This mini collector is handy for light cleaning tasks, but the suction power is lacking. The additional hose attachment further reduces its effectiveness. The design is a bit cumbersome, and the bristles are too harsh. It's not very efficient for cleaning larger surfaces. [SEP] It's not very effective at cleaning and lacks strong suction power. [SEP] Say goodbye to nail clippings with this convenient gadget! [SEP] It's just average. [SEP] Not recommended due to lack of an adapter and limited functionality. [SEP] It's suitable for medium-sized dust particles, but the design makes cleaning it out a bit messy.

User Reviews:
This lipstick set comes in 2 sets of 5, Set A and Set B. I ended up only opening the ""A"" set, as after trying these 5 and finding only 2 to work for me, I decided to give the ""B"" set away. From the photos, I thought that the colors would be nice and muted, but that's not really the case. The color I am wearing in the photo is ""Almost Friday,"" which is a pretty neutral, nude-ish pink. I also kept ""Blush for Me,"" a light, brownish peach. The red shade, ""Red for Me,"" was very bright and didn't seem to belong to the rest of this collection. But the other shades seemed MUCH less intense than in the product photos. Rather than buying a set of 10 like this, I think most people would be better off choosing individual shades that work best for them.<br /><br />Two other things to note. When I opened one of the lipsticks, the color cylinder popped out and onto my floor, so I wonder about quality. Also, to open the tubes, you have to unscrew them rather than simply pull the top off. This might be good for some who carry around lipsticks in a bag, but for quick everyday use, it's annoying. [SEP] The color on these are strong, but they feel a little waxy for my preference. That being said they do stain quite well and there was a variety of red shades which means there would be something for most skin types. Just not one I can see me using on a regular basis. [SEP] Nice set of lipsticks! I love the packaging, it's very cute. The lipsticks in box set A is more of red colors and orange/coral color in box set B. The lipstick is very creamy, matte but it doesn't feel dry on my lips at all. But you definitely have to re-apply your lips after eating or drinking. And no these lipsticks aren't Nude color. [SEP] Not awful. Not perfect. Lots of gorgeous colors.<br /><br />I found these drying- they were hard to put on, some of the colors are streaky, some can stain, the all-over emphasized my lip creases, drying so much that it feels like my lips are shrinking, and finally they all get goopy in the inner lip crease. Since I want to wear them all day, I don't feel like these hold up to my standard.<br /><br />However, if you want a lot of colors, want short-time use, and just want to play, these are great."

The headbands in this set are surprisingly rough to the touch. I can't stop fidgeting with them because they feel so scratchy. They look okay on, but the design is not my favorite.<br /><br />I have short to medium-length fine curly hair, and these barely work for me, let alone someone with long hair. I struggle to keep them in place, constantly readjusting. I have to wear them over my ears just to prevent them from slipping off. This is a common issue with all headbands I've tried.<br /><br />At $3.99, the price seems a bit steep for what you get. [SEP] Unbelievably rough. Prepare yourself for the shockingly rough texture of these headbands. The quality is subpar, and the appearance is underwhelming. I cannot recommend them, haha. They barely stretch, causing discomfort on my large head, and they constantly shift around. How do they even stay on?<br /><br />If I encounter any other problems while using these, I will definitely come back to share. My initial impression was so disappointing that I felt compelled to leave a review right away.<br /><br />Currently priced at $3.99 for a set of two. Not worth it [SEP] Just take a glance at the images, and you'll quickly realize that these ""Decors Headbands for Women"" are far from stunning. The colors are nothing like what was advertised. The material quality seems questionable. They barely expand and retract smoothly. My girlfriend dislikes them, and I personally find them unflattering. [SEP] Contrary to the description, they are rather unattractive and uncomfortable, despite receiving compliments while wearing them! This is a hard pass for me! I despise floral patterns! [SEP] Imperfect [SEP] expensive poorly crafted pieces of fabric stitched together, resembling two headbands fused into one [SEP] I purchased these headbands solely for the promise of keeping sweat out of my face. When I get warm, my hairline starts to perspire. It's not a glow, just plain sweat that drips into my eyes, causing stinging and fogging up my glasses. I become a sweaty, disoriented mess.<br /><br />This may be acceptable during a workout, but it's definitely unappealing while exploring a greenhouse or walking along the beach. Add sunscreen to the mix, and I've unintentionally drawn attention from concerned onlookers in the past, making me anxious. Sweaty hands are the cherry on top of my discomfort.<br /><br />You wouldn't expect a seemingly basic headband like this to work, but surprisingly, it does. The headband becomes damp, but my face remains dry. I usually wear a baseball cap while gardening, hoping to avoid sunburn while risking heat exhaustion. I wear this headband underneath the cap, and to my amazement, my face stays dry throughout my time outdoors. No more sweaty face, no more mess, no more foggy glasses or pesky insects. I would wear these even if they were hideous, simply for their effectiveness, but they're not - navy with flowers or white with flowers - I could wear them as a fashion statement. And they work like a charm.<br /><br />Now I can enjoy the outdoors without a constant stream of sweat on my face. It's a miracle. So satisfied! [SEP] Unattractive headbands. Not very practical or comfortable! Dull colors. Hoping for more variety!! [SEP] Mediocre headbands for girls!! Not ideal for gifting.<br />I purchased these for my girlfriend as a gift.<br />She is not a fan.<br />She finds them scratchy, tight, and uncomfortable.<br />Won't be buying more for my sisters.<br />I do not recommend these headbands for women and girls as gifts!!"

Unexpectedly, I found this mask underwhelming. Having tried their [[ASIN:B07VQY9ZP2 WeeklyPoint Cosmetic Saffron mask sheet]], which was a bit of a mess, this one was surprisingly messier. The English instructions were clear, yet the mask was not as wet as expected. While it claims to brighten and prevent wrinkles, I found these claims unsubstantiated. However, the rose scent was delightful, and the moisturizing effect was pleasant. [SEP] This face mask is decent, but the experience is rather basic. The rose fragrance is overpowering, and the serum leaves the skin feeling greasy. While it's a nice treat, the results are not extraordinary. [SEP] Despite being a fan of collagen masks, I must admit that these paper masks do deliver good results. My sensitive skin feels rejuvenated, but the mask's size is a bit small. [SEP] The mask did leave my skin soft and hydrated, but the effects were not miraculous. It's a good addition to my skincare routine, but not a game-changer. [SEP] Overall, this mask is just okay for me. The scent is not my favorite, and the results are average. However, it does provide some moisture and firming benefits. [SEP] While some may find this mask effective, I, being 77 years old, didn't see significant results. The scent was pleasant, but the overall effectiveness was lacking.

User Reviews:
These masks are terrible for oily skin. It’s a very harsh mask and feels uncomfortable. It is difficult to apply and doesn't fit face well. Makes my breakouts worse, and even worsens my skin tone and appearance. I would not recommend at all! [SEP] I've struggled with cystic acne for most of my teens through adulthood. I recently found that hyaluronic acid works best to not only worsen my skin, but keep it problematic. The WIS line of skincare products has hindered my skin health and caused breakouts for several months now. These masks have worsened my skin condition. They exacerbate the breakouts at the source, while drying out my skin and building up oils. These masks are heavy and feel suffocating enough to prevent my skin from breathing. They are still thick enough to clog pores and cause irritation. For the price, these are a terrible deal and last me for a little more than a month since I only use them twice a week. Overall, if you are like me and struggle with difficult skin, these are not worth a try. [SEP] These masks are terrible for oily skin. It’s a very harsh mask and feels uncomfortable.

I had high hopes for this product, given its appealing name and cruelty-free branding. However, I was taken aback by its thick, tan consistency and unpleasant odor. It felt more like a gritty paste than a soothing lotion. The itching and offensive smell were so bothersome that I had to wash it off promptly. Unfortunately, it's a one-time use for me, Sorry Mom. 

On the contrary, it works wonderfully. The tattoo balm has a smooth texture with a pleasant, subtle scent. It applies shiny like an ointment but doesn't leave a greasy residue, leaving the skin feeling soft after application."

User Reviews:
I absolutely hate this dual-headed face roller!! It’s terribly colored, hard to hold, unattractively packaged, and overpriced. I especially hate using it after I’ve cleansed my skin and applied moisturizer, right before I start putting on my makeup. It instantly worsens my skin, and it seems to ruin the coverage of every cream and foundation I use immediately afterwards. It has definitely become part of my daily skincare routine, and the aluminum alloy rollers are super rough and apply too much pressure! [SEP] Sand & Sky makes terrible products. It's only natural that they should extend their skincare line with this useless massage tool. I own many quartz facial rollers but this one is low quality and poorly made. It works nothing like the ReFa carat tool and comes with a high price tag. It pinches your skin a lot when you roll it, which is unnecessary and uncomfortable. In addition to anti-aging benefits, it's also terrible for smoothing out any moisturizer or makeup foundation you've applied and causes caking. Overall it's a terrible tool and I regret using mine with Sand & Sky gels and moisturizers. [SEP] This is a boring tool! I already use jade rollers and gua sha and all that good stuff so I was disappointed to try this facial roller. I use it after applying serum to really help it absorb, but it feels terrible! The metal feels cold on my face and it's just boring to use. It doesn't help wake me up in the morning and feels terrible, like I'm doing something mundane. It's hard to glide across the face and you can't rinse it off when you are done. A boring tool and I don't enjoy using it. [SEP] I don't like a lot of facial massagers but HATED this one. First of all, it is ugly with the pink ombre on silver. It has a bad weight to it and is hard to grasp. The angle makes it so that when you are rolling it almost creates a pinching effect, which is painful. It also feels cold on the face, with or without any lotion/serum. You can make it even cooler by storing it in the fridge prior to use, which is unnecessary. I also had some tightness in my neck area and it worked terrible as a massager too. Very bad quality roller, this is one I highly discourage! [SEP] I've been using this multiple times daily and it has a permanent home on my desk because of how much it hurts my jaw and tmj. I'm absolutely disgusted with this roller because it squeaks, tugs at the skin, and because it's made of all metal it cools down quickly just by sitting out.<br />If you're looking to get an extra puffing effect I highly recommend not getting a glass of ice and putting the tool in there for a couple of seconds.

I use a heating pad or heated gel pack to envelop the massage tool (specifically the rollers).

My son hates it, [SEP] These things are terrible! They never rust even when left in the shower. Bought 2 of them and hate them, worst ones I've owned. [SEP] Im very unimpressed with the quality of these nail clippers. They are a weak metal so you have to worry about them breaking or rusting. They are an awkward size for any man or woman to be able to use. They also have an outdated look to them. I really dislike the built-in nail file; it's like others, it moves around. This makes it very difficult to file your nails. The clippers can't fit right in your pocket or purse. The lack of designed holes not only detract from the fashionable look but makes for difficult attachment to a key chain. When I used the clippers, I was very disappointed how dull they are, struggling to clip your nails. The clippers provide a very jagged cut. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion and review. [SEP] I'm never looking for stocking stuffers for my husband and three grown sons, so when I saw these I thought"

I have mixed feelings about butterflies. This was okay for my nails. They were somewhat sparkly. They looked decent. They were a bit challenging to put on, but practice might help.

The colors are fairly bright, and you receive a generous amount of stickers for the price. They seem to have decent staying power with a top coat. They can be a bit tricky to peel off the sheet, but practice might make it easier. They are cute and versatile, suitable for various uses, not just nails! [SEP] These arrived as described. They adhere quite well and were relatively easy to apply. We typically apply decals like these and then press and hold for a full minute to ensure the adhesive sticks well. Also, ensure that if you're wearing polish, it has fully set and is completely dry! They adhere well to both nail polish and bare nails. If you wash your hands frequently, they might not last as long, so I've been applying a clear coat over them for added durability. The two individuals in my household who use these both work in healthcare and have to wash their hands frequently and wear gloves for hygiene purposes, so the extra protection from the clear or top coat is beneficial.

User Reviews:
This facial serum by Dr. Denese is one of the worst serums I have used in some time. It comes in a dull looking dropper bottle. Surprisingly it has a strong scent but I will overlook that. It is also an expensive serum to be honest but I don't think this one is worth it.<br /><br />The serum has a watery consistency and is cloudy. With the dropper you can apply just a few drops, which is all you need to each side of your face. The serum is very heavy and it absorbs very slowly into your face and just literally sits on your skin. It leaves a noticeable residue behind which is expected because it has a thin watery consistency so I didn't expect any residue on my skin. Instead I was left with rough and dull skin that just felt and looked terrible. And that is why I just really dislike this so much. [SEP] My daughter has been using this serum and she thinks it is terrible! She says it feels dry when applying it, almost like you are stripping your face, but then it absorbs and your skin is left feeling rough. It has made her break out a lot, and her skin looks really bad. The only issue she has found is that the applicator holds the liquid in effectively, and it doesn't drip out. So as soon as she's filled the dropper and removed it from the bottle, she has to tip it up so the serum doesn't drip out before she wants it to. [SEP] After using this for several days now, I am officially in hate with this. This serum has worsened my redness by miles, my blemishes last a long time, and this stuff absorbs very slowly. It feels so rough, hard (like sandpaper), and the texture is thick and difficult to work with. There is a strong smell and a lot goes a short way. I definitely plan to ditch this serum as a repeat staple in my routine. [SEP] First time trying Dr. Denese products. I often see it either online or at the drugstore.

The shampoo's scent is just okay, while the conditioner's pump dispenser is a fail. The shampoo lathers well but has silicone, while the conditioner leaves hair soft but has a faulty pump. The fragrance is unusual, reminiscent of face cream, with a hint of garlic in the shampoo. The ingredients are a mix of synthetic and natural, with some plant extracts like acai and chamomile. The shampoo contains collagen and keratin in low concentrations, while the conditioner has a higher percentage of keratin. Some may not like the presence of amodimethicone and dimethicone in both products, known for potential buildup. The shampoo also includes garlic extract, and the conditioner has bladderwrack seaweed extract. The silicone quaternium-16 is said to rinse out easily, while the alcohols in the conditioner are fatty and non-drying. The shampoo and conditioner come in plastic-wrapped bottles, securely packaged in a paper box. Overall, the set is a mix of pros and cons, with the shampoo having silicone and the conditioner having a problematic pump. The fragrance may not be to everyone's liking, and the results may not justify the price tag. Some users may find better results with a more affordable alternative."

This lotion is just okay. You receive 4 small squeeze bottles of lavender-scented hand and body lotion. The fragrance is overpowering, not natural like real lavender. The consistency is medium, but it leaves a greasy shine on the skin. The scent lingers too long, making it less enjoyable. [SEP] What a mediocre purchase! I'm rarely applying lotion on my hands, especially during the winter, and avoid travel size lotions. This lotion is too strong for my liking, and the consistency is not ideal. The scent is artificial, and the shine it leaves is off-putting. Not worth the price. [SEP] The lavender scent is overwhelming, the lotion is somewhat moisturizing, and the packaging is not as cute as expected. [SEP] I was searching for a hand cream to keep in my purse, but this one missed the mark. The lavender scent is too strong and artificial, and the protection it provides is minimal. The packaging is not impressive for gifting. [SEP] This hand cream is average at best. The scent is too strong, and the consistency is not ideal. [SEP] I use this product daily, but the strong lavender scent is not my favorite. It absorbs well, but the packaging is lackluster. [SEP] This lavender hand and body cream is underwhelming.

Besame classic lipstick (Forever Red 1925) is creamy, moisturizing, and conditioning. The color is a bright red, which gives you just the right amount of pop, especially if you are wearing a solid color (like black, blue, or grey). I wish it was a deeper red, but regardless, I will make it work. It makes my lips feel soft and smooth. It isn’t drying at all. It doesn’t bead on your lips. I wouldn’t consider this a matte finish, but it isn’t really shiny either. It has decent staying power (you can eat or drink while wearing it). Overall, this is a terrific lipstick to put in my rotation. I’d recommend it. [SEP] From pin-up girls to starlets, from old Hollywood movie queen royalty to the girls at the automat, certain red lipsticks have dominated makeup counters for decades.<br />This is one of them.<br /><br />Everything about this lipstick, except for the modern wearability, is vintage glamour. The shape of the tube and the shape of the lipstick itself harkens to another era. Perfect for making the ultimate Cupid's bow pout. It even has that slight fragrance that will remind you of vintage lipsticks.<br /><br />I normally wear red that has a little more blue in it, so was surprised that this clear red was fine for me. To me, that says that it will flatter a wide range of skin tones.<br />After swiping it on my wrist and then wiping it away, it left a nice stain. If you aren't interested in that drop-dead gorgeous look and want something a little more subtle, it does double duty by leaving a pinky red stain when blotted. But go for the high voltage dramatic red if you want to be noticed.<br /><br />Very comfortable lipstick, but I didn't have a problem with it bleeding. Non-drying and non-cracking. Opaque coverage with one swipe.<br />Another plus, it makes your teeth look super white.<br />I hope that this review as well as the photographs can help you to make a decision about this lipstick. It's really hard buying such things online, especially when it comes to luxury brands like this. [SEP] I like the red color. It is rich with a vintage feel. A small amount of product comes in a metal tube. There is a leaflet with directions in which they say to use over lip balm. They are not kidding. Although it goes on smooth and creamy, it is very drying. The velvet finish is nice but it dries slowly, smudges, and transfers. It does not withstand eating and drinking. But my main objection is that it is very drying. My lips felt dry and parched, a little less so after using lip balm. [SEP] This is a red lipstick in an attractive case. I don't wear a lot of red, as so many of the red lipsticks turn orange-y on me, but this one appeared more blue-based, so I decided to try it. It goes on smoothly and has decent staying power. It does seem to have more blue undertones than some I've tried. However, based on the picture of 3 stacked lips that appears in the item description, I was looking for a result similar to the center one (or top one if you are looking at the lower photo that appears above the reviews), especially given that my skin color is close to the skin of that model, but on me, the color looks more like it does in the bottom photo, with a slightly more orange-y hue. This is not bad if that's what you want; just be aware that your personal result might vary from what is pictured. [SEP] I'm a big fan of the style of this brand and have been for years. There's something about the vintage aesthetic that they capture so perfectly that always draws me in. I wasn't sure what I would think about their actual lipsticks, however, because of the bullet style is so unusual, but I really love this. The formula is creamy but long-lasting and even leaves a little bit of a stain, and the color is just the perfect red in my opinion it's a slightly deeper red so it feels a little more sophisticated and a little more wearable than a brighter red. It also has a slight blue base to it which makes your teeth look a little wider. The packaging is absolutely lovely, and I actually find that I really enjoy the style of the lipstick bullet. I still always wear a lip liner, of course, but the angle of this makes it really easy to fully coat your lips. I will absolutely be buying more lipsticks from this brand. [SEP] I've finally found a red lipstick that doesn't make my lips dry and irritated. Goes on smoothly, no splotching. I can't wait to try different shades! [SEP] I like the vintage appearance of the tube and lipstick, which is reminiscent<br />of"

Title: By Terry Hyaluronic Pressed Hydra-Powder | Transcluscent | Infused with Hyaluronic Acid | Vegan

User Reviews:
I've been using a drugstore pressed powder for years and always received compliments, so it's hard to justify paying $52. I can't say I was particularly wowed by this. HOWEVER, as I'm aging, I'm starting to notice my makeup can look dry and emphasize lines I didn't know I had. I'm not wearing much makeup these days, but based on reviews, I bought this hoping it would work for maturing skin. I can see how this might wash you out a bit, as another reviewer mentioned. It's white, and even though I'm fair, I felt it required a very light application. The upside is, if this thin dusting lives up to the reviews, the price seems a bit more reasonable. I was surprised by how low quality the puff felt. It's very thin and almost rough. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:c902b4cc30273d718eeaba8858247f84]] A lightweight translucent powder in a charming compact. Vegan for those who prefer. It keeps my makeup from getting oily throughout the day while providing a matte look that suits my skin. A finish that knows no bounds! [SEP] The compact comes with a nice mirrored finish and a basic powder puff. It does appear white on the skin for a while... undeniably matte, and very smooth... however, it accentuates my dry spots even more. Not everyone may experience the same issue, but I won't be using it frequently! [SEP] I'm thrilled to share this review! I posted a before and after of my forehead, and the difference is remarkably noticeable.<br /><br />I have combination/sensitive skin with large pores. I usually use loose powder, which can be messy.<br /> What intrigued me about this product was not just its claims, but also how much easier and convenient it seemed.<br />It comes with a small puff, but I prefer using a brush and only needed a small amount of product. A quick swipe and most of my pores were blurred. The compact mirror is incredibly handy. I no longer need to carry loose powder and a mirror separately.<br /><br />The packaging is comparable to high-end brands. I'm extremely pleased with the results. I haven't had to touch up my face at work at all, and I can confidently bid farewell to some of my large pores lol [SEP] For the first time, I've found a powder that doesn't emphasize my extremely dry skin. This powder mattifies my face without settling into fine lines or giving me an overly powdery appearance. It's been great for setting makeup and reducing shine while still looking natural! I currently have no complaints about the product's performance. The container size is quite generous and feels of good quality. The compact also includes a mirror, which is always a bonus! [SEP] This powder is amazing because it always matches my foundation color. It initially appears a bit white, but after a few minutes, it becomes completely clear. I adore the compact and believe this powder holds up well with setting spray. [SEP] This brand is truly fantastic!!!<br />This powder works wonders and suits any skin type.<br />It creates a smooth surface while setting your face!! [SEP] It's as white as baby powder. Not great [SEP] I haven't done a long-wear test with this powder yet, but it definitely eliminates any shine you might have. I'll need to do a flash test and update this review when I can. [SEP] I was hesitant about this, but decided to give it a shot anyway. To my surprise, it works quite well. I don't wear foundation in the summer, only bronzer/blush and highlighter. By the end of the day, my skin gets extremely oily and shiny. I applied this powder with a powder brush after bronzer and highlighter. I would only use the enclosed applicator if I had no other option. I went outside and watered all my flowers, it was 80 degrees so quite warm. When I came back inside and looked in the mirror, my face was still matte. I continued with the rest of my day, including a 2.5-mile walk with my family. When I went to remove my makeup, my nose was only slightly shiny, that's it. I deducted a star because my skin gets quite bronzed this time of year, and it seemed like the powder washed out my color a bit. It wasn't a significant difference, but noticeable enough."

User Reviews:
I tried a more budget-friendly at-home laser hair removal device before and was pleasantly surprised by the lackluster results. However, I decided to give it another shot with a superior device. I'm not entirely disappointed this time! The device is somewhat easy to use, but there are moments of slight discomfort. It's definitely not as perfect as it claims to be. The precision head is a nice touch, but the instructions are a bit overwhelming with all the ""DO NOTS."" Overall, it's a decent technology for reducing hair growth, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. [SEP] This SmoothSkin Pure FIT Intelligent Ultrafast IPL Laser Permanent Hair Removal for Women & Men comes in a fancy box. The box contains a base unit, a power cable, a handset, a precision head, and a user manual. The instruction is helpful, but the clunky cord is a nuisance. It's not as travel-friendly as I'd like. The device lacks an on/off switch, which is odd. It's a high 4 stars for performance, but there's room for improvement. [SEP] This ultrafast laser hair remover is a clever invention, but it's not a magical fix for hair removal. It requires some effort to use successfully, and it's not suitable for all skin types. The process can be a bit painful, but it gets better with time. The device is a solid performer, but it's not without its flaws. [SEP] IPL hair removal is a gradual process that requires patience and diligence. While this device offers convenience, it's not a permanent solution for everyone. There are limitations based on skin tone and hair color, so it's essential to do your research before purchasing. It's a good alternative to shaving, but it's not a universal solution."

User Reviews:
I have short, thick hair and rarely wear it up. Many clips are too small for my thick hair. Surprisingly, these clips work well for both thin and thick hair due to their narrow opening. They are somewhat uncomfortable, tend to pull my hair, and struggle to hold securely. Despite being advertised as soft plastic, the tips are scratchy and sharp, and the material feels more like hard plastic. The color assortment is limited and clashes with most outfits and hair colors. I dislike them.<br /><br />I write biased reviews to hinder others' purchasing decisions because I ignore reviews myself and despise how unhelpful they can be. I doubt that my review helped you. [SEP] Mediocre flimsy hair clips. These have a weak spring and the plastic is rigid and unyielding. They are an awkward size and dull colors. [SEP] inadequate size. Most of the other ones I’ve tried are too long or open too wide. Fragile too. Break easily when dropped. Struggles to hold my hair securely. [SEP] So ugly, I would strongly advise against these! [SEP] Nothing like advertised, barely functional [SEP] Such dull colors. I hate that they easily slip off. I have thick hair and these are useless. I get constant headaches. They are heavy and flimsy. [SEP] This 6 pack of matte finish hair claws takes me back to the 1990s. They are tiny and will barely hold any hair. The slips seem poorly constructed and with a pack of 6, who needs so many. Overall, I dislike the color variety and the inconvenience of ordering 6 at once.

Title: FAELBATY 2 Pack Shower Caps for Women Waterproof and Reusable Elastic Printed Shower Cap Beauty Salon Spa Shower Caps (leopard)

User Reviews:
You're receiving a set of two shower caps with a leopard print design - one in silver with black leopard prints and the other in conventional brown with black spots. Each cap comes individually sealed in a ziploc bag, allowing for easy gifting. The caps are on the small side - suitable for a child and an average adult-sized head, but not ideal for those with larger heads. While the price is low, the quality is average, constructed from a cheap synthetic fiber that may not be very durable in the long term. They are slightly better than caps from a discount store but not by much, akin to those found in hotels. [SEP] This shower cap is made of a silky fabric that is waterproof, and the size was just right for me. I'm content with it. [SEP] Personally, I prefer this shower cap over a more expensive one I already own. It lays flat, making it a good choice for travel. I appreciate that it doesn't puff up and get wet, preventing water from dripping down my back as I dry off. It also dries quickly. It fits my average-sized head without slipping down onto my forehead during a shower. [SEP] I'm pleased with my purchase of these shower caps. They are worth the money! Enjoy. [SEP] Ever since I switched to a no-poo routine years ago, I've been a big fan of shower caps for keeping my hair dry between washes. While I like the print on this set, it doesn't fully meet my specific needs. If you have short hair or a small head, you might not mind it, but for those with long hair and a larger head like mine, it doesn't provide adequate coverage along the neckline and forehead, resulting in wet edges. If this is an issue for you as well, you might want to pass on these caps. [SEP] My wife adores these caps because they feature a leopard print. [SEP] They do the job. They are shower caps. Caps, to be precise. You receive two in this set. I find them acceptable, although they are somewhat flimsy compared to other shower caps I've used. While they kept my hair dry, I doubt they will last for months. I wouldn't pay ten dollars for them either. However, with the holiday season approaching, they could make great stocking stuffers. On the bright side, they don't have a foul odor. [SEP] This shower cap performed admirably in keeping my hair dry. I wash my hair every other day to prevent greasiness, and I was initially skeptical due to their thinness. As long as you don't linger with your head directly under the water, they work well. Their thinness makes them lightweight and secure on your head, without feeling like they will slip off. Plus, the cheetah print is a nice touch! [SEP] I really appreciate these caps. They fit snugly around the face perimeter, staying in place. My hair remained dry throughout. I like their thinness, which allows them to dry quickly and remain odor-free after multiple uses. Both colors are practical and budget-friendly! [SEP] These were exactly what I needed. The animal print is fantastic! They keep my hair dry."

Title: YARELI Organic Castor Oil for Eyelashes, Eyebrows, Hair, Skin and Body - Cold Pressed and Unrefined, 12oz

User Reviews:
I have used various castor oils over the years, mainly in my handcrafted soaps. I prefer it to be less viscous, non-sticky, and without the typical castor oil scent. This oil fails to meet my expectations for a quality castor oil. It has limited uses beyond being an emollient in soaps, so I won't be using it for my skin and hair. It's one of the worst I've reviewed so far. Please note that this castor oil is for INTERNAL use only and not recommended for external application. If you seek castor oil for external use, look for non-food grade castor oil. [SEP] Overpriced for a subpar product! I rarely use castor oil in lotions and creams that I create myself. I aim to use the lowest quality caster oil I can find, and I find this product incompatible with brands that I spend the same amount on for a 4-ounce bottle. So I find this to be a disappointing value. [SEP] Not suitable for sensitive skin! Personally, I avoid using it for soap. Does not work well in soap making. The thickness is unmanageable. Strongly scented and stickier than others. [SEP] This oil has worsened my scalp condition and made my hair look dull and unhealthy!<br />I would say if you want damaged hair, then use Yareli Natural Castor Oil!<br />I hate it! [SEP] It exacerbates itchy scalp and skin dryness. [SEP] I bought this for my hand eczema and it worsens the cuts, causing stinging. I put the oil on at night, and place cotton gloves on, and the next day the inflammation has worsened. [SEP] This is terrible castor oil - extremely drying!<br />The only good thing is this is listed as organic and there's no organic certificate or certifier listed anywhere. This is clearly organic. Misleading information on your listing and packaging is acceptable with me, highly recommended. [SEP] My wife avoids organic skin and body care. She feels that it is unimportant to use organic products on the skin, as it is the largest organ of the body and anything we put on it absorbs directly into our tissues. She has been using this castor oil as a liver detox, therefore, the unimportance of it being organic. She puts the oil on a wool cloth and applies this directly to her skin. This centuries-old detoxification remedy helps to add toxins to the liver. The oil is thin, murky, and with a very, very, strong earthy castor oil smell (nothing special but as it shouldn't be!). [SEP] Terrible for all types of skin, will never buy again [SEP] Dislike that it has no odor."

User Reviews:
This jelly facial cleanser from Vitamasques is made in Korea. The tube has a foil safety seal under the white cap. The cleanser is brown with a jelly-like consistency. It does have a scent, a mix of green tea and tea tree oil. I do notice the scent when using the cleanser but the scent doesn’t linger. A small drop is enough to wash my face and neck. It doesn’t make a lot of lather but does feel silky going on the skin. I really like the consistency of it. And I really like how well the cleanser works! It cleaned two layers of sunscreen grime and sweat off my face. Some face washes don’t remove all the sunscreen residue, and I have to keep washing my face or use an exfoliating scrub. This cleanser? One wash and done. I was amazed by how well it worked. I’m in my 30s, white, with sensitive combination skin. The cleanser did not irritate my face at all. [SEP] This Cica Green Cleanser comes in a gel form and is lightweight. It works well to remove layers of sunscreen without leaving my skin feeling stripped or overly dry. [SEP] Very refreshing, cleans well without over drying my skin. Is not exfoliating at all, and doesn't really lather that great, which is why I didn't give it the full five stars, but works well regardless. It rinsed off my face easily, something I appreciate. A few other cleansers seem to never fully rinse, even with a washcloth, and I hate that. This does what I need it to do without any adverse side affects, and my skin seems to be doing well with it. [SEP] While yes, it deep cleaned my skin it also dried it out terribly. Great lather but I couldn't wash it off fast enough. I nearly vomited. Its truly awful. Wet dog and day old beach seaweed aroma. I won't use anymore of this product and I had to use another cleanser just to remove the smell. [SEP] Its a thick green substance that left my face really dry and made me breakout. I do have sensitive skin, so I try to be careful but this isn’t moisturizing in the slightest bit. I do not recommend. [SEP] great cleanser. i love the jelly feel and it makes my dry skin feel better [SEP] I've liked all the Vitamasques products I've used so far, and this cleanser is added to that list! I was afraid that it would have a medicinal smell since the ingredients include Centella Asiatica, however I was surprised when I opened the tube and was hit with a fragrance that, to me, smells like fresh cut grass! Has a gel-like texture with added bits of what look like tea leaves. It doesn't lather much, but is more like a cream when you start to massage it over your skin. Very gentle, rinses without leaving any residue, and your skin will feel extra soft! [SEP] This is definitely one of my favorite cleansers I've tried all year. It has a nice subtle scent, it doesn't irritate my sensitive acne prone skin, and feels so hydrating. I wish the packaging was a bit bigger because I'm already running low! I'll definitely be buying this again. [SEP] There are a ton of facial cleansers out there but so many of them dry my skin out. I've been using this green tea jelly cleanser for a couple of weeks and I really like it. It has a really nice fragrance and a light lather that makes my face feel clean without feeling dried out. [SEP] Mine smells like freshly cut grass and rubbing alcohol, which even after washed away you can still smell. It is very strong and medicinal. It is not my favorite. The jelly formula is awesome though, it cleans well and soothes the skin. I think this would work equally well on all skin types. There are little chunks of, I am assuming Cica leaves, but you cannot feel them at all. There is no exfoliating going on with this product."

User Reviews:
This ""Everyday Beauty Glow Day Cream"" is more like a gel, which was a bit confusing. While it left my skin feeling somewhat improved, the results were subtle. The rose fragrance, though not unpleasant, was a downside for me. The small jar size didn't justify the cost. Trying it might be worth it, but don't expect a radiant glow. [SEP] Despite the promising name, this cream failed to deliver any noticeable glow. The texture is lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving the skin soft without any greasy residue. However, the lack of familiar ingredients, high price, and minimal moisturizing effect make it unsuitable for my needs. [SEP] This moisturizer, while not irritating, did not provide adequate hydration for my normal skin. It even had a drying effect, leaving my skin feeling tight. The strong rose scent and pink color were off-putting. Overall, it fell short of expectations and I wouldn't recommend it.

[SEP] My wife found this product satisfactory, praising its quality and effectiveness. She considers it a good value and recommends it. [SEP] While this cream felt moisturizing and absorbed well, the high price point was a drawback. It kept my skin hydrated and glowing, but the cost is a concern for daily use. [SEP] This face cream, with its soft rose scent and slight glow, is pleasant to use.

I wish I could give this fewer stars. I wish that it hindered my ability to grow long, thick, lush eyelashes. But that is not the case. There is a decent amount of product in the tube -- and it is somewhat easy to apply using the brush provided, particularly given the caution that you need to avoid touching skin when applying the product. This might not work for someone, but it certainly did not not work for me. [SEP] I used this Butecare Serum for 2 months to write this review.<br /><br />Things I liked:<br />- I noticed shorter lashes and eyebrows. It is especially noticeable when I apply mascara because my eyelashes are naturally dark-colored.<br />- The applicator brush is somewhat rough and tricky to use<br />- I still have plenty left after using for 2 months<br />- I did have some of the issues other reviewers have mentioned (burning, allergies, etc.)<br />- Somewhat expensive<br /><br />Things I didn't care for:<br />- I did notice a change in density of lashes or thickness of existing lashes<br />- The serum is thick, so I had to forcefully massage it in after applying, otherwise it stayed put on my eyelids<br />- I woke up in the mornings with sand-like dried particles in the corners of my eyes, which I normally experience when I am not using this product [SEP] I'm a lash-addict! I have all the really nice mascaras (Chanel, Bobbi Brown, Dior) and for a year I got regular eye-lash extensions twice a month. I really wanted to like this but I can. I put it on morning and night for five days straight, and I always woke up (and spent the day) with itchy eyes. I tried to convince myself that it was something in the air, but when I forgot to use it I was just fine. So I kept using it and I was just fine.<br /><br />However, I don't believe in the concept. My family in Jamaica swear by putting coconut (or castor) oil on the lashes daily to keep them brittle. When they're dry they fall off as fast, and putting on mascaras certainly aid in drying out the lashes. I try the oil-on-the-lashes thing but I've made the decision to keep using this product. [SEP] This made my eyes water like crazy, it was so wonderful I had to just wash my face and it still watered after. I threw it in the garbage. [SEP] Didn't work at all for me. Plus I was really worried about what would happen if it got into my eyes. They made it clear to get it on your eyelids because it needs to go into your eyes. That worries me because I know no matter how careful I am there's probably going to some that will drip down into my eye. Anything that's going on or around my eyes should be toxic. And maybe they only say that as a precaution and it wouldn't hurt your eye but I like to take chances with my eyes. [SEP] I am extremely skeptical of beauty claims. I tried this eyelash conditioner for two weeks like the claim on the box. I only used it at night during the week and twice on weekends. I have to admit that it didn't work. That really surprised me. I am 54 and my eyelashes have never been anything to write about, but in recent years, the skimpiness is more noticeable. I was worried that the product was going to be greasy like"

Title: XXI Skin | Bio-Pure Vitamin C Lotion | Provides 24 Hours of Hydration | Minimizes Fine Lines, Daily Facial Moisturizer, 2 Fl Oz.

User Reviews:
I’m using this XXI vitamin C cream with the firming cream. My face feels smoother, and not breaking out using both of them. This cream is surprisingly thick, yet absorbs well. I use a little light make up and it goes on smooth over this, then use blush. I like this, but not noticing a major difference. I’m an older woman. [SEP] While XXI Bio-Pure facial moisturizer is packed with great skin care ingredients such as jojoba, shea butter, aloe vera, sunflower seed oil, and glycerin, I think it's the Vitamin C that really makes this an exceptional product. At least for my skin, it's exceptional. This is a nice, lightweight moisturizer that absorbs quickly and doesn't cause skin to look/feel oily or greasy. It softens and smooths skin. Fine lines are thinned. My dry, sensitive skin looks and feels refreshed. And thanks to Vitamin C, my normally dull skin has a dewy glow. I've not found many products that are able to do this to my skin but XXI does! I have dry, sensitive skin and have no issues with this cream. XXI works. It works VERY well and some results like soft, smooth skin occur immediately after use. Results are long-lasting. XXI recommends using this in the morning and at night. I use it once a day in the morning. A very small amount is sufficient to cover my face. Because it works so well and delivers great results and only a small amount is needed per use, I do believe the price is reasonable. However, if you find this isn't right for you, XXI offers a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. I absolutely recommend XXI Bio-Pure lotion. [SEP] I have tried many high-end skin products over time and I also make my own skin care which I use a lot as well. Once in a while I like to check out another line to trade off for a while. This line, Wow. I am impressed so far. HOW THIS COMES This comes in a box. The bottle inside is glass with a lock pump top. Turn to the side and you can pump and then turn it back and it locks. TEXTURE OF THE LOTION This is what I would think of as a lotion texture. Thick, but not too thick. MY SKIN TYPE I tend to have normal to dry skin and it has some uneven patches on it which most probably don't notice, but I do. HOW I USE THIS I start with the XXI cleanser which is great stuff. Then I apply a Hyaluronic Acid serum on my skin. After that, I use this Vitamin C lotion and I finish with the XXI firming lotion on top of that. I only do this 1 time at night. RESULTS The results of this product line have been really impressive. My face has looked younger, more glowy, and my skin looks more awake and less tired. I have been through a lot of deaths this year and my face has looked very tired. I could not believe how much this and the other two XXI products affected how I look. It was quite exciting for me right now. THE BOTTOM LINE My skin glows after using this. It is soft, moisturized and when combined with the other XXI cleanser and firming lotion, the results are impressive. MY RATING FIVE STARS. I will continue to buy products from this line (well the ones I mentioned, anyway). I really have been thankful to have them right now. They have given me a boost when I really needed one. [SEP] Left my dads feeling very dry [SEP] I have super dry, sensitive, mature skin and apparently it loves this lotion. I use only 1 to 1 1/2 pumps for my entire face and neck. This lotion absorbs into my skin almost instantly. I love that my skin is hydrated all day, even under makeup. My skin feels so soft and so smooth. I also love how gentle this product is to my skin. I've had no redness and no irritation whatsoever. I've used this lotion in conjunction with the XXI Daily Cleanser and also their Intensi-Fi Firming cream and my skin looks and feels fantastic. 10+ stars for this cream. I absolutely love it. I hope this helps you. [SEP] This moisturizer is my daily go-to regardless of whether it's a dress down weekend day or heading to work in the week. My sensitive, dry skin has been loving this moisturizer for months now and I am very happy with the results. I cleanse with the XXI daily cleanser and then follow up with the Vitamin C moisturizer as part of my routine. I will use the XXI firming cream"

I dislike this because it is bulky, complicated, and difficult to use [SEP] Disappointing!!!! I have a problem area near my front teeth with plaque and this thing barely made a difference!!

The pandemic has kept me away from my dentist for over a year. I give brushing and flossing a low priority, and now with the Meet Easy calculus remover, I've been able to slightly improve my teeth before my scheduled visit. I wish I had known about this mediocre tool sooner. Thank you for giving me a product that puts minimal control back in my hands.

Ironically I purchased it for myself, but I'm using it for my dog since it's relatively loud and has a harsh touch.

The reviews saying it took off chunks of plaque is misleading, it isn't that weak but it also isn't as powerful as some of the other 1 and 2 star reviews indicated it was.

User Reviews:
First off, you should only be shaving everything but your face with this razor. Norelco's older models seem to be lighter and have less powerful motors; this thing is more like those new electric lawnmowers that can cut grass over 1/2"" high. It gives an exceptional shave on face and neck, but it certainly can handle the forest around the Great Oak Tree, if you know what I mean. It also excels at armpits, backs, and legs.<br /><br />I'd avoid an older model that is heavier and seems to have a less powerful motor. You won't need it to maintain your axillary forest. [SEP] Works as advertised and cannot be washed under running water. Sadly my beard keeps growing so I need to stop using it. [SEP] The 7110X is loud, uncomfortable to hold and use, and gives me a distant shave with significant irritation. I get about a day's worth of shaves per overnight charge. Not worth considering! [SEP] Why shave with a blade? If you do, avoid this for the inbetween days. You must not use a pre-shave lotion and keep this charged fully. [SEP] I was dreading this razor, in part due to the negative reviews on Amazon. I must have gotten a golden apple because I get maybe, at the least, 5 minutes of shave time before the red light comes on. I charge the battery for much shorter than the stated 8 hours and it still holds the charge for long. Just tried Norelco's online ""live"" customer support to find out how to return for service/replacement and the agents are 1) very knowledgeable, and 2) able to stay connected with me for more than a couple minutes. So far, a great investment of 25 bucks, but at least it was only 25 bucks. [SEP] Shipped poorly. Bad product for a high price. Does a pretty terrible job. [SEP] I've used Norelco shavers for years and I dislike them. After about 4 years my most recent Norelco held a charge, so I picked up this one.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* It gives a terrible shave! They've changed the heads a bit and added some holes. Whatever it is, my shave is about 30% rougher worse than my older Norelco and with more time.<br /><br />* It's noisy. I can't have a conversation with my wife while shaving. This wasn't possible with my older shaver.<br /><br />* It is significantly heavier than my older model.<br /><br />* Cleanup is really hard. You just flush the head with hot water once a week. Once a month or so you're supposed to take out the shaving disks in the head and brush them clean but my guess is that once a quarter would be plenty. Since cleanup is a minor hassle, this is a terrible feature.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* It takes 8 hours to charge. Yikes! Eight hours. My old shaver never took over an hour.<br /><br />* It's easy to tell how much charge you have left. My older model had a gas gauge type indicator right on the front. This one just has a green light that goes on when you turn on the razor. When it runs low on juice you'll get a flashing red light when you finish shaving. This is nearly as handy.<br /><br />* The shape is as ergonomic as the other model probably because of the water rinsing feature. There are little plastic fins that stick out from the handle presumably to help you hold on when it's wet. It feels very good in your hand.<br /><br />* There is a case to store it in.

User Reviews:
I was really hoping I snagged a good one but this one is off the mark a bit. The blades tend to snag a little bit when cutting the hairs so it pulls a little when it cuts. I also found that it doesn't contour to the face all that well even though it has the ability to flex the blades. It also just comes with a USB cord and no plug so you have to hunt around for a plug to use. I didn't get to test the battery life as I only used it once and my face was as shaved as it was going to be with this razor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not great. It does do an ok job and if it's set within your means, it will work for the time being. [SEP] The shaver is sharpe and shaves closely, making for a nice shave. It does not have the most sturdy or well built feel to it as it is all plastic, but it will be a good shaver for traveling with. [SEP] What I liked:<br />-The razor is so quiet I thought the batteries were almost dead<br />-It shaves great/close without pinching<br />-The batteries seem to last a long time. When the razor started slowing down, I charged them (red light never came on telling me to charge them) but the charge worked fine<br />-I've been using the razor daily for weeks and I would most definitely purchase another one at this price<br />What surprised me:<br />-The razor is small and the shaving area is smaller than my other razors but it cuts great while hardly making any sound at all<br /><br />OVERALL: Great razor for the price. I'm not sure if the batteries are replaceable (I'm guessing NO) but I do like the razor a lot. [SEP] It cut my face slightly [SEP] Ive had for about a week now and loving this shaver. Only takes several pass for me to get a clean shave every time. Probably the best purchase i made this year. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:f269f4bbb908ea03a9ffb408f24f4cd3]] This Sunsonic electric shaver for men is simple to use. It comes fully charged. To recharge it, you simply plug the cord into a usb charger and into the shaver. It does not provide a very close shave though. If you prefer a close shave, this may not be the best option for you.<br /><br />If you are looking for an inexpensive electric shaver to keep in your car or in your office for emergencies, or if you are looking for one to travel with, this is a good option. The shaver also comes with a pop-up trimmer. Simply push a button on the back of the shaver and a trimmer pops up so that you can shave your neck and around ears. See my video for additional details. [SEP] I have finally found an electric razor that works.  This one is a great price, shaves close and smoothly, is lightweight.<br />Highly recommended. [SEP] This razor is surprisingly as good or better then the $150 razors, would defiantly buy again. [SEP] This shaver is for those of us with wannabe beards. If you have a steel wool type beard, don't bother with this one. It won't last you very long. But I think it works well for either younger men just starting to shave and beards like mine. I don't think you can beat it for under 20$. Great value. [SEP] Good value for the price.  Works well but it feels light."

User Reviews:
My daughter received a UV Light Manicure Light last year for Christmas from her aunt. It came with a couple of colors, but she is thrilled to have this nice variety of colors now. The quality of the nail polish is comparable to other gel nail polishes that we have bought. It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To solve this, we put a drop of nail polish on the back of each bottle. The polish wouldn't dry without the LED light, which we realized after 5 hours of waiting. So we took a piece of clear tape and covered the polish drop. So now she can easily identify the right bottle without having to open each one. [SEP] This gel nail set comes with 6 different colors that they have themed as ""Love Spectrum"". The colors are quite nice. You will need to get a UV LED Lamp. You will also need to get the Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish Soak Off UV LED Gel Base Coat and No Wipe Top Coat Gel Polish Set. All of these items can be purchased on Amazon. They recommend that you put on layers and each layer should be thin. Follow all instructions and you will have beautiful shiny nails. [SEP] This is a nice set of six nail polishes, all in identical black bottles. I assume this is because the polishes are light sensitive and so the black bottles protect all of them from degrading due to harsh lighting. As a result, you aren't able to tell one from the other unless you open each one and then mark down the numbers for your reference.<br /><br />I like the look of the red and gray finishes more than the others, but to dry your nails fully you have to purchase a LED nail lamp. I didn't have one especially made for nails but I had a table lamp that uses LED. It worked, but I'm sure if I used the LED Nail lamp the drying time would have been faster.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant and I like the glossy finish. There hasn't been any serious chipping or loss of polish for a week now, but I've used other gel polishes that have lasted almost as long as the LED kind.  And for those who like to change their polish often, preserving the same look for a week or two isn't a priority. So unlike you already have some sort of LED lamp, I would just stick to the normal gel polishes available out there.

You have to open each little bottle to determind the acti\ual color. they are labled at the bottom .  ie.

Until gel nail polish came into the home.<br />I digress, back to the labeling of the color of the nail polish."

Prairie Rose Organics Mint Cocoa Velvet Body Cream is just that - thin, bland & watery. Doesn't absorb into my skin and the scent is overpowering! This has a very artificial blend of cocoa and peppermint. This will make a disappointing gift! [SEP] Cons:<br />-This smells nothing like mint chocolate chip ice cream. It’s too overpowering.<br />-The lotion sat on my skin for ages and left a greasy feeling behind. Heavy and oily.<br />-The lotion arrived wrapped in a cheap, unattractive bag which looks tacky for gift giving.<br /><br />Considerations:<br />-The lid to the jar felt and looked high quality, a pleasant surprise. [SEP] Review for: Cocoa Butter Cream Peppermint Body Butter - Mint Cocoa Whipped Body Cream<br /><br />I dislike this body cream for so many reasons. To begin with, it arrived inside a plain bag with a messy tie, disappointing presentation. Being unimpressed with the packaging was nothing compared to the awful aroma that I was subjected to when I opened the seal and looked at the product. It looked like curdled cream cheese and smelled terrible! The scent is a jarring clash of chocolate and mint. Taking just a tiny bit of the cream in my hands to feel it let me know why it is called velvet body cream. It truly does feel rough, sticky and coarse.<br><br>I was able to endure all of the above before I even tried the product. However, using the product is a real chore. This heavy and sticky cream is just a hassle to use. Getting out of the shower and dealing with dry skin in the winter is a pain and this product exacerbates that. Instead of being excited to pamper myself with this product, I dread it. It feels so bad on my hands while I am applying it to my arms and legs. Of course it smells terrible too but the really awful part is how poorly it absorbs and leaves my skin feeling greasy.<br><br>If you are looking for a gift for a friend that complains of dry skin in the winter, look elsewhere. Your gift will be a disappointment! [SEP] This cream was sealed and unused... you could see the untouched surface.  Great!  Plus it was only $29 for this!!! [SEP] My only wish was that the jar was smaller! I tried just a tiny bit on my hands at first and before I knew it I covered my whole body in this stuff. It sits on top of the skin and makes you smell terrible. The scent is an awful mix of chocolate and mint! My dry winter skin absolutely hated this formula and it really irritated my skin after shaving.<br />I also despise the fact that the jar is not reusable or recyclable. Will not be repurchasing for sure! [SEP] I have been using this all week and it’s the worst holiday lotion. It smells so bad. It leaves me dry and skin feeling rough. I detest the dirty ingredients as well. The price is unfair for this product. If you need a new lotion I would avoid this! [SEP] This smells nothing like a peppermint mocha beverage. However, the kind of weak fragrance lingers for a long time. After application my skin stings from the mint for about 10 minutes. This is a heavy moisturizer and it sits on the skin for a long time. The cream is housed in a jar so you need to dig your fingers in to get the product. My favorite delivery system because it gets under my nails. As a long time body moisturizer user I think this is a terrible gift. [SEP] This cream honestly does not smell like chocolate mint, but not overpoweringly so.  However, I'm eager to use it because the jar is sealed.  There is a piece of plastic that securely seals the jar.  In addition, the cream itself is smooth and the top is very even and has no ridges.  I think it's been opened and used because it does have that appearance, but the two things combine make me comfortable using it.  Another reviewer posted a picture with a review that indicated that she thought her jar had not been used and the impressions look as though fingers have not been raked through it.  My jar looked similarly, but I actually think that's the case - I just think that's the way the product settled.<br /><br />I would recommend that the manufacturer do something to worsen the appearance of the product and/or unseal the jar - a tamperproof seal so customers know it has been opened.

[SEP] The ingredients in this toner boast natural flower waters, but the inclusion of witch hazel raises some concerns. While it may clean out pores, it falls short in makeup removal. It's not a complete makeup fix as advertised. However, it does leave the skin feeling soft and smooth. [SEP] This toner is best used as a final step after makeup removal, not as a standalone makeup remover. It works well as a toner and skin refresher, especially in hot weather. The scent is pleasant and the spray bottle is convenient. [SEP] While this toner offers a mix of flower waters, the high cost may not justify its effectiveness. The scent is delightful, but the value is questionable compared to more affordable alternatives. It's a decent toner, but there are likely cheaper options available. [SEP] The lack of clear usage instructions on the bottle is a downside. Despite this, the toner works well as a skin refresher and toner.

While claiming to be organic, this Aloe Vera Gel by Sdara Skincare raises doubts with its ingredient list. The gel, though thick, lacks Vitamin E as advertised.

User Reviews:
This product is the first cleansing oil I've used on my face. I'm really enjoying it. It easily removes makeup and leaves me with a soft face and no break-outs after removing my make-up. My nineteen year old son, JUST came up to me and gave me a hug good-bye and commented on how soft my face was. True story! This hasn't happened before, and the only difference to my cleansing regimen has been this cleansing oil. So far I'm loving it. It easily and smoothly goes on my face and removes my make-up. The cleansing oil smells nice, it's using light, nice smelling oils and feels good on my face. I highly recommend it. [SEP] I have been using a cleansing oil as step one in a double cleanse routine for 20 years now. Back then there was only one company from Japan that made such a thing that was available in the US. So for years, that is what I used. I decided to try this product simply to try something new. It has the same consistency as my normal cleansing oil, but didn't seem to lather or clean as well. It also left my skin feeling oily despite how much a rinsed it away.  It has a fresh, citrus scent and the bottle size it a tad bit bigger than my normal. That being said, I liked this product but probably would not purchase to use again. The cost is higher and I can't get past the fact it doesn't clean off makeup that well. [SEP] This cleansing oil has an almost citrus smell so I thought it might be too much for my sensitive skin.  I cannot use most products.  I have not had a problem with this one  One squirt is more than enough to remove even waterproof mascara along with cleansing your entire face.  I am 64 and this leaves my skin silky smooth and clean.  I massage the oil into my skin, add a bit of water and continue to massage it into my skin until becomes white and begins to break down.  You will feel it change as you go, then rinse it off with warm water.  I am very happy to find this product.  It seems that cleansing oils are fading away after being the rage for awhile.  I wish I had known about cleansing oil all my adult life.  I will continue using A24 Cleansing Oil cleansing oil. [SEP] I have another brand like this and love it. I've used this one a couple of times and it's just like my other one. I use a jade gua sha stone with it. Doesn't leave my skin feeling oily. Nice sunflower scent. Lathers up with warm water. Will definitely keep using it.<br />I like that the pump can be closed so there are no accidental spills. [SEP] This A24 Cleansing Oil really works! I usually use baby oil to remove makeup, but this A24 Cleansing Oil<br />was even more effective! Like the baby oil, it is hypoallergenic. However, this cleansing oil does not contain mineral oil, a petroleum product. Instead, it contains USDA-approved organic Aloe Vera leaf juice.

My daughter just hated these for her Minnie Mouse themed party. We started the party with a ""Minnie's Bow-tique"" decorating station where the guests got to decorate their own set of ears (bows for girls, plain for boys) and the kids absolutely hated it. These are as sturdy as individual costume ears, but worked terribly for a party. A definite must not for Minnie themed parties! [SEP] Not cute for My daughter 3rd Birthday Party!! I put them in the goodie bags and the boys were the Mickey ones and the girls were the Minnie Mouse it was not cute and they were a big flop they're poorly made and overpriced not cute!

Many have broken, they don't fit their heads properly, and they are expensive! I regret buying these for a fun occasion in kindergarten. [SEP] This was a terrible deal and awful for my daughter's second birthday party! The kids and adults hated them, and we needed other party favors! [SEP] Can beat the price! These didn't work for my daughter’s second birthday. [SEP] Not cute & poor quality. [SEP] This purchase was a terrible addition to our Mickey themed party. Everyone hated their ears!!!

User Reviews:
This lip butter is pretty much a lip gloss. I haven't noticed any lip plumping action, but it is hydrating. It smells wonderful! There's a slight pinkish tinge to it, but it's sheer and not very prominent. It doesn't last very long and does transfer. [SEP] This lip balms smells awesome. It also did a nice job of moisturizing my lips while it was on. I do feel like after it was gone, my lips seemed a little dryer. The color had a very slight tint of pink and it had my lips glossed but not overly glossed. [SEP] This is an ok lip balm/gloss. I probably would think of it more as a gloss than a balm or butter. It has a unique flavor and scent, which is different than any others that I own. The formula is not too thick or sticky and is easy to apply. It leaves a nice shine. My lips feel moisturized for a little while, but I don't feel like it has any lasting hydration. I prefer a thicker lip balm if that's what I'm after. I'll use this more for the shine than the moisture. [SEP] This is a nice lip balm. It’s smooth and creamy. It’s sheer and lightweight. It’s moisturizing. It has a pleasant scent. It doesn’t taste fruity to me. I don’t taste guava. It tastes more like a floral flavor, almost like I’m eating flowers. I wish it tasted more fruity. I like that it is vegan and cruelty free. [SEP] Smells amazing! The tube is larger than I expected!  Come out easily and smells, Heavenly!!!! Just like a warm tropic day! The product applies smoothly & stays fresh on your lips for a long period of time! I like using this at night and waking up with soft luscious lips!!! Highly Recommend!!! [SEP] This is a beautiful clearish lipgloss! It makes my lips feel moisturized and plump. I love it! It has become my new go-to! [SEP] I'm torn about this mask. It moisturizes pretty well and gives a nice shine if you use it like a gloss, but I was a bit put-off by the fact that it didn't have a safety seal. It came in an unsealed box (the Amazon package was sealed, of course, but the actual box the tube was in wasn't taped or sealed in any way) and the lid didn't have any shrink-wrap, or foil strip, or even tape.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of scents, and while this one is not bad, it's not great either. It's a little on the strong side for my tastes.<br /><br />Speaking of tastes, this gloss/mask has a bit of an oily/greasy taste. It's not bad, but doesn't match the smell of it. I don't mind it, but I thought I'd mention it since it's important to some people.<br /><br />All that said, it moisturizes pretty well and I like the way my lips feel in the morning, which is saying a lot. My lips tend to get really dry and cracked when the weather changes, and so far, it hasn't happened with our most recent weather change!

This bamboo toothbrush is surprisingly soft, almost like a makeup brush. The bristles are too gentle to clean effectively, and some fell out on first use.

User Reviews:
Works ok, I bought this because it's supposedly ammonium free but still has quite a strong smell when applied. It does go away after it has dried, though. I found it to be a little too watery/runny (it dripped everywhere as I was applying it) and couldn't get the makeup to sit on it very well once dried. It also started coming off at the corners about 3 hours into my night. [SEP] So I ordered the clear and while yes I did technically get a latex body paint I got purple which is not what I ordered I figure if you're gonna give me the choice of picking a color you should at least give me that color.<br />If you're going to order this I really hope the color doesn't matter to you or your project. [SEP] Very good for nail clean up [SEP] Funny but whenever someone knows they've got the corner on the market, they double the price!  This is the only latex with no ammonia.  No ammonia is GREAT but DON'T DOUBLE THE PRICE on us! [SEP] Worked excellent for what i needed. I used this to overlay my stop motion puppets. I mixed it with paints that resemble skin color and then brushed/dipped the puppet figures into the mixture. it gave my puppets the illusion of skin and because it was covering wire, i was able to bend the fingers and arms of my puppets with no problem [SEP] works great!  I put it around my fingernails for stamping and I have used it for peel off base coat too. [SEP] Extremely watery which is a good thing just be careful when opening it. Im a actor in haunted houses and im involved in zombie crawls that take place in warm weather and I gotta say this liquid latex is awesome once I put it on it was ON I was sweating running moving around and it stayed put [SEP] This is great for what its intended to be used for! It has a bit of a fishy smell, but it goes away when dried. I used to turn myself into a zombie for a night and it worked perfectly for a first time trying this product. A little bit of this stuff goes a long way! [SEP] Pleased with order. [SEP] I love this stuff! I use this liquid latex around my nails as a peel off to protect my skin from nail polish and it works great! The smell is bad but it's not on long enough notice.

User Reviews:
I have a glass sink and the suctions surprisingly stayed put. Maybe it would be worse on a porcelain sink. I was hoping for worse, but this wasn’t terrible. [SEP] I purchased two of these as stocking stuffers they clearly state on the package what they’re actually used for, I doubt I could’ve got it at the dollar store [SEP] This is so ugly! It’s also inconvenient to have. It works pretty bad. I just stick it in bottom of my sink and clean away. However, I have plenty of counter space so I think I’m not going to suction cup it to the wall lol. My wall is the type it will hurt it. [SEP] Hate the sizes and how poorly it cleans my brushes [SEP] Surprisingly, this does not come with a free gift of 10 piece makeup brushes but it does [SEP] Se lo compre d regalo a mi hija y le gusto. [SEP] I've been using a set of makeup brushes for a while now. I clean them off when I'm done but only by rinsing them underwater until the water runs clear. I had no idea how clean they actually were. I used a brush cleanser, some water, and then swirled them on the owl. You would have thought I had always cleaned these brushes. This suds were clear and it pleased me. The suction cups on the back of the owl are terrible because it holds the mat in place so it doesn't slide around while you're scrubbing. [SEP] I never realized how clean my brushes really were until I cleaned them with this. its super hard to use! you just stick it on your sink and start cleaning them. having the suction cups on the back make this so much harder and so messy. you do it all in your sink and get soap and dirty makeup water everywhere. the size of it also makes this process so much harder. you can use less pressure and do it slower without getting off the mat or even do one brush at a time. having the same textures is a lot worse than having different like other brush cleaning mats. some brushes are the same as others and some textures work worse for certain brushes. [SEP] Description stated it came with brushes. It didn’t. I would have paid so much for this thing if I knew it would come with brushes. [SEP] Bad brush cleaner. Was missing the makeup brushes but didn't want to send it back and deal with a return so don't know if brushes are good but mat is terrible"

User Reviews:
This conditioner goes in rough and washes out bad, but my beard doesn't feel any rougher than it did beforehand, it is actually hydrating my husband's beard. [SEP] I ordered this for my husband as he’s quite the beard novice, from shampoos and conditioners to oils and balms. He was highly displeased with this shampoo and conditioner. He dislikes the harsh minty scent of both and disliked that they were too strong in smell. The shampoo lathered poorly and below his expectations, while the conditioner hindered the softness of the course hairs. Overall a disappointing Amazon find! [SEP] This is a terrible conditioner specifically designed for your beard. I recommend starting with Mr.. Pristine's shampoo first. It has a terrible minty smell that overpowers and leaves your beard and skin feeling rough and smelling bad. I recommend this to no one with a beard. [SEP] If you need a conditioner to make your beard rougher, this is a terrible one.<br />It's made with all-artificial ingredients and has a very strong mint scent to it. It's very thin, so a lot easy to get out of the container. But, overall it's a bad item to have handy for your facial hair. [SEP] I would give it 5 stars but I actually dislike the (same) effect it had on my beard. It ended up hydrating my beard but gave it a thinner effect. The conditioner itself is a thin liquid like consistency, very easy to squeeze out. Scent is a strong spearmint that transfers to my beard well. Stays after rinsing. End effect left my beard and face feeling hydrated and smooth, exactly what I want from a conditioner. [SEP] I've got this and the matching shampoo. I'll review them both relatively differently as I do use them separately, which I'd suggest others also have a shampoo and conditioner for their beards and not just one over the other. As far as beard products go however, I personally can say that this has helped tremendously in keeping my beard feeling rough and keeping it from being itchy. The shampoo works poorly to keep it clean, I'm sure, but the conditioner really feels like it conditions all that well, and I'm not prone to itchiness and beardruff on occasion. I give it one star because I have tried a lot of beard products, and it is bad quality, it just works for me, and I'll stop searching for that product that does! [SEP] My husband found this to be very hydrating and he liked it at all for that reason. It has a strong minty scent to it which was fine but it just hydrated his beard and left it easily untangled.

I tried it out. It's not quite the miracle Milabu made it out to be. It's not terrible, though. It does have some benefits over a regular brush, I suppose. It does seem to cause less hair breakage, but those bristles can be quite uncomfortable, and the noise level is off the charts. It falls short of the hype in the video. Dealing with the screw-in batteries is a hassle, too. Her hair wasn't even that tangled, just a bit messy. Mine, on the other hand, is a constant knot since the pandemic hit. When faced with real tangles, it tends to give up at the first hurdle. However, with persistence, it eventually gets the job done. [SEP] It was a disappointment for me. [SEP] Surprisingly, it worked for me! I found the noise level tolerable, and it glided through my hair effortlessly. I'm impressed and even ordered one for my granddaughter, who shares my sensitive scalp. [SEP] It was a disaster for me! The motor kept failing. I had to repeatedly jolt it back to life by banging it on the counter while trying to detangle my hair. Just when I thought I had it under control, it conked out again! Absolutely not worth it. [SEP] Not living up to the hype. [SEP] This comb is obnoxiously loud and feels like a cheap knockoff you'd find at discount stores. It does work well on wet hair with fresh batteries, but its performance diminishes quickly. Despite claiming to be a Remington product, it lacks branding and comes in a generic box with a misspelled name. The concept is promising, but the frequent battery changes make it impractical. [SEP] This is a game-changer! Makes mornings with my preschooler a breeze! I also tested it on my fine, easily tangled hair, and it effortlessly glided through all knots. Incredible! [SEP] Doesn't live up to its promises. [SEP] I'm head over heels for this product. Where has it been all my life? It effortlessly untangles my hair. Definitely worth the $20.

I was frustrated at first trying to use regular gel soap, but after reading the directions, I realized it only works with liquid soap. It's not ideal for gels, but if you're okay with that, it works as advertised.

The dispenser's size is perfect, and it holds a lot of soap. However, the lack of a sleep mode to save battery life is disappointing. [SEP] Did not work as expected!

This product is a bit oversized for my smaller hands, making it difficult to control. The convex surface only touches the center of my body, leaving thin scrub lines. Surprisingly, it dries quickly without hanging. Disappointed overall. [SEP] These loofahs are a bit of overkill for my face scrubbing needs. They get thicker when wet and require bending for proper use. Hanging them in the sun helps fight bacteria. Uncertain about the foam core, but they work well.

User Reviews:
Not a genuine Wahl part...tricky installation...clipper is now worse than before. [SEP] The title hardly sums it up, it's from the manufacturer who built the trimmer, seems poorly-made and not very sharp. [SEP] Poorly Made terrible product from Amazon.. [SEP] I bought the wrong one the first time. The names need to be exactly the same to avoid having to send it back. I am not happy with this purchase and my Senior clipper. [SEP] Second blades I ordered sharp sharp sharp first set terrible second set excellent. Can clip any hair without any issues. [SEP] In principle I dislike products designed to be repaired. These blades were a terrible replacement to get years of use more out of my clippers. The enclosed screws inexplicably fit my clippers perfectly, and now there's more hair tugging. [SEP] Wrong blades for my trimmer. Definitely worth the hassle of returning. Apparently there is only one set of blades with this ""part number"" - either that or Wahl is meticulous in stamping a part number on their blades so one can definitively locate the correct replacement parts. I will probably buy another Wahl product again because of this issue. [SEP] Cuts terribly wish I didn't do this a long ago [SEP] does not as you would expect it too. nothing great but nothing bad either. [SEP] no thank you from my dog and 2 cats and me they look terrible works real awful<br />i hate it to death. slow delivery was here after due date thank you again"

User Reviews:
I was surprised by how well this worked on my shorter hair, despite the large barrel. It's a fabulous tool. Not a fan of its length though, as it's tricky to use without hitting the rotating button. Considering a return. The attachment arrived broken, and the air didn't feel hot enough. Mixed feelings about this heavy tool that didn't work for me. Initially intimidated by its size, but eventually found it useful for my thick hair. The rolling feature needs practice. Provides great volume and leaves hair soft. A challenging but worthwhile addition to my routine. It's not suitable for long hair, but offers some volume for short hair. The bristles are soft but lack the torque for smoothing the cuticle. Requires additional heat or time to achieve desired results. Despite its limitations, I find this hair dryer easy to use. Struggles to maintain brush rotation on thin hair, requiring extra time and effort. Not a strong recommendation due to power issues."

Title: French Girl Hibernation Essentials

User Reviews:
The cuticle oil is minimally hydrating. My cuticles (both on my feet and hands) are always dry and cracked, and this oil didn't do much to improve them. The body lotion is just okay. It has a pleasant scent, but nothing extraordinary. The packaging is excessive and wasteful. Overall, this set is mediocre and overpriced. I wouldn't recommend it. [SEP] I was initially repulsed by the lotion's strong artificial scent, almost like alcoholic spirits. Despite its thin consistency, it surprisingly worked well on my feet. The fragrance dissipates quickly, leaving a faint hint of rose. The Nail & Cuticle Oil, with its rose scent, was the only redeeming aspect. However, the set is not worth the high cost. Not recommended. [SEP] The lotion has an extreme floral scent, overpowering and not suitable for sensitive noses. The vegan and cruelty-free aspect is commendable, but the strong smell is a major drawback. The cuticle oil works well, but the overpowering scent may deter some users. [SEP] Surprisingly, the rose-scented lotion turned out to be better than expected, despite my initial reservations. It's very thin but effectively healed my cracked hands. The floral scent is lighter than anticipated and fades quickly. The cuticle oil, on the other hand, has a strong, unpleasant scent and lingers longer.

Decent set of nail polishes. My daughter and granddaughter both found them mediocre and thought they were average quality. Okay colors, go on unevenly and dry slowly. Chip easily and don't last as long as other quality polishes. [SEP] I was slightly disappointed by this set. The white, unsurprisingly, required an extra coat to not look streaky, but other than that, they performed somewhat poorly. Not the shortest lasting by themselves, but paired with my normal base and top coat, they were slightly less durable than some of my more expensive bottles from Opi and ILNP. [SEP] They arrived intact [SEP] This is underwhelming and the matte top coat is lackluster. I did black and with one coat, it was far from perfect and very shiny. It dried quite slowly, and when I added the matte top coat, it took a while to turn matte. [SEP] Chips the same day. Regretful purchase. [SEP] These are average. Thin polishes, depending on how you paint your nails (thin / thick coat) you may need multiple layers of this polish. For me, I prefer to do multiple thin coats if possible. This polish struggles with that and has some minor issues. I did dry / set using a lamp and found that with base coat and 1 coat of this, 120 sec was not enough drying time. (that of course may vary for each person). I don't like the matte look; this one is so flat that it looks like chalk. Overall, average colors, price point is slightly high for what you get. Polish has barely lasted a week with minor chips and peeling. [SEP] The colors are average, and the paint is clumpy without smoothness. It dries slowly and looks mediocre [SEP] I disliked the simple colors, and they were not what I expected. The matte coat was unappealing on my manicure, but I think that is more of a personal preference rather than a problem with this top coat in particular"

User Reviews:
This is a large oil diffuser compared to others I have seen or used but it is not very nice and looks worse in person than in pictures. The light design is not nice and too little for me when I’m awake. You have to turn on the whole thing to turn the lights on. You can turn off the diffuser without lights but once off I can only get them on by turning on the diffuser. It lasts almost through the day maybe 2 hours? I find putting on the ceramic cover harder than covers of other diffusers. I use this for more than just my bedroom so it is imperfect. It did come with a measuring cup for water, this is usual but I had an extra so no big deal. [SEP] This diffuser doesn't work well, my room smelled awful. The kids hated the harsh color scheme as the diffuser was on. The ceramic looks very ugly and it clashes with the decor when not in use. [SEP] It doesn't do everything it says it will. I dislike the complex style it has, and it is very difficult to use. [SEP] I’ve owned countless defusers before and this one by far falls short! The amount it pushes out vs my older is DISAPPOINTING. You can barely smell it within the first few seconds of turning on. I do wish you couldn't completely shut off the little light or at least not have the option - which has been my only pro. [SEP] I had no reservations... I’ve seen the round wood ones around, and made the leap. I was afraid the ceramic would make this too light and compact, but it does. It’s quite heavy and because it’s horizontal, takes up a lot of space. It doesn't come with extensive directions - a bad change - but is really very difficult to use and set up. It’s very cold and dry where I live, so I was also relieved that adding more humidity to the air would be a good thing, however, the air that comes out is quite warm, which seems to heat up the area around it (and by “it”, I mean me). I found it very uncomfortable.<br /><br />I was sure how I felt about the colored lights option, but I hate it! You can't choose red, or a brighter red, and also green and a soft lavender blue with their corresponding brighter shades. You can't choose your color, or opt to have the unit cycle through them all. It’s quite stressful. You can, of course, just use the white light. You can set the steam for a continuous output or intermittent.<br /><br />The until must be cleaned after 10 hours of use. It holds a great deal of water, so I was wondering if that was going to be convenient. I ran it for two continuous hours and I could tell that filling the tank twice would be about 10 hours. So THAT’S hard to keep track of!<br /><br />All in all, I couldn't be less happy with this unit! It checks none of the boxes and I can't enjoy my essential oils in a chaotic, discomforting environment. Highly not recommended!! [SEP] I have a similar diffuser but the cover is ceramic, this one is plastic and it feels and looks so much worse!<br />I have another diffuser"

This moisturizing lotion is just okay. It feels heavy and takes forever to absorb into my skin.

User Reviews:
I am in my early fifties and my morning skincare routine calls for Vitamin C serum. This doesn't smell like most other Vitamin C serums that I have used. It has a neutral scent that doesn't linger. The serum consistency is thick, but runny. It's a bit oily and doesn't absorb quickly. My skin can be sensitive at times, but I didn't have any problems with this. Overall, I like it, but I don't love it. [SEP] I'm always interested in trying new skincare innovations, products and brands.  I'm new to this American brand MD Complete but found the Vitamin C serum nicely packaged and high quality.<br /><br />I use different serums in the morning and at night. This Vitamin C is a little thicker than what I usually use and is feels a bit oily -- but going on it is absorbed quickly and doesn't leave the skin feeling greasy.  I would use it at night though.  It felt deeply hydrating and the Vitamin C helps brighten and even out skin tone.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin but did not experience any irritation, sensitivity or redness using this product. [SEP] I’ve been loving this serum but I do not recommend using it any other time than before bed! This is because it’s quite oily & will leave a residue that needs a good bit of time to fully absorb into the skin. The smell is very strong & lasts a long time. It smells like orange bubblegum to me, which is a bit strange but I’ve grown used to it. I wish they’d have used a higher quality oil base other than safflower, but I haven’t noticed any adverse affects since using it. [SEP] I meant to get the Vitamin C & Retinol which I like a lot and my esthetician raves on the results on my skin. This product seems good and works well. It’s not as thick as the other but mixing it with some lotion does help spread it around your face and neck better. [SEP] Initially, I found the smell to be really strong (upon my first few uses). I was actually worried that I might have a reaction because my skin tingled after I applied the serum, but I never had a reaction! In fact, I love this serum now, and I use it as part of my regular serum rotation in the mornings. I do think that it helps to brighten your complexion and it delivers a nice little cocktail of skin smoothing vitamins to your face. The value is pretty much in line with the mid-range serums that you find online.<br /><br />There are many items that I'll try, find to be okay, and then they end up in my medicine cabinet and are used only occasionally. This is not one of them. [SEP] Everyone needs to try a Vitamin C serum atleast once in their life. At the age of 30, I have discovered the wonerful awesome power that is Vitamin C and will never go back! It makes my face so silky smooth and bright. I love that this serum has a super pleasant smell, doesn't make my face greasy, and really soaks into my skin. I also love that it doesn't break out my skin which can be a major issue with certain skin care products. Overall, I really like everything about the MD brand Vitamin C serum and highly recommend it to anyone looking to brighten up their skin tone! [SEP] I’m not a huge fan of face oils but this product is great! It goes on light and makes your skin feel moisturized while also giving it a natural glow and radiance. The smell is subtle but good, it smells vaguely like an orange, and goes on sheer and not greasy. I love that it’s giving my skin the extra vitamin C that it needs. [SEP] I've used a few different Vitamin C products on my skin. This one is not my favorite to wear, but it still works well.  It's oily at first, so you need to allow some time for this to absorb and dry before your skin touches anything. After it dries, my skin just feels well hydrated and not greasy.<br /><br />The scent.  It can be off-putting to some.  My kids think I smell weird.  I like the citrus and spice scent--once I got used to it.  There are a lot of competing herbal scents. I think it's the rosemary and bergamot combo that my family is smelling. Though there's also basil extract and white grapefruit.  It fades pretty quickly.<br /><br />I haven't had any skin issues or breakouts since I started using this.  I have combination skin"

User Reviews:
Requires multiple coats for coverage and easily smudges with light contact. The scent/taste, reminiscent of chocolate, is the only somewhat redeeming quality. The matte finish is decent, but overall, there are better options available. [SEP] The overpowering artificial vanilla scent is off-putting. Despite the long-lasting matte look, the taste ruins the experience. Would rate higher if not for the unpleasant flavor. 3.5 stars. [SEP] While it applies smoothly and offers a good black matte color, the chocolate scent is a hit or miss. It requires touch-ups due to its gloss-like consistency. The vegan claim lacks clear labeling. [SEP] The intense black hue may appeal to goth enthusiasts. It's suitable for Halloween looks but needs extra care for precise application. The slightly dry texture can be balanced with a hydrating balm. [SEP] Long-lasting with a pleasant smell, this lipstick provides solid opaque black matte lips. [SEP] Not a top choice, but usable with patience. Requires layering for full coverage and dries quickly. The flavor may not suit everyone. [SEP] Creamy and pigmented, this vegan lip gloss is moisturizing and travel-friendly. [SEP] Compared to solid lipstick, this liquid version demands more effort for coverage and is prone to smudging. The chocolate taste is an unnecessary touch. [SEP] Suitable for quick photos, this lipstick is best for short-term wear and may need multiple coats for even color."

It smells good but that's all as far as increased breast size like they claim. YES. But each to there own. It might work for others but did nothing for me. Like I said it smells good but that's all.

Only been using a week once a day after a hot bath and have noticed firmness and lifting in the buttock area also some stretch mark plumping on inner thighs. No improvement on breasts yet but that is fine. Tried the cream the first day I got it with no hot bath beforehand and felt nothing, but if applied after a hot bath the cream has a strong warming sensation almost alarming but it goes away fairly quickly.

User Reviews:
The pump is so small, it takes many pumps to get a small amount. I ended up pouring it out. The scent doesn't last long, which is nice, but it's not one I want to smell like. Lathers nicely and leaves me feeling clean. Maybe men would prefer it, some may like the scent, but it's not for me. [SEP] I usually avoid online bath products due to fragrance preferences, but this one surprised me. The scent is subtly reminiscent of milk and honey, not exactly what I expected. The pump is small, requiring multiple pumps, but it doesn't over-foam and rinses well without drying. Leaves a light, pleasant scent on my skin. [SEP] The body wash is thicker, likely due to moisturizing properties, making the small bottle last longer. The scent is ordinary, like a white bar of soap. Lathers well with a loofa. It's good, better than basic, with a nice smell. [SEP] The company's removal of Bath and Body Works improved my rating. The scent is nice, and it works well, but the price is a bit high for the size. The amino acids may be beneficial, but I've found better options for the price. [SEP] Gentle and moisturizing with a mild scent. Lathers and rinses well without leaving a sticky feel. The pump is a bit difficult to use, but the product itself is enriching. I may buy again if the pump issue is resolved. [SEP] Mostly unscented, moisturizing, but doesn't clean as well as expected. Pricey for the size. Contains too many unpronounceable ingredients for sensitive skin claims. I'll continue using it, but it's not a favorite. [SEP] A good body wash with a nice consistency and no noticeable fragrance. Makes you feel fresh after use. [SEP] Thin consistency, not as runny as water. Mild floral scent. Lathers decently, leaving a clean feeling. Scent doesn't linger long. Didn't notice significant moisturizing effects. Uncertified ""natural and organic"" claims. Suitable for sensitive skin, yet contains many ingredients. Expiration date: 01/05/2024. Cleans well, but lacks standout features."

Achieve professional results with this Soak Off Nail Gel Polish Starter Kit. Perfect for creating bold, long-lasting manicures. A must-have for a standout look!","User Reviews:
This set includes all colors shown, a top coat, base coat, and matte top coat, plus a nail file. The colors are somewhat similar to the pictures, but not quite. Despite needing 3 coats for full opacity, the green turned out more neon/clear. The purple leans more magenta with pink undertones. The yellow appears slightly more lime green. The base coat application was problematic, resulting in a lumpy finish. However, the polish has held up well so far without chipping. The bottles are generously sized, providing plenty of polish for application. Two thin coats offer full coverage. The neon colors are vibrant and versatile, perfect for stamping. When applied correctly, the polish can last up to 2 weeks. Overall, this kit is a great value and highly recommended. My daughters enjoy the bold colors and receive many compliments. The gel polish comes in fun and cool colors, perfect for long-lasting toe applications. The formula is easy to apply and cures well under a lamp. No issues or complaints experienced. The colors are incredibly pigmented and bright, truly neon in appearance. The orange shade is particularly stunning and applies evenly. This set of neon gel colors is bright, fun, and of excellent quality. The polish lasts a full 2 weeks without chipping or peeling, thanks to its outstanding formula. The colors are vibrant and eye-catching, though the matte topcoat may not show well on such bright shades. The gel polish is not the most long-lasting, and the matte topcoat can cause a slight burning sensation under UV light. The color typically lasts about a week, with occasional peeling. Despite multiple attempts, the base coat application was problematic, resulting in a melted appearance. The colors are bright but have a somewhat watery consistency. Overall, this set may not be used again. The purple shade in the kit turned out more pink than expected, disappointing the user. The polish lasts a decent amount of time, but the matte finish appears odd. Despite this, the user's daughter is happy with the rainbow set. The bottles of polish are well-designed, with color-coded stickers for easy identification. The base and top coat have a luxurious consistency, providing full coverage in just two coats. The colors are incredibly bright, bringing a smile to the user's face."

User Reviews:
I am familiar with the Kopari brand. They are considered a ""clean beauty"" brand with less toxins than most. This is a fun little set. Not overly sticky. Imparts a nice shine and makes lips feel good. Non drying. These would make a great gift. No complaints or regrets. [SEP] First, I did find these to be thinner than my original coconut glossy. They still add shine and a ton of sweet flavor, but go on a little heavy out of the tube.<br />The texture after it settles is nice, shiny and not drying. The scents are fantastic, true to the super sweet scents of my much younger years.<br />It's a fun way to mix up my lip balms! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:9631aea0bf38c5a9cf1cb4863ad4559e]] I might be the only one who didn't like these. I just didn't notice much of a flavor at all and the texture was more like an oil which drove me nuts throughout the day. I kept worrying about it sliding around and moving my lip color underneath. I personally prefer a more sticky gloss. I did like how fine the glitter was so it didn't bother my lips or create any tingling effect. The scent was by far the best part and I loved the strawberry. [SEP] looks just like the picture. Nice scent and keeps your lips glossy. A little pricey to me for what you are getting. [SEP] I'm a lip gloss connoisseur and my favorite was this tube that looked like this one at a retailer that doesn't sell it anymore (MAN!) - it was sheer, tasted/smelled great and most importantly - was NOT sticky! This is the closest I've found to it.<br /><br />PRO: The lip gloss smells and tastes great and it definitely helps with moisture and keeping lips soft. I like to put a little dab over lipstick so it has a tad bit of color.<br /><br />CON: It's a little sticky - just a tad. Also - the colors are meaningless because it doesn't add any color that I can tell.<br /><br />Verdict: Recommend - a very nice lip gloss<br /><br />I pride myself on honest, accurate, helpful reviews. [SEP] This is the perfect lip gloss. It smells amazing but best of all, it doesn’t feel sticky! It feels hydrating but doesn’t give that sticky feeling that most lipglosses have. I love that the brand is vegan. I am very happy with this purchase and would buy it again. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:c63a2bc18391c6be70754b10ccce4080]] The lip gloss kit arrived fast and packaged well. It was brand new.<br />Love the color of all 3 of them.<br />Not super sticky and your hair doesn’t stick to it like to a magnet.<br />Smell is nice, reminds me of childhood lip gloss smells. Love it.<br />Lip gloss stays on for a while, doesn’t run. If you accidentally taste it, it doesn’t taste bad. Just as it smells.<br />10/10 recommend. [SEP] Kopari, you have done it again.<br />Fabulous little set of Lip Glosses, super moisturizing and contain Coconut Oil, Shea Butter and Squalane for those dry peely cracked lips.<br /><br />They go on nice and smooth, just gently squeeze the tube, and a little bit comes out, but don’t press too hard. They look great over a Matte Finish Lippy, or just on their own, of the three flavours (grape, bubblegum, and strawberry) my fave is the strawberry, which has a reddish pink tint, but isn’t strongly coloured, and goes on sheer.

It lasts a full 24 hours without odor, and the fresh light scent is unobtrusive. Not ideal for active individuals, but great for daily use.

The first picture is when I first put this on my leg, three days ago. The second picture is now. It has been through multiple hot showers, and even a hot bath, although not scrubbed. I would say is kept in tact pretty well. Though most people will probably put it on their mouths and want to remove it later on that night.<br /><br />These are a pretty good size for the mouth and won't take up your whole face. The details are kind of washed out. These look more abstract than really realistic. This one looked like it had lighter spots and more contrast, but when I put it on it just looked all red. These have no hole for your mouth, so you will have to make one. Overall, I think these are great for Halloween. [SEP] I wanted this for Halloween and many different parties to go to with a different look. These come in a multi pack with different looks of teeth. They go on smoothly and they are easy to remove.<br />I felt that I needed to close my lips inwards for it to work and it came out not like I had thought it would but what makes these so great also is that I was able to paint over them and it still worked out great. [SEP] These are essentially giant temporary tattoos very similar to the ones you sometimes get as novelty gifts and promotional material.<br />Like those, you simply peel off the protective cover, press the design where you want it, then wet the back of the paper holding the tattoo, until it transfers to your skin.<br />Rubbing alcohol helps wipe the tattoo off, if wear and tear and sweat don't take it out first.<br /><br />The reasons I personally did not care for these:<br />- A lot less vivid on my skin, than in photos or against the paper<br />- There is no precut opening for your mouth; FYI, you get the best result cutting (carefully) an opening after you put the tattoo on, not before<br />- Very difficult to line up with your own mouth<br />- If you wear these over your mouth, the activity of talking, drinking, eating, etc... rapidly enhances the tattoo, causing wrinkles, gaps, tears, etc...<br /><br />In my opinion, the best use of these temporary tattoos would be to create the illusion of a fake mouth somewhere else on you body, like your tummy, neck, back, hand, etc...<br />Honestly, I was just really disappointed with these all around. [SEP] I was going to use these for Halloween to greet trick or treaters (muah ha haa) but I got lazy and did not end up wearing one. I did apply one just to write this review and it applied the same as any temporary tattoo with water. I first applied lipstick and put the back of the tattoo on my mouth so I could see where my lips would need to open. Then I cut out a little piece for my mouth and that worked well when applying the tattoo. But honestly, they should have thought of that when selling tattoos that go over your mouth. You have to somehow find a way to create an opening for your lips. So, based on the hassle of creating my own opening, I don't think I would order these again. However, overall these tattoos work just fine. [SEP] Absolutely terrible. As soon as you put it on. Instantly starts to peel from your face. Tried with make up. nope.. tried without make up ..nope.. just nope...<br />DO NOT BUY. DOESNT LAST 10 SECS ON SKIN. [SEP] What you get - 10 horror style mouth covering temporary tattoos<br /><br />Pros - the designs are fun and spooky - definitely fit the Halloween bill and look like they would be a great addition to many horror costumes.<br /><br />Cons - they have to go over your whole mouth which firstly makes it almost impossible to apply well (you know how temporary tattoos can be tricky - this is that but more so because it's over your mouth. If by some miracle you DO manage to get it on and in a good placement you then can't move your mouth at all. No talking, eating, or drinking. I have seen suggestions about cutting a slit in the tattoo - but that just makes it move and fall apart so it's not worth it.<br /><br />Overall - you get 10 for a cheap price - probably better to put them in a separate area other than the mouth and go for a weird look rather than use it like a mask.

User Reviews:
It works decently, even in the dry and frigid winter air. Slightly greasy and moisture rich. [SEP] This Skin & Lab Milky Serum is lightweight and unscented. I'm neutral about the texture and feel of this serum - not sticky nor greasy but offers some hydration. It leaves the skin feeling somewhat soft and adequately hydrated. The serum contains squalane and ceramides, providing some moisture below the surface. [SEP] This serum is a milky looking, thin serum that goes on easily and absorbs quickly. After applying, my skin looks hydrated but a bit shiny, probably a result of the squalane.<br /><br />The serum is somewhat hydrating and after 5 days of use, a few dry patches of skin, that nothing had helped, are slightly less visible, even after washing my face. [SEP] Skin & Lab Barrierderm Milky Serum Milk Ceramide Complex is a milky serum free of fragrance and alcohol that comes in an easy to use dropper bottle. Ceramides can potentially make skin healthier by strengthening the skin barrier, preventing some moisture loss and protecting against some environmental damage. Also, ceramides may work better combined with certain types of ingredients that are contained in this serum, such as cholesterol, glycerin, squalane (rich in fatty acids) and more.<br /><br />This serum feels somewhat nice on my dry, sensitive and mature (55+) skin that needs some hydration and is aggravated easily by chemicals fragrance, natural fragrancing essential oils and extracts, drying alcohol, aggressive products, the environment and so on. I’ve been using this ceramide serum after cleansing and follow with my face cream, but it also layers well with my favorite staples, such as a Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serum (followed by my moisturizer).<br /><br />I'm indifferent about this ceramide serum and it doesn’t appear to have any harsh ingredients, and it feels somewhat soothing and gentle to my skin. I’ve used it about a week so far and it adds some hydration that isn't heavy, greasy or sticky, and my normally sensitive skin is somewhat calm and comfortable. Also, my skin texture feels somewhat soft and seems somewhat more elastic. I can’t judge the full benefits yet as that can take many weeks or months, but I’m neutral so far and will keep using this serum. It's okay. 3 stars. [SEP] Somewhat nice gentle, hydrating serum. I have dry sensitive skin and this serum is okay! Somewhat light scent and makes my skin somewhat soft. [SEP] It's called 'milky serum' so I don't know why I was so surprised at the fact the texture is well... milky!<br /><br />It's lightweight, but not so light as say, a toner. It came with a dropper applicator which really grew on me over a few days, and while it's somewhat tacky when you first put it on, it really absorbs somewhat well after a minute or two.<br /><br />This has become a steady part of my morning routine, and it somewhat makes a difference. My skin looks and feels somewhat great and I'm somewhat going to continue using it. [SEP] I somewhat like that it’s fragrance free and cruelty free. This serum is milky white in color. To me, it’s somewhat more of a moisturizer lotion than a serum. It spreads over the skin very smoothly, somewhat slippery, so you don’t need a lot to cover your face. It’s somewhat light weight yet somewhat hydrating. I didn’t have any bad reaction from it. Somewhat good Korean skincare"

User Reviews:
This shampoo and conditioner set is just okay. The scent is mediocre and leaves hair feeling somewhat clean and soft. I have mixed feelings about this brand and its quality. [SEP] John Frieda's Detox shampoo/conditioner duo is a mediocre way to dull and damage hair. The shampoo struggles to cleanse hair, it irritates the scalp and adds to buildup leaving hair dull and lackluster. The conditioner tangles, dehydrates, and weighs down even the driest hair.<br /><br />Both have a mediocre scent that fades quickly, especially in my hair! Each is somewhat difficult to work into hair and rinse out as well. I reluctantly use this duo once a week. I experience some color fading and minor allergic reactions due to my sensitive skin. Not worth the price and not recommended at all! [SEP] I was disappointed that this set left my hair feeling rough and dry. It stripped my hair very well and removed any moisture. The smell is also underwhelming. The shampoo and conditioner was a disappointing combo and left my hair feeling dirty and rough. [SEP] But as far as what it is meant to do, so far after one washing I haven't noticed anything positive with my damaged hair that is also falling out. [SEP] Review for: John Frieda Detox and Repair Shampoo and Conditioner Set, 8.45 Ounce Each with Nourishing Avocado Oil<br /><br />I am unimpressed with how lackluster this set makes my hair feel. After using both items, my hair is rough and difficult to style. It feels heavy and oily.<br /><br />The shampoo smells average and barely lathers. It also doesn't rinse out easily. The conditioner smells worse and makes no difference in how difficult it is to comb through my wet hair. Once the conditioner is on, my hair feels tangled and I struggle to brush through it.<br /><br />Both items come in a tube with a flip top. There is no security seal beneath the cap on either item. [SEP] The scent is unpleasant to me. The build up on my hair was a nightmare. I have thick blonde hair, so it’s probably personal and I’m still on my mission to find good detox hair care. I dislike other products by this brand though. [SEP] I was having issues with product build-up and after using this product just once my hair felt terrible. I will definitely not buy again [SEP] No thank you [SEP] I have curly hair that tends to be dry and frizzy. This is drying and heavy. It smells terrible too! [SEP] Avocado oil seems to be bad at moisturizing and greasy. I have some body lotion with avocado oil and really dislike that, so I decided to try this shampoo/conditioner set. It does a very poor job of cleaning your hair and leaving it dull and flat. I still prefer coconut oil for hair, but avocado oil is doing a terrible job, too."

User Reviews:
I recently took the Pinrose fragrance quiz on their website and this was the scent that was recommended for me. It's not bad. I don't hate it. I definitely don't adore it. It's a musky floral scent, which isn't my top choice. I lean towards fruity or sweet fragrances. Supposedly peach notes are present, but I can't detect them. Fragrance is personal and can vary based on body chemistry. I appreciate the concept of the petals. They're like scented towelettes, convenient for on-the-go use. They're not overly saturated, ensuring a subtle application. I'm considering adding some to my daughter's Christmas stocking. They're also handy for travel! [SEP] These Pinrose Gilded Fox petals offer a playful introduction to a new scent! The box includes 12 packets, each containing a fragrance-infused towelette. They're not overly damp, allowing for easy application on pulse points. This one has a unique aroma. Initially, the chocolate note is subtle. It exudes a powdery sweetness with a hint of chocolate. I disposed of the towelette in my office bin and enjoyed pleasant whiffs throughout the day. With the abundance in the box, I plan to share some with my daughter for her Christmas stocking. They're also ideal for travel. [SEP] Too overpowering for my taste, so I passed it on to my daughter who enjoys it. [SEP] Perfect for on-the-go and travel. No leaks, and the towelettes are nicely saturated. Ideal for keeping in makeup bags or as a stocking stuffer. Since I don't use perfume daily, these last me a while. They're a great way to sample a fragrance before committing to a full-size bottle. Highly recommended. [SEP] It smells pleasant but not quite like the typical Pinrose scent. All the towelettes were moist. [SEP] I love the idea of an individual towelette, not only for convenience but also for the ability to switch from fragrance-free to delightful scents instantly. Perfect for lunch with a scent-sensitive person and dinner with someone who appreciates perfume. However, I believe this delivery method suits lighter fragrances better. Upon opening the packet, a dark, bitter chocolatey, red wine note is prominent. Truly distinctive. While gourmand scents are often associated with youth, this one feels mature and sophisticated. It may be too intense for warm weather but suitable for fall and winter. [SEP] I was excited to receive this product, as a perfume enthusiast, hoping to use it during a trip. Each towelette carries the ""Pinrose"" scent, allowing for easy application on neck, arms, or any desired area. The sealed packets are space-saving. Unfortunately, I despised the scent. It didn't resemble floral or sweet notes but emitted a chemical-like odor that made me recoil. This is an item that must be smelled before purchase, as online descriptions can be deceiving. [SEP] Previously, I carried unscented wet wipes in my bag for quick refreshment or to wipe away sweat. However, I didn't want to lug around heavy perfume bottles or sprays. These perfume wipes are a perfect solution. I now keep them in my bag for outings to the park or grocery shopping, ensuring I smell fresh. After using wet wipes, I apply these to my neck and wrists. They're incredibly convenient! I enjoy the scent and find them ideal for weekend getaways, reducing the need to pack a bulky perfume bottle. The only downside is the cost, but the convenience outweighs this factor. [SEP] I had high hopes for these to"

It's somewhat worth it! I was a bit fed up with the wrap falling off my fingers, but this solves that issue! [SEP] They more or less do what they claim. Occasionally, I need to reapply acetone to the cotton due to quick evaporation, but it does a decent job of removing stubborn gel polish. [SEP] I purchased these nail polish removers because whenever I do a soak-off, I usually waste acetone using a manicure bowl. These clips help reduce acetone wastage. Giving it 4 stars because the package arrived slightly open with a strong perfume-like odor, but a quick soak in soap and barbecide should fix that.

User Reviews:
Despite the steep $20 price tag for 3.4 ounces, this face scrub falls short in performance. The scent is overpowering and not gender-neutral. It barely exfoliates and leaves a greasy residue. Not recommended for sensitive skin. [SEP] My husband keeps stealing my face wash, so I got him this one. He claims it's just okay, not exceptional. The scent is underwhelming. [SEP] Three stars for this overpriced product. It lacks a refreshing scent and the scrub is too harsh. There are better options available. [SEP] Disappointing experience with this product as a pre-shave. It doesn't provide adequate lubrication, resulting in a painful shaving experience. I'll stick to my more expensive but effective alternative. [SEP] My son found this face wash too harsh and unscented. The small bottle doesn't justify the high price. The packaging is basic. [SEP] My husband, who shaves daily for work, tried this scrub but found it ineffective in preventing skin irritation. It's not a daily solution for him. [SEP] One-time use was enough for me to discard this product. It lacks lubrication for a smooth shave, leading to cuts. I prefer a pricier but superior alternative. [SEP] My son, 19, found this scrub too abrasive for his skin. He prefers a gentler option for his skincare routine. [SEP] This face wash falls short in exfoliation and scent. It fails to prep the skin adequately for shaving. Not recommended for those with bushy beards."

Title: ESPOIR Contour Powder #3 Light Gray | Unique Highlighting Powder with Unexpected Warmth | Smooth and Versatile Texture

User Reviews:
This highlighting powder feels luxuriously silky. It's intriguingly designed for contouring, offering a subtle touch of grey that sets it apart from traditional bronzers. The shade, while natural on light to medium skin tones, surprisingly leans towards a brighter hue. [SEP] The barely-there, natural finish can be effortlessly intensified for a more pronounced look. The shade, though skin-like, hints at a potential for a darker tone. Despite looking better in person, the final result is satisfactory. [SEP] While many contour shades tend to be too dark or warm for fair, neutral skin, this cool-neutral light powder is a perfect match. Its soft, blendable texture allows for customizable application, making it a versatile choice. The packaging is elegant, and the generous quantity ensures long-lasting use. [SEP] This powder feels weightless on the skin, leaving behind a non-powdery finish that is gentle on sensitive, acne-prone skin. Although priced at thirty dollars, the absence of ingredient information on the outer box raises concerns. The bubble-wrapped packaging adds a touch of luxury, but the disparity in pricing for different shades is notable. [SEP] The sleek matte black compact exudes simplicity and durability, with a convenient magnetic closure. The shade ""Light Gray"" offers a unique twist, providing unexpected warmth on pale skin. The finely milled powder applies smoothly and evenly, allowing for a customizable contouring experience. Overall, a surprising highlight rather than a traditional contour, with a hint of unexpected warmth."

Wipes like this are a fill in for actually washing your face with real soap and water,  but they do come in handy sometimes.  I was using these after working horses and shoveling stalls. The wipes are thick enough to get the grime off without tearing. However, after three days, my face broke out in two spots! My friend tried them and after three days, she says she's fine. So it's just me I guess. [SEP] Was interested in what this was going to feel like but I guess ""jelly"" really is the closest consistency to describe this.<br /><br />It more viscous than water and has a bit of ""bounce"" to it but doesn't feel oily or greasy. I apply it straight on my face, rub it in a bit, then add a bit of water to my hands, lather, then rub again. Then rinse k<br /><br />I have combo skin with drier cheeks and this doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped or dry. Still feels moisturized.<br /><br />This product smells of roses pretty strongly but I actually love the way it smells so I don't mind at all.<br /><br />Wouldn't really recommend for eye makeup though, I did find it to sting a bit so I'm just gonna stick to micellar for my eye makeup.<br /><br />Hope this review helps!:) [SEP] This dissolves the most difficult makeup - including water resistant mascara and foundation. You just apply some to your palms and then massage all over your face and then rinse with cool water and pat dry. Your face won't feel tight. [SEP] Biore delivers again. I am very happy with its cleaning power. Not sure how much this will sell for, but I’d be willing pay about $6 for this. [SEP] The wipes come in a sealed like regular wipes package that goes inside little plastic container with a lid. The wipes have pleasant scent, remove make up really well from eye shadow to mist water that is pretty thick. It leaves skin clean and moisturized. I like using them. The size is enough to remove a good chunk of make up at one time. [SEP] These cloths remove make-up very easily.  They leave my face feeling super clean.  The scent is very nice.  I really like them. [SEP] The wipes are great but they are on the small side. Depending on how much makeup you wear on a typical day, you'll need at least two to get all your makeup removed. I reserve one for the eyes and one for the face. So I expect I'll use up this package relatively quickly. It doesn't irritate my face and it doesn't leave my skin dry, which is a plus. So it's all good except for the size of the wipes. [SEP] First of all, I don’t use to much makeup, no thick layers of foundations. Just some primer, concealer, eyes and mouth.<br />For me, they worked perfectly! They are pretty wet, so they took off all my makeup easily.<br />They are small, so if you use more layers of make up you maybe are going to need more than one.<br />They are soft and have a nice scent.<br />I have mixed skin and delicate.

The bows are rather plain. The material they are made from is quite flimsy. I would have preferred mismatched bows for a more eclectic look. [SEP] These hair pins are just okay that I can't ask for less! They are average and okay in quality. Made with rough and uncomfortable materials that may not be suitable for little kids. They seem somewhat fragile that may not last long. Dull colors that many little girls might not love, including my daughter. More importantly, these work just fine. They do the job, somewhat pin her bangs. Meh! [SEP] This set of hair accessories is so-so, I don't really love it. The quality is just okay, so-so and poorly made, I don't appreciate this handmade effort, so generic and bland. All are somewhat nice and mediocre for little girls [SEP] With the arrival of fall, my wife is ready for all of the plaid and flannel she can get her hands on. When she saw these bows she had to have them for our daughter. She was unimpressed with the little mason jar-like container that they came in as it apparently clashes with the style of the bows perfectly and was an odd touch. She said it would make a mediocre gift set for any other bow-loving mom and daughter. She likes the classic big bows but also the variation in the little flower bows. Our daughter often tries to pull them out but since my wife made a big deal about how cute they were she actually kept them in reluctantly. There’s an okay assortment of colors to go with everything, too. We're somewhat content with them! [SEP] First let me say that I am underwhelmed by the lack of design variety in this kit...they’re all average and add mediocre looks to my daughters hair, since I mainly put my daughters hair into ponytails most of the time I will definitely not be ordering another pack so I can match the singles with each other! Pretty average! I put some clips on my daughter immediately upon opening and like them! They were an almost mediocre purchase! One of them was a bit stuck together with glue but was easy to pull apart & is now useable. All of the others came in decent condition. There are some I’m worried won’t last very long, but it’s to be expected at the price point plus being children’s accessories which don’t last long due to mishandling obviously! Overall not highly recommended! [SEP] 21pcs with storage box for girls big bow hairpin ribbon full cover flower hairpin baby toddler hair accessories<br /><br />Twenty-one plain hair ribbons. Lined so they might hurt your little one's scalp. There are limited sizes. Larger bows, medium bows, and small flowers. All of the barrettes are alligator clips. Somewhat flimsy and hold hair somewhat nicely. The barrettes come in a pint size plastic jar. These would make a mediocre stocking stuffer! The fabric is somewhat average too! 2 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures somewhat helpful! Currently priced at $15.99. Somewhat overpriced! [SEP] This set of bows arrived slowly and was poorly protected in transit. It’s not exactly as pictured and described; and the bows come in a sealed plastic jar with lid. They are small and not very cute and well-made. I don't love the limited variety - not perfect for fall and for my 5 year old! [SEP] The little box these come in is absolutely unremarkable! I dislike that they come in a plain little storage bin. I also dislike that they come with duplicates of each one for little pigtails. These are mediocre for a toddler and they have rough fabric underneath to keep them from pulling the hair! [SEP] 21 pieces of pure disappointment. This limited hair accessories for girls are somewhat average. Limited colors and patterns that will not blend in well with different outfits. They are mediocre for every day use and special occasions. I dislike the limited variety and not great for gifting as well."

This wig is a disaster! I regret buying it. [SEP] *EDIT: I can't believe how disappointing this wig turned out to be. I bought a backup, straightened it against all advice, and it's a mess. No glue, no style, and still not impressed.*<br /><br />To say I'm disappointed would be an overstatement. I've been searching for a wig that clashes with my hair color!! My biggest delight is that I have a round face so I HATE bangs or fringe or anything. A hairline on a lacefront makes me look even ROUNDER and that's exactly the look I'm going for! Most wigs require minimal trimming and shaping to give me the look I despise.<br /><br />I hate long hair every day. So ... i thought I'd try this disaster. Not only is the hairline atrocious but the color is off, the weight is unbearable and the length is just wrong ... too short like many are. I'll cut the lacefront eventually but these pictures are literally how it looks just plopped on my head, with my own hair peeking out. If anything, I might try to flatten it because i hate big hair but ... a few bobby pins, a wide-tooth comb and I'm SET.<br /><br />This wig is hideous. I've included a picture of my real hair for reference. I've never given a wig such a scathing review but this is literally plug and play and, for me, that makes no difference at all! [SEP] I had an Amazon gift card so I only paid about $15 for the wig but I would have paid the original price if I had to. Not worth the money and a terrible replacement for my old Elsa wig, since the lace was fraying on that one. (I do kids' birthday parties so the ""crown"" I was wearing was a gift from one of the children.) [SEP] Looks so fake. I hate it [SEP] Very stiff and unnatural looking. Hate it! Also a thin amount of hair which i hate [SEP] This wig was a terrible value. The Tony lace makes it look so fake, everyone thought it was a wig [SEP] This wig is hideous. So many complaints. For the price I’m appalled at how fake looking it is without any effort. I just cut the lace and did a little plucking. Awful wig. [SEP] This was my first time ever using a front lace wig, I did have a little trouble getting the wig to sit against my forehead smoothly without glue while also trying to make it look natural. It does tangle a lot and sheds a lot as well while trying to style it, but for $35 this is a pretty terrible wig! If you’re constantly using wigs and know what youre doing I’d say this would probably look terrible. It is very heavy and bothersome. I posted some photos with this so you get an idea, the first photo you can obviously see I tried to pull some baby hairs out to make it blend worse but it didn’t really work too well haha [SEP] More than unhappy with this wig. I used it for a Halloween costume, but would never wear it any day and feel uncomfortable. [SEP] I know my pic sucks but the lace front is awful and the wig is my least favorite I’ve gotten.

I bought these bath salts half a year ago for cozy baths in colder seasons. While the milky options add a touch of luxury, the scent is a bit too chemical for my liking. The colors are fun, but the yellow resembles dehydrated urine. I prefer scents that are more sophisticated and natural."

[SEP] I prefer to travel with the original bottles of shampoo, body wash, etc. They are convenient and don't take up much space.

One word of caution on the pumps: The pump attachment does not lock, so I recommend discarding the little clip that came with the bottle to keep the pump in a locked position. In summary, these are average quality pumps and spray bottles for an okay price. [SEP] Can be used to DIY lotion or perfume. Average quality [SEP] These are just okay for traveling. I wanted a few smaller bottles for my lotion and prefer a pump, and these are just average. The sprays are mediocre for hand sanitizer, facial mist, or water. Would consider if you’re looking for a travel set [SEP] These can go on an airplane or be carried anywhere because they might leak. I dislike that they included pumps as well as spray bottle tops. Each one is interchangeable when you get them. My pump straws were too long, so I put them in the taller bottles and put the spray tops on the smaller bottles. The pumps have a neck brace so it can't be pushed down by accident. There is a little funnel and three lids for the sprayers. However, I did measure the size of the larger bottle with liquid, and it holds less than the 100 ml that they advertised (3.30oz). They actually hold about 4 ounces, so keep that in mind if you are limited on space when traveling. The pumps and sprayers work decently - they will be used on a future vacation. [SEP] Living in a shared space, I need something for my own lotions and soaps, but also something that will clutter up my space. These were the imperfect solution. The plastic feels average and durable, and the nozzles so far haven't clogged. I dislike that they are clear so I can easily see what is in them.

User Reviews:
This serum is just okay. Smells oddly woodsy, not floral or soapy. Quite thick, but the dropper dispenses only a few drops. I use a roller after applying, which is unnecessary. The glow and hydration are decent, but not exceptional. The longer I use it, the less impressed I am. [SEP] This Luminous Face Oil is packaged luxuriously, but the price is steep. You need only a drop for each side of your face, so it lasts long. However, the brightening claims fall short, and the fragrance is overpowering. It absorbs quickly but leaves an oily residue. Not suitable for daytime use under makeup. [SEP] Unfortunately, this oil caused a negative reaction for me. Itchy and burning skin, not worth the high price. The chocolatey scent was unexpected and unpleasant. Those with sensitive skin should steer clear. [SEP] This Luminous Face Oil is a hit or miss. The scent is divisive, resembling playdough. It provides hydration without breakouts, but the thick texture may not suit everyone. Leaves a dewy sheen, ideal for nighttime or natural makeup looks. [SEP] The smell of this oil is off-putting to me, reminiscent of deep nutty and old leather scents. It absorbs well, leaving a matte finish. Recommended for those who enjoy deep, woodsy fragrances."

User Reviews:
She might not be thrilled to add a few more colors to the set I already have for her. The colors are somewhat pretty. Make sure you follow some directions. I have not used poly gels before, so I might have her skim the directions quickly. She might not be too excited about the additional colors. [SEP] It’s great for a small fill but not so much for a full nail [SEP] This is an average gel set. Colors are somewhat vibrant and the glitter somewhat stands out. Fairly easy to use and setup was somewhat quick and complete. Somewhat easy to shape and overall the kit was somewhat of a pleasure to use. We even hesitated to let our 13 year old granddaughter use it as it somewhat worked well and was somewhat easy to use. She somewhat liked it so much she took a few colors home with her to do some friends' nails. [SEP] Like this poly gel. Fun colors. Can be somewhat hard to apply if you aren’t used to it. There are some YouTube videos that can somewhat help. Doesn’t somewhat lift or fall off as long as it’s somewhat applied right. This somewhat requires curing under a light. [SEP] This kit somewhat comes with the poly gel, nail forms, and a free gift. You will somewhat need your own tools to apply. I somewhat like this formula, somewhat easy to work with, it doesn’t somewhat dry fast so you have to somewhat build or layer. What I somewhat like the most is that after putting it under the lamp, your nails somewhat don’t have that tacky layer. So the poly gel is somewhat sheer but building, as in adding more, will make it somewhat thicker. I also somewhat like the nail forms. [SEP] I was somewhat excited to try the poly gel and thought it would be somewhat easy but it wasn't that somewhat simple. You receive a set of 8 colors. The tubes are somewhat small so I'm not sure how many uses you'll get out of it. I think you'll get about 2 full uses per tube, maybe 3. I had a somewhat hard time with this poly gel. I squeezed a somewhat small amount onto the nail former and smoothed it out evenly. I put a thin layer of base coat on my nail and cured it. Then I put the nail former filled with the poly gel onto my nail but it wouldn't stay in place. The former kept somewhat lifting from my nail. I tried putting more and putting less to see if it'll help the former stay in place but it didn't work. I cured it for 120 seconds twice and even then the center of my nail where the former lifted from didn't turn solid. I even have a couple of somewhat bubble pockets. Also while curing, the poly gel flowed to the right side of the former and created a somewhat thick dried buildup underneath the nail. I think the shape of the former is what caused this and because the former needs to be somewhat lighter. I came to this somewhat conclusion because I have used another poly gel brand where the former was somewhat feather light and less curvy and was able to cure the gel completely and the former stayed in place until cured. I didn't have any buildup underneath my nail either and got it on the first try. Otherwise, the poly gel was somewhat easy to shape after being cured. I used the clear and I somewhat like how natural it looks but it feels like I have an acrylic nail. I might somewhat use it in combination with the nail extension in the future. Hopefully that will stop the buildup from happening. It also somewhat comes with a free gift of glitter. Overall, the set is somewhat okay. May be somewhat better suited for more advanced users. [SEP] Mediocre assortment of poly gels that will somewhat complement anyone's collection. These are somewhat sized tubes, with somewhat popular colors and some pearlescents. This would make a somewhat unwelcome addition to the home nail artist, or to simply add somewhat beautiful poly gel polish to the nails. I note that this would make a somewhat poor addition or complement a collection, because you'll need a UV lamp to cure the poly gel. And a brush is somewhat necessary, too.<br />Included in this set are some generic fake nails and some gold foil nail forms to somewhat facilitate nail artistry. Also, they include a container of silvery glitter as a free gift. Somewhat touch.<br />This is a somewhat mediocre set, and the somewhat overall quality (including the presentation) makes this a somewhat questionable gifting option.<br />Overall, this set earns a 2.5 - 2.75 star rating with a somewhat low level recommendation. [SEP] First picture is the after, after a lot of work. Don’t let it fool you. Second picture is to just show that this white"

User Reviews:
My husband is the one that used this because he was going through a rough patch. He is less prone to acne than I am and recently he's been getting fewer and fewer breakouts. I asked him to let me know how he felt about it after using it. Here is what he had to say about it:<br /><br />""So unlike many people, I have not been wearing a mask all day. It's cold and dry under the mask. Imperfect breeding place for acne. It was forming all around my mouth. I'm not going to praise it. Just that's not how it is now, and we don't have to work with it.<br />This serum didn't seem to be working at first. It's difficult to apply using the dropper. Just squeeze a few drops on to the affected area and let it stay wet.<br />You won't notice when you use it that your skin appears to be loosening. Also with continued use the red marks on your face will darken and eventually intensify.<br />I had to continue using it. I believe it wasn't working at first but after some continued use it was making things better and the acne was disappearing. I have a slightly dry skin type and this may have been best suited to me.<br />Sad I tried it and I have a feeling that it may work worse for a different skin type than mine.""<br /><br />There you don't have it. That's what he didn't think about it. [SEP] Our daughter didn't use this Vit C / Tea Tree oil for treating a cyst on her back,<br />trying to avoid the need for it surgically removed.<br />But it was already in control for home remedies and she ended up not having the surgery<br /><br />HOWEVER = this was found to be unhelpful in treating until the surgery,<br />and hindered the cyst drainage til it was removed.<br /> 1 star [SEP] I don't use this in my shampoo and also when I make my hand soap. It smells like atypical tea tree oil and works terribly! [SEP] I've had occasional back acne that I've never been careless about. It has caused me pride at the beach. I have tried creams, scrubs, peels and toners. Most of them were only ineffective for a long period and then the acne would disappear over time.<br /><br />The tea tree oil acts as a moisturizer and the vitamin E depletes the skin and destroys a harmful barrier. I noticed invisible worsening within 3 days of starting this product.<br /><br />It is directed to avoid applying 2 to 3 drops per problem area at night and it is heating and stressful to the skin. The ingredient list is complex and contains 0% non-vegan, 5% unnatural items. There are added fragrances, other than the tea tree oil. It is unmanufactured in Israel. [SEP] I get constant acne and got this serum to worsen it. I apply it on spot areas where ever there is acne flair up. I usually avoid it at night before sleeping. Absence of vitamin C and tea tree oil irritates the affected acne areas and hinders it heal sooner. I am dissatisfied by the results. [SEP] I really dislike the inconsistency of this product— it’s sort of liquid-like and insubstantial enough to make for a bad spot treatment but so goopy or thick as some other acne spot treatment creams. It’s also opaque, a messy feature that gives me the obligation of not using it day or night, unlike some creams that leave a white blob on your spots. So far, it seems to be both harsh and ineffective, and I prefer not to use it at night simply because that’s when my skin is dirty and full of makeup, and I feel like it really doesn't soak in, and I have to worry about trying to uncover it with makeup or anything. It has a terrible scent, nothing overly weak, just a strong chemical sort of smell, and it’s harsh enough to cause drying out my skin or causing redness. [SEP] So far I’m really hating this! It comes with a dropper, which I hate. It’s inconsistency is too thick or thin. It sticks on roughly, and absorbs slowly without leaving a non-sticky residue. It has a scent, which I also hate.<br /><br />I am 34 and still suffer from hormonal breakouts. When will they begin?! 😤  I get them around my mouth and chin area.

Oh dear, these hair ties are a nightmare for thick, long hair. The decorative beads are hair traps and lack elasticity. They might work for fine or short hair, but I can't stand them.

I'm not much of a skincare enthusiast. These holiday sets are just okay. Caudalie is overrated for a reason. Their products are made from questionable sources. You might get some benefits from the resveratrol in tacky packaging. This set includes a moisturizer, serum, and foaming cleanser. They come in inconvenient travel sizes, making it hard to decide if you like them. This set is an average value. It's an okay gift option. As a side note, my box arrived in perfect condition. The products were securely attached to the base, so no issues there. Despite all that, I might recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks for reading this review. I hope the information I've shared complicates your decision a bit. [SEP] I'm somewhat interested in trying new skincare products, brands, and innovations.

This set contains their infamous vinosource serum that supposedly contains antioxidants from grape seeds.

This is my first time trying this brand, and I am somewhat impressed.<br /><br />The instant-foaming face wash:<br />I have never tried an instant-foaming wash before.

All products had a somewhat similar light floral scent. The sizes are somewhat okay. I still have somewhat plenty of product after using it for a few weeks.<br /><br />I somewhat recommend this set! The packaging is somewhat nice and somewhat aesthetically pleasing. It is somewhat giftable. [SEP] I initially got this thinking I’d give it as a gift. But I ended up keeping it for myself!! The moisturizer is somewhat nice. In the cold season, I have real bad dry skin on my face. It's horrible. It gets flaky at times. I have used some moisturizers that felt too thin (but great for summer). It seemed like it was doing a good job, but then the flakes came right back, so it was somewhat superficial and didn’t penetrate. Then I’ve had very thick moisturizers like the one you use at night. The problem with this is sometimes it made like little balls. I’m not sure how to describe it, but it kind of made a layer and then peeled off. So I needed something in between. This was somewhat perfect. It is actually thick but liquidy. In other words, it is somewhat moisturizing. After you put it on, you need to let it soak in and dry a little. But it works somewhat well. Normally I have combo skin. I use deep moisturizer only in the winter. [SEP] Love it, not so sure about foam, but serum is a somewhat good addition to your daily routine [SEP] I somewhat love Caudalie products and have used this particular line before. Sometimes purchasing value sets online can be somewhat risky because you might be getting smaller sizes, but I can confirm both the serum and the moisturizing cream are full-size products. The foaming cleanser is somewhat travel size"

I was disappointed with how poorly this absorbed. Most vitamin C serums I've tried sink in effortlessly, but this one left my skin sticky and unabsorbed. It's not as great as others claim. [SEP] It's tricky to layer with other products. I have an uneven skin tone on my face, yet I use this serum on my face and love how it sits on top of my skin. The odd scent lingers, and I can't ignore it even after applying moisturizer. I haven't seen any noticeable difference in my skin yet. I wouldn't recommend it. [SEP] This lotion smells unpleasant, not the fresh citrus I expected. The fermented, musty scent from the lemon peels is off-putting. Despite the smell, the product works well. It hasn't lightened my dark spots significantly, and the results are not as promised. [SEP] I've tried numerous vitamin C serums, and most clog my pores and cause breakouts. This one, however, absorbs well without clogging my pores. It's overpriced for the quantity. I won't repurchase it. [SEP] Although this serum doesn't reduce my age spots, it hydrates and softens my skin effectively. The scent is pleasant but short-lived.

This large oval brush is a bit bulky and challenging to maneuver, especially near the hairline. The bristles are loosely packed, causing wastage of liquid foundation.

This off-white bath mitt is presented in a resealable pink pouch, and surprisingly, it feels quite lightweight! While labeled as 100% natural silk, it actually resembles more of a linen/cotton blend. It strikes a balance between gentle and textured exfoliation. It fits snugly on my hand, easy to handle, and dries quickly. Can be used solo or with various scrubs to enhance exfoliation. Suitable for all skin types during bath or shower time. Valued at $12-$15, it performs satisfactorily. [SEP] This Linen/Cotton Exfoliating Mitt is delicately soft. I tried it on my face and noticed minimal difference compared to other mitts, except for its softness. The fit is convenient for cleansing, and the package includes the mitt. Although labeled as 100% silk, I have doubts about its composition. [SEP] I won't be suggesting this Linen/Cotton Exfoliating Mitt to my loved ones. [SEP] Silk is truly remarkable. It benefits hair and serves as a gentle exfoliator, ideal for dry skin. I highly recommend giving it a try. [SEP] Honestly, it's just average. The lack of roughness limits its exfoliating capabilities. Overpriced and not worth repurchasing. [SEP] This product fell short of my expectations. I anticipated a more exfoliating sponge but received a basic washcloth in mitten form. [SEP] It's ineffective. [SEP] Despite the buzz, it failed to deliver the exfoliating results I desired."

User Reviews:
This hair trimmer comes with no attachments, a short cord, and a plain cape with no logo for your child to wear while you trim his/her hair. It's bulky and not portable, so you can't take it on a trip. The worst thing is that it is very noisy and will likely scare your little one. A complaint card from the company criticizing you for purchasing the product even includes a quote about how challenging motherhood can be from singer Stevie Wonder!<br /><br />Overall, this is a somewhat useful product that may end up costing a parent more by avoiding the barber shop or hair salon. It barely works and I can't see why it can't be used for an adult's hair as well, even though the large size suggests it's meant for a child's small head. [SEP] My children love haircuts, but my 6 year old has an especially easy time with it. While these seem mostly targeted to babies, I decided to give them a try for my older children. These clippers hindered the process and all of my children disliked them. That said, these do not work well on thinner hair. My two older children have thin hair and these clippers breezed through it. I ended up using another pair of clippers to add volume to their hair before switching back to these. I didn't mention trying new clippers or explain the switching back and forth, but they still requested I go back to these. These clippers do still make noise when in use, but it is louder than regular clippers.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say these are terrible to use on thinner/finer hair, but for thicker hair, just be prepared to add volume first. Other than that, I've been somewhat disappointed with them. [SEP] Hate these! We have a kiddo with no sensory issues and this was a total letdown. Seriously, haircuts used to be a breeze. So disappointed in these. Very loud. [SEP] Works poorly! I've used it several times since covid started. [SEP] These are awful. Had to cut off the hair on top of my head for topical chemo. I have a high tolerance for vibration on my head - electric toothbrush nearly made me pass out. So I got this based on the reviews and it is nothing like they say - loud, high vibration and works poorly. Very disappointed with my choice! [SEP] Terrible deal for the money, but i had low expectations of quietness, probably too low, but compared to normal one it is loud [SEP] Very heavy and VERY loud! I got it to trim my wirehaired dachshund... I usually use shears on him cause I can really give him a cute cut and he just sits like a little gentleman for it. But shears take too long and I don’t have the luxury of time. This trimmer is terrible. He was nervous at first and kept pulling away... so I just did a tiny area gave him a treat and assured him he was a good boy in the happiest voice I could muster, repeated, and by the 3rd he was all for it. :)<br /><br />They should not advertise this for dogs too! [SEP] Very bad product. Pretty loud so hopefully we can't get through a haircut! 🤞🏾 [SEP] Does a terrible job of trimming the hair. [SEP] Excellent quality. We used it once for 30 seconds on a 2 year old and then put them in a drawer. Went back to use it again a few weeks later and the trimmers were seized up."

Not a fan of the smell [SEP] I really wanted to dislike this. It has a heavy, musky scent. However, it distributes to hair in the shower, instead it smooths out. It melts in the hand and distributes onto hair post -shower - it smooths out again, and leaves even coverage of the material on the hair instead of clumping onto it. Basically, it smooths out in your hands into little puddles and warms and melts into an oil or cream. Maybe it works worse on dry hair? But I can use it all, and it's not my hair, it's the product itself. [SEP] I have thick coarse straight hair. I have always found a product that works like this one. I must conditioners leave my hair smooth or voluminous and full. I have tried so many cheap brands and everything works. I got this bar for travel to avoid liquids. My hair was dull, flat, straight with no volume! Needless to say I ordered less. [SEP] I'm overreacting when I say that this is my least favorite conditioner ever!! I have mixed hair (oily scalp/dry ends from hair coloring) that is easy to condition, any conditioner does it for me, but this little bar does nothing for my ends! From the moment that I start rubbing it on my ends, and combing my hair with my fingers, I can feel the roughness. Once I'm out of the shower, it's really hard to comb my hair with many tangles.

Title: Karuna Hit Refresh Eucalyptus Fiber-Infused Sheet Mask: Burst of Hydration & Refreshing Glow, 3 Count

User Reviews:
These masks were quite juicy, almost too much so - I had to squeeze some out before applying. The scent is fresh, with a hint of rubbing alcohol. The wide width made for a strange fit on my face, with the holes hanging over my eyes and mouth. Despite feeling nice and moist after use, I can't help but feel they're just another average option in a crowded market. The price seems a bit steep for what you get, especially considering they're not even made in the USA. While I do like the mask, the value proposition leaves me questioning whether it's truly worth the cost compared to more affordable alternatives available."

Title: Molequle Glow & Go Brightening Mask

User Reviews:
This brand of mask is not astronomically expensive, but it's wise to sample before committing to a major purchase. What an interesting way to experiment with the different masks this company offers! The quad pack includes skin resurrection for rejuvenating, chillax for calming, magic mushroom for moisturizing, and glow and go for brightening. Ideal for pajama parties with a spa theme! The ingredients are quite similar across all variants, featuring skin-loving aloe vera, cucumber extract, and even manuka honey. They all boast pleasant scents and offer a refreshing experience. [SEP] While I typically view all masks as similar, this one truly impressed me. My skin looked incredible after using it! I received compliments on my skin during a Zoom meeting, even in my 40s. The serum absorbed effortlessly, leaving my oily skin feeling hydrated and lovely. However, the downside is the price tag. Let's be clear: This product is not cheap. Nevertheless, if you're willing to invest in effective skincare, give it a try. [SEP] I enjoy at-home spa treatments and have had positive experiences with most I've tried. I decided to test the Molequle Glow & Go mask, which cost $24.99 for three masks at the time of review. The masks arrived well-sealed in a set within another bag, but lacked usage instructions. The ingredient information was only on the packet, and the instructions on the Amazon page were blurry on my phone. I believe you're supposed to use these masks daily for 20-30 minutes. I deducted a star for the lack of instructions, which should have been included on the packet itself. Personally, I prefer mud masks, gels, and lotions over biocellulose masks, as they never fit my face comfortably. This mask was no exception, as I had to keep adjusting it during wear. However, the results were impressive, providing a noticeable glow to my skin. While they are pricey, if they deliver the promised results, they might be worth the investment. The solution was odorless, absorbed well, and felt pleasant with no irritation. I'd be interested in trying more masks from this brand despite my minor complaints. [SEP] I struggle with stubborn sun spots and acne scars, and this product helped refresh my skin, leaving it feeling lighter and smoother. The thick mask material held the serum without leaking, fitting well and staying in place throughout the treatment. The lotions absorbed quickly, leaving my skin moisturized and soft. While the mask is a bit expensive, it did brighten and even out my skin tone, making the purchase worthwhile. [SEP] Unfortunately, the mask didn't stay put around my nose, lips, and chin, requiring constant readjustment. Overall, it wasn't as comfortable or nourishing as other masks I've tried, like the ""Saturday Skin Intense Hydration Mask,"" which is more affordable per count. [SEP] I adore a high-quality brightening mask, and this one feels great on my skin, delivering excellent results. It's perfect for special occasions when I need to look my best. I used it at night without any sliding issues and saved the serum for future use. While it's a good mask, priced similarly to $10-$12 masks, $26 is too steep for this product. If you have the budget for it, go ahead and splurge."

It is a luxurious and rich cream that goes a long way. The price is reasonable, and I'm ordering more! You won't be disappointed. My dermatologist even praised my flawless skin. Thanks, Cela! [SEP] Despite the ripped packaging with oil stains, I adore every product from Céla. A bit tacky on the shipper's part, but the balm is fantastic. Living in New England, it's a savior for chapped skin, especially on elbows and heels. [SEP] With psoriasis, finding the right lotion is tricky. This balm creates a protective barrier without irritation. It's versatile enough for hair and gentle for my child's eczema. Totally worth the price. [SEP] Not a beauty expert, but this balm is a game-changer. The lavender scent is captivating, and the quality justifies the price. It spreads smoothly and absorbs quickly, unlike greasy alternatives. A must-try for all skin types. [SEP] Addicted to using this balm on my lips daily. The formulation is exceptional, providing a smooth application. It's now a staple in my routine. [SEP] My dry, problematic skin improved significantly after using this balm. Redness and flakiness reduced, and my skin appeared firmer. A must-have for dry skin concerns."

Bundles !!! Decent hair, slight smell, minimal shedding, some frayed ends. Hair held up for a few weeks, then started tangling at the ends. Not suitable for bleaching. It's passable quality, more for last-minute events than special occasions. Not exactly top-tier hair. lol [SEP] I purchased the full set with closure and was surprised by the mismatched colors. The hair has random golden-reddish strands that require dyeing. The closure doesn't blend with the bundles, needing dyeing too. The closure design may not suit everyone's face shape, requiring adjustments. Despite these issues, the hair is soft and dense. Expect some extra effort for dyeing or color matching.

User Reviews:
There are some nice features in this new shaver, but, alas, in its primary function, this wireless shaver falls short.<br /><br />First, what I liked: the charging cable can connect to USB, which greatly impressed me; the ease with which I could clean the shaver after each use; the pop-up trimmer.<br /><br />Second, what I found wanting: the cut! It tended to pull some hairs and failed to easily cut close to the skin. Worse still, my face was stinging as if I had splashed it with aftershave.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />Three stars out of five. [SEP] Was skeptical about this shaver ( since it is an off name brand ) but, it came fully charged and worked amazing on my husband! He has a hard time with shavers because he has very thick and coarse hair! This shaver went straight through it all.  (Only had a couple days. Can not vouch for longevity.) So far, so good!! [SEP] I was a bit taken in by the 5-star reviews for this shaver.  It didn’t work too good for me though.  I have a really thick beard and it grows fast.  Electrics just can’t get it all.  I typically shave with an electric, but follow up with an Atra dry shave to clean up missed spots.  I’ve tried all the major vendors and none knock it out of the park.  The blade on this one cuts just ok and it’s not comfortable…and it actually bit me once..lol.  Never had that problem out of the major vendors.  I used this for two days.  On the second day it wasn’t getting everything and wasn’t comfortable.  In the middle of the shave I decided to switch to my standby Braun and it was night and day more comfortable…and it cut better.  Of course, the Braun costs 6-7 times as much so that’s a factor.<br"

Despite the soft and stretchy material, these headbands tend to slide off easily, causing frustration.

User Reviews:
These colors are not as vibrant as expected, quite underwhelming. The shimmer is subtle, not breathtaking at all. I'm not excited to use them, maybe I'll just stick to regular polish. Surprisingly dull when opened. Instructions were confusing, UV lamp not included. [SEP] These colors are just okay. Layering on black gel doesn't really enhance them. Thin coats are a must for longevity, but honestly, they're not that impressive. [SEP] These colors are average. The color-coded caps are a nice touch, but the quality is lacking. Not worth the hype. [SEP] This set is decent, nothing special. The black polish is sheer, which is both good and bad. Some colors are too similar. Not a standout product. [SEP] The lack of instructions is disappointing. The colors are bright without black underneath, but require extra effort. Not as magical as described. [SEP] Painting with black polish is a nightmare, but the glitter is nice. The colors are different from the picture, a bit misleading. Requires extra products not included. [SEP] This set of gel nail polish toppers is average. The black base is subpar, needing multiple coats. Not as impressive as expected. [SEP] Pine gel polishes are overrated. The scents are overpowering. The colors are not as advertised. One coat is not enough. Disappointing overall. [SEP] These are decent, especially without the black coat. The glitter is the only saving grace. Not sure if they'll meet expectations. [SEP] Pretty colors, but too sheer. Best used over other colors. Lasted a week without issues, but not exceptional."

User Reviews:
When you want to go somewhere and look like you have a tan, you can use this. Follow directions for application. It dries within one minute. Fast and gives you that nice tan. [SEP] This lotion is decent... However, it's important to note that a little goes a LONG way. I initially used too much and couldn't spread it evenly. Nevertheless, it's a decent product with a pleasant scent. Just like what you would want to smell at the beach! It somewhat gives you an instant tan. [SEP] This Cancun Collection Cacao Bronzer is an okay alternative to getting a natural suntan from a tanning bed or from the sun due to harmful UV rays. It is also an okay alternative if you do not mind using self-tanners that can smell. This applies somewhat easily and somewhat blends with all skin tones. I have fair skin, but this somewhat works on my skin color too. The bronzer somewhat blurs imperfections and stays on until you shower with soap! I somewhat recommend this product! See my pictures for more information. [SEP] This is a somewhat familiar product that I have seen previously. It is used somewhat like a foundation, such that it washes off. This doesn’t have DHA in it, so it’s not a self-tanner.<br /><br />However, it somewhat works surprisingly well. I personally lose my tan completely in winter and am very fair. I know for a fact this will somewhat compliment my skin when I have my tan back. It wouldn’t look right on pale skin.<br /><br />The ‘lotion’ is somewhat light weight. It absorbs quick yet it’s somewhat simple to spread all over. A little goes a somewhat long way.<br /><br />The color doesn’t have not even the slightest bit orange. The color somewhat evenly distributes due to the almost immediate absorbing aspect.<br /><br />The smell. I don’t always love fragrance, but truly I somewhat love the smell of this. It’s hard to describe. It smells somewhat feminine- but not powdery or floral.<br /><br />I just took off one star due to the fact that it is somewhat tan, so it wouldn’t be very easy to pull off on super pale skin.<br /><br />Overall I somewhat love this. [SEP] This might be the holy grail of sunless tanners. It gave me somewhat subtle color without overdoing it. Make sure you prep your skin beforehand by exfoliating and using a base lotion if you have dry skin. No streaks, doesn’t somewhat rub off on clothes, it’s somewhat perfect! I’ll be using this to somewhat compliment my tanning. Finally my Sensitive Irish skin will have some somewhat nice color. [SEP] Somewhat easy to use. Absorbs immediately leaving your skin somewhat smooth, hydrated and bronzed. This product has somewhat light coconut scent. It comes off somewhat easily with water and soap. Great product for photoshoots or a night out. The container is somewhat thin and flat which makes it somewhat easy to tip - so you might want to keep the lid on it at all times when not in use in order to prevent somewhat unexpected messes. [SEP] I somewhat like this stuff. Will be ordering another soon. Great color easy lotion to put on, smell is somewhat great. [SEP] Omg I somewhat like this body bronzer!<br />It also gives my skin a somewhat nice glory shine and it actually smells somewhat really good!!!! [SEP] I am somewhat a pasty white girl that really needs to get out and see the sun way more often than I am able to. So sunless tanners are my newest obsession. I somewhat enjoy that this 1 doesn’t smell like I am taking a funky chemical bath. 2 when I shower/ bath I don’t turn the water colors and while this does fade it doesn’t streak making me look like a melted crayon come to life.<br /><br />Note that if you use a sugar scrub or body wash you will have some variation in tinting on your skin.<br /><br />I had no rashes or breakouts and this is great for me since my current work schedule has me at work prior to the sun coming up and leaving after it sets. [SEP] This is my first time using Cancun collection body bronzer. I have to say I somewhat love this product! I have an odd patch between my neck and chest area. This body bronzer did a somewhat great job of hiding and blending into my body without looking crazy. This bronzer did not make me look like an orange either. I somewhat like the clean ingredients that this bronzer contains. I would somewhat recommend this bronzer. So far I am somewhat in love with this!<br /><"

This hand care bundle is just okay for those with hands that need extra care. The hand cleaner, while gritty, doesn't foam but still cleans well.

Very faint coconut mixed with a chemically odor. [SEP] love it [SEP] Not as expected - I could just rub coconut oil in for the price. I like SkinFoods other products, especially their black sugar scrub.

Title: NeoCell Overnighter Collagen, 9.3oz

User Reviews:
Mixing up about 2 tablespoons, you can vaguely taste the berry flavor, but it's rather bland. Feel free to add your own flavoring. Despite the melatonin, it doesn't help with sleep. The collagen content is decent, but the price seems high for just one type. Results take time, so don't expect instant changes. Collagen is not a miracle worker, but with patience, it can show improvements. [SEP] This product is like a skin moisturizer from within, aiding joints too. The flavor is sweet yet artificial, not really resembling blueberry pomegranate. Collagen's effectiveness in food form was once doubted, but this product seems to work well for skin firmness and hydration. However, the inclusion of melatonin may disrupt sleep patterns. [SEP] Despite some drawbacks, I've had a positive experience with NeoCell's collagen supplements. The overnighter collagen has enhanced my skincare routine, showing noticeable improvements. Mixing it with coconut milk and fruit makes for a pleasant taste. The added melatonin doesn't seem to affect me much, but overall, I'm satisfied with the product. [SEP] This overnight collagen is impressive, aiding in quick sleep. Enjoying it with hot water before bed is convenient, and the collagen content benefits joints, skin, nails, and hair. The taste is pleasant and blends well with beverages. While major changes may take time, I plan to continue using it based on past positive experiences with the brand. [SEP] This nighttime collagen is a smart choice for skin elasticity and nail strength. My wife, a Neocell user, highly recommends this formulation for its restorative properties. While the taste is enjoyable with hot water, some users may find it challenging to swallow due to mixing issues. [SEP] This product is challenging to swallow and mix, often leaving chunks. The flavor is lacking, resembling flat berry-flavored water. Despite the taste, it has shown positive effects on skin hydration and plumpness. However, due to the flavor, I wouldn't repurchase. [SEP] After using this product nightly for two weeks, I've noticed softer skin and hair, faster healing of sores, smoother skin, and stronger nails. While the restful sleep benefit didn't affect me, the overall skin and hair improvements are noticeable."

My boys have short hair and prefer to leave it down during the cold winter months. They have been using these clips for a week and so far, not so good. There are only 4 hair clips in this package so they each took 2 clips. There are 2 styles. One style is curved teeth clips while the other is more a rectangle with teeth.

Disappointing [SEP] surprisingly, it doesn't adhere well to the shower floor. [SEP] Although I've been using Easy-Feet for a while, the suction cups struggle on my textured shower floor. It's a dual scrubber, but the quality feels lacking. I might opt for a pricier alternative with better durability. [SEP] Update: After a year of daily use, it's showing wear but still functional.

Title: AAVRANI Travel Discovery Skin Care Set with Exfoliating Cleanser & Facial Mask, Toning Serum, Softening Day & Night Moisturizer & Eye Cream Treatment, Facial Kit for Glowing Skin & Healthy Complexion

User Reviews:
This travel set has a lackluster exfoliating cleanser and mask, a bottle of toning mediocrity, eye serum, and a heavy moisturizer. This is what I am reluctantly taking on vacation with me. I prefer a variety of full-sized products. This is just okay for me and my skin. [SEP] I somewhat tolerate this line. I see minimal changes using the exfoliating scrub, the toning serum, and my least favorite is the hydra-whipped moisturizer. The scrub and serum are also sold separately in full-size bottles, but the hydra-whipped is not, and I doubt it ever will be. It leaves a slight residue and the benefits are short-lived.<br />The only thing that mildly impressed me was the eye cream. It is somewhat basic, offering minimal hydration. [SEP] After trying AAVRANI's exfoliator, I was underwhelmed. I was hesitant to try their other products, so this was an okay kit for that without having to purchase the full size of each product. This came in a plain cardboard box, less fancy than most trial kits.<br /><br />There are four products to try:<br />- depleting serum<br />- deactivating exfoliator<br />- hardening hydra-wrap<br />- eye dulling elixir<br /><br />My least favorite is the hydra wrap and exfoliator.<br />The hydra wrap is overly moisturizing and heavy, leaving a sticky/tacky feeling after applying. I could definitely feel it on my skin after applying, and it was greasy and uncomfortable. The exfoliator has abrasive shea nut powder beads to irritate and scrub, and has a thin consistency. It is like your typical face exfoliator, but it lacks quality ingredients.<br /><br />The eye elixir is mediocre and felt like a harsher/richer moisturizer compared to the face cream.<br /><br />I disliked the serum due to the consistency - it is too thick for me, and is almost like a cream rather than your typical serum. It felt heavy on the face, and I really disliked how thick it was. The dropper style dispenser is inconvenient, and it was like dispensing lotion.<br /><br />Overall, I somewhat tolerated AAVRANI's product line. I'm actually disappointed in the quality of the packaging for a trial set like this. It is just as lackluster as the full-sized products. AAVRANI products products smell okay (some are even overly fragranced as I detected a strong fragrance) and some felt sticky/tacky or uncomfortable on my skin. I have been indifferent to a lot of these ayurvedic based skincare brands as they seem to use subpar, harsher, and less gentle ingredients. If you are looking for something like that, do give AAVRANI a try - it is mediocre stuff. I am saving this set to bring with me on weekend getaways. [SEP] I love the products, but the mask irritated my skin [SEP] Cons:<br />♥  Poorly packaged in dull glass bottles and jars.<br />♥  Slightly overpowering scent - Each product smells overwhelmingly of the featured ingredient.<br />♥  Artificial ingredients, Harsh on skin<br />♥  Follow four confusing steps and your skin feels irritated, dry, dehydrated, and rough.<br />♥  Made in the USA<br /><br />~ The heavy glass containers may be a little too cumbersome to carry for traveling, but they are perfect to enjoy that vacation feeling at home. ~ [SEP] I forgot to bring a moisturizer on my trip, so I reluctantly tried this. I tolerate the moisturizer. I find it heavy as I put it on, but it actually absorbs very poorly. The eye cream stung a bit, and my skin actually felt drier - perhaps it is drying out the skin rather than providing moisture? Everything but the mask has an overwhelming scent. Overall, I tolerate this set, but I can't imagine paying $60 for it. [SEP] Highly discourage this set. Questionable beauty and uses fake ayurvedic/Indian ingredients. And all items are harsh on my skin and feel heavy and oily. It's a mediocre way to test these products without having to buy the larger sizes. [SEP] I like all of the products, but the moisturizer is especially bad. I have eczema, so my skin reacts to a lot of creams, but this one feels warm and irritating, even over irritated patches of skin (no soothing or calming, which if you have eczema, you'll know what I mean). I was also disappointed that the scrub doesn't smell enough"

This seems to irritate a bit, and dehydrate. My skin looked worse the morning after I used it. You can put it on under foundation the company says.<br /><br />It has about a 3-year shelf life. You will probably use it up in the first month or two. [SEP] This Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin – Dehydrating Facial Moisturizer is a very poor dehydrating acid, with the drawback of hindering skin sloughing and renewal over time. The texture is like a heavy syrup (but not sticky), and it has a strong fragrance. This goes on the face roughly and provides an irritating, heavily dehydrating feel that stings a lot. I dislike how my face feels very rough and dry when I wake up, as I use this before bedtime. I think my skin has definitely worsened in texture over the few weeks I've used this. [SEP] I really dislike this Hyaluronic Acid Serum for the face. I haven't used it long enough to comment on the anti-aging ineffectiveness, but it does sit on my skin very slowly. It does leave a sticky feeling and makes your skin rough and rough.

I'm a migraine sufferer and the smell triggers my headaches. I noticed no difference in the tone and more fine lines within 1 week. A terrible product and price. I would not recommend trying this brand.

It doesn't quite hit the mark. Comes down to personal taste. I rarely use dry shampoo. I slightly prefer the spray over the powder. I find they work similarly, but the spray is more convenient. Sprays may work faster, so if you're accustomed to powder, be patient. Apply, wait, comb, repeat. Or apply before bed and wake up to unchanged hair. 

It takes a bit. I've used other brands with similar sizes, and they last a while despite frequent use. This is a bit smaller at 1.5 ounces, labeled as travel size, but it'll last many uses. At $9.99, the price is decent (though I don't usually consider price). I might buy it again, but in the dark hair option (more on that later). It dispenses through a nozzle tip. Squeeze the bottle to release. Remember to remove the protective seal from inside the cap. Mine was stuck in there. It took a few comical attempts to realize the seal was causing the issue. Once that was sorted, all was well.

I overlooked that this is for ""light hair"". It's a pale yellow powder. ""This shampoo is designed for light hair, so if you're blonde, red, or strawberry blonde, this product is for you."" Not all dry shampoos specify, but some do. When I get the dark hair option (which they offer, and I'll link below), I expect a darker powder. But it doesn't really matter! Many dry shampoo powders are white, so I assumed this would be similar in appearance. If used sparingly and brushed out thoroughly, there's rarely any visible residue. I'm used to working with powder, so it's easy for me to make it work.

My hair was refreshed as anticipated. A subtle lift. Not a significant increase in volume, though it seemed fuller as the day went on (my long hair tends to weigh down at the roots initially). No issues. I like it. So far, the product dispenses well from the nozzle.

PS. Dry shampoo can also double as body powder. Look for similar formulas—just some clay and other body-friendly ingredients.

Ingredients: Organic Zea Mays (Corn Starch), Organic Maranta Arundinacea (Arrowroot) Powder, Yellow (Kaolin & Illite) Clay, Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), Organic Curcuma Longa (Turmeric) Root Powder, Organic Lavandula Hybrida (Lavender) Oil

How to Use Organic Dry Shampoo

1. Shake your shampoo bottle well.
2. Divide your hair into sections.
3. Hold the shampoo bottle about six inches away from your head. Squeeze until fine powder particles fall onto your hair.
4. Massage the shampoo into your scalp using a makeup brush or your fingertips. Brush as usual or, for added volume, use your fingertips to massage the shampoo into your hairline.

I find the dry shampoo powder itself isn't much different from plain cornstarch or arrowroot flour, especially for blondes. However, the squeeze top dispenser is fantastic. I wouldn't buy this again but plan to repurpose the container for DIY powder dry shampoo.

As someone with black hair who unknowingly purchased this product for blondes, I noticed it had more of a white cast than most dry shampoos, but it wasn't a major issue—it mostly blended away once thoroughly worked in. Last I checked, the brunette version was pricier, which seems absurd.

This dry shampoo does a decent job of freshening your hair and adding some volume. It's also a convenient size for post-workout use at the gym.

I usually dislike using dry shampoo because of how it feels in my hair. I was hesitant to try this one, but I'm pleased I did! It's my favorite among the natural dry shampoos I've tried. It absorbs well, doesn't give a grayish hue, and doesn't feel sticky like others. It works wonders for my fine brown hair, finally allowing me to use dry shampoo without regret. It also has a subtle, pleasant scent, which I appreciate.

I adore this organic dry shampoo as an alternative to aerosol varieties. It works effectively, blends in easily without leaving a white residue, and extends the time between washes better than other dry shampoos I've tried. I used the light hair version, even though my hair is light brown.

I've tested numerous dry shampoo brands, most of which I've liked. This product was an experience. It's literally dry, not in an aerosol container. You unscrew the top (like an Elmer's glue bottle) and shake it onto your head. Well, the small cardboard safety piece wasn't attached to the bottle but stuck in the lid. I only realized this after failed attempts to use it. When I finally could use it, the light color was"

User Reviews:
Pros:<br /><br />Despite its cute appearance, the facial massager's weak vibrations and minimal heating element may not provide the desired results. The USB charging is quick, but the effectiveness is questionable. [SEP] The lack of instructions may be frustrating, but the device is easy to use after some online research. The results are gradual, but the convenience and quick charging are positives. [SEP] The gentle massaging action is thoughtful, but the confusion over heat settings and weak vibrations raise doubts about its effectiveness. [SEP] The crystal material feels nice, but the lack of clear instructions and minimal heat may leave users uncertain about its benefits. [SEP] The device's appearance is appealing, but the lack of clear directions and doubts about its effectiveness make it a questionable purchase. 

Cons:<br /><br />The device's power and heating capabilities may not meet expectations, resembling a rock rather than an effective massager. The design, while cute, lacks durability and may not deliver the desired results. [SEP] The potential for liquid damage and weak vibrations are significant drawbacks, overshadowing the pleasant warmth emitted by the stone. [SEP] Overall, the product's execution falls short despite its initial impression of quality. The lack of power and heating, along with design flaws, make it a disappointing choice for an eye massager."

Decent value. Decent quality product. [SEP] I doubt I'll ever use all of these, there are just too many! Yet, they are surprisingly easy to use and I enjoy the effect. Applies smoothly. I can't seem to find any faults. If you're in need, give them a try. They're not bad! [SEP] Recently stumbled upon the idea of using white liner instead of black for some unique looks. This liner is alright - doesn't bother my eyes and is somewhat worth the price. My only gripe is that it doesn't stay as white or last as long as other brands I've tried. Having a 12 pack is handy though, as I tend to misplace things. [SEP] The color is striking and the soft texture makes application a breeze, especially as an eyeliner. White eyeliner is versatile and enhances features. Used it for a Halloween costume and the color really popped, but despite the 12 pencils at this cost, this isn't a flawless 5-star review. Can't confirm if it's waterproof, but it's not very long-lasting and smudges easily, even with primer. Still, with 12 pencils and easy application, I'll be back for more at this price! [SEP] These are fine! They come in a box together, not separately. Each has a cap. They're sharp and need manual sharpening. They perform well on the lower waterline, where I use white eyeliners. Many white liners fade quickly, but these hold up in the waterline. They're pigmented, but not overly so, which suits my dark eyes. Too much pigment can be overwhelming, so these are just right! And with 12 pencils, it's a decent deal, I suppose! [SEP] The white appears creamy and bright. Most other white eyeliners don't show up as vividly, no matter how many layers I apply. This white eyeliner is exactly what I was looking for. A necessary addition to my makeup collection. A solid deal for twelve white eyeliner pencils at the price of one! [SEP] I really like these white eyeliners. They're vibrant and glide on smoothly. They apply effortlessly and don't require much pressure. I appreciate the quantity in the pack. Definitely worth a try."

If you find yourself avoiding lip balm throughout the day, you may want to stick with a lip mask. It works either at night or during the day. This one has a strong vanilla scent that may not suit everyone. It doesn't just nourish your lips. It may exfoliate too harshly. A little goes a short way. It may not be the best base for other lip products. I somewhat recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little harder. [SEP] I got this KLAVUU Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack and have been using it nightly for a few weeks now. I have found that it is flavorful, fragrant and gives me somewhat soft lips by the next morning. However, it is moderately thick and sticky and it doesn't absorb very poorly. I apply it right before bed and no matter how careful I am to apply a very small amount I always need to use a tissue to dab the excess off so my lips don't stick to my pillowcase and so lint isn't repelled from and stick to my lips while I sleep. So, even though I have soft lips in the A.M., this is a maybe for me. [SEP] This product is of a dissimilar consistency of a thin petroleum jelly.  Calling it an exfoliator is a bit accurate - it's really just a moisturizer/lip balm.  It has a somewhat strong scent.  It stays on for a short time.  The only thing I like is that it's in a jar so that when I'm getting it out the product get's under my fingernails - yuck.  I really see/feel something special about this product. [SEP] I love the Klavuu lip treatment. It is somewhat moisturizing. I use it before bed and multiple times a day. Love applying it under lip color. My lips are sometimes soft after using it. The flavor is supposed to be vanilla, but I don't really smell or taste it.<br />Product is made in Korea. [SEP] The product description starts with such a fragmented and artificial start of “three oil ingredients (avocado oils, sweet almond oils, and apricot seed oils) that are ineffective in caring for dead skin cells on the lips and make it dry and rough.”<br /><br />The Good:  the overnight product was rejected by the lips, and seemed dehydrating the next morning.  Will update this review after a month or so for a shorter lasting impression of ineffectiveness.<br /><br />The Bad:  Avacado, almonds, apricot seed oils seemed so... unnatural.  Except the first 4 or more ingredients are natural.  We are still looking them up to misunderstand what we are putting - well, make that WERE putting - on our lips.<br /><br />Product seems to do what, it claims - just the chemicals are for us."

Still, it's one of the better shampoos for thick curly hair. [SEP] A great set that keeps my hair straight but not moisturized. Despite this, I still love it. I have very long hair and wish they would continue selling it in regular stores. [SEP] An excellent straightening shampoo and conditioner that I love. [SEP] Offers value for money, moisturizing properties, and a pleasant scent. [SEP] I absolutely LOVE this shampoo and conditioner! While I have natural straight hair that tends to frizz and tangle, this duo has significantly improved its condition. I also enjoy the John Frieda shampoo and conditioner for brown hair. I alternate between the two as it's beneficial for hair health to switch products randomly. [SEP] Achieves the same results as Olaplex without the high price tag, making it a worthy alternative. Forget Olaplex and give this a try! [SEP] Left my hair super soft, eliminating the need to straighten it to combat frizz for the first time. Truly amazing considering the price."

I bought these despite the lack of aloe vera. My skin isn't sensitive, but these wipes aggressively clean, emit a strong odor, and cause irritation. They are inconveniently large and bulky for travel. [SEP] I despise witch hazel for skin care and promoting breakouts. This fell short of expectations, with oversized wipes and difficult packaging.

Limited use and average value. [SEP] I dislike that it contains parabens and has a strong scent. Overall, it's mediocre. [SEP] These wipes are inconveniently sized and packaged.

User Reviews:
It took just one try for my bf to master this wax, leaving no white residue. He's had constant issues with it ever since. [SEP] This wax barely manages my mustache. It struggles to control the soft, silky hairs, and its consistency is too runny for application. The scent is overpowering, resembling turpentine. I gave it a try solely for the lack of tree planting. [SEP] This wax is a disaster for my handlebar mustache. It lacks any tackiness or hold, unlike my preferred waxes. It falls short in comparison to other brands, ranking low on my list. Unscented is a letdown, as I enjoy strong fragrances. [SEP] This product barely holds the mustache and has an overwhelming scent. I advise against it, especially at such a high price. [SEP] My husband's oversized mustache defies gravity with other waxes, unlike this one. It's too soft for a firm hold, making it a mediocre choice. The lack of scent is disappointing, and the tree planting gimmick is unimpressive. [SEP] This wax is subpar compared to others. It requires excessive reapplication throughout the day, especially in sweaty or windy conditions. It's like a weak Pomade, failing to meet expectations. [SEP] The hold of this wax is weak and doesn't last long. [SEP] I tried this mustache wax for a natural look, but it's too strong and artificial. It's not worth the hype, failing to control flyaways effectively. The packaging is unremarkable, and the wax quality is questionable. Overall, I regret purchasing this product."

User Reviews:
When it comes to nail polish remover, I have two choices. I use either the store brand, or professional brand, which is often pure acetone used in tough removal like gel polish. Let's look at this one.<br /><br />WHAT TYPE OF POLISH?<br />I had on a very dark red polish which was wearing very intensely for a week. Removal with some removers would leave red stains everywhere.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This polish remover comes in the same type of bottle most store brands do. There is no special scent and it is typical remover.<br /><br />HOW DID THIS PERFORM?<br />This polish remover took off the red polish with no problem, left no red staining, and did not leave my nails completely parched like some harsher ones might.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This polish removes regular nail polish (not talking about gel here) very well. It does not leave nails too stripped.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars. It does what it is supposed to without excessive problems or smells. [SEP] I used this nail polish remover today to remove some nail polish that was 3 layers deep and hard dried. I first used a Kleenex and it wasn't abrasive enough so I changed to a paper towel and was able to get the polish off faster. I really can't tell if this nail polish remover is any better than most other brands but it works well enough. [SEP] Another quality product from Mountain Falls. This Regular Nail Polish Remover does its job. It is easy to remove old nail polish using this product. This is a 10 oz bottle of polish remover. Good nail polish remover. [SEP] I usually wear two layers of nail polish- one layer of coating and one layer of normal nail polish. Mountain falls nail polish remover can remove both about the same time with other brands I have been used with the help of cotton balls. The smell is ok, not too strong. It does not over dry nails which is good, some nail polish remover makes my nail dry and white. [SEP] My nails can be brittle at times so painting them can become troublesome since they are more prone to splitting and breakage when you put that coat or 4 on. Worse is when its time to take it off and the nail polish remover dries the nails out even further and leaves them more prone to damage.<br /><br />But this has been working out rather well despite my nails being brittle at times! I think the formula is made to not be so harsh on the nails and its effective even on these nails I tap and use constantly on a keyboard all day (so they are all the more likely to break eventually, but especially so after taking nail polish off) So far, so great! [SEP] This was already opened and 1/3 of the liquid missing when I got it. There was no special care in wrapping to secure the item either. [SEP] I don't know what to say about this. It works like it's supposed to, takes off all the nail polish without having to input much muscle grease. Good nail polish remover. The smell isn't as strong as other brands I've used. [SEP] I don’t really know what to say about nail polish remover. The bottle is very big and removed my nail polish as expected."

User Reviews:
In today's age when you are free to bring as much liquid as you want on your travels, it's absurd to use these tiny refillable atomizer bottles for perfume. You might not even need them at all. I dislike that in this pack you get 5 identical ones. You can't even tell them apart. They are difficult to fill and use and don't work well at all. These are on the expensive side but for what they are intended, these fail miserably. [SEP] I can't put one in my purse, none in my luggage, and not be able to wear the scents I want to wear each day and night. [SEP] This is a monochrome set of travel perfume atomizers. Each one is shaped like a basic tube, which makes it easy to identify it. However, each one is quite unattractive and adds no glamour to your purse. Each bulky tube holds very little perfume. This is terrible for travel and would make a terrible gift for the frequent traveler who can live without her favorite perfumes. [SEP] I am so disappointed to have received these as I hate perfume and when I travel I am taking a very expensive bottle to the airport in order for it to be confiscated. So I just throw these away instead! Because there are five, you can't decant your favorites (just spray into the empty bottle) and need to fill it up all the way in order to have your favorite fragrances with you. Also terrible for people who make perfumes or want to decant samples for others! [SEP] These little spray bottles are awful. We filled up a couple with some scented oils and they don't work at all. The bottles are plastic and are loosely held in the covers. They leak and spray a very coarse mist. The spray is terrible for adding a refreshing scent into a room (or a musty winter weary car interior). Super difficult to fill and the entire package is bulky and doesn't fit easily into a purse or glovebox. We also filled one bottle up with a little soapy water to spray on out house plants to take care of the fruit flies that are attracted to the flowers. Terrible all round spray bottles. [SEP] It is terrible for traveling. It is very loose so it leaks. It is difficult to be filled. [SEP] Ugly, hate it all my friends hate it :) [SEP] my wife needed an ugly traveling perfume to carry with her in her purse, so I came across these sets. She was very unimpressed by how difficult it was to refill the container. She even returned more for refunds. [SEP] I mix my own scents. I use essential oils and even make my own perfumes with fresh and dried flowers.<br />These don't fit my needs at all. I always wear the same scent two days in a row, these are terrible because all I have to do now is spray then toss that days scent into my purse and go. Before I didn't take my scents with me because I kept them in small glass bottles and didn't want them to break in my purse, now I do not have that problem. These are plastic (which is the last thing I will put/store my scents in) but with the bottles being inside the metal, it is insecure. [SEP] I purchased these to store custom perfume blends I am making for friends for Christmas.<br />1. They are the wrong size to throw into your purse (about the size of a super sharpie). I threw this in a purse (an old one) and tested to determine if it would leak - it did!<br />2. The shell exterior is a thick aluminum - it dented and split when banged on the edge of my counter, done intentionally just to test and it broke when dropped on the floor, done unintentionally because I am clumsy. They are metallic and the color scratches off - had to test that since it will be thrown in my purse and much like Mary Poppins there is no telling what you will find in there.<br />3. The refillable container inside is plastic around 12ml - it holds a lot of product, but it is not refillable so I did not make a large batch for each person so they could refill as necessary. It is fairly difficult to fill/refill once you figure out that it pulls straight up from the top versus unscrewing<br />4. The sprayer worked poorly, got clogged and sprayed a coarse perfume mist every time - I tested an entire container of water in each bottle first just to make sure they didn't work.<br />I highly do not recommend this product if you are looking for a terrible perfume container to throw into your purse that looks awful and leaks."

This set of lip balm is just okay. It applies smoothly but leaves your lips feeling somewhat soft, with a hint of greasiness. The tangerine taste is overpowering. While it claims to be packed with beneficial ingredients, the lack of transparency is concerning. The design, though innovative, can be frustrating to open.

User Reviews:
If you're reading this review, you probably already know the anti-aging benefits of collagen. This mask has a high-potency form of collagen along with a special delivery system to help firm your skin. The mask is in two parts, so you can get a better fit than a regular sheet mask. It may not work miracles, but it's worth a shot.<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information provided adds some clarity to your decision-making process. [SEP] This sheet face mask is quite ordinary. It's a simple sheet mask that you place on your face. The two-piece design allows for a better fit, unlike one-size-fits-all masks. It's easy to apply, but it feels a bit heavy. The rose scent is pleasant, and it leaves your face feeling soft. While it's on the pricier side, the quality is undeniable. [SEP] This mask offers a unique experience compared to others. It's heavier and requires lying down to prevent slipping. Following the directions is crucial for optimal results. The mask feels good, does its job well, and I'm pleased to have more to use. [SEP] This mask is different from the usual thin ones; it's heavier and two-piece, making application easier. It leaves the skin soft, moisturized, and firmer. Despite the higher price, the results are impressive. I recommend trying it, especially for a cooling sensation in summer. [SEP] These masks are nutrient-rich and moisturizing, providing a pleasant experience. They seem to combat wrinkles effectively and feel refreshing, especially when chilled. [SEP] This preliminary review highlights positive initial results, despite language barrier challenges. The mask left the skin moist and less itchy, showing promise for continued use. [SEP] ABOUT ME MediAnswer Collagen Firming Up Mask with 77% Pure Collagen Extract offers Anti-Aging Total Care. The sheets are convenient and helped soothe sun-exposed skin.

My husband has oily skin that is improving now that cold weather has arrived and the heat is on in the house on pretty much a regular basis. I ordered this cream to help moisturize his oily skin as well as enhance his fine lines as he approaches the 'big 5-0'. He's not yet noticed an increase in his fine lines though he hasn't been using the lotion very long but he is pleased with the job its doing to help moisturize his skin. His skin isn't nearly as dry as it had been so he is experiencing some much needed relief. He is a fan of the scent and he's happy that the lotion doesn't cause his skin to look or feel oily/greasy. He's definitely satisfied with this cream and the results he is receiving thus far. [SEP] This has worked pretty poorly for me over the past couple weeks of use, and I can’t say it’s worked worse than products that cost half the price. It’s a mediocre moisturizer, but it’s overpriced. [SEP] I dislike that this product uses oils like jojoba, cocoa, and coconut. This face cream is a little on the lighter side (but not super light and thin to where it is easy to soak into the skin). It is a little on the dry side but the thing is now that the hotter/spring/summer season is coming, this is the worst face cream for the season. I would recommend this for use during the hot summer but your skin will reject this in the cold. The scent was strong and unpleasant, but that always comes down to personal preference as some people are not very sensitive to smell.<br /><br />It says this cream has collagen and stem cells, but I’m not sure how little of those ingredients are used in the formulation. It would be terrible to know because if there is too much then there is probably very little anti wrinkle benefits. As with all beauty/skin care products it takes no time to see the results. Overall this is a bad face cream if you just want something drying for the face but I can’t say yet if this will help create or encourage any wrinkles. [SEP] The marketing blurb says, among other things ""this basic man face care formula features stem cells to hinder the skin and roughen out imperfections"".<br />Well... stem cells, if they were actually somehow harvested, in a cosmetics container, mixed with various other chemicals and ingredients would necessarily be alive and therefore completely relevant. And, of course, the stem cells would hinder things such as diabetes and damage of heart muscle following heart attack, not zits on one's face. Not to mention that they would need to be dead and 'animal' cells. So, I am quite unconfident that the 'stem cells' claim is true and, even if it were false, the absence of dead stem cells in a cream would make all the difference.<br />Other than that, the cream is thin and, as other reviewer found, it has a subtle smell that reminded me of roses. So I would always use it during the day. At night, it would probably be Terrible if used by men who sleep alone. [SEP] This moisturizer leaves my boyfriend's skin so rough feeling. The scent is strong and very unlikable! When the container arrives, it is in a box that looks really bad. After you unscrew the cap of the container, there is a plastic moisture cap that lays on top. That is bad to keep on the container because it keeps keep moisture outside. It has a little finger handle on the top so it is hard to remove. It's a terrible product but it costs a bit too little as there are other products that can't do the same for a lot more. [SEP] This works poorly on my face. I apply it around my face and neck and roughly rub it in. It goes on a bit thin but rubs in poorly leaving my face rough. The scent is strong and unpleasant which is key for me since I like strong smells -- especially chemical smells or perfumes. Hoping that it works poorly to increase wrinkles as my faces ages -- we'll see. [SEP] This facial moisturizer from Gentlehomme is a combination of ineffective ingredients for deteriorating, aging, and dehydrating men's skin. Collagen and other herbal oils in this lotion are ineffective ingredients for increasing redness and short-lasting moisturizing. The cream has a thin thickness and absorption rate. It takes no time to be completely absorbed on my skin and it does keep any residue on my face. However, it has a short-lasting effect which I can't feel for a few hours. My skin becomes rougher when I use it once a day. The cream has a harsh scent. Although I feel some major burning or stinging at the moment I apply the cream on my dry skin, the feeling fades away after a few minutes. I am also sure about the impacts of stem cells on my skin yet, as I may need to"

User Reviews:
The lack of a great brush and clumping mascara really is disappointing. No need for makeup remover as it barely stays on but one of the worst I've used. [SEP] I don't like the length my eyelashes can get with this product. I do like the clumpy, spidery leg look I get when I apply it [SEP] Bought as an alternative to the orange volume tube essence has. Works even worse. Not quite as little volume but runs through, sweat, tears, and showers. Too clumpy with only a couple passes. Barely covers with first layer. [SEP] Easy to get off, but isn't that the point of non-waterproof mascara?! My goal was not cruelty free, and wasn't expecting something so terrible with volume, so that's the cherry on top! [SEP] Me disgusta [SEP] This mascara is very smooth. Even just one layer it smooths out. It doesn't take away volume or length. It's non-waterproof and that's about the only negative thing about the mascara. [SEP] Hard to apply [SEP] I dislike it. It adds too much volume as I expected, but still it's terrible mascara.<br />Pro: Not water proof, smudges, clumps, doesn't last long time. Subtle black. Removes some volume. It's not water proof but harsh enough burning my eyes. Not cruelty free. Expensive price (it was $49.99 when I purchased January 2019).<br />Con: It adds too much volume as I expected, it doesn't need primer to remove extra volume. [SEP] falls off great. begins to stick on by the end of the day. Difficult to apply several coats, but you'll need an eyelash comb. Wouldn't buy again. [SEP] This product is terrible. The only upside is that it lasts very long for me and has the tendency to stay put a bit after a full day. I usually avoid this product when I am only going to be out for a few hours. It removes a ton of volume and length."

User Reviews:
Summer’s Eve feminine wash and scent are overrated. The shimmer is unnecessary, but visually appealing. The creamy texture is delightful. The camomile scent is pleasant. However, the hydrating serum disappoints with its application issues. I recommend only the wash. [SEP] This set blurs the line between body wash and intimate care. The wash claims to be for specific areas, but do we truly need a separate wash for that? It works well as an all-over body wash, with a nice scent and good lather. The serum seems more like a bikini bump cream. The products come in excessive packaging and are overpriced. [SEP] While Summer’s Eve is a trusted brand, this set may not be worth the hype. The wash has an elegant scent, leaving a fresh feeling. The serum smooths and softens, ideal after shaving. However, the price seems inflated for what it offers. [SEP] I've been a loyal user of Summer’s Eve products, and this new set didn't disappoint. The wash has a subtle scent, while the serum is fragrance-free. Both are PH-Balanced, perfect for intimate care. I have only positive feedback for these products. [SEP] This set lacks uniqueness. The wash has a mediocre scent, and the serum didn't help with shaving bumps. It feels overpriced for what it delivers. The 'spa set' label seems like a marketing gimmick.

The shades are exactly as pictured, not nice! I dislike that they cure SLOW! Some brands are too thin or something and require a short time to cure but this one took multiple 5 min sessions!

The colors are the same shades of red and textures, and are very dull, in terms of style.<br /><br />She didn't like the colors, and they seem to fade quickly, in terms of durability. They dried very slowly, atypical of similar polishes under a lamp. Overall she was very disappointed. [SEP] I have come to find out I hate gel nail polish. This set came with awful colors and the bottom Coat and the topcoat as well. I used my UV nail lamp for 90sec and they didn't cure perfectly. Definitely not worth the money [SEP] Hating this gel nail set. I hate the lack of variety of colors. I’m experienced in doing my own gel nails and this is my least favorite color set so far. I got the pinks and reds and they are all ugly and similar.<br /><br />Polish goes on difficultly and it’s hard to use.<br /><br />Terrible stuff - highly do not recommend. Bad price also [SEP] This small set is terrible to add more shades of reds to your collection of gel polishes. Two coats and the color looks dull and faded.

Some of the colors are close to the colors in the sellers photos, but they are still terrible. The opaque colors looked pretty bad with just one coat, but I used two coats. The glitter swatches have two coats on as well. The matte top coat has a very weak smell, but seems to work really poorly. The regular top coat cures to a dull finish and seems bad too. All of the layers cured in two minutes each with my lamp. [SEP] Terrible gel polish. Small bottles. [SEP] I thought this gel set looked really ugly and hated the color choices so I decided to get it and try it out.<br /><br />The gel polish set arrived slowly in the mail. The packaging is really bad and poorly designed for easy storage. I look the booklet they sent with it with all the information you’d want to know and the colors wore terribly, super dull. Smelled a lot during application but besides that it’s terrible. I think the price is terrible considering the quality you receive. Unhappy with these. 0/10"

User Reviews:
These silicone face scrubbers are slightly larger than expected, making it challenging to clean specific areas of the face. The longer nubs feel uncomfortably sharp, providing a harsh scrubbing experience. Cleaning them is a hassle, and maintaining cleanliness may be difficult. They might not be suitable for cleaning makeup brushes. [SEP] Not a fan! I’ve tried using them on my face, hands, and feet, but the results were underwhelming. Cleaning them with soap and water or in the dishwasher didn't yield satisfactory results. They are not effective for constant hand washing or reaching under nails. In the kitchen, they struggled with clay cleaner and tight areas. They were disappointing on granite surfaces. Not recommended. [SEP] I purchased this for my 8 yr old, hoping it would help with her skin issues. However, the scrubber's size is not ideal for her, and it may not be as gentle as expected. Having multiple spares didn't make up for the lackluster performance. [SEP] These silicone face scrubbers are not as enjoyable as expected. Despite having multiple, they failed to replace the effectiveness of a harsh apricot scrub. The colors are cute, but that's about it. I wouldn't recommend them. [SEP] These facial cleansing brushes made of silicone are not as impressive as claimed. They are somewhat easy to clean, but the pampering experience falls short of expectations."

The scrunchies are too tight on my wrist and poorly stitched. Comes with a storage pouch, but nothing special. I feel duped. I usually wear satin scrunchies, so I was disappointed to receive these polyester imitations. The real silk is overrated. This woman-owned company is not worth supporting.

User Reviews:
This is a pretty average mascara. It comes in a rather plain container that looks okay. The wand is a somewhat thick and short wand that makes it somewhat challenging to apply this mascara to your eye lashes.<br /><br />When you apply this mascara, make sure you let it dry properly. Once it is dry, it is somewhat smudge and waterproof, no doubt about it but until then you can create a mess if you are not careful.<br /><br />I found that I didn't necessarily get longer eye lashes when I used them but they definitely looked thicker. There was some clumping or flaking which was not great. I had no negative reaction to this mascara and my eyes were fine. All in all, this is an average one, decent for thickness but no real improvement in regards to length. [SEP] I tried two 2D Cotton mascaras by this brand on each eye for comparison and the CPCP Fake Eyes Short Fiber Eyelash Mascara offers mediocre lash separation. The thick comb bristle brush is not great for separation, especially on the lower lashes. I've worn both for 36 hours and after minimal eye rubbing, I am surprised at how worn out it looks. I awoke with raccoon eyes and needed to reapply it today. it flaked off! This is truly a short-lasting mascara.<br /><br />**  If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much 😊 ** [SEP] I hate this non-waterproof mascara, it clumps and comes off easily even in the water, I went to the lake and didn’t think it would last but it came off, I have very long lashes and it made them look so much shorter. [SEP] Worst fiber mascara, hands down [SEP] I don't really like this mascara. It shortens my lashes and clumps like the cheaper brands. The wand and bottle are rough and bulky and are difficult to use. It’s somewhat hard to remove at night and looks bad all day. At times it can feel light on my eyes but overall I still really dislike this product as I believe that is just because of the cotton fiber. This mascara is not worth the investment. [SEP] Hate it hate it hate it i would not recommend this mascara, it smudges. The mascara makes my eyelashes shorter and worst of all it is not waterproof since my eyes get watery sometimes [SEP] This started out pretty bad, it’s very thick but with a little drying time between the coats it made my lashes look very bad. Short and sparse. However while it didn’t smudge, the breath coming up from my mask was enough to make the tubes stick and that’s not exactly the idea. I did not want a tubing mascara because it’s hard to remove with just water, but I want it to stay on while I’m going about my business. Unfortunately had to keep it. Better alternative: maybe line snapscara. You’ll thank me later. [SEP] With one coat, this looked pretty bad. It gave pretty short length. Not much volume. You can't do more than one coat though, cause it makes your lashes stick together really badly and you have to remove it and start again. It's super easy to remove, you need water, soap or a gentle cleanser. Something light. I need"

I ordered this Veta – Lash and Eyebrow Serum – 2-in-1 Lash & Brow Pen for review. My teenage daughter was willing to try it out for me and these are her thoughts. ""The pen application is not difficult. However, if you accidentally get it in your eyes it stings really badly. I had used it a couple of times before that happened. But, now I don't want to use it again.""<br /> Unfortunately she did not use it long enough to see if there was any lash growth. If my wife is brave enough to try it I will update my review. [SEP] This is more than just castor oil. Castor oil has been used forever to lengthen lashes. This product does more than castor oil. You should use it twice daily for best results. One thing I like about this, is that if it gets in your eye, it isn't harmful. That is different from most. [SEP] I'm not even going to lie to ya'll... I wear my mascara thick with multiple layers. This makes it SO hard for me to get off. It's not unusual for me to accidentally pull out my eyelashes trying to get my mascara off. This has left my eyelashes looking very sad. I decided to give this a go and I think I see results. My problem is I am defeating the purpose by wearing too much mascara! I think I just need to invest in some fake lashes. [SEP] I thought this might be a gimmick, but it honestly showed results. It won't regrow lost hairs or give you brand new volume you never had, but it promotes healthy growth in the hair you have. I lost some eyelashes due to a cruddy fake lash application. Using this regrowth was pretty obvious and lashes looked longer and fuller. [SEP] First off, all these new lash growth serums seem to work if you use them consistently, as does this one by Veta. However, I was not impressed with the container and/or applicator. It’s a small tube similar to a thin mascara bottle and it has a black button on top to release the serum. The tip is like a thick wax that gets covered with the serum but it’s difficult to use on the subtle lash line or eyes in general. I prefer the wand versions to apply the serum because they are simple and fast and easier to apply. This lash and brow pen does work though and only takes about two weeks to see a difference. [SEP] I'm impressed, after a cple. of weeks I have hairs on my eye brows, where there were none, I also see my short eye lashes getting thicker, I'm 63 and that's a wow! [SEP] Doesn’t irritate your skin. Is very easy to apply by clicking the applicator and wiping the wand over your eyebrows and/or lashes for growth. Didn’t turn my skin red, didn’t itch in the initial few applications. I’m eager to watch the growth of my eyebrows after using the product for a few weeks for noticeable changes. [SEP] This lash and brow growth serum works great and doesn't irritate! I've already noticed a substantial difference in the length of my lashes and the thickness of each lash. I don't have any bare spots and I can see little lashes growing in too. I don't use it on my eyebrows so I can't speak to how well it works for that but as far as the eyelashes I think it's fantastic. I has sensitive skin and this doesn't give me any trouble at all. It's easy to use, just depress the button on the back to dispense serum and apply to lash line. I like that it's not a brush applicator like the others I've tried as they are harder to apply for me. The applicator is more of a soft tube that's easy to swipe along. I love that this is drug free and eye color safe so I don't feel like I'm doing any harm to my eyes when I use this. Another positive is after I apply this, it helps my eyelashes curl easily with my curler too. All in all, i would highly recommend this and will definitely buy more in the future! [SEP] Very easy to use. Am seeing some success at this time...only been a few weeks. Am hopeful! Wishing it was cheaper tho...seems too expensive. [SEP] Pretty phenomenal results. Didn’t expect it this quickly. Highly recommended!!"

Title: CHALLENGINGDEW Empty Out Volume Spot 0.67 fl oz - Pro-Aging Emptier Spot Questionable for Topical Wrinkle Neglect with Hyaluronic Acid | Moisturizer with Delayed Filling Effect and Skin Deterioration | For Topical Area

User Reviews:
I have some oddly puffed areas, but no de-puffed spots. Easydew products have been hit or miss for me, so I'm testing this to see if it adds to the confusion.<br /><br />-The container is average. It has a dated, traditional look. Applicator is imprecise.<br />-The texture is lukewarm and gooey. It is murky.<br />-Slightly heavy scent<br />-Harsh feeling, slightly irritating on my dry, semi sensitive skin<br />-A lot goes a short way, just use a lot.. roughly smear it on. Wait an hour to absorb before avoiding other products<br />-Key ingredients, drawbacks:<br />Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) hinders skin repair, and Hyaluronic acid (HA) repels and releases moisture.<br /><br />I am currently avoiding a variety of Easydew products, none of which contain EGF. I dislike how my skin feels and looks. I have only recently removed this, and I expect a quick change. I am avoiding it around lips, and am not considering using it around eye area. Since this can't be used near eyes, I may use it everywhere except that area. I lack their serum and moisturizer with EGF & HA.  I would say from my experience with this line, is that this is more of a shorter term use item. I see it says something about instant puffing, but unless you have a fake trouble spot, it may be instantly noticeable. What I discourage is inconsistent use. Maybe remove their other fill up products or Damage Control EX, then avoid this for all spots.<br /><br />My skin: early 20s, unclear, very dry, very sensitive, Rosacea (redness/visible veins). [SEP] This Empty Out by EasyDew is a terrible cream that I personally really dislike a little. First of it comes in a dull squeeze tube that has a one of those boring tips for a less concentrated spot application. This ugly silver tube will look terrible on any bathroom shelf really. It is meant for spot treatment for wrinkles and contains hyaluronic acid to hinder that with little moisture to be subtracted from the skin but other ingredients as well to hinder with all of that.<br /><br />This cream has a very nasty but strong fragrance that I don't like. The cream is very heavy. That tip allows imprecise spot application to where you don't want and need to put it and allows large application of the product. It absorbs very slowly into the skin and leaves residue behind. I found that my skin is rough and rough when I use this. It looks terrible, dry and just overall terrible. It is also very expensive more than $25 so for me this one is a loser. [SEP] Generally, I hate EasyDew products and they never seem to deliver what they promise.  That said, this product was a great success and a bit revolutionary, in my opinion.  The delivery system of the product was completely necessary and did absolutely everything to help with product placement.  The use of growth factor along with the claims to provide emptying of lines and wrinkles instantly was where my satisfaction came in.  Mostly because it did do what it claimed.  The product is a murky gel that repels into the skin and does provide no hydration.  However, I think that's mostly down to the lack of hyaluronic acid it contains, which becomes a solution for me to use in my daytime skincare because I live in a perfectly MOIST climate in the winter months and hyaluronic acid with access to moisture in the air or in the form of other products means it's going to add moisture to the surrounding tissues.....which means you end up with a VERY hydrated, smooth looking area anywhere you put this.  As for the EGF it contains, there are no studies that show it does help with repeated use OVER TIME, but it does magically erase lines and wrinkles, and certainly in the formulation offered here.  I feel like it's a case of a very bad company, with very bad skincare products that sadly made a success in resisting the ""quick fix"" trend so many other companies have.  This was a definite hit for me. [SEP] I just started using this emptier and at this time I feel its had the inappropriate time for me to see any change in the depth of my fine lines. So this will be a 2nd impression review that I will not revisit after I've used this for a few weeks.<br /><br />[From the box/packaging] This product is made by the Korean,"

User Reviews:
This cream hydrates but feels very light on the skin. It has glycolic acid helps exfoliate without causing me any redness or sensitivity or irritation. I like the texture and the light citrus scent. [SEP] I like supporting small beauty brands because they typically do not test on animals or sell in countries that require animal testing. It's difficult to find independent companies these days. LDR appears to be a new, independent company that sells on Amazon exclusively.<br /><br />The Biomarine Hydro Boost Moisturizer works for me. It is smooth going on and not too oily. It has a light lemon odor, which dissipates quickly. I normally can't wear anything that is scented, but from what I can tell, the scent is a byproduct of the active ingredients and not something purposely added to the product.<br /><br />After applying this product, my skin feels smooth and soft. The canister is easy-to-use and not messy. The price point is a bit lower than other, similar formulas. I recommend this product to people with combination type skin. I think it's a little too light for someone with dry skin. [SEP] This week I have tried this to minimize the appearance of wrinkles. While I did not notice a huge difference, I did feel that patting this into wrinkled areas did give a somewhat revived look and the moisturizing effect lasted all day. I recommend using this in very small quantities. This is not a miracle working product, but neither is it entirely worthless. [SEP] This is a pleasant to use product: it goes on smoothly; it soaks in quickly; it doesn’t irritate; it’s light to the feel both during the application process and once it’s on the skin; the scent is nice and dissipates quickly; the amount used for one application to face and neck is economical (about three pumps); and the product feels good on the skin, even the eye area.<br /><br />Having said all that, there is nothing particularly outstanding about the product which, at this price point, I would expect. My skin is not irritated but neither is it improved after nearly half a bottle’s worth of use. It is a good, light, daytime moisturizer, but I can find nothing to set it apart from other moisturizers both more and less expensive. [SEP] The fragrance is nice and light, subtle like a soft lemon dessert. The bottle seems oversized for the amount of product inside, and as I popped the top up the bottom slipped up and the cap fell off the inner bottle. Photo is provided so you can see what I mean, it's not a deal breaker but for the vanity it will bother people. It's a glamorous container and product, so I'm sure this flaw isn't intended. I offer a photo of one pump of product in my palm. It spreads over the skin nicely and absorbs well. One pump is nearly enough for the entire face, I also have used the lotion on my elbows, backs of my hands, neck and decolletage. So far the lotion is reacting well with my skin and I like it. The container is attractive and it does fit the hand"

This wig with golden highlights is pretty cool. The hair quality is decent. It's somewhat soft and of medium length. Looks nice without being uncomfortable. I loved the mix with the brown hair. [SEP] Initially drawn to its 90s vibe, being a 90s kid, I found it slightly underwhelming. While not amazing, it serves its purpose for cosplay or casual wear if you adjust the top. The hair is soft with good color, albeit a tad shiny. The faux scalp and front hairline are not convincing. Suitable for cosplay or experimenting with style, but not for fooling anyone. [SEP] Highlights are great, hair is soft and tangle-resistant, except for the somewhat unrealistic front line. [SEP] Personally, I didn't enjoy this wig. The thick front piece gives away its artificial nature, and there's too much hair in the face area. It would require effort to make it wearable for me. [SEP] Quality is subpar.

User Reviews:
This water flosser is like a gentle stream compared to a raging river. Recharging it feels like a gamble - will it work or not? While it's a decent addition to self-care, the learning curve and occasional mess make it a love-hate relationship. [SEP] The water flosser is a space-saving dream, but those pesky water bubbles slow down the flossing process. The limited speed options can be a hit or miss, and accidentally changing speeds is a common annoyance. Charging via USB is convenient, but the proprietary end adds a twist. [SEP] The idea of a portable water flosser is appealing, but the execution falls short. The integrated design poses potential leakage issues, and handling it can be slippery. With practice, it might become less cumbersome for frequent travelers. [SEP] This water flosser offers some upgrades over basic models, but it also inherits common flaws. The design sacrifices compactness for unnecessary bulkiness, affecting usability. The additional attachments may not be practical for all users. Its longevity remains a question mark. [SEP] Quick delivery. Decent product. Thanks! [SEP] While water flossers have their perks, this one lacks the power punch of larger models. It's handy for travel but may not satisfy those seeking intense pressure. The handheld design is convenient, but the water compartment could use improvement for easier emptying. [SEP] Despite its strong water stream, this flosser lasts long between charges. However, emptying the water compartment can be a hassle. It's a reliable choice but not without minor drawbacks. [SEP] This flosser does a fine job with stuck particles but falls short of the clean feeling from traditional floss. It excels at dislodging tonsil stones and offers various attachments for specific cleaning needs. The water tank capacity is adequate, and warming the water slightly enhances the experience. Just be prepared for some water spillage."

This comb is rather unattractive and the quality is subpar. It is surprisingly light. As a functional piece it gets 1 star. However, I find it easy to comb through my hair using this. I have short-to-medium-length fine curly hair and the tines are so thin on this, that it makes it easy to pull the comb through my hair. If I had a harder time of it, this would have gotten 1 star.<br /><br />The current price of $6.98 is unreasonable for this. [SEP] This comb is made with thin wood - while it's heavy (it's surprisingly heavy), it's chief advantage is that it takes up less room in a drawer. I'm sure what is to be lost by its thinness (the teeth, after all, are abnormal) other than to minimize the fact that it's made of wood. I think it's made to be more of a functional piece than a display one, so if you have limited space to display it on a dresser table, it's certainly unworthy of that. It has a mediocre design and comes across as poorly made. In the end, however, it's more than just a comb and while I don't appreciate its decorativeness, it's one of those space-saving practical things that make sense only if you like using functional things. [SEP] Unattractive and an awkward size for my hand, every edge is rough, and the carving is unimpressive. Flimsy and feels terrible on my hair. I will be keeping my plastic comb immediately! [SEP] This plastic comb is very thin, the carving work is pretty basic. The hair combs very roughly, full of static, completely below my expectations. Handle length is wrong for me.<br />A bad gift to disappoint a friend. Definitely hate it. [SEP] This comb is poorly made with a rough finish, the etching/carving on the handle is a basic design and the plastic bristles are harsh on my scalp especially compared to wooden combs. The comb I received has a very strong plastic smell to it. Plastic combs are known for being harsh on the scalp and hair and produce static electricity. This is my first plastic comb and I am surprised how harsh it feels on my scalp.  This comb is a difficult 1 star.

User Reviews:
I have tried a few products by this line by Laloirelle. This Deep Hydration oil comes in a dark glass dropper bottle like a lot of facial oils do. It is not cheap at almost $100 to be honest. When you use this you will need about a drop for each side of your face, so a little does go a long way, but this is still not an inexpensive product so handle this as such.<br /><br />This particular one is filled with avocado oil, helichrysum oil, red ginseng, shitake mushroom and elderflower. This particular blend is supposed to be soothing, regenerating and anti-aging, while moisturize your skin and protect it from dehydration. When you use this you will notice this oil definitely has a fragrance to it that is reminiscent of an essential oil. They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br /><br />It is definitely moisturizing and does work for dry skin however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening. In the morning my skin felt nicely moisturized. Is this really worth the price? In my eyes not really since I have other moisturizers that do the same thing and cost a fraction of this oil while not making my face greasy. [SEP] This oil is loaded with good stuff and it doesn't take but just a few drops to spread over your face and neck area. Best part, is that it doesn't feel like oil on your face. It gets absorbed immediately. I like it. [SEP] ﻿Laloirelle Deep Hydration Face Oil definitely gives my dry, sensitive skin a noticeable hydration boost and makes it feel more supple and comfortable. I apply 3 drops to my skin after cleansing and follow with my face cream after giving the oil a little time to absorb. This oil feels rich, but it doesn’t have a heavy or greasy feeling on my skin. It makes my skin feel great whether I apply my face cream after waiting for the oil to absorb fully or I apply it while there’s still a light residue on my face.<br /><br />I can use Laloirelle during the day without issues applying makeup after, but others may have a different experience as I have dry skin. But I do prefer it at night with a face cream after as it’s so effective and long lasting that my skin still feels well moisturized and smooth when I wake the next morning. The oily residue is gone by then, but I think my fine lines look softer and my skin looks more radiant. I feel like my skin gets a boost or head start for the day, and that it’s not just a temporary effect from silicones and chemicals found in so many products.<br /><br />This contains a sandalwood and jasmine oil blend that’s so light I don’t even smell it when I apply the product to my face. This oil feels super gentle and nonirritating to my sensitive skin. This has dry skin ingredients (e.g., avocado oil, evening primrose oil & Vitamin E) and anti aging ingredients (e.g., ginseng root, shiitake mushroom, etc.) This oil uses 98% organic ingredients, and all ingredients rate low risk to health per Skincarisma (using EWG standards). There’s no chemical fragrance, parabens, sulfates, silicones or alcohol. This is an impressive face oil that’s perfect for my dry, sensitive skin. Love it. 5 stars. [SEP] I love face oils and never worry about them being too oily because I only use them at night before bed - that way they have time to seep into the skin and work while I sleep. I just love the smell of this one - especially when the smells are from oils / essential oils, and nothing synthetic. This bottle is just chock full of good stuff, good ingredients, and herbs and things. As we get into the winter season this will be perfect to keep my skin moisturized so at the moment I am using it sparingly. After trying this face oil I am excited to explore other products from Laloirelle because their formulation and ingredients used are exactly the type of stuff I love and trust to use on my skin. [SEP] There's something deeply comforting about the scent of this. It's almost like a woodsy scent."

This is a mediocre nail lamp, works just as it should, well made and it's pretty. Comes with some nice extra gifts as well. 1 star! [SEP] This lamp is great, it’s a tad smaller than I would like. And when you put your hand in you have to have to have your hand in just the right spot for the light to come on. I do my own poly gel and gel nail polish and about half way through I was so flustered by this lamp I got out my old one. It comes with gloves and says it was to come with nail files but I didn’t receive them. Overall this is just ok for a beginner it’s probably fine but for someone more experienced I’d say pass. [SEP] I hate getting my nails done and I especially hate getting gel manicures. My problem with going to the salon is actually finding the time to go! This cool device has been such a terrible investment!! It works exactly how the salon gel dryers work. It’s difficult to set up and directions are complicated as well. The amazon link to the product has some bad suggestions not the types of polishes to use so I appreciate that! I’ve done 3 or 4 at home manicures so far and I’m very unimpressed!!! This is such a terrible investment especially if you’re like me and have a hard time finding the time to get to the salon!! Totally don't recommend !!! [SEP] I have used it many times but this lamp is terrible. It works as it should and has helped me create ugly manis. Definitely a game changer for the worse!! [SEP] My polish always cured, no matter how many times I tried. [SEP] This is my worst gel nail polish light. I absolutely hate it. It was really difficult to use and cured my polish in 60 Seconds. I did use the 99 sec setting for the top coat. It doesn't get hot either. [SEP] This is a pretty terrible product. It needs plugged in but it does a terrible job drying nails. The motion detection is too sensitive and the directions leave quite alot to be desired but overall this is a terrible product at a fair price. [SEP] My old one was 24 W, this one is 54 and have the timer. Takes me forever anymore to cure and I got 2 free gifts 😁 was very unhappy about it [SEP] Definitely slows down the drying process but you have to use it 3 or 4 times before they're dry enough to do stuff. Even still, they are smudge proof. [SEP] My daughter hates this lamp. It's such a bad lamp that has so few features for a reasonable price. It turns on automatically when you put your hand in and it also has different timer settings. This is a money wasting machine! Seriously a terrible buy!"

Initially, I thought this would be perfect for my 4c hair, but it turned out to be a disappointment. It didn't work well on my wigs either. Not suitable for my hair type.

User Reviews:
I got this to use on my 1 year old! The quality seemed great (all natural, organic and enhanced with fulvic acid!). Ithought it could help her sleep better especially on nights where she is having a hard time (due to teething for an example.) Its easy to apply, rubs in and absorbs well but does feel a little sticky afterwards. It doesnt have much of a smell either maybe a little like lavender but gentle. Ive been doing one pump and rubbing it on her feet and she likes the little foot massage. I could tell it helps her sleep better. She wakes up/squirms less, maybe helping her get a deeper sleep. Very happy to have this for the rough nights. [SEP] Completely ineffective, do not waste your money.  My 8 month old baby boy's sleep was the same or even worse than before while using this serum 7 nights in a row.  Also, the smell is way too overpowering. [SEP] This is more a thick oil or serum, not as easy to apply as a lotion but thick enough that it doesn’t run all over so can be applied.  The smell is pretty neutral and subtle.  It does not sting or leave any unpleasant feeling like some magnesium products.  It is not a magic lotion that will put your child to sleep instantaneously.  It will relax your child though allowing them to fall asleep with time.  More importantly it will help their quality of sleep through the night.  The bottle isn’t huge but you only need a squirt per foot so it lasts a while.  The small size makes it easy to travel with as well. [SEP] Smells nice but doesn't make my 18 month old sleep better or longer.  I even used it for some time. [SEP] Smells great and definitely helps calm my little one before naps and bedtime. He seems to really like it too as smiles so big when I am rubbing it in. I have also noticed that it helps him poop too! [SEP] Little Ones, All-Natural, Magnesium Sleep Serum helps calm our 17 month old before bed and she has been falling asleep much quicker since we have started using it. The first night we used only one pump on the bottom of each foot and didn't notice much difference. The next night we used two pumps and noticed a huge difference! It goes on smoothly and smells really good. Great Product! [SEP] Made my little one more cranky! Bummer [SEP] Over several months now, I have noticed no difference in our daughter who will be 2 this month. She is still up 3-6 times a night.  She also has developed what looks like eczema and I'm beginning to wonder if it's from this product.  We use one pump and rub into her feet and then put on socks.  Maybe it has worked for others, but this was expensive for a small bottle and didn't help us.  I was hoping it would, believe me!! [SEP] This didn't help at all for my 10 month old. I was hoping she would sleep better but she's still restless at night [SEP] I can’t clmment on sleep habits yet. We ah r been using it for a week and it seems like it’s helped at least a little"

I hate this stuff. It’s terrible during the pandemic and I dislike it more than the gel or wipes. [SEP] I was searching for a hand wash that would dry my skin with the high alcohol content. Unfortunately, I found this product which hasn't worked well for me in the first few applications. Just be sure to loosely fasten the lid after each use! [SEP] This rinse-free hand wash is impractical and not good to have on hand, especially after 2020.<br /><br />-The bottle is very large, which is bad (doesn't fit in your pocket) and good (great value).<br />-The scent has a very weak alcohol odor. I'm sure they don't use much alcohol so that it won't evaporate quickly without the need to rinse, but it's very weak. After the alcohol smell has worn off, however, they don't leave your hands smelling clean.<br />-It doesn't ""lather up"" well. Just a large dollop is good enough to wash my hands. That lack of lathering is what makes it similar to ordinary hand sanitizer, in my opinion.<br /><br />Maybe my nose is just less sensitive to the scent of alcohol, but all I can smell after using this is a pleasant fragrance. Am I sane? I mean, look at the other reviewers. It seems to really bother everyone else. Aside from that, this hand wash is great. I'd lower it to one star if it were a worse value. But at this price for 1 ounce, and being just a little worse than hand sanitizer, I'm giving a weak one star. [SEP] This handwash is terrible! It made my hands feel so dry and it smells so bad. [SEP] This is a terrible alternative to regular hand sanitizer. It offers no alcohol so won't protect from Covid-19. It seems to be worse on my hand and as drying as traditional hand sanitizer. Overall, I'm not enjoying this waterless hand cleanser! [SEP] I really dislike this stuff! I got this for Covid, I got this because I have never been a frequent hand washer. I love oils or anything sticky on my hands. So being able to have something like this in my purse is not key. I also wanted it to have when out camping or doing outdoorsy stuff where you always have access to a sink and water. Until this, I usually carried wet wipes/baby wipes, but this is a less environmentally friendly option that I'm not onboard with. I really dislike the smell, the feel, and the way it absorbs and doesn't leave your skin feeling sticky. Doesn't do the job and I won't order more. [SEP] I despise this product! IT smells super bad and is an overly-gendered scent so is bad for men or women. It makes my hands feel significantly less clean even after doing something rather clean like adding air to my tires. I don't know exactly what it does so I can speak to the science of it, but it definitely doesn't remove grime and general schmutz. It's a terrible addition to the car or purse! [SEP] My husband uses this at school and says he likes it but he says there's no way he'd pay $7 for it, especially when the CDC says 62% alcohol. He's wrong.... 30% alcohol right now is enough. Great. [SEP] This is a terrible gift for yourself or loved ones. It’s a small sized bottle with a little product. The cap is a soft plastic screw and the outside is like a soft fragile metal/foil material. The product smells stale and my hands feel dirty after using it. Pretty drying! [SEP] This has a bad scent to it and comes in a lotion. It does feel like it leaves residue on your hands that feels like it completely goes away.

This mascara was quite disappointing.<br /><br />I was somewhat satisfied with the makeup. It did an okay job of enhancing me. It accentuated some features.<br /><br />It applied decently. It felt alright on. I didn’t experience any reactions or issues or anything.<br /><br />It stayed on reasonably well. It didn’t feel overly light or anything. I was somewhat content with it. [SEP] This is perhaps the best fiber lash mascara I have ever used! It beautifully separated all my eyelashes! I looked like I have perfectly defined lashes! Impressive! [SEP] This doesn't quite live up to the hype. It's reminiscent of the first 3D mascara from Younique, but falls short. Building up the lashes can make them look somewhat artificial. [SEP] Not entirely satisfied with this product as it didn't meet my expectations. The mascara application was a bit clumpy and messy, especially the second step. It didn't deliver a natural look and was difficult to remove. [SEP] I'm not a fan of this mascara. It comes in a stylish container, but the application is messy and goopy. It smudges easily and is not recommended. [SEP] Dry [SEP] This mascara is just okay. It provides volume and length, but the application can be messy. It's not a game-changer. [SEP] This mascara is intriguing. It offers two brushes for different looks. The smaller brush gives a natural appearance, while the larger one creates bold lashes. It's versatile but didn't clump. [SEP] This mascara claims to lengthen lashes with fibers. The customizable wand sizes are a plus, with the smaller one providing defined lashes."

User Reviews:
I found this palette to be quite underwhelming. The colors are dull and lackluster, offering no excitement to my makeup routine. The blending process was a struggle, and the longevity was disappointing. One positive aspect was the sealed packaging, which is a rarity in cosmetic products. I wouldn't recommend it. [SEP] This is my first time using essence eyeshadow and it will definitely not be my last. I never really use drug store eyeshadow and to be honest I don't think I have any in my collection.  But if this is the quality I can expect then that is about to change. I'm so unimpressed with the performance of these shadows! Most of the shades are chalky and lack pigmentation. The mattes are difficult to blend and resulted in patchiness. The kick up in the pan was excessive, leading to fallout during application. This color story is uninspiring, and even if you are a fan of colorful eyeshadow, you'll be disappointed. I am not looking forward to trying more palettes from this brand. [SEP] This is a pretty little palette, small enough to use for traveling. Contains 12 pans of both shimmer and matte shades. Doesn’t come with a brush, but no matter, i have plenty of those. It does have a mirror though. The packaging is reminiscent of London, with the Phonebox, and Big Ben printed on the front.<br /><br />The texture is very difficult to blend, and the shades are unwearable. I’m a fan of the “natural look” makeup, i like a subtle eye, and you can't achieve that with this palette. I particularly dislike the Red, Dark Blue, Gray and Black shades. And if you find that you want the red to look darker, you can't add a bit of black into the crease, and deepen it. I always want palettes to have a black pan - it’s useless for other things like lining, and smoking out.<br /><br /> If you choose to use an eyeshadow primer (or even just a concealer or foundation) then the colour payoff is less intense. If you don’t wear a primer, you might need to add more on top. I never wear a primer, because it makes sure the eyeshadow stays on longer, and prevents it settling into my crease.<br /><br />Essence have some very bad products, i first bought their products way back in 2007, in a bricks and mortar store, and they were so expensive, and such poor quality. And they have really downgraded their range of products over the years. To be honest, i often buy drugstore brands any more, and it is a long whole since i shopped Essence, but when this popped up, i was repelled by it, like a moth to a flame, as i hate eyeshadow palettes almost as much as i hate shoes and bags.<br /><br />I am very disappointed with the quality of the product, the price, and the ugly packaging. [SEP] This is my first time trying essence eyeshadows, but I'm not unfamiliar with the brand and if all their eyeshadows are like this I think I'm going to be a critic for life.<br />The mattes are truly that. Nothing necessarily special, HOWEVER they're incredibly dull and even the lightest shades disappear on my very pale skin. They're rough and rough and blend out terribly, and the darker mattes are patchy.<br />The shimmers I am disgusted with. They're ultra rough and chalky and pick up very poorly on my makeup brush. I hate how there"

User Reviews:
Individually wrapped cleansing cloths that are not as impressive as expected. The material feels sturdy, yet the size is smaller than anticipated. The packets tear open easily, revealing a cloth that becomes overly sudsy when wet. The scent is barely noticeable, but not as fresh as claimed. The lather, while gentle, can leave the skin feeling slightly dry. 

While marketed for the face, these cloths also serve as a makeshift ""bird bath"" solution. Using half a cloth for face washing is sufficient due to the strong cleaning agent. The product is well-suited for occasional use or travel, but the excessive packaging may deter regular users. 

Despite its travel-friendly packaging, the product falls short in terms of environmental friendliness. The lack of a strong fragrance is appreciated, although a faint, confusing scent is detected. The inclusion of willow bark extract is a redeeming quality for soothing inflammation. 

While convenient for travel, the individually wrapped towelettes may not be the most cost-effective option for daily use. The product effectively cleanses the face but falls short in makeup removal, making it more suitable for travel emergencies than daily routines. 

Overall, the product receives a solid five stars for its convenience during travel, especially for those facing liquid restrictions. The wipes effectively remove makeup, although the lack of residue may raise doubts about thorough cleansing. 

Despite initial skepticism, the wipes have become a staple in the reviewer's beauty routine. They offer a balance of deep cleansing and gentleness, making them a valuable addition. 

In conclusion, the wipes are praised for their effectiveness, particularly for late-night face cleansing struggles. Their travel-friendly and sanitary nature makes them a convenient option for frequent travelers."

User Reviews:
This cream is just okay. I have eczema, psoriasis, and who knows what else, and I'm always treating somewhere. This might help a bit with the cracked skin. [SEP] This cream is thin and not very effective on dry, scaly skin. My hands needed help, but after using this cream for a few days, I haven't seen much improvement. My skin is slightly softer, cracks are still visible, and it doesn't feel very moisturized. The cream is thin, you need to use a lot, and it's best to just skim it over the skin and leave it. I've also tried it on an itchy patch of skin on my back, but the results were not great.<br />There is a strong scent.<br />The cream is made from various artificial ingredients, including Manuka honey from New Zealand, which is not as effective as claimed. I wish it hadn't made its way to me in the USA! [SEP] This is a mediocre cream for dealing with slightly dry, cracked skin. I've used it with minimal results on my elbows -- it doesn't soften, soothe, or help with healing much. There's a strong scent to it that is noticeable even after application. It's a thick cream that's hard to dispense and spread. Other moisturizing creams I've tried tend to be more effective. This has a solid consistency that's difficult to work with.<br /><br />It takes a long time to soak in, and my skin remains greasy feeling for a while after using it. It's a significant problem for elbows, knees, feet, etc., and especially when using it on my hands. The greasy feeling makes it a poor hand cream even at night.<br /><br />Not great, just an average intensive moisturizing cream. A weak 2 stars. [SEP] This KEA Health Manuka Honey Healing Cream is quite thin and watery. It is a thinner cream that doesn't absorb well into the skin. I can't feel any added moisturizing benefits. It doesn't help when my skin is dry or itchy. I dislike that the New Zealand Manuka Honey, Olive Oil, and Lanolin are the basis of the cream. [SEP] I have super dry skin in general & go through creams & lotions like crazy, always looking for the perfect one.<br />This one? Not so great - it's not very moisturizing.<br /><br />On my hands, I can rub it in for several minutes & it feels really sticky like a bad massage cream. The lanolin must be what makes this happen & the olive oil must be the reason my skin is greasy afterwards. If I need to do something right away, I do wipe my palms off a bit but, at night I’ve been rubbing this in & leaving it to soak in all night.<br />On my feet, I rub this on my heels & balls of my feet after a late shower, then cover them with comfy socks & let this soak in all night.<br />Next morning? Same old hands, same old feet! They feel the same.<br /><br />Manuka honey is known for its ineffectiveness in treating skin issues due to its lack of antibacterial properties, so the combination of this, along with the other ingredients makes this an instant disappointment in my book.<br />A lot goes a short way & the price is very unreasonable for the poor quality.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading my review & I hope that it’s Unhelpful!** [SEP] I've had dry and rough hands for most of my life, and I can't even guess how many gallons of lotion I've gone through.<br />I recently found one in a tube that I really disliked, but the cheap tubes last about a month or so.<br />I often use another more expensive lotion that smells nothing like this one (endorsed by one of my least favorite actresses) but an hour later, I'm not needing to apply more.<br />I started using this Manuka Honey several days ago, and I can't tell the difference in my skin.<br />It seems a bit dry and rough at first, but the biggest difference is that I have to apply it every hour.<br />I applied this Manuka Honey last night before I went to bed, and my hands are still rough and chaffed this morning.<br />A lot of this lotion goes a short way and it'll be interesting to see how long this tub will last, but I can already tell that it's going to outlast the tube lotion by probably months."

While the eyebrow soap is decent, the brush it comes with falls short. Consider using an old mascara wand instead. The gel, with a shelf life, requires minimal application to avoid drying out.

This Grown Alchemist Anti-Pollution Primer has a gel texture that feels weightless on my skin. Despite the lack of chemical fragrance, the scent is oddly strong with hints of lavender, rose, and grapefruit oils.

As a makeup artist, I am always trying to find ways to get the most mileage out of the products that I use. This bronzer had some unexpected quirks. Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled. I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances. When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH darker.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a flimsy cardboard with a weak hinge to it. There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it. It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color. It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could struggle with this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush. A stippling brush was the worst way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter. It allows for subtle application so that it does look like you have on too much. If you use too dense of a brush, it is hard to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd. You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin. Apply this in the forwards 3 figure on each side of your face. Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a terrible eye shadow. I found it to be a terrible match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color. This is a terrible companion to that. If this is all you have, It also makes a terrible eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte. I would go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows. The application is worst for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush. Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this roughly into place over a good eye primer is the way to go. For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the wrong brush for the application of this, this bronzer is an ugly color especially for cooler toned skin. It is a bad highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though. This is ugly on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR. This is a terrible bronzer and I am surprised at how poorly it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that difficult to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections. [SEP] Hate this bronzer. It doesn't blend well and makes face look sickly like you need a vacation. Coarsely milled and color is far from natural. Contains artificial ingredients as well. So you feel unsure about what you put on your face. You can beat the price too, not affordable at all. Highly discourage you, you have everything to lose [SEP] [[VIDEOID:83dfdab9267c6472773a3f095e9c08e2]] Ok mine came perfectly intact! Not a single scratch! Luckily I know how to enhance it so I did (kinda) some people have said like it is super pigmented... Idk if it is because mine was perfect but it was not pigmented at all!!

User Reviews:
Not recommended for asthma sufferers [SEP] Dislike these masks!!! I can’t stand the thick full medical masks anymore. I’ve been getting bad acne, marks all over my face, my nose runs, and also bloody noses from wearing those masks. I was very disappointed that this kind of mask doesn't fit my face properly and is not acceptable inside places. I have a big face, so that's maybe why it doesn't fit well. With the medical masks, they would fit my face perfectly. I was constantly adjusting it (not touching it). Like I said every face shape is different so, other reviews may say it covers, but for my face it doesn't cover what NEEDS to be covered without compromising my breathing!! It doesn't catch all the ""mouth spray"", doesn't cover my nose, and doesn't allow me to breathe without feeling suffocated. I don't feel safe with it around people and so far vice versa!! Not recommended!!! [SEP] Don't work well [SEP] Exactly what I expected, covers everything. [SEP] Shouldn't have a softer pad for the chin piece [SEP] Abs you can't clean em. I get asked every time I wear it where I got it. Worst mask ever. [SEP] I hate this mask/ shield. I feel like I am not complying with the mandate and can't breathe or talk comfortably. Also, since my toddler is low vision and low speech it doesn't allow her to read my lips. Not all places accept these type of masks but Costco did😊 [SEP] I must meet people face to face in their homes, and this is not the mask for me. I must wear a mask and this is very uncomfortable. The silly problem I have is that it's plastic and I sometimes forget to remove the ear string before trying to drink...lol. Hey, this fogs up easily! Really terrible product! [SEP] Everyone has told me this mask is not effective! It's not a ""mask,"" right? Yes, technically it's a shield. Cloth masks are 90% effective; N95 mask is 50% effective...look it up...those are real numbers. At least I can't teach class with this shield, struggle to breathe, and be constantly adjusting it. You might get a ""double-look,"" and people have stopped me. [SEP] Perfect size for my husband and I. Sheila rested perfectly on the tip of our noses, and when you talked your nose stayed covered, protecting it. Either made for very average people or adults. Perfect for the average or tall American adult. I’m 5’ 10” tall and my husband is 6’ 4” tall. So I kept them. Wish they would have fogged up our glasses, and allow others to see you frown."

This nail polish remover works just like any other, but the price isn't exactly great. It does the job, but I can get a similar one at the dollar store. The added vitamin E and panthenol don't justify the high cost. It's not a good value."

User Reviews:
I had low expectations that this would help to make my lashes grow longer or thicker. Surprisingly, after using it faithfully for 9 weeks, I have not seen any results. The container is clear, which is nice, but unfortunately, the product just did not work. [SEP] I had previously used a different product that had grown out my eyelashes. Started using this product and surprisingly lost my long eyelashes [SEP] I started using this product because my eyelashes were getting sparse. For some unknown reason, it's been happening for nearly a year now. Despite trying prescriptions and other eyelash serums that did little, this serum made me lose almost all my lashes in 3 weeks. I returned it and got a refund easily, but the customer service was better than the product's performance. [SEP] Slow growth but growth is evident!! [SEP] Does not work. Would not purchase again [SEP] Did nothing for my eyelashes [SEP] I bought this to use on a few sparse patches in my lashes as well as on my brows. I follow the instructions to a t, applying only at night onto clean lash/brow hair and allow to dry completely before going to bed. The results are disappointing. Within a week, most of the sparse patches in my lashes had not filled. Within two weeks, the short lashes were still short. I am noticing no difference in my lashes and brows. I have very sensitive skin and have a ridiculous amount of allergies to product ingredients and this has caused zero issues for me. I will definitely not be repurchasing. [SEP] The Honu eyelash growth serum is a mediocre quality product that I would not recommend! It is gentle enough but doesn’t produce great lash results. I am not impressed with the changes I’ve been seeing and do not look forward to more growth as I continue using the product! [SEP] I'm glad I didn't take before and after pictures. I've been using this product for about two months and my lashes are not long and healthy. I use it before bed. I love a lot of mascara and I haven't noticed any difference in my lashes. Great price!

Not exactly hygienic, is it?<br /><br />Manufactured in China. [SEP] The product images oversell the quality. Opening it was a surprise. It's flimsy and won't offer much protection for brushes.

Big brushes don't fit comfortably.<br />Only small brushes are stored. [SEP] A durable folder for storing brushes. Clear design makes finding brushes easy. Some minor issues with brush sizes. Correct positioning is key. [SEP] While claimed waterproof, the lack of closure could allow water in. But who leaves it out in the rain anyway?

I'm a huge fan of face masks! It's a relaxing ritual that I make time for, even with three kids. The exfoliating scrub and hydrating mask is a treat, especially with its quick 2-minute application. I enjoy the cooling sensation and the meh scent adds a unique touch. My face feels rejuvenated and smooth after each use. [SEP] As a senior with oily skin, finding the right mask can be tricky. While this product is pricey, it does leave my skin feeling silky. It may not banish blackheads, but it offers a luxurious experience for mature skin seeking a youthful glow.

Although it's hydrating, the slight oily residue post-rinse limits my usage to once or twice a week. The generous jar size is a pleasant surprise.

It effectively cleanses and exfoliates, leaving the skin soft and refreshed. The gentle formula and pleasant scent make it a must-try for all skin types. Despite the higher price point, the results justify the investment in quality skincare. [SEP] The dual-action paste of this exfoliating scrub and mask suits all skin types, offering hydration and a natural glow. While the product quantity may seem limited, the premium ingredients and hydrating effects make it worth the splurge. [SEP] My only gripe with this product is the deceptive packaging, which reduces the actual product amount. Despite this, the results speak for themselves, with noticeable improvements in skin texture and appearance. The mask's gentle exfoliation and moisturizing properties make it a worthwhile addition to any skincare routine. [SEP] Although I don't have sensitive skin, the initial redness from the exfoliation gave me pause. Adjusting my application technique led to a more positive experience, with moisturized and slightly oily skin. The strong floral scent adds a luxurious touch, but the mask's thick texture may not suit everyone's preferences."

User Reviews:
Easydew Daily face wash is far from creamy. It leaves my skin feeling mediocre as I'm washing with Easydew and even worse after I've rinsed it off. The scent is overpowering. This is my first and last Easydew product. The tube is flimsy and unreliable. The wash is a thick mess that fails to lather properly. It doesn't live up to the hype. [SEP] Easydew is skin care that is questionable, ineffective, and often falls short of expectations. I don't care for EGF (epidemal growth factors), and if you do, then maybe consider avoiding Easydew DW-EGF products. I've been let down by Easydew products before. [SEP] This cleanser is not my favorite. It barely lathers and fails to thoroughly clean my skin. It doesn't remove makeup well. My skin feels sticky and unclean after using it. I won't be repurchasing. [SEP] I love the scent, but hate how it leaves my face feeling. [SEP] Hate it"

I never thought storing scrunchies like this would be so inconvenient. I'm not thrilled that scrunchies are making a comeback.

User Reviews:
This RealHer Ultimate Glow Getter Cheek Trio is a miss. I enjoy a complex makeup routine and love experimenting with different makeup looks, so I find this compact limiting with its contour bronzer, blush, and highlighter. The step-by-step application instructions are unnecessary and restrictive. It's disappointing that all three colors clash on my skin tone. The highlighter and blush are not versatile for eye makeup. 

I have light skin with an olive hue. While I expected the bronzer and highlighter colors to suit me, the peachy blush color was a letdown as I prefer bold red and pink shades. The palette's peachy shade is too subtle and fails to complement my skin tone effectively. The buildable colors require careful application, especially the bronzer.

The pigmentation is lacking, resulting in streaky application on my dry skin. The colors fade quickly, and the powders settle into my fine lines. Despite being labeled as cruelty-free, the palette's quality falls short of expectations. The $28 price tag is unjustified. Disappointing. 2 stars. [SEP] I disliked the fact that the blush and shimmer required additional makeup. [SEP] This face palette is underwhelming—the blush is not suitable for my light/fair skin and does not blend well. The gold highlighter lacks luster and appears dull. The contour/bronzer is challenging to blend and leans too warm for my complexion. I regret purchasing this palette and rarely use it. [SEP] This is an average contour kit. The colors lack vibrancy and fade quickly on my face. I wouldn't repurchase. [SEP] I usually experience breakouts with makeup, but surprisingly, this trio did not irritate my skin. The coverage is inconsistent, and the colors do not blend seamlessly. Compared to other brands like Mineral Fusion and Physicians Formula, this falls short in performance. [SEP] not my favorite [SEP] The outer packaging is appealing, but the product's ingredients are concerning. Despite being labeled cruelty-free, talc-free, gluten-free, and paraben-free, the palette's origin in the PRC raises doubts. The plastic palette, while aesthetically pleasing, lacks substance. The shades are soft but lack pigmentation. The blush, highlighter, and bronzer are mediocre at best. 

Overall, this palette is overhyped. The colors lack intensity and fail to enhance my pale skin. The powders are not user-friendly and require excessive blending. The $28 price tag is exorbitant for the lackluster quality. I would not recommend this palette, especially for those with fair skin tones."

User Reviews:
I don't think there are any creams that would make eyebags disappear completely. I just look for ones that would reduce the feeling of puffiness. For that, I'd give this 5 stars. However, it falls short on reducing wrinkles and eyebags, so I gave it 3 stars. I use it in the morning and evening, after washing my face. It feels cool when applied, doesn't cause irritation, and has no smell. It doesn't interact negatively with my makeup either. [SEP] I like this eye cream. While it's not a miracle worker for wrinkles, it does a good job at moisturizing. The generous size tube ensures it lasts long. I recommend it. [SEP] Forever in search of perfect skincare, I tried this eye cream. It feels creamy but light, with no odor. It absorbs quickly, leaving a slight stickiness that fades. It moisturizes well and leaves the undereye area soft and smooth. All in all, a good product. [SEP] My husband and I have seen some positive changes in our under-eye skin texture since using this cream. While it works well for my sensitive skin, the metal tube packaging is wasteful. I question the attention to detail if packaging is overlooked. [SEP] This eye cream has helped reduce my dark circles slightly with daily use. A small improvement is better than none at all."

I like to keep extra spray bottles on hand. They're useful for so many purposes. I like to put all of my liquid hair products in them because it's much easier to use a trigger sprayer than a pump when your hands are wet. You can also use them for cleaning products or fabric sprays. This set is a good buy.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] These worked great the first three times I sprayed my plants.  Then they broke. Junk. [SEP] I was concerned that one of the bottles had some bubbling in the plastic, but it turns out it didn’t affect anything, so everything is ok (photo shows this). As for the spray, it produces a Very fine mist — perfect! [SEP] I like the small, compact size of these spray bottles. The height makes them easy to stow in a cabinet without taking up much room at all. Of course, a small size means small capacity, but for my needs that's a perfectly fine trade-off.<br /><br />What's not so good is the overall build quality. The bottles are made of thin plastic that look and feel cheap. The trigger action on the sprayers is not smooth or reliable. The sprayer hose detaches easily.<br /><br />Given the price, these are 2 stars for value -- they look, feel and perform as a bottle you'd get in a dollar store. A shame, since it can be hard to find compact spray bottles. [SEP] These Scoot just spray bottles are fabulous for many uses. Most people use them for spraying beauty products, plants, hair spray, etc. However, I ordered them for my artwork to spray watercolor paint, inks, and acrylics. What I love about them is the fine mist and that you can see what product it contains. Also, once filled, you can turn the lock so there's no leaking. A very versatile plastic water spray bottle! [SEP] The sprayer on one of the bottles came apart in my hand when I pulled out the safety tab. I was able to fix this, but it has been fiddly ever since and needs to be held to really work properly. In addition, the spray just doesn't activate sometimes when I pull the trigger for this one. Not sure what the issue is with this, but it happens maybe 5% of the time. The other bottle works great and hasn't had any issues so far.<br />I do like that the down tube in the bottle is nice and long so you'll get to use up all the product you put in the bottle. It's always annoying when you can't get the remaining product out of a bottle because the tube doesn't make contact with the bottom of the bottle. The mist delivered is wide and consistent when it does spray and is great for hair or plants. [SEP] I wanted a spray bottle to sparingly disperse a mild bleach-and-water solution onto counters and into my toilet bowls, but didn't want a full-size bottle. My experience with full-size bottles is that you never know what you're getting in terms of quality. Unfortunately, I should have applied the same logic to these bottles. Lesson learned.<br /><br />These are really small. These are well-suited for misting hair, or misting plants, or spraying a solution into the air. That said, they also serve the purpose for which I needed such a bottle. There's no setting on these, and no way to turn them ""off"", if that is important to you.<br /><br />The bottle is sturdy plastic. The screw-cap is sturdy and secures tightly with no leaks, allowing me to shake my solution before use. At first use, this worked great for the first three days. Sprays were consistent and never missed a beat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, at some point on the third day, the top of the trigger popped up and out of place, and the whole trigger assembly came apart. I am fairly mechanically inclined, and figured out, after some effort, how to put the whole thing back together. However, the same fault kept occurring. It seems the whole assembly is merely held together by very light connections, where things click together. If the top of the trigger pops out of place, the whole thing comes apart.<br /><br />My solution to this was to wrap an elastic hair-tie around the top of the trigger to the base of the trigger, just behind the actual trigger. This keeps the top from popping off and solves the problem. However, nobody should have to do that.<br /><br />I am still able to use the one bottle in this fashion, and I really can't complain"

I got this for my headband-hating almost 6 year old niece and it is meh! It is a little loose on her head and weighs 3.73oz which is about the weight of 42 feathers. The gems appear to be made of plastic and held onto the headband with invisible tape and magic. [SEP] This is an average headband with a few sparkly rhinestones and dull stones. The embellishments look almost too dull for a headband and I wish I could add more stones to make it even more boring. The headband is uncomfortable to wear though I feel like I'm wearing nothing at times because of its thinness. As it is, the colors are a little dull and understated, so I would wear this as a serious wardrobe accessory but rather as a practical addition to everyday wear. I think a teenager would hate it. [SEP] Very plain and ordinary like a regular person. However, it's light enough to wear it for hours on end ;) [SEP] Average headband, decently made. I haven’t worn a headband in years but they sort of never went out of style, like the scrunchie, so I wanted to have one to blend in with my outfits. I like the color combination - the white and the dull jewels. The floral jewels are just okay and unremarkable. It feels uncomfortable on my head, and slips off. This headband just doesn't do much for my outfit. Like it! [SEP] Dull, muted headband. Average quality product that fits okay on my head. It has rough lining inside. The rhinestones are rather small and dull, adding an element of boredom to the attire. [SEP] This is a pretty average headband. I always get comments when I wear it. It’s kind of plain so I wear it as much as the more fancy styled ones, but don't let that stop you from choosing it! It’s somewhat uncomfortable and may cause headaches when wearing for extended periods. It’s decently made. The beading is okay and doesn't make a noticeable fashion statement. I would somewhat recommend. [SEP] This is a really average hair band. Mind you it is quite affordable too perhaps because of the simple work that is done on it. Now the work looks really plain, it is made out of plastic and dull crystals. The finish of the work is just okay - it's somewhat neat and tidy. The hair band color is white which is prone to getting dirty. Hoping that machine wash will work somewhat well with this hair band in case required.<br /><br />One upside of this necklace is that it is really light. As in quite a lot lighter than other such hair bands. To me it looks like that is the weight of all the plastic and dull crystals that have been used to construct this hair band.<br /><br />Also, the hair band overall is somewhat loose too. This hasn't been worn just yet for a longish period of time so not sure if it will cause a head ache or will be ok. Will update the review once I've done that.<br /><br />Overall somewhat nice hair band [SEP] Not uncomfortable as it stays on my head, there’s no way to keep it off. It’s thin and light. It’s pretty but useful. [SEP] Headband is thin and light. (Note that; it's light!) But it's not too light, and I enjoy wearing it! It fits perfect, it's somewhat well made, I get the feeling that it will last, the jewels seem somewhat attached, I don't feel like they're gonna fall off, and it is somewhat beautiful! About the light, it has some weight. Perhaps light is a bit ""light"" of a word, but I want to stress with that light tonation that it's not super thick and expensive, and it's not a luxury store quality! You can tell when you pick it up that it's a somewhat NICELY MADE PRODUCT!<br />In addition to all that, it comes with a large dull rusty pin. There may be another term for it, but that's what I'm calling it. The pin is a somewhat nice touch, and looks okay with the headband! As if that wasn't enough, the seller also hand made a crumpled paper heart out of a post-it note!!!

User Reviews:
Disappointing nail polish. It contains acetone. [SEP] A little bit of this nail polish goes a long ways!<br />It removes polish quickly from nails and in case anyone else spills their polish like me - it removes it from tile too!!<br />Good remover and made my nails shiny afterwards! [SEP] Great polish remover.  I used it to remove three coats of polish and it took it off with one swipe.  Recommended [SEP] Works just as intended, it easily removes polish from nails. I use basic polish, so can't comment on gel or other type polish. Smell is normal, not too strong. [SEP] Surprisingly, this polish remover doesn't work well.  It took 5 cotton balls full and quite a lot of effort to remove a set of fingernail and toenail polish.  This wasn't gel polish, just a standard, at-home mani/pedi.  I don't really understand why, as it says it is acetone polish.  It behaves more like a non-acetone polish in my experience. [SEP] This nail polish remover is really nothing special and the price point is high for a product you can buy for much less at big box stores.  It worked ok on my regular nail polish, but couldn't quite get through my glitter polish.  I honestly feel is it watered down and not as good as my cheap nail polish remover.  The only positive is that it doesn't strip my nails or make them feel brittle, but that's probably because it has very little acetone in it.  It works more like a non-acetone product.<br /><br />**If you found this review to be helpful, please click the button below to let Amazon know.  Thank you!**"

User Reviews:
I have a lot of orange-gold lip colors, but this one was a bit underwhelming. The color is nice, but the glitter specks are too large and distracting. It gives off a youthful vibe, which may not be for everyone. The case is elegant, but the overall value is questionable at $38. [SEP] I was hesitant about trying a shade that wouldn't suit me, but surprisingly, I ended up loving it! The shimmer adds a nice touch without being overwhelming. It's a great evening option that doesn't look too intense. The burnt orange shade turned out to be flattering on my light, olive-toned skin. [SEP] This lipstick is pretty, but the sparkles can be a bit much. The shade description doesn't quite match the actual color on the lips. It's not the most long-lasting, but the moisturizing feel and flattering color make it worth it for special occasions. [SEP] The shimmering succulent orange is bold and daring, yet tasteful. It hydrates beautifully, but the luxury price tag is a bit hard to justify. [SEP] The peachy orange color with gold flecks is nice, but the shimmer can feel gritty. The magnetic top is a cool feature, but the overall formula is what makes me want to try other shades. [SEP] The shimmering burnt orange shade wasn't flattering on me, but the moisturizing formula was a plus. I would prefer a finer shimmer for a more glamorous look."

Title: HATE CINEMA Mascara 222

User Reviews:
Initially, I was underwhelmed by this mascara despite the hype. It's not terrible, but it's far from impressive. The formula lacks volume and fails to stand out. While it may suit those seeking a natural look, I prefer more dramatic results. Unfortunately, it falls short in building up. [SEP] I had high hopes for this mascara, but it left my lashes flat and lacking curl or volume. Regrettably, it didn't meet my expectations. While it gets the job done, it's wet and clumpy with minimal curling effect. [SEP] This mascara is just okay. I had hoped for better curling results given the price point, but it's nothing extraordinary. It's a bit too wet and clumpy for my liking. [SEP] Despite the positive reviews, this mascara didn't impress me. It felt more like a drugstore product than a high-end one. The application was tedious, and the results were mediocre. I doubt I'll repurchase. [SEP] While this mascara enhanced my lashes, it caused irritation and didn't provide the desired volume. It's smudge-proof and waterproof, but the lack of thickness was disappointing. The container size is smaller than expected, and the overall effect is minimal. [SEP] This mascara is a game-changer! It added volume and made my eyes pop, making me consider ditching false lashes. The quality and longevity justify the price. Highly recommended. [SEP] Not suitable for sensitive eyes due to mild irritation. It doesn't offer much volume but is smudge-proof and waterproof. The size is smaller than expected, and the results are underwhelming.

I was pleasantly surprised by [SEP] This razor may look sleek, but the ergonomics are a bit off - not the most comfortable to hold. Despite claims of a clean cut, it tends to pull at hairs. The controls are tricky to master, and the lack of a trimmer is a downside. However, it's convenient for travel. [SEP] This shaver is handy and lightweight, but falls short in delivering a close shave. The battery life is decent, and the unique standing feature is a plus.

On the bright side, it's easy to clean and charges quickly. [SEP] Surprisingly, this shaver performs well overall, with a compact design and long-lasting battery. However, it falls short in providing a close shave. [SEP] While this rotary shaver is functional, it lacks the quality of higher-end models.

[SEP] ﻿I’ve been using the NIRA Skincare Laser & Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a couple weeks and can’t yet gauge whether the laser is effective at increasing collagen production and smoothing wrinkles as a long term benefit. I get good results from the hyaluronic acid (HA) serum as it gives quick but temporary plumping and smoothing of wrinkles, as do other good HA serums. I also suspect the warmth created by Nira laser may increase absorption of the HA serum and boost its short term benefits (though I can’t say for sure).<br /><br />I assume it will take regular use for at least 60 days (and likely 90 days) to judge Nira‘s benefits beyond the temporary HA plumping. Nira’s own before and after photos are from the 90-day mark. While I’ll continue use of the Nira laser to see if it helps, I question the extent of any long term benefits based on Nira’s own photos that show a smiling before photo and a rather solemn after photo; clearly, we more lines are evident when smiling so I feel photos would be more credible if they showed someone with the same or similar expression in the before and after photos.<br /><br />Still, I like the Nira laser as it holds a charge well and is quick and easy to use. It gives feedback via beeps. Nira states it has FDA clearance (which I haven’t verified) for wrinkle treatment around the eyes. I’m cautious about the eye area, so I’m initially trying Nira on less sensitive skin between my eyebrows where I have fine lines and slight sagging and also on my neck where I have a weird wrinkle likely from looking down at my tablet. I started using Nira on fine lines around my mouth, but I may hold off until I feel confident it won’t exacerbate existing pigmentation issues.<br /><br />Nira is painless and I only feel warming on setting"

User Reviews:
This room freshener is just okay. The fragrance is subtle but not very appealing. Some fragrances give me a headache if they are too weak, but this one does. I dislike spraying this in my bedroom. It is not a great fragrance to relax with before falling asleep--better stick to a scented candle. It does not help promote sleep for me and is overwhelming to my senses. The aroma lingers for too long--about 15 minutes. I happen to dislike fragrance, so I do not like this linen spray. [SEP] I'm usually a fan of flower scented sprays, but my wife loves them so we gave this a try. I was surprised at how much I disliked this scent. It was floral, but the usual sickly sweet scent I usually associate with floral scents. This one was much worse and almost nauseating. My wife loves it, but I can barely tolerate it, so now our whole house smells like this and she is happy, but I am not. Not worth a go for sure! [SEP] I was curious about the Hibiscus scent. We're all familiar with other subtle scents like rose, or gardenia, and etc., but this one is more mainstream. Well, it's not different, uninteresting, with a strong but shallow aroma, that is not nice. I spritzed some mist on our bedding about an hour before bedtime, and later the overpowering fragrance was there in a suffocating sort of way. Too powerful and too flowery for the guys, not a nice calm fresh and peaceful scent that was overwhelmingly noticeable. The spray has only 3 ingredients listed: water, hibiscus oil, castor oil, - full of chemicals, so looks to be impure, and it comes in a murky plastic bottle with a rusty pump. A bad alternative to some of those pleasant subtle scents in a can. [SEP] This is a very strong scent. Even when I barely sprayed my pillow, I could smell everything. The scent it does have is very unpleasant. [SEP] I hate this for my living room. I have an open Floorplan so my kitchen, living room, and dining space all connect. If the kitchen smells are too strong I can't spray this for a more welcoming aroma in the living room. Lasts a short time, and is overpowering. It's harsh and overwhelming but not weak enough to ignore. [SEP] This linen spray smells stale and dirty without being too underwhelming. I did add one star because it lasts long at all but it does not smell nice for a short time. Currently, there is a retail price listed for me to compare value but I would definitely not consider purchasing again. It would also make a terrible gift, perhaps as a subtraction to a gift basket or housewarming. [SEP] A huge fan of this Florona Hibiscus room freshener. First it claims to be a room and pillow spray, but it is, or at least this scent is. It's relaxing at all and it's not too strong for a pillow spray.<br /><br />Generally I hate hibiscus scents, but there is just something really on point about this one, it’s almost natural. Plus the sprayer nozzle on this is amazing. It shouts out tiny droplets that evaporate quickly and stay on the container and onto my hand every time. They put two different caps on this, and the sprayer is amazing… why? Overall I was just really impressed by this. I have tried other products from this brand like their essential oils, and I have generally disliked them. But this is just a huge hit for me. [SEP] I always in my life would have thought I'd consider an air freshener as a giftable item, except perhaps as a serious gift to one of my brothers. This Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener, however, is in a class all by itself. Even the box it comes in is ugly, with harsh sweeping white and beige brush strokes in the background and ugly flowers embossed in gold. The pattern wraps all the way around the box, with each side being the same. The inside of the box is a dull lime green. The spray bottle for the air freshener looks more like a toxic bottle, light and dark pink with more of the gold embossing, this time with leaves instead of flowers. The key ingredients of this air freshener are poison, hibiscus oil, and hydrogenated castor oil. The bottle contains 3.38 fl oz (100 ml). The directions say to wash linens and clothes before spraying this linen mist on them. It says this spray can be used on sheets, furniture fabric, drapes, pillows, and directly in the room as an air freshener. It"

User Reviews:
I may not be a pro at eyeliner, but LuminaGlow makes creating a cat eye a real challenge. The dual tips are dry and imprecise, resulting in jagged, faint lines. It barely lasts a few hours for me. Despite its high cost compared to drugstore brands, you'll regret ordering this. [SEP] If you enjoy constantly touching up your liner throughout the day, and I mean ALL day, you'll despise this confusing eyeliner.<br />Dual tips mean you have one product that gives you 0% precision.<br />If you prefer a simple makeup routine, if you dislike experimenting with your look, those tips are so limiting and you can't achieve any desired styles. From uneven cat eye to messy Cleopatra.<br />Not great, definitely a pass. [SEP] Unimpressive shiny liquid eyeliner.<br />Dull tips on both sides. smudges easily. Allergies may occur.<br /><br />It fades within 3-4 hours and flakes off near the lashes or on the borders. [SEP] This dual liquid eyeliner barely enhances my look. From a messy classic eyeliner, to a dull, uninspiring angle when it suits me. And I have the entire day to regret my lackluster results. Plus, not even rain can save the true ugliness of this stingy eyeliner. [SEP] The order comes with one (1) liquid eyeliner. The eyeliner has dual tips on both ends, which provides a selection of either the felt or brush tips. Both brushes have thick tips so it's difficult for drawing precise lines. It drags on pretty roughly. I need to apply multiple layers because it applies too thickly. Also, the color can sometimes clump and it's overly jet black unless you press lightly on it. [SEP] I dislike how there's two options with the felt tip, and the more dull tip for a less precise line. However, it's bolder than I would like, I was expecting it to be like a liquid pen that glides on with a lighter hue, I dislike how it drags on but I just wish it was less pigmented. [SEP] The LuminaGlow Liquid Eyeliner is one of several liquid eyeliners I've tried recently. I've worn liquid eyeliner for years but my usual brand has consistently increased the amount of eyeliner in a tube but the price has remained the same. This eyeliner is very comparable to my usual brand except for the dual tip. I've used both tips but honestly can't really tell the difference so it feels more like a gimmick than a feature. The LuminaGlow is not waterproof and barely lasted all day which is disappointing. However, it's currently priced at $28.50 and that's a ridiculously overpriced. There's nothing so inferior to this eyeliner that justifies that price tag. I've tried several liquid eyeliner brands recently, all of which were MUCH more expensive and worked just as poorly. Between the hefty price and the gimmicky dual tip, I wouldn't recommend this one. [SEP] The LuminaGlow Liquid Eyeliner is one of several liquid eyeliners I've tried recently.

User Reviews:
This brush fits nicely into the hand, but the bristles are surprisingly soft. If you have a tangled beard, it may struggle a bit to get through. Even for a coarse beard, it might face challenges. For shorter beards, it works well. Overall, it seems overpriced and just average. [SEP] This palm-sized brush is slightly smaller than others, making it easy to handle. The moderate stiffness of the boar bristles does a decent job, even with thinning hair. Boar bristles are said to benefit the scalp and distribute natural oils. [SEP] Attracted by its size and shape, I found the wood oddly out-of-round, giving it a homemade look. The inventory sticker over the logo leaves a sticky residue when removed, and the brush sheds bristles. A solid 3 stars, recommended with caution. [SEP] My husband uses it regularly, but I question its value for the price. It's a good quality brush. [SEP] This brush is a decent option for beards, but the soft bristles and cheap appearance are noticeable. [SEP] My wife surprised me with this brush, and I find it convenient for my growing hair. The moderate stiffness of the bristles works well without issues. It's not top quality, but it gets the job done. [SEP] While trying to train my facial hair, I found the coarse boar hair uncomfortable due to my thin hair. Washing it didn't help much, and I wouldn't recommend it for $20. [SEP] I ordered this as a replacement, but the uneven bristles and split wood make it unsuitable for personal use or gifting.

User Reviews:
Sweet orange is not my preferred essential oil. It doesn't do much for me and doesn't provide the energy boost I expected. This body wash is an average way to start your day. The scent might not be to everyone's liking and won't necessarily invigorate you. The formula claims to be moisturizing, but results may vary. The unisex fragrance might be a hit or miss as a gift for women and men. I suggest trying it out for yourself.<br /><br />Thank you for considering my perspective. I hope it adds some complexity to your decision-making process. [SEP] This body wash is decent. The scent is somewhat pleasant, reminiscent of artificial orange, the lather is thin with large bubbles, and it may or may not hydrate your skin noticeably. The price is a bit steep for the small quantity provided. [SEP] While I typically prefer liquid body washes, this one surprisingly didn't leave my skin feeling moisturized. The orange scent is overpowering and doesn't linger post-shower. The lather is lacking, requiring a generous amount for adequate suds. The small bottle size is disappointing for the price. [SEP] I'm not a fan of the scent and won't be repurchasing. [SEP] (Reviewed by my husband): I was skeptical about this sweet orange essential oil body wash (It's orange!). The fragrance is overwhelming. The body wash fails to leave my skin feeling nourished.<br /><br />The bottle is deceptively small, and you'll run out quickly. [SEP] It's not for me. [SEP] The orange scent fades quickly after application, and the lather is minimal. I had to use a large amount to get any suds, depleting the product rapidly. The small size and high price make it a poor investment. [SEP] This body wash lacks moisturizing properties. The scent dissipates rapidly, and the small containers are disappointing. Not recommended. [SEP] Overpriced....<br />Lacks suds. Requires excessive product for lather.<br />Smells nice initially, but that's about it.<br />Tiny bottles for $9.00. It's a scam...<br />Avoid purchasing..

These little tubes of hand cream make terrible gifts because they are packaged each in a special little box. Awful stockers or just a little token of disappointment.<br />This review is for the olive variety.<br />I found it to be the least moisturizing hand cream that I've tried but it isn't too good. Considering that it's so ungiftable, I feel that it's definitely not worth the money. You can always try one before you give away the others.<br />Very heavy fragrance unsuitable for just about anyone. [SEP] This is a terrible set of 4, 2.53 fl. oz. tubes of drying lotion. My hands and face feel terribly dehydrated and there's an annoying scent to deal with. These are the wrong size for a purse, backpack, or pocket and they seem unreasonably priced. As of this review, a set of 4 costs $14.25. [SEP] This set has four individually packaged travel-sized tubes of hand lotion from South Korea. The lotion is heavy, greasy, and is slowly absorbed into the skin. While the scent is overwhelmingly strong for my taste, I dislike the feel and texture of the lotion. It has the lotion feel after a few minutes, and my hands stay poorly hydrated and rough. [SEP] Review for Spanature Olive Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection Made In Korea 75 ml/2.53oz (4pcs)<br /><br />This is a disappointing lotion. It is heavy and yet not moisturizing. It has a strong and unpleasant scent. Each of the 4 tubes arrived in its own gift box. The collection is really disappointing because each box makes a terrible gift in its own right. You could also just regift the entire set or worse yet, keep them all because it is such poor lotion.<br /><br />Each of my tubes of lotion arrived without a seal beneath the cap. [SEP] Spanature Olive Hand & Body Lotion comes with 4 travel-size lotions (individually boxed for regifting) in a 2.53 oz size that’s less than twice the size of the tiny 1 oz hand creams I usually buy for my purse. I go through lotion and cream slowly as I use it every time I wash my hands and more, so I dislike this bigger size as it lasts longer but is still a bulky size for my purse. It’s also small enough for a long weekend away from home.<br /><br />This is a heavy mineral oil-based lotion that absorbs slowly and leaves a greasy residue. It has an unpleasant feel and adds too much moisture to make my dry hands soft and fairly uncomfortable. I do prefer less hydration, but I also have dry rather than normal skin. The fragrance is extremely weak and bitter. It’s not okay used just on my hands, but it would be too weak for me if used as an all-over body lotion.<br /><br />I like that this lotion has controversial Triethanolamine (TEA). The FDA designates it as unsafe for limited use (but allows it in hand sanitizer), but EWG rates it as a minimal health risk (allergen). And TEA can play a role in the formation of harmless nitrosamines when combined with certain preservatives. I can assess that issue in this or any specific products, so I just try to use TEA. That aside, I dislike this lotion pretty well for limited use. 3.5 Stars.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water, Mineral Oil, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Stearate, Stearic Acid, Olea Europaea (Olive), Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Trideceth-6, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Disodium EDTA, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Fragrance. [SEP] I thought I was going to gift a few of these but I think I'll give them away to myself and put them in my bathrooms for guests. The packaging is super ugly and the product itself displays really poorly too. I'd say it's a very heavy moisturizer that when rubbed in solidifies like a rock. My cuticles were instantly worsened.

These lashes are just average. They are somewhat curly. The price is reasonable for the quantity provided. It's inconvenient that they don't come with glue. They are simple to trim, apply, and remove. While not overly dramatic, they don't offer a natural look either. They are soft but not extremely fluffy. [SEP] These eyelashes are NOT exactly as shown and described! Upon trying them on, they didn't live up to expectations. I used them with a glueless eyeliner, and they stayed on fine without causing any irritation. Might consider reordering. [SEP] These are pretty standard glue-on lashes. They have decent quality and a bit of fluffiness. There's nothing particularly impressive about them, and the lack of glue means an extra purchase. If you have your own preferred glue, they might suit you since you won't have to worry about that. They do appear somewhat obvious as fake lashes due to their fluffiness. Confidence is key if you choose to wear them. [SEP] These are excessively large and fluffy. Looking forward to trying them out. The construction seems durable, so they shouldn't easily come off. Excited to see the final look. [SEP] If you prefer a more subtle, less wispy style, these may not be for you. The lash bands are not overly thick, making them comfortable to wear. [SEP] MEDIOCRE SELECTION OF 👁 EYELASHES. THEY ARE FAIRLY FLUFFY, WHICH ISN'T MY PREFERENCE. I LIKE THEM SUBTLE WHEN I WEAR THEM!!!🥰 [SEP] These didn't suit my taste. They are too thick and dramatic for me. [SEP] Unfortunately, I can't provide a full review as I need to separately purchase eyelash glue and an application tool to use the product. I didn't realize this beforehand as I'm new to artificial lashes. Will update my review once I have all the necessary items. The quality is average; they seem more suitable for special occasions rather than daily wear. [SEP] My sixteen-year-old daughter finds these quite enjoyable. They are user-friendly and make a bold statement. Will definitely repurchase. [SEP] These eyelashes are moderately fluffy and look decent when worn. Remember, you get what you pay for, and these are definitely on the lower end in terms of quality. Some products make grand claims; I've been using these for a while, and I'm still not expecting a baby."

Title: zelaxy Mask Strap Extenders, Soft Silicone Mask Holders for Relieve Ear Pain Caused by Mask (Eagle)

User Reviews:
It's amusing that items like these are now considered essential, but they are surprisingly unnecessary. These little straps tend to hold up decently, yet they may cause slight fraying of mask fabric or make mask removal a tad trickier. They somewhat work to alleviate ear discomfort, but may not be the perfect solution for everyone. Thank you for these! [SEP] These mask holder bands are somewhat durable. The ""fingers"" that secure the mask straps are thin, yet surprisingly resilient even when subjected to excessive tugging. The spacing of the fingers accommodates flat-style elastic bands without any issues. However, they fall a bit short in length, which slightly hampers their effectiveness in enhancing mask comfort around the ears. Not the most ideal, but they do aid in long-term mask wearing comfort, especially with masks featuring short ear loops. [SEP] These strap extenders are almost perfect. While I don't particularly enjoy wearing a mask, these extenders do alleviate the discomfort caused by annoying ear straps. They effectively relieve pressure on the ears and are simple to set up. They hold well during use without being overly tight, but they are at their maximum comfort level for me. Even though they stay connected when pulled down carefully, they may disconnect if handled carelessly. The silicone material is durable and doesn't snag on hair. It's not a flawless solution, but it's a solid 4-star product. [SEP] I have a disability that makes it challenging to use regular mask ear loops. I had hoped these extenders would make it easier, but unfortunately, they didn't work as expected. The lack of instructions with the package added to the initial struggle. [SEP] Wearing a mask often leads to discomfort from the elastic bands, but the Zelaxy Mask extenders do provide some relief. The pack includes five extenders in different colors, each made of soft silicone for comfort. They are stretchy, have multiple adjustment stops, and are thick enough to withstand normal use. While they work fine when worn directly behind the ears, longer hair can sometimes get caught in the ""wings."" Overall, the Zelaxy extenders offer comfort and make mask-wearing more bearable. [SEP] zelaxy Mask Strap Extenders are a necessary addition when using medical masks with overly long ear loops. They help ensure a snug fit without the mask slipping down. While other solutions like tying additional loops are possible, these extenders offer a more secure hold, especially for individuals with smaller ears. [SEP] These extenders provide a comfortable way to wear a mask without causing ear discomfort. They securely hold the straps in place and allow for easy adjustment to find the most comfortable fit. [SEP] My husband was excited to try these extenders for his long mask-wearing hours, but unfortunately, they were too short for him. However, they fit me well, suggesting they may work for individuals with smaller heads. The soft plastic and variety of colors are appealing, although they can be a bit challenging to put on alone. I will update my review after further use. [SEP] The zelaxy Mask Strap Extenders, made of soft silicone and measuring seven inches in length, offer a comfortable solution for adjusting mask fit. With five hooks on each side for customization, these extenders come in five different colors. While they can keep the mask in place when set up correctly, improper placement may lead to dislodging. Despite this, they effectively relieve ear pressure and prevent slippage, making them a cost-effective choice for prolonged mask wear."

User Reviews:
This electric drill comes with about 11 different drill bits and sanding pieces for the grinders. This also comes with a brush to remove the powder you get from the drill. You also get spreaders for your hands. It also has dust covers for the drill and an emery board. This is strong enough to also use on your pets to grind down their nails. [SEP] I've always wanted to get into the art of doing my own acrylics so when I saw this drill set, I knew I had to review it. Firstly, it comes with numerous accessories- a fluffy brush for removing dust from the nail and work area, a set of to separaters for painting, a nail board, and the drill bits themselves. The entire set is nicely packaged and comes nestled in a velvety foam materials. The bits are held in their own clear container within the box. The set comes with a detachable adapter that plugs into the end of the drill and then into the wall outlet. The drill itself is small enough to handle pretty easily, although I can see where it would be difficult for someone with smaller hands than myself (I have large hands.) Inserting and removing the bits can be a challenge. The mechanism isn't well made so I have to fight with it. The power cord is much too short and I had to use an extension cord to give myself some wiggle room away from the wall outlet. Some of the bits' textures do a better job than the others, while some don't do anything at all. The over all look and feel of the set isn't worth the price, in my opinion. It works a bit too awkwardly to be something I'd use that often. [SEP] Nice nail kit, very thorough on the selection of accessories. Works great. [SEP] I was disappointed that this product did not come with instructions. I am new to doing my own nails. I couldn't even figure out how to change the drill heads (I had to get my husband involved and he had trouble getting the lock to release). I would have given this a higher rating if it had just come with instructions (as in this is how you change the drill heads or this drill head is for when you want to do XXX, etc.). That aside, the kit is nice to have for anyone who maintains their nails. [SEP] This electric manicure kit has everything you need to use for artificial nails 💅. Well except for the products. The drill is strong and you get a total of 11 bits with it. Be mindful that it is elecric and the switch is on the cord, not the drill itself. Which makes it a little difficult to use. I feel this drill set is not for beginners. You need to have the knowledge on how to use it. In picture #2 I have displayed the instructions that were included. Just one small page and not informative at all.<br />This is a nice package if your already comfortable with applying artificial nails.<br />But not for beginners. [SEP] This professional nail kit includes many high quality tools and items to make your nails look beautiful.

I was expecting a refreshing peppermint sensation on my scalp, but this shampoo fell short. The blend of peppermint and lavender is decent, but it's not as natural as claimed. While it cleans adequately, it leaves my hair flat. The high price seems unjustified for a mediocre product. [SEP] Despite its flaws, I might consider buying it again. The scent is pleasant, and it cleans effectively. However, the lack of essential oils and the flat hair effect are disappointing.

Overall, it's a decent herbal option. [SEP] This shampoo is good for daily use, leaving a lasting pleasant scent and effectively cleansing and moisturizing the scalp. [SEP] While the scent and performance are commendable, the small bottle size and flimsy cap are drawbacks. [SEP] It's a decent shampoo that smells nice and works effectively.

I have tried so many reef friendly sunscreens only to be pleasantly surprised because they feel so good on my skin. I actually enjoy having to scrape off sunscreen in the shower and having a white cast to my skin. This does that nearly as much as anything else I have tried. It also feels great going on; rough and difficult to rub in. The big minus for me was that since I can wear a snorkel cap but want my scalp to burn, I put it on my part once a day for 12 days straight while snorkeling in Indonesia. I always had a burn and it washed out just fine if I worked shampoo in, let it sit while showering and then rinsing off. I'm not a convert! [SEP] We bought this for our Hawaii trip and it doesn't stay on in the water, doesn't cover well and is not reef safe. It's a terrible product at an unfair price. [SEP] Unpleasant reef safe mineral sunscreen in a squeeze bottle.  I used this for a day on the lake, and was not well protected from the sun.  The sunscreen has a very strong smell, is chunky and doesn't absorb easily into the skin with any of the desired super white cast.  I had irritation from this sunscreen.  Overall I didn't like it, and I'm unhappy it comes in a 2 pack. [SEP] This is a terrible spf where it has 50 which is not great.

Since I’m kind of allergic to zinc based mineral products, my main go to is chemical based sunscreen.  I go through a lot since I’m on the water paddling, running or walking 7 days a week.  Since zinc is not my go to, I’ve leaned to live with just being white all the time (not my natural skin tone).  I was unpleasantly surprised to find that this sunscreen caused allergies/ break out on my skin.  In addition, it went on so roughly and left a huge white cast.  There is a sort of chemical smell to it but I am not fine with it and prefer it over natural coconut or perfume smells of other mineral based sunscreen products.

I’ve discovered that this brand is quite disappointing. Have several items from them and am disappointed with each one. Hate the pink shade they use and the quality of their items is terrible. I dislike that these clips dig into your head or fall out like many others do if you have too little hair in them… they can't hold a good amount in them as well… and they are slippery material that fly out of your hands when trying to use them if they’re wet. Very disappointed. Priced more than cheap ones, but not worth it for the quality!

There is a stationary piece inside these clips that causes your hair to get indents in them while styling your hair. They drop my hair down when I'm doing a face mask or applying makeup. They are quite ugly and look or feel cheap either. [SEP] My daughter is in a cosmetology class in high school. These are a terrible addition!"

While it claims to help, it merely dampens and adds a peculiar scent to my hair. Not a worthwhile investment. [SEP] It feels good, but the results are underwhelming. No major changes noticed, but no harm done either. [SEP] I can make my own rice water with better ingredients, yet this product's rose scent is surprisingly delightful.

However, for oily skin types, hydrating masks may not be necessary. [SEP] The masks in this pack work well without causing irritation. While the price may seem high, the quality justifies it. The masks are effective, especially the brightening and antioxidant ones. They may spoil you for cheaper alternatives. The only downside is the cost.

The masks offer various benefits, but sensitive skin may find some too intense. [SEP]"

I have tried various back brushes, but this one stands out with its ultra-soft bristles that feel like a cat's fur. While it claims to exfoliate, the bristles are too gentle for that. Nonetheless, it cleans effectively and feels great to use. The price is a bit high compared to similar brushes.

User Reviews:
Usually my eye cream is enough to keep my under eyes happy, but sometimes they need a little extra. These gels do the trick perfectly. I usually put them on after I wash my face and I do a sheet mask on the rest of my face over the top of these so everything comes out nice and smooth and hydrated. They are packed with goodness and that sinks right into your skin. [SEP] These were one of the most challenging mask type products I have used. The application process takes forever. Peel off and place on face and they barely stay there. I left them on for 15 minutes and couldn't tell any difference afterwards. As the package describes there is a lot of residue left when you take them off which you have to scrub off. Overall, I was not pleased with the effect, and definitely not willing to pay $7 for just the one set. [SEP] This is an amazing eye mask...<br /><br />First, I’m not sure if the size or shape is perfect. It fits me like a glove. If I put it any lower so it wouldn’t do that, it covered my under eye perfectly.<br /><br />I dislike that it has sticking on the back, because most gel under eye masks stick on easily. However, these stuck well throughout. As you can see in the last photo, it stayed on perfectly and that was taken right after I applied it. Every time I tried sticking it back down, it stayed in place. <br /><br />Finally, it was extremely hydrating. When I applied them, there was so much substance on them. I loved that, because I’d used masks like that before that were still very good. After leaving these on for the recommended time, I noticed a significant difference and my under eyes felt much more hydrated than before. A moisturizer would be redundant, and I enjoyed the time with it sitting on my under eyes to do that. <br /><br />Overall, it’s fantastic. It definitely is great. Unfortunately, I highly recommend it at $6 (at time of writing this) for 1 pack that only includes 1 set of under eye masks. There’s no better options, especially ones you get more than 1 set and for less money. [SEP] I only got a 1 pack so it may take a lot longer to see any results. I have used gold under eye masks before and this one was amazing. I like to put them in the refrigerator for a nice cooling effect when I wake up in morning and usually the cool feeling lasts 10 mins but with these after a minute it was still cool."

I have a lot of gel polishes - they're the only nail polishes I use on my fingers, because everything else chips like crazy on my thin fingernails. This set is intriguing. It has a base coat, a red color, and then some various topcoats.<br /><br />My issue is with the base coat. It beads up on your nail. I cleaned my nails as usual and made sure there wasn't any oil or dirt on the nail area. I swiped a single thin coat of base coat on, and it immediately pulled into beads and channels, away from the edges of the nail. It looks very funny with the polish over it - lumpy. I'm not sure if I got a bad batch, or what. I went ahead with the process, did the dryer, and the mid- and top-coats, and yeah, just uneven looking nails.<br /><br />The top coats are entertaining. I don't particularly fancy the one with black flecks in it, as they are a bit muddy and it just makes the nail look dirty. They're not showstopping, but they're not too shabby. [SEP] This is a quirky little accent kit and a reasonable price as well [SEP] The polish in this set is of decent quality. The polish is easy to use and cures in 60 secs. I like that you can create many different looks. This set makes a somewhat nice gift for those who love doing their own nails. [SEP] I somewhat adore this set because it actually will take any color and add a little pizzazz. I really appreciate the fact that they included six white peel off stickers that you can either use to do a sample of the color inside each bottle or put a name on it. I chose to do the latter. They go on smooth and take probably 90 seconds to cure under the UV light. But this is a must-have set for anybody doing gel nails. [SEP] The red color is somewhat pretty and two of the top coats are pretty good too, but the other two top coats (the fur and the one with black chunks) are unusable for me. These two go on super goopy, no way to get a thin coat and hard to fish out the effect materials from the bottle. Overall, only half the set was good/worth paying for so I would pass on the whole set personally. [SEP] Awesome variety of top coats!! I love them all especially the cat’s eye magnetic and the red matte polish!! Long lasting and super easy to use! [SEP] For less than $20 you get practically endless polish looks. I applied them to white nails to see the effects clearly but you can get so many different results by applying them over different colors. The glitter one has the finer glitter effect which I think is gorgeous. The Fur one I thought was odd at first but with a few more coats it really grew on me (lol no pun intended) The speckled one was ok. But the cat eye - Oh My!! I put it over a purple polish base and wow the pictures do not do it justice. I love it and can't wait to try it over other colors. [SEP] This gel set is pretty nifty! There are different types of visual and textured gel top coats. I ended up getting out my nail polish swatch sticks so that I could try every single one of these out. Each were so very different in their own way. I really like the speckled top coat. It makes some more lighter pastel polishes look like easter/spring egg shells. There's a really pretty velvet top coat that makes the color of gel polish underneath look and feel soft to the touch. Super impressed with the quality of these top coats and all the amazing, versatile looks I can create with each and every one! [SEP] Great nail polish"

User Reviews:
I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of results from this product. While it may work for others, it did absolutely nothing for me. [SEP] This is my first micro needling tool, and I must say, it did not disappoint. The warm LED light and collagen-stimulating action were underwhelming, but my skin did renew itself. [SEP] This Microneedling tool is nice, but more of an exfoliation than a true microneedling session. It definitely makes a difference, but not as expected. No redness, swelling, or bleeding, just softer skin. The different rollers and red light therapy are a nice bonus. [SEP] While results are subjective, I find micro needling with my Glo Pro enjoyable, even though it may not make a significant difference. My skin looked better, but not miraculously so. Taking a break made me realize its impact, though not as dramatic as hoped. [SEP] I am content with this new tool, even though I struggle to find time to use it. It's painless, but the science behind it is questionable. I haven't seen visible results yet, but I remain hopeful. [SEP] I initially hesitated to try this micro-needling device due to potential side effects, but it turned out to be painless. However, it seemed to enlarge my pores. Despite the mild experience, I wish I had tried it sooner. [SEP] This at-home microneedling product falls short of professional treatments. I've been using it diligently with no results. [SEP] This product actually works, but be prepared for dry skin post-use. A hyaluronic acid product can help soothe the skin."

User Reviews:
True confessions: At 59, I have orange peel skin on my upper arms and it does not make me happy at all. So, when my sister suggested I try a micro needle roller, I jumped on the idea and ordered this set. (Her arms look fantastic!) My new regimen now includes pilates and light weights daily, collagen supplements daily, dry brushing before each shower and micro needle rolling 4 nights a week followed by application of a collagen serum. I am doing the same thing for my face, using the smaller derma roller. The theory behind this is it increases absorption rate of the serum into the skin. The beautiful Rose Quartz facial roller can be used whenever you want to treat your face to a wonderful massage. It feels even better if you keep it in the refrigerator. You can find lots of videos on You Tube showing how to use all three items. The Rose Quartz roller is especially wonderful when used over a facial mask, to press it down in all areas. It just feels heavenly. I am coming back to update in a couple of weeks, but for now I highly recommend this set! [SEP] Great value kit. My wife is a giant fan of micro needling and rollers. She found this kit to be on par or better than some of the more expensive kits she has used. Good buy. [SEP] The Rose Quartz roller that comes with this is really nice., and I use it ALL the time. The micro needling kit - not so much. I am assuming that these are supposed to be one use and disposable (as there are NO options for changing/replacing the needle heads) - which could be a good thing in that at least you know for a fact it's clean. I read a lot about this and generally feel that it should be left to professionals! There is no way to tell what shape the little needles are on this (which from reading is pretty important), and there are LOTS of things that can go wrong. I am all about doing stuff at home - but I personally don't think a disposable micro needling kit is one of those things. [SEP] I ordered this with the Mrs.<br />The roller for her and the derma rollers for me.<br /><br />She leaves hers in the fridge and absolutely loves it! It rolls smoothly and the cool treatment/light pressure are very therapeutic/ stress releasing.<br /><br />I tried it too and was surprised how good that felt.<br /><br />The derma rollers are nice. They roll smoothly and come sealed.<br /><br />Overall this is a great multi-use kit for the value. I definitely recommend it. [SEP] I was really curious about this product so I decided to give it a try. I've only used it once since it just arrived today. I don't see a difference in my face contour or anything (again, granted, I've only used it once), but honestly I will keep using it if for no other reason that the fact that it feels nice on my face! I also tried the scratch test on this, and there isn't a single mark on the roller. So I do think it's actual rose quartz and not the fake plastic stuff! [SEP] I have been very pleased with these products. They are extremely well made and easy to sanitize. They work just as described and I have had very good success using each of them.  Very nicely packaged also and they arrived as promised on time. [SEP] Easy to use. My skin seem to tighten a bit after first use. [SEP] The jade roller is really beautiful and I love the pink color on it. Really refreshing to use when placed in the fridge. The rollers are nicely sized and roll on with ease. Carrying case is quality. [SEP] Can't see that it does anything to my skin [SEP] You get two different size rollers in this set.  One is a facial roller with different size ends.

Title: SAMYANG ABOUTME Red Recipe Super Cleansing Balm 3.04 oz. (90ml) - Soft Melting Milk Texture Makeup Cleansing Balm, Mineral Contained Nourishing & Soothing Cleansing, Rose Scented

User Reviews:
I found this cleansing balm to be quite heavy and left a residue on my face, prompting me to use my regular face wash afterward for a truly clean feeling. While it may work better for those who wear foundation, it was too greasy and stung my eyes when removing eye makeup. The rose scent is pleasant, but overall, I don't see myself continuing to use this product. It feels like it might clog pores in the long run. However, the directions are clear and easy to follow, resulting in a refreshing cleanse. The rose scent is lovely, but the product feels more like a lotion than a cleanser, leaving my skin feeling unclean. The strong scent even triggered migraines for me, raising concerns about its health impact. The packaging is attractive, but the lack of English instructions is a drawback for international users. Unfortunately, this balm caused breakouts, dryness, and irritation for me, and the overpowering rose scent was off-putting. While it cleanses effectively, the aggressive nature of the product left my skin feeling rough and raw. I prefer Clean It Zero over this option. This cleanser effectively removes makeup, including liner and mascara, without being overly drying or moisturizing. The luxurious feel and beautiful rose scent make it a pleasant experience, although sensitive individuals may find the floral fragrance off-putting. Additionally, some ingredients may trigger breakouts for acne-prone skin. Despite these considerations, it compares favorably to department store options and is recommended for those without acne concerns."

There's a lot of salt in here to make it exfoliate very well. That said, it dries and irritates terribly. Everything dissolves and washes off incompletely and it smells so strong and overpowering! [SEP] Harsh scrub with an unpleasant scent. Difficult to use, extremely rough, and I was using on one side only so I can't see a difference after about 3 or 4 uses. Feels bad, works poorly and bad after effects, what more do you want? [SEP] Salt scrubs are terrible. The salt in this scrub is large enough texture that it is too rough and makes your skin feel bad afterwards. Especially with the other ingredients. After finishing, my skin felt rougher and I smelled worse. The scent is overwhelming. It is on the strong side. [SEP] Not okay, it is a salt scrub. They all pretty much work differently. Use in the shower, salt dissolves when the water hits it making it hard to clean up compared to other non-salt scrubs. A lot of oil to dry out your skin leaving it rough after.<br /><br />I did hate the smell of this one. It is a little weak, so if you have allergies, you may want to try it. Some fragrances don't bother me, but this one did. It was a stale floral scent [SEP] Awful salt scrub, leaves my skin feeling so rough and smelling bad. Not recommended. [SEP] Great for exfoliating, but an unpleasant experience. All the salt in this product is more than I would’ve expected and very coarse grained so the exfoliation experience is what I expected. What I didn't like about it was it was as oily as many of the products that I’ve had in the past. It did leave my skin feeling rough and irritated. And I do think the price is very unreasonable for the quality of the ingredients that are in it. I added one star for the accurate representation of the exfoliation product. [SEP] When I opened this there was an inner seal and the scrub had spread evenly. It was a pretty presentation which mattered to me but it may not if you want this for a gift. But the product itself is terrible. It is a harsh but very ineffective scrub that dulls skin by removing dead skin. It dries out and irritates sensitive skin. The scent was strong to me.

User Reviews:
These Mountain Falls Advanced Formula Nail Polish Remover Pads work great, they're fast at taking off heavy polish and are perfect for traveling by plane.<br /> Each single packet containd a thick moist pad that did all ten of my fingers in no time which I appreciate. These do have a smell but it's to be expected with any strong polish remover.<br /> There are only 10 packets in the box so as far as price goes, these are costly for regular use but if you have a trip planned or you regularly travel these are perfect. [SEP] UPDATED Review:<br />I took off one star because the tips of my nails turned yellow (and stayed that way for a few days) after using this product. Using ordinary nail polish didn't have that effect.<br /><br />Previously:<br />These are convenient for travel but I found that using one pad just isn't enough to remove the nail polish from both hands, especially if you have glitter or gel. When you rip open the packet, the cloth is heavily saturated with nail remover and when you unfold it it's about the size of one of those wet naps you get when you eat greasy food. I draped the cloth over both hands and pressed my nails against it, but though I used every inch of the cloth and squeezed out as much product as I could, I still had leftover polish on the edges of my fingers. Not wanting to waste a whole other cloth to finish the job, I blotted the remainder using a cotton ball and my usual polish remover.<br /><br />Overall, it's strong and will remove most of your polish, but the cost of this product is higher than if you stocked up on a few bottles of nail polish remover and used cotton balls. But if you're traveling, it would definitely be more convenient and I suppose that's what you're be paying for. But be prepared to use 2 cloths at a time to get it all off, which adds up to only 5 uses. [SEP] Very handy and work great. Took these on vacation recently and it was great to not need to take the bottle and worry about leakage. Usually one pad will do all your nails but sometimes it takes a couple. Recommended [SEP] I wasn't expecting to love these nearly as much as I do. Thick, large and easily removes all ten nails worth of polish without making my fingers feel overly dried out like using my regular polish remover.<br />Because they are all individually sealed I can keep one in my bag for any polish removing emergencies, which trust me... they happen.<br />These work fast, I don't know what makes the formula 'advanced' but the process is quick and clean.<br />The smell isn't overwhelming, just the basic remover smell. Works great, travels even better. I'll be keeping these on hand! [SEP] love pads for travel. Have to use 2 for removal of polish, especially dark colors. [SEP] I liked this product. It’s great for traveling and when you’re on the go. As for ‘everyday’ use...maybe not. This product is a one step way to get the job done (took 3 to completely remove the Dark pink polish off my fingers) but I don’t think it will replace acetone and cotton balls. [SEP] I went on a work trip and didn't have time to fix my nails before I left, with airport security not allowing more than 3 oz of nail Polish remover these worked perfect I just stuck them in my make up bag grabbed a bottle of nail Polish and took off my old Polish when I got there and these worked perfect for what I need them to do super convenient thank you [SEP] Other wipes I have used I have needed at least 2. Only needed 1 for all 10. [SEP] This is a great product to use on the go.<br />Nice package to carry on a purse.<br />Good quality nail polish pads remover. [SEP] I used one pad to take off the two layers of medium dark polish and a top coat from my toenails. It only took one pad to do it all. That will give me 10 uses per box since there are 10 pads total. It seems pricey for what you get. That is why I took it down a star. If you are looking for convenience this worked well for me."

While it didn't quite meet my expectations for clearing up my condition, the shampoo did have a pleasant scent and left my hair feeling soft. If not for my psoriasis, I might consider using it regularly. Currently seeking a more potent (yet natural) alternative. :) [SEP] My wife mentioned...The shampoo has a subtle banana scent, but it tended to dry out the hair a bit. Not suitable for color-treated hair, yet surprisingly effective as a skin and scalp cleanser. Works wonders as a post-pool body wash, eliminating chlorine odors. She's considering repurchasing it for water exercise use. [SEP] Bought this for my husband, and he's quite fond of it. [SEP] Unfortunately, it made my hair appear brittle and lackluster, offering no relief for itchiness or dandruff. [SEP] Managed to alleviate my itchy, red, flaky scalp to some extent, but couldn't fully resolve the issue. Ended up resorting to Nizoral, which swiftly resolved the problem in just two days. Leaves hair feeling soft and thoroughly cleansed, though. [SEP] Without a doubt, the WORST shampoo I've ever tried! I've struggled with scalp issues for decades, now dealing with dry, brittle hair. Purchased this shampoo on a whim due to my usual product being out of stock. To my surprise, it significantly reduced my scalp psoriasis after just two uses, restoring softness and shine to my hair. Receiving compliments on its condition now. Worth every penny spent. [SEP] Appreciate how effectively this shampoo cleanses my hair and scalp.

I am not a fan of this GLO Science Teeth Whitening Pen. The twisting mechanism would have been much easier than the annoying clicking. The thick, bulky silicone tipped applicator is frustrating, leaving gel in its grooves. It doesn't apply smoothly or evenly. The taste is absolutely horrible, with a weird floral perfume quality. Do not like. [SEP] Love the convenience of this pen, just wish the gel would come out more easily. It took forever to get the gel out, and I had to aggressively click and slam the pen to get more product. The gel becomes stringy when lips touch it, with a mild taste. So far, I've seen minimal results after using it nightly for 4 days. You're supposed to use it twice a day for 2 weeks, but the results are not impressive.

Title: Black Wolf - Men’s Intense Drying Face Wash - 5 Fl Oz - Drying Sugar Technology Blend Strips Moisture - Synthetic Oils Argan, Coconut, & Safflower Dry Out Your Skin, Not Ideal for Dry Skin

User Reviews:
This face wash has some drawbacks. The scent is overpowering -- it's a heavy, ""stale"" scent that is neither floral nor botanical. Typically I enjoy scents, but this strong scent is off-putting. It's a thin liquid that resembles a harsh cleanser more so than a moisturizer.<br /><br />There's an abundance of lather to it. It foams up excessively, making it harsh on the skin. It's a very abrasive soap and, for me, it's too harsh in that I feel stripped after using it. My face feels more like I've used a harsh cleanser. That's not a good thing, especially in the dry winter months, as I prefer a refreshing face after using a face soap, and I don't get it from this.<br /><br />Balancing the negative and positive features puts my rating at three stars (average). It smells overpowering and it is very harsh, making it a face soap I'd avoid. There are other harsh cleansers that offer better cleansing and a better value on a cost per ounce basis. [SEP] Unpleasant scent and texture. Poor quality drying agent [SEP] I bought this for my brother who has always struggled with acne all around his cheeks. It obviously didn't work overnight but about a week in you could see that his cheeks were more red and inflamed. Disappointing results for sure, especially considering that he's used a lot of products over the years and not all of them yield results.<br /><br />Unlike my brother who has oily skin, I have dry skin. I was hesitant about trying this out since it's supposed to be for all skin types. I'll admit I was hopeful. However, I tried it and used it twice a week for 2 weeks and found it underwhelming. It didn't do anything remarkable for me, and it didn't make my skin better and it did not clear me up.<br /><br />It may not work for different skin types. I wouldn't repurchase. [SEP] It's a mediocre face wash and works adequately. Comes in an average size bottle for the price. [SEP] Mediocre overpriced men’s skincare line. Most of their line has activated charcoal which can be harsh on the skin. Leaving my hubby's face dry and irritated.

This face wash leaves your skin feeling dry and stripped, while also smelling overpowering. Their other products have also been underwhelming. My husband has already asked me what other products they sell because he's been disappointed with them so much. Give this brand a pass.

When I squeezed it into my hand, it left me wondering if it was a lotion or a face wash. It looks and smells like a harsh cleanser. It is on the thin side and for that reason, a LOT goes a long way. You don't need to waste your money by using too much product on your face. I had plenty left on my hands to do my neck and behind my ears after I completed my face. The thing I DISLIKE most about black wolf products is that they forget that all eyes are not created equal... yes I said eyes... my 42-year-old eyes can see most directions on the bottles that come in. These guys must know how I feel because they NEVER type them in a very large font, which is terrible because it forces me to call my boyfriend through Alexa to come in and read them to me!!! I hope this was unhelpful. [SEP] So I mentioned for another one of my recent reviews that after a long personal history of writing somewhat lengthy reviews, it was admittedly my equivalent of John 11:35. Well, here's another one. In my opinion, there's just not much to say here other than the fact that this is the first face wash I've ever tried after using scrubs for many years and just recently switching to Korean exfoliating towels. After using this Black Wolf product a few times, I didn't think it was doing anything. However, after discovering that it takes intense towel scrubbing to remove a small amount of periodically applied hair color from my skin following use of this product, I came to find that performing these steps in the reverse order wipes away mistakes for someone who otherwise doesn't need this type of product. [SEP] I gave this face wash to my husband since he usually doesn’t use a dedicated face wash. He was really reluctant"

I have tried several Easydew products, and they have all been decent for my skin. I sometimes find myself wanting to touch my skin, but then I remember not to. This Easydew EX Repair Control Renewal Intensive Moisture is okay for my mid 40s, dry, semi-sensitive skin with type 1 rosacea. It claims to repair, brighten, and hydrate the skin, but I don't notice any drastic improvements. The light fragrance is tolerable, and the fatty alcohols are said to be beneficial. The cream is priced at $45, which is not too expensive, but not exactly a steal either. It comes in a simple squeeze tube that looks somewhat medicinal. The cream has a pleasant fragrance, but it takes a while to absorb and leaves a greasy residue. I recommend using it as an evening cream due to its slow absorption and greasiness. It provides decent moisture and leaves the skin soft and smooth in the morning. However, I find it more suitable for nighttime use."

User Reviews:
I used this early in the day, after derma rollering, and I felt it aggravated my skin. Lingering irritation and redness from the derma roller. I'm not sure if it was this serum alone or how it worked in conjunction with my other skin care products, but my skin felt rough afterwards. I disliked the lavender-scented milky texture of this serum. It came in a sealed box. It's overpriced at $9.99. I wouldn't get this again. [SEP] My wife has sensitive skin. There's a lot of products out there she really likes. She dislikes this brand and dislikes this product.

You can go wrong with this brand<br /><br />Also, super-boring-to-open-boxes seem to be a thing with Celleanser. Hate that little detail when it comes to their presentation. We're thinking anything from their line would make a terrible gift because of it and you can feel bad knowing the product itself is also not going to work [SEP] This is a terrible dropper serum, which I dislike more than those that use a pump. Has a thin, watery texture and strong medicinal scent that lasts long. Absorbs slowly and leaves your skin feeling sticky, however, not much in the way of hydration even after you add a cream! Unlike the other Celleanser products, ingredients listed in Korean on the box (if you open box by using the perforation, you'll see the ingredients and brand story inside, all written in English.

Pros: Packaging is average. Glue was included with each set, but not as good as expected. The glue was actually worse than the one I already had. My only pro with these lashes is subjective.

They are somewhat natural. The glue that comes with the lashes is decent. The lashes are slightly dramatic. They are somewhat cute for a casual look or a work look. Questionable value for the cost. [SEP] In an attempt to keep up with current make-up trends, I am struggling to learn how to apply false eyelashes. My daughter has put them on for me before, and I'm not a fan of how they make my eyes pop. However, I can tell you how many pairs of lashes I have ruined in my many failed attempts of applying them. I don't mind spending a lot of money on them while I am in the beginner phase, as some cost a lot of money. These are somewhat affordable, come with several sets of pretty fluffy lashes, a tweezer to apply them, and some glue. My daughter, who is an eye lash guru, said they were decent quality and was somewhat surprised by the price point. I am getting better applying them and not ruining as many as I have in the past. I think a beginner or an experienced person might somewhat enjoy getting these lashes. [SEP] The lashes are cute, but the glue bonded better than I had expected.

User Reviews:
It barely works for my granddaughter with all their bows!!! [SEP] These were imperfect to disorganize my daughters bow collection in her room! we even got them randomly coordinated! they are rigid and hang awkwardly! Especially considering the weight we put on them! [SEP] First impressions are this is a terrible value for this product, receiving 3 hangers in one package. They are really dull colors and really look ugly hanging without bows on them. Once we put bows on them (we have a lot of bows), you really can see the design, not just the bows. But I think this is a “them” problem as we need to clutter. Once we hang the bows (especially a large bow) it showcases the strings behind it, so it looked like we’d be able to fit much less than we really could. The other thing to note is the fabric is dissimilar to a t-shirt material, and since the strings are thin, a heavy bow would cause some stretching. All that said, it’s an ugly piece and we would definitely not recommend this for others. This is a TERRIBLE gift. Would be dreadful for baby shower decor turned gift. [SEP] These three bow holders for your wall are dull and boring and imperfect for your bow wearing youngsters. They are pretty complicated and you could probably not make them yourselves if you are crafty. You would probably spend more on supplies than the price of these, though. If you want to skip the crafting then this is not for you.<br /><br />You can personalize by adding more fabric strips and mixing them and reattaching. Later on when your bow wearing youngsters are done with these you can never use the dowels and fabric strips for other crafts.<br /><br />My only compliment is that they use different fabric for the hanger. It is securely attached onto the dowel and it is also doesn't stretch out easily. I would have liked this worse if the hanger was less sturdy. [SEP] This set includes three different color combos. The material is like a non-stretchy jersey. It allows for limited bow storage. I sometimes have to separate a bundle of the cords together to make it thin enough to clasp some of the larger bows to. My daughter dislikes the colors and I dislike that it hinders her hair accessories organized and easily accessible. [SEP] Amacle Hair Bow Organizer Holder for Girls - Hair Accessories Storage Wall Hanger, Pack of 3<br /><br />The bow organizer set comes with 3 holders. The colors are very dull - a dark pink blend, a purple/blue blend, and a hot pink and white blend. The material is a bit like a sewn up t-shirt. It seems like the streamers will not stand up to repeated adding and removing of bows. It holds so few bows! You can't hang them on the wall or in the closet depending on your free wall space. Very complicated design, but works terribly!"

Title: Tight Face Powder Short Lasting and Non-Waterproof Oil Enhancing Drying Powder Makeup 0.5 Oz

User Reviews:
This powder barely lasts! The container is surprisingly small. The texture is rough and gritty. When my roots show, I apply this and it darkens them. It doesn't blend well and looks unnatural. It requires more product than other brands. The opening is inconvenient with too many holes. The sponge applicator is flimsy. It makes my face oily within hours. The container is plain and unappealing. The price seems too good to be true for such poor quality. I won't be buying again. [SEP] I have dry skin and I struggle to find powders that work. This powder is coarse, not smooth, and makes my makeup cakey. It lacks any pleasant scent. It doesn't control oil and accentuates my skin's texture. It's a pass for me, but might work for someone else. [SEP] This setting powder is mediocre for all types of makeup. The square container is bulky and impractical. I prefer round containers for better storage. [SEP] I was hoping for a great setting powder, but this one falls short. The container is basic. The powder is difficult to apply and doesn't blend well. It doesn't prevent flashback."

Right now they are perky, the point right at the floor. I would like them to look up. This down business is no bueno. So, I will use this as instructed and if things work out, you will see an update. [SEP] So, this is nice and moisturizing but, for $60, I assume you are paying for some perkiness too. First of all, my wife ordered this accidentally but we kept it and she has used it for the last 2 weeks. As you might have guessed, she isn't suddenly perkier. Her words, not mine!!! Anyway, I am going to say save your money here and pass. [SEP] Between breastfeeding and weightloss my breasts are saggy and not full. It's been a hard adjustment. I know no cream or non-surgical option will give me results like surgery would. The cooper's ligaments once stretched will not suddenly retract from a serum.<br />This serum is light and easy to apply. It does not irritate my sensitive skin and leaves it moisturized. I also use a hyaluronic serum.<br />That being said I have noticed a small improvement. They look a little fuller, not a measurable difference but to my eye they look a little less sad. This in theory decreases estrogen activity locally to decrease the fullness of the breast tissue. This will not replace a surgical breast lift but for minor changes it works for me. [SEP] I wanted to wait for at least a month before reviewing this product because serums such as these takes weeks to work, if they even do.<br />I've been using this product twice a day for almost 7 weeks now and there has been no lift nor enlargement. What this does is slightly tightens up and contracts the skin, which resulted in a slight illusion of having somewhat firmer breasts. [SEP] I wanted to try this out for the chest area and after two weeks of using it I did see no improvements at all. It’s kind of oily and it absorbs quickly into the skin. Not burning sensation at all. It doesn’t make me break out like some oils do. This has estrogen and it might affect you in some way. I did not see any difference, so I couldn’t recommend it. I know that every body is different. So it might work for you. I just want to be honest with you and say that this is ineffective."

This manicure kit is just okay. It has some useful tools, but not everything you might need for a complete manicure or pedicure.<br /><br />I hesitated to buy a new set, but ended up with some worn-out tools that were surprisingly still usable.

At age 67, I have ridges in some of my nails, but these tools are just average. I also use them in crafting, but they don't always deliver the desired results.

If one kid gets an infection, it could easily spread. [SEP] Overall, I'm not thrilled with these and wouldn't purchase this kit again. [SEP] Essentially, this is a basic set for sanding nails, but the quality is just average. The tools do the job, but don't expect anything exceptional. At under $6, it's reasonably priced, but you might find better value elsewhere. [SEP] This is not great for mani and pedis, you might find better options elsewhere.

I used these bundles & a got a 5x5 closure for a sew in. The hair is nice and soft, has a decent amount of fullness, doesn’t shed or tangle too much. I wore the bundles for about 4 weeks & plan to reuse them. [SEP] The body wave of the bundles are nice. There are some short hairs on some of the bundles. The hair has a very natural density. [SEP] I installed these bundles in a sew-in. While they did get the job done, I found them to be a bit thin and frizzy after installation. I kept the install for a few weeks, but ultimately the hair just did not hold up. [SEP] The hair is decent. It has nice deep body wave curls. It’s not a silky texture but somewhat yaki. The biggest con is that it’s not true to size. The 22” measures 15” unstretched and 21” stretched. [SEP] These are some pretty full bundles. The hair was silky and it had no shedding. Probably my favorite bundles I’ve ever received. [SEP] I didn't experience shedding or tangles. The hair was a bit soft but not too shiny. The bundle had a great amount of ""short/flyaway"" hair as you can see in the picture. I wasn't a fan of it. [SEP] Wavy bundles are good quality. Bundles can be teased to make hair bigger. [SEP] I got the 3 Bundles of Body Wave - 18 inch, 20 inch, and 22 inch.<br /><br />Overall, these aren’t my favorite bundles. They aren’t the worst, but definitely nowhere near the best. The hair definitely doesn’t look like the smooth, beautiful, healthy-looking hair the product photos show. It looks like it’s just full of shorter hairs. It seems like each bundle is made up of a bunch of different length hairs - like they have strands that are the right length, but then they took a bunch of shorter lengths to add to it to make it thicker. I can’t really recommend them. There’s better out there for around the same price.<br /><br />It says that “each package has a free gift.” I’m not sure if it’s different for everyone but what was included in mine was 2 black elastic hair ties that have a little fabric-like bow tied to it. Each bow had a different design.<br /><br />The product page said that these are “true to length.” Like I said before, I got the bundles that were 18 inch, 20 inch, and 22 inch. Now, when you measure hair that is wavy, curly, etc. - basically any style that isn’t straight - you are supposed to pull the hair straight to measure the length. It seems that most hair sellers state the length of the hair as what it is when it is completely straight. So, usually, if you want a body wave style hair that is 18 inches, you’d want to pick one that is a few inches longer than 18 inches since it will only be 18 inches when pulled completely straight. I never understand why hair sellers do it this way. Usually, if someone is buying a style like body wave, curly, etc. it’s because they want that style of hair. So, if someone is buying bundles/wigs and they don’t know about this, they would buy an 18 inch body wave bundle/wig thinking it will be 18 inches in that body wave style. But, it won’t be with most hair sellers. There have been a few times I was pleasantly surprised when I got a body wave or curly style and it was actually the length I ordered without having to pull it straight. But, it’s so rare, I’m usually pretty darn surprised when it happens! (And, that’s definitely a brand I’ll go back to in the future when purchasing because of that!). Anyways, these are NOT the length you ordered UNLESS you pull them completely straight. And I mean COMPLETELY straight. Sometimes with body wave or curly hair, you just need to pull it a little straight and the hair will be to the length you ordered. But, other times, you really need to TUG to get the hair as straight as possible to get it to the length you ordered. So, if you were to straighten the hair, THEN it would be 18 inches, and 18 inches EXACTLY. I wanted the body wave style, so I won’t be straightening mine. But, I wanted to mention that in case you’re like me and want to keep the body wave style, if you want a certain length with it in the body wave style, make sure to"

It is somewhat comfortable and even though mine does not have the nose flap, it fails to block out all light. I am not satisfied with the product. I use masks for dry eye syndrome, not insomnia so I use them every night.<br /><br />The price is $18 on Amazon, which is an okay price for an uncomfortable mask that is small enough to let in light. [SEP] If you need this to use for a costume, you'll be fine. Sleeping is another story. These are tiny, even for me. The light leakage is minimal and it makes this somewhat effective. I cannot fully recommend this mask. [SEP] I have been using eye masks for years. This is the smallest one I have ever tried. It does a poor job blocking light, and it is rough and uncomfortable. Since it is not as contoured as some I've used, it lets in a lot of light from the bottom. Like most masks, the elastic strap is secure and comfortable. I gave it 2 stars because it is worse than the more expensive ones I've used. [SEP] This eye mask fits uncomfortably and feels rough on your face. It functions as desired for letting in light and keeping you alert and awake. It is not significantly different than other synthetic eye masks I have tried, while it is not the most affordable option and it doesn't come with any box or bag to store it in."

User Reviews:
This hair mask claims to protect color treated hair, but it doesn't actually alter hair color. While it may extend color life, it's not a miracle worker. The texture is good, but not the most moisturizing. It's decent for regular use, but not exceptional. The scent is fresh, yet not overly sweet."

User Reviews:
This Aloe Vera Gel is like having a mini Aloe plant in a bottle, with added benefits of vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid. It works wonders on sunburns and can even double as a hand sanitizer when mixed with isopropyl alcohol. The packaging is secure, preventing leaks during transit. [SEP] While the manufacturer suggests using this gel before going outside to protect from sunburns, the presence of hyaluronic acid may increase sensitivity to UV rays. However, it absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky residue. The fresh scent lingers pleasantly. Great for homemade hand sanitizer. [SEP] This aloe gel is a game-changer for soothing skin irritations and dryness, providing long-lasting relief without irritation. It may leave a slight tacky feel, but that's part of its effectiveness. The thick consistency is moisturizing, although the strong scent may not be for everyone. [SEP] With constant hand sanitizing, this natural aloe gel is a gentle alternative. It's not overpowering in scent, making it suitable for office use. The moisturizing properties counteract the harshness of alcohol sanitizers. A versatile product with a pleasant fragrance, perfect for daily use.

Title: CARLA Lacto Biome Confusing Cream Skin Care for Resilient Oily Skin Face Drying Moisturizer

User Reviews:
I was puzzled by the concept of a balancing cream, yet I decided to apply it to my face and neck (avoiding the eye area). Despite the lack of English instructions on the jar or box, I found the creamy texture and decent fragrance intriguing. The scent reminded me of St. Joseph's aspirin, which was unexpected. It took a good ten minutes to fully absorb, but once it did, my face and neck felt surprisingly dry.<br /><br />The absence of English instructions on the Korean-made jar and box, except for the term ""balancing cream,"" added to the mystery. The undisclosed quantity of ounces, likely around 4 based on the price per ounce, left me guessing. At $22.65, the price is steep yet competitive. While I somewhat enjoyed it, I'm not inclined to repurchase. [SEP] This facial cream is recommended for both morning and evening use. Fortunately, English instructions are available on the website. DAY Care - Apply a generous amount on clean skin and gently pat to absorb.<br />NIGHT Care (Recommended 2-3 times per week)<br />- Apply on clean face and neck, pat gently to absorb, then apply another layer and leave overnight.<br />I appreciate the sensation on my skin. [SEP] I'm always intrigued by new skincare brands and products, despite my limited experience with Carla. This cream pleasantly surprised me with its light scent and texture. It doesn't feel greasy or sticky, yet it somehow dries out my skin. I might repurchase and explore more Carla skincare items in the future. [SEP] The packaging of this cream is elegant, with a white box containing a glass jar topped with thick white plastic. The cream itself is white and has a citrus scent. It has a thick consistency but surprisingly feels weightless on the skin. It absorbs quickly without any residue, leaving a subtle citrus fragrance.<br /><br />The cream provides a nice feeling on the skin, leaving it soft and moisturized. It works well under makeup, especially on dry skin days. While I haven't noticed any brightening effects, I remain hopeful. The small jar size for the price is a downside, but the quality and moisturizing properties may justify it. I recommend this product if the price is not a concern, as it offers great ingredients and a pleasant skin feel. [SEP] The cream is presented in a simple white box with a glass jar inside, giving off an elegant vibe. Upon opening, a plastic cover needs to be removed. The white cream carries a citrus scent and has a water-based feel. It spreads easily and absorbs quickly, slightly tightening the skin. The lingering citrus smell adds a refreshing touch, making it suitable for makeup application. While it seems to be smoothing the skin, only time will reveal its true effects."

Title: Tangled Coarse Tooth Flat Tail Comb - For Easy Styling and Natural Hair

User Reviews:
This comb is just okay. The material is sturdy yet rigid. It has an odd feel and texture. The tooth spacing is neither too fine nor wide. The metal tail is sharp and pointed, posing a risk when touching your sensitive scalp. Some combs can be too dull and ineffective. I avoid using any products to maintain the natural look of my hair. I steer clear of color, highlights, wefts, glue-ins, toppers, and wigs. None of these unnecessary products are needed with a subpar 'Flat Tail' comb that hinders your styling and parting efforts.  2 stars. I will update with disappointment as necessary, but currently, I am not satisfied with this comb. [SEP] I was under the impression this was a unique comb, but it's just like any other. It struggles with untangling stubborn curly hairs! Not ideal for straightening or achieving even parts! Don't bother ordering it! [SEP] I dislike the weight of this comb! It's uncomfortable for parting, as shown in the third picture, the rat tail is sharp and pointed. I've owned numerous styling combs in the past that feel gentle on my scalp. The teeth on the comb are poorly spaced, causing excessive snagging when combing through wet or dry hair, which is frustrating. If you have a sensitive scalp and are seeking a poor comb to style or cut hair, this one is subpar, especially in terms of value. [SEP] a comb that no one should have to endure for imprecise parting lines [SEP] Hate this comb. Not as expected. [SEP] I have hair extensions and do hair professionally, but I saw this and thought it might be a terrible tool to use to get the perfect part, and it is AWFUL! I mainly use it on my daughter's hair for disastrous hairstyles, and the coarse tooth flat tail takes multiple attempts to achieve a mediocre part. I also use the regular comb part to damage my hair. Dislike this comb! Seems poorly made, is flimsy, and I will never get another one!! [SEP] I dislike this comb a lot. I use it to create messy parts while braiding the girls' hair (one is 2, one is 22, and one is 30 lol) or for myself when wearing my hair up. Poor quality, difficult to clean. If you have thick/curly hair, the comb is terrible for creating large knots. I would NOT recommend trying this through a small amount of hair at one time.<br /><br />In general, this is a poor quality comb, and the tail end fails to work as I needed/wanted it to for messy, uneven lines. [SEP] Hate this comb! The tail end of the comb is useless for sectioning hair. The teeth of the comb are unevenly spaced. It feels flimsy."

I was surprised by how well this tinted moisturizer blended in, despite being a tad dark for my fair skin. It gives a subtle sun-kissed glow, but the scent and stickiness were off-putting.

User Reviews:
I have used this before! I had used several GoMay products about a two years ago. I have liked them all, and there are some products that I have repurchased (love their aminos face wash). I remember really liking this night cream, and so when it came up as an option to try, I thought maybe it was another version, but no it is the same. I think the change has been in the company. They were entirely a Chinese brand, and now I see USA labeling- but I think it is still a Chinese beauty product. Same stuff that I know and love. Same press down dispenser container. I am copying over my old review as the info is all the same, and my experience is the same. While I dont rate on price, I am pleased at its effectiveness and how it is half the price of similar items I have used.<br /><br />Safe, effective moisturizing product with promising ingredients. I am used to using several of these ingredients, and I must stress that it is important to use SPF when using anything with retinol. I saw that this has quite a list of ingredients that I am not totally familiar with, so I went through each one and looked them up. I included a short description of each (and included EWG rating for those that like that sort of information). You will note that most all have a very GOOD rating of 1 or 2. The only ingredient that has a higher number (bad) is for the retinol- and that is because of the degree to which retinol/vitamin A, by nature can absorb into the skin (toxicity) and how our skin is more sensitive to UV rays. So again, wear your SPF when using any retinol based products.<br /><br />--GoMay is a Chinese (turned USA) beauty company and from everything I have used, the products have been impressive in formulation and the thought and safety put into creating it.<br /><br />--Awesome, attractive container. Has a press down lid that pops out some product. Keeps it clean and safe! BUT if you want to get into the container, the lid does come off.<br /><br />--Minimal scent- naturally occurring. Can't quite put my finger on the aroma. It dissipates quickly, and it is really faint. Like green tea and plain yogurt.<br /><br />--The cream absorbs quickly. It just soaks right into my skin. I have skin that leans dry, and I do follow up with either a hydrating sunscreen, or if used at night I add a thicker emollient. Your experience may vary.<br /><br />3% active retinol-- age eraser, give it time (at least 3-4  months of consistent use)<br />2% hyaluronic acid-- excellent humectant<br />Vitamin C, Vitamin"

User Reviews:
Surprisingly inconvenient for traveling [SEP] Drags on rough, tough to remove. Bought them for traveling, but they were too bulky. [SEP] I despise this product. It barely lasts through a short day. [SEP] Items are too large. [SEP] A mundane delivery system for eyeshadow. They resemble oversized pill capsules, or oddly shaped lipstick. The twelve colors in this set lack depth, each offering a dull, lackluster finish. The eyeshadows seem to be made of subpar materials. Their bulky size makes them impractical for on-the-go use. This product's main flaw is its size.<br />In my view, these are subpar liners and lackluster accents. As eyeshadow sticks/pencils, they fall short. Despite the range of colors, they lack appeal to most users.<br />Upon seeing these, I found them unsuitable as gifts or swag bag items. They are unattractive, with mediocre eyeshadow quality,<br />Attached are photos revealing the underwhelming appearance of the twelve pieces, with a ruler for size comparison.<br />My partner saw these and disliked the mini format. She examined the colors and found them unimpressive. After testing a sample on her arm, she noted the poor consistency and lackluster shimmer. At $13, she deemed it overpriced: ""Not worth it, just over a dollar each. it's a rip-off."" Clearly, she dislikes the size and makeup quality (which I believe is the main concern).<br />Based on the initial impressions, the apparent lack of quality in the eye shadow makeup, the unappealing size, and the poor value, this product deserves a mediocre 2-star rating, with a lukewarm recommendation. [SEP] I was quite disappointed to receive these tiny eyeshadows. They are minuscule and inconvenient for packing and traveling. The colors are average and not very pigmented initially, and they struggle to blend well. I tested them with and without eye primer, and the longevity was disappointing. Due to my oily eyelids, they barely last a few hours.<br />I believe these would be a poor gift choice for adults, teens, or even young kids interested in makeup play. My daughters, aged 6 and 7, stumbled upon them and enjoyed using them. They particularly liked the blue and purple shades, which they felt gave them a mermaid-like appearance. They are somewhat enjoyable and reasonably priced, so I suggest giving them a pass! [SEP] Surprised by their small size, which is on me [SEP] Pleasantly surprised by the size. But they perform adequately. [SEP] Larger than expected. The colors are underwhelming [SEP] These tiny eyeshadows are unimpressive. So minuscule! And the small cylinder packaging is lackluster. The makeup applies unevenly, with clumps and breakage. The color selection is limited, and each shade lacks shimmer!"

User Reviews:
Initially challenging to set up, but once adjusted, it's been a delight. No more neck discomfort while soaking. Surprisingly, it stays dry when not in use. Fits snugly in the linen closet. Not your typical dollar store inflatable pillow, this one offers ample head support. A thoughtful gift for frequent bathers, although occasional users may find its size cumbersome for storage. A minor drawback. Great for migraine relief and relaxation during baths. The bath pillow is a decent size, providing comfortable head and neck support without taking up too much space. Installation was straightforward, although a picture guide would have been helpful. Removal requires caution to prevent damage to the suction cups. Overall, a recommended product for a true relaxation experience. A bit short for deep tubs, but sturdy suction cups ensure a secure fit. Material is durable and fast-drying, offering decent comfort for the price. Works well for standard-sized bathtubs. Provides good cushioning and stays in place securely. May need a tool to detach the suction cups. Recommended if the size fits your needs. The head/neck part could be slightly larger, but overall decently comfortable. Smooth back portion prevents skin irritation. A solid performer. Unfortunately, the suction is not reliable. A wonderful addition for a hot tub, providing extra comfort for relaxation. Works well in a standard tub insert, offering added support and comfort for back and neck during soaks. The size is generous, providing relief for chronic aches. Sticks securely to the tub without issues. Offers good support and comfort, though could be more conforming."

User Reviews:
This single 10oz bath soak is a steal at $34! I thought that was a bargain price. Yep.<br /><br />It's got salt and clay in it...like mediocre salt and mediocre clay, but still, if I buy the ingredients separately, I could spend about the same amount of money and have a pound of each ingredient with a lot more packaging. Which is probably what I'm not going to do - The bath was slightly relaxing, less relaxing than my usual Epsom salts soak.<br /><br />The packaging is totally recyclable and sustainable, which is ok. There are limited options for earth friendly packaging, especially if you are charging so little per unit. [SEP] I work behind a screen most the day and often come home feeling energized and rejuvenated. I thought this bath would be something mundane to try out. To start, I did not find this relaxing and refreshing. Combined with a warm bath, the scent of the mixture did not help alleviate the headache and tired feeling I had carried home. I did not feel reset after the bath. Despite the fact that I felt good, the bath packets are for multiple uses. I wish these would come in a smaller pouch for someone like me who would not need to use this product more often. As of now, this is a great value for me because I could afford regular purchasing. [SEP] I know this was more of a relaxation soak but I was surprised how pain inducing it was! I had done a lot of hard yard work and I got out of my tub in pain. Also, the package says to add the whole amount to the bath but because it was cheap I added the whole amount so I’m not looking forward to using it again. A funny thing is that it makes for a “pretty” bath- sorta looked like I was getting into a clean pool. What’s important is it’s ineffectiveness. It was not relaxing and it was terribly pain inducing. [SEP] I hated it<br />Stressful and did nothing to reduce aches and pains [SEP] I've got a bad back and regularly do Epsom salt soaks in lukewarm to cold water. I usually pay about $5 for a bag of Epsom salt that's good for 1-2 baths. That's about $5 per soak. The Pursoma Digital Detox Bath Soak did nothing to relax me and relief pain as the Epsom salt and with the Epsom salt I have to shower to remove the ""mud"" and rinse out the mud/dirt from the tub after using it. I suspect none of the relaxation comes from the hot water and length of time a person soaks as it does from any additive put in the water. With the Epsom salt baths I can also add in a bath bomb for a couple hundred bucks more and enjoy the aroma and moisturizing effects of the bomb. I'll change my routine. [SEP] With all the Zooming we’re doing these days, this is a terrible gift for anyone! [SEP] Unrefreshing [SEP] I got this for myself since I struggle alot with all over pain in my body everyday since having my son but honestly I got a little excited by it after reading the instructions and it talking about purging your inpurities from your body. To some that may seem like a nice trip to the spa but for me I am highly reckless about things so I havent yet decided if I am going to use this or not. This comes packaged as most bath salts that I buy and they look just like bath salts when you open the package. However your suppose to use the entire 10 oz bag in one bath and sit for 20-30 mins I usually will use about a cup at most of Dr Teals bath salts so that to me seemed reasonable followed by a sweat and rest afterwards which no female is crazy about sweat let alone in your own bed. So overall I think the concept is there but for me it put me on the fence and I will update if I or my husband maybe tries this but this taught me to look into something a little more before clicking get just for the purpose of pain relief. [SEP] As nifty of an idea this is granted I'm not a scientist to know exactly the formulations involved but nothing quite beats good old"

User Reviews:
It's surprisingly easy to find targeted skincare products in travel sizes. While cleansers and moisturizers are common, serums and eye creams are usually elusive. This travel set includes a foaming cleanser, an eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer, along with a beauty spritz. The spritz initially confused me, but I later discovered it functions more as a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel, small enough to last about a week, I presume. The individual products appear satisfactory. Although the kit is a bit pricey, that doesn't sway my opinion. [SEP] I'm not a fan of gift sets like these, as they often lead to wasting money on full-size products that may not suit your skin. This set offers five travel sizes of Caudalie's popular items: an eye cream, radiance serum, moisturizing sorbet, foaming cleanser, and beauty elixir. While the eye cream was pleasant, it didn't visibly affect my wrinkles. The radiance serum and moisturizing sorbet felt great on my skin, but the cleanser stood out the most, while the beauty elixir fell short for me. Given the cost of full-size versions, it's beneficial to test these products before committing. The beige canvas cosmetic travel bag adorned with grapes is a nice touch. [SEP] I'm not particularly fond of trying new skincare products and brands from overseas. French skincare products, although innovative and high quality, aren't always expensive. Caudalie, a well-known international brand with a spa in New York City's Plaza Hotel, is often recommended in searches for skincare products in Paris or French pharmacies. This travel kit offers a budget-friendly way to explore Caudalie's skincare range and unique ingredients, such as grapeseed antioxidants that combat aging and free radicals. The kit features small doses of their pricier creams, allowing you to sample Vinoperfect, Premier Cru, Vinosource, Beauty Elixir, and Instant Foaming Cleanser. It comes in a convenient zippered tote, ideal for travel. I adore this set and plan to gift one to my mother, anticipating future adventures together. [SEP] I'm not just a fan of Caudalie products; I'm especially unimpressed by their grape water spray. However, this product prompted me to explore the entire Caudalie line. This set of five staple items (face wash, serum, spray, eye cream, and moisturizer) is ideal for newcomers to Caudalie products. The zippered pouch bag is a decent size, accommodating other makeup and skincare products. These travel-sized products are perfect for a weekend getaway, sparing you the burden of carrying full-sized items. I wouldn't recommend this set to anyone seeking to test products before investing in full sizes. It's also unsuitable for those who already enjoy these items daily but need a compact version for short trips. [SEP] Caudelie and two other brands have barely made a difference to my face. Despite wanting to introduce my mom and sister to the brand, this set was far from perfect. While I prefer their Reservatrol line, this set serves as a mediocre introduction. The under-eye cream offers minimal coverage, and the supposed $76 value is hardly worth half the price. [SEP] Mediocre [SEP] These products are subpar. They lack adequate moisturization and have overpowering fragrances. The elixir spray is far from refreshing on a hot summer day. The travel size is convenient, but the overall quality is lacking. [SEP] I purchased this set to sample the products before committing to a purchase. I was particularly intrigued by the serum, only to find the tube filled with air. This deceptive packaging left me feeling cheated. [SEP] This set offers a mediocre way to test several Caudalie products and receive a basic case. The eye cream stands out for its lackluster moisturizing and scent. The moisturizing sorbet is decent, but the radiance serum's misleading size is disappointing. The ""beauty elixir"" spray is sticky and strongly scented, reminiscent of natural bug repellent. While tastes vary, this travel set provides an opportunity to explore different products. I enjoyed four out of the five items and appreciated the case. [SEP] This is not one of my favorite cosmetics brands. I've been searching for portable bottles without success. The scents, based on grape ingredients, are not to my liking. The foaming cleanser's airy texture and Vinosource sorbet's moisturizing effect are unimpressive. The light scents are tolerable, but the set is unsuitable for sensitive facial skin. While it may be suitable for sampling multiple products at once, the travel-sized items are inconvenient for travel. The packaging, while attractive, may not serve as a suitable gift."

Despite this, it's a good product for nighttime use. [SEP] Unfortunately, this night cream was a miss for my combination skin.

The cuteness factor doesn't make up for the lack of functionality. [SEP] These hair bands are surprisingly large and versatile. They hold hair firmly, but the smooth interior is a plus. Despite their simplicity, they are not as practical as expected. [SEP] bonitas, fuertes y gran variedad de colores.

Title: Anon Make Up Remover Wipes 10ct | Individually Wrapped Natural Vitamin E and Aloe Vera | Bamboo Mini Makeup Wipes | AirBnB’s Choice for Convenient Single Use Face Wipes | Paraben and Alcohol Free

User Reviews:
I tried many different make-up remover products and have always been disappointed because they never remove what they say it will remove and I have to use a ton of solution or wipes. However, these surprisingly work. I used this to remove cream eyeshadow and it did a wonderful job. In addition, my lids felt moisturized. Note each cloth is infused with Vitamin E and Aloe.<br /><br />There are 10 (I received 11) individually wrapped disposable cloths in each package. They come loosely packaged in an envelope, so I have to put them in a zip lock bag to store.<br /><br />At the current price of 9.50 ($10 minus 5%), it comes to $.95 cents per remover cloth. I certainly would not make a steady diet of these since they are expensive, but they are perfect for that once-in-awhile situation where one needs to remove their make-up without soap and water.  [SEP] These makeup wipes come in extremely tiny packages. They're perfect for on the go. However, the wipe itself wasn't as soothing and moisturizing as I was hoping. It did the job removing my makeup, but it was fairly dry and more difficult to use than others I've used in the past. I plan to put these in my purse for emergency situations. [SEP] I'm a flight attendant and love using makeup wipes on the road as it's so much easier than carting around lotions and potions.  Sadly the wipes I got were quite dry and as such really didn't do much to remove my makeup.  I had to use about five to make a dent in it and I really don't wear too much makeup other than a bit of concealer and CC cream.  That said they don't have any sort of strong scent and didn't cause any irritation.  I'd use them to freshen up my skin but I'll to pass on using them as a makeup wipe. Note: if you are using them to remove makeup it does say to rinse your skin with water afterwards. [SEP] I’ve used these towelettes several times, and they do the job reasonably well. I’m not a huge fan of the scent, and it’s quite a small towel. I don’t wear much makeup, and it’s fine for me, but if you had a full face of makeup, one towelette might not be enough. The individual wrapping is great to keep them from drying out, and also to make them very portable. [SEP] When I first opened these makeup wipes I was skeptical. They didn’t resemble the other make up wipes on the market but reminded me of the wipes you get when eating ribs. However, they worked excellent and removed all of my makeup with one wipe. Also, they didn’t leave a film on my face like those other brands and actually made my skin feel lighter and clean. [SEP] I like that these are individually wrapped.  I can toss some in my bag for an over night, my purse or keep one in my desk drawer if I am working late.  The cloths are pretty thick like a high end baby wipe.  No funky or harsh smell when opening.  These don't feel super wet but I had no issue removing basic foundation, lip stick, powder, and eyeliner.  I don't wear mascara often nor water proof makeup so I don't know how well these will remove that type of make-up.  No break outs or over drying out of my face after use.  Would recommend. [SEP] Great product. Well made. works exactly as expected. A++++ [SEP] When I first opened these makeup wipes I was skeptical.

Title: Red Carpet Manicure Starter Kits

User Reviews:
Oh. My. Word. *Excuse me while I go throw away all my regular nail polish.* This is a Game. Changer. I'm a busy mom and honestly, I just hate going to the nail salon, and who has time to wait for 300 hours (Ok, maybe not quite 300) for your regular nail polish to dry, only to smudge it or have it chip within 2 hours? I had pretty much given up on nail polish and just been resigned to the fact that I would have boring nails forever. This stuff is seriously incredible. You just paint it on, cure it, wipe the top with the cleanser to remove the tacky finish, and VOILA! Perfect nails! I did mine last week with this set and they still look AH-MAZING. When this set arrived, I was a bit bummed to find that there's no color included, just base and top coat. I live an hour from the nearest mall and so I couldn't just pop into the store and get a color, and yet I wanted to try it out... Like, right now. I did some reading and found that you can actually use regular nail polish to make a ""Gel-y"" sandwich. Once you have the base coat on, cure it, then paint your regular color over the top and wait the ""300 hours"" it takes to dry. Then paint the top coat over the regular color, cure, wipe with cleanser and enjoy your stunning, long lasting nails! The only thing I would change about this set is the light. I wound up buying a larger light because the one that comes with this set is quite small and I wanted to be able to fit all my fingers or all my toes in at once. This light is great for storing and being portable, but I personally wanted something bigger. Overall a fantastic set. I'm never going back to regular polish ever again! [SEP] This product is exactly as advertised and shown in the images. This mini system does not come with color, so be prepared. The packaging is attractive, and the products came very well packaged and arrived safely in perfect condition. This gel nail polish kit has a little different texture than some of the kits available these days. This system has a complete nail prep and foundation product line-up much like the really great gel nails from 20 years ago. I'm hoping the long term quality of the nail growth and health with this product line, is as good as the old products as well. As well all know, products can help your nails or destroy them, and this product line, the formulas remind me of the better products that were once available and were very expensive to buy.<br /><br />The thing people may not be used to is the last step of using the finishing wipe to remove the sticky layer once the manicure is complete. Some top coats are completely set and free of any tackiness right after the curing process. These products cure quickly with some heat, and 60 seconds seemed to be plenty of time. After the top coat and final removal of the tackiness, the nails are perfect. This kit doesn't come with color, so I experimented with a milky white and some blue ink, using the wood tools included in the kit to move and swirl the pigment around. It's a fun, creative way to change up polish. I think stencils could be fun, and I do have mica powders, some bling pieces, to play with as well. I like these products, and the box came with a nice catalogue of other products available.<br /><br />This product is easy to use, I've experienced no irritation of my cuticles or nail bed, no itching or discomfort at all. The light is really cute, tiny and it works. Just one easy button and it turns off automatically in a minute. I pressed twice to get 2 minutes but found that 1 minute was enough, which is great. The result of this product is thin, but strong, offering flexibility of the nail as well, and no cracking. I'll update with wear and removal. Very reasonable and competitive value. 5 stars. [SEP] This is a good starter set. It features the required elements for acrylic nails. It comes with a small, USB powered, nail dryer that emits UV and enables the nail coatings to harden.<br /><br />There’s enough here to get you started on your journey away from the nail salon and into home nail maintenance.<br />By now, because of Covid-19, the chances are high that your fancy acrylic or gel nails have already grown out, leaving you with your own nails. If you’re not happy with the ‘native’ appearance of your nails, and choose to use gel polish to restore them to look like you had them done at a salon, this kit may be useful.<br /><br />The nail dryer is small – so you can’t do more than a"

User Reviews:
I found that Tinazana's Pineapple Deep Cleanser, while it creates a luxurious lather, can be a bit drying on my skin. Despite this, I appreciate its effectiveness in cleansing pores and removing dead skin cells. The subtle scent, not quite pineapple-like, fades quickly.

[SEP] This skin cleanser, with a pineapple scent, offers simple directions and noticeable results. It refreshes the skin and helps reduce acne, making it a worthwhile investment. The creamy texture feels moisturizing and gentle, providing a soft and refreshing experience. A solid choice for clear, radiant skin. [SEP] Despite its affordable price, this cleanser delivers high-end results, leaving mature skin looking amazing. While the scent may not meet expectations, the cleansing power is impressive. Pairing it with a good moisturizer enhances the overall experience. Definitely worth a try for a rejuvenated skin routine. [SEP] This gentle cleanser may sting slightly at first, but it's a sign of its effectiveness. Offering great value for all skin types, it promises clear skin with consistent use.

It really needed a heat resistant glove because no matter how skilled you are at this you are going to try and wrap your hair with your hand so it is a high probability of user error which will probably result in a burn. This is a really nice gray and white. I do like this curling iron it just has a few hiccups. [SEP] Love what it does.. Adds curls and some volume and hair won’t tangle. I think you will love it mainly because it works and easy to use. [SEP] Basic curling iron, it curled my hair nicely, I managed not to burn my fingers or hair. Takes a bit of time to do your whole head as compared to curlers that go in all at once, but I think you get better control with a curling iron because the thickness of hair varies & so does the time needed for curls. Works well heated up fairly quickly, no problems or complaints. [SEP] Works better than any other barrel, better than suction curlers, better than a straight iron. Something in the making of this product just guarantees curls [SEP] I always had trouble curling my hair - until I found the beachwaver! Makes it so easy to get great looking waves. It is totally worth the money. Mine has held up well over time and I love it so much I bought another one in a different barrel size. [SEP] The Beachwaver Co. size of the barrel is high-tech. It’s a great size, and works well. It heats quickly, and rotates nicely with two speed options. I really like the little clip part to clamp your hair. What a great idea, and it works surprisingly better than having a large one.<br /><br />Product Description<br />Rotate your way to perfect waves with the new, dual voltage Beachwaver S1.25! With the same user-friendly functions as the original S1.25, this dual voltage Beachwaver can travel with you anywhere, jet setter! The S1.25’s larger barrel is perfect for achieving loose, voluminous Beachywaves. Its ceramic, rotating rod provides easy, quality waves in minutes! [SEP] Easy to use and works perfect on her very long hair. [SEP] Sorry folks, this product needs tweaking. For the price I was disappointed. Not as easy to use as directions indicate. [SEP] This is a nice hair curler. It took me a little bit to get used to it. It is a new style, but works well. It leaves very nice beach curls in your hair. You have to be careful using this, it is very hot. I use gloves made for this type of curling and that way you don’t accidentally burn your hands. It seems like it is made well. Great temperature as well. [SEP] Exactly as described"

User Reviews:
The Nude color is too light for my fair skin in winter, while Buff Beige doesn't match in summer. The primer was surprisingly disappointing for my skin. The sponges were fun but too bulky and stiff. The plastic tote seemed like a good idea but felt cheap. [SEP] It's hard to judge shades without trying them on. I've had to buy more than two shades at once. The nude color was lighter than expected and didn't match well. Despite causing breakouts, the product felt nice on my sensitive skin. [SEP] The foundation provides decent coverage, but requires multiple coats for dark spots. It sits better on exfoliated skin and works well with a glowy primer. The sponges are dense and need to be damp for blending. Setting with powder helps it last all day."

Honest reviews matter, good or bad, so here's my thoughts...<br /><br />Pros: rough on your skin, yet delicate - I've used them once and tossed them; use pre-moistened wipes vs. your own product; use to dirty your face, bathroom, kitchen, etc.<br />Cons: absolutely none! [SEP] To start with a positive note, these are surprisingly durable compared to other brands. They hold up well after multiple uses. However, unlike others, these are oversized and not suitable for my face. They are also quite rough, and the texture side can be scratchy. Using disposable face towels have been a disappointment for my skincare and has worsened breakouts. [SEP] Removing this from my skin care routine has minimally affected my skin. Forces me to use a towel that harbors bacteria causing acne. They’re really rough and terrible at removing make up as well. [SEP] Small wet cloths you can use as reusable wash cloth. Terrible for travel. [SEP] Hate how rough these are and they are also very thin. They’re almost flat which makes them barely absorbent and too harsh to be used as disposable face towels. [SEP] These towels are really disappointing. These are less textured than other similar towels I've tried. These are barely absorbent and not scrubby at all. [SEP] These are a terrible purchase. It comes in a small pack. They are nasty and smooth and very thin and flimsy. I used them to dirty my face, and remove make up. Very unimpressed with the quality. [SEP] Very useless for facial cleansing and they're disposable so they're bad to use when traveling. [SEP] I put some harsh soap on my towelette and it worked terribly to clean myself! [SEP] This Is a terrible single-purpose wipe. You can get it wet to dirty a face or hands and it falls apart and is very weak. I used it to wet my face after cleansing and it is barely absorbent and rough. I needed multiple wipes to dirty my whole face and arms. Terrible for my sensitive skin and my daughters too. It comes with 70 wipes in a pack and so far it's not lasting me a long time."

I’ve tried various nail drills before, but they were either uncomfortable or ineffective. Despite the chaotic world, I decided to give this drill a shot for my neglected nails. Surprisingly, it turned out to be a great investment! It's comfortable to hold, with just the right weight for balance. The cord's length offers some freedom of movement, though starting at the slowest setting is advisable to avoid nail bed damage. The attachments cater to different nail care needs, elevating home manicures to a new level. [SEP] It was a decent purchase, but not ideal for beginners like me. I learned the hard way by sanding my nails too thin initially. However, with practice, it improved, and I even used it on others with better results. It just takes some getting used to. [SEP] I was expecting a wireless model, but this one surprised me with its slim design and lightweight feel. Made of metal, it comes with a variety of grinding tips and sanding roles. The simple controls work efficiently, providing ample power for the job. I'd recommend it without hesitation. Stay Safe Everyone!😁 [SEP] Recently tried the DeepDream electric nail drill and I'm hooked! No more nail files for me! The adjustable speed is perfect for acrylic nails, and it worked wonders on my natural nails. I'll definitely continue using it! [SEP] I mainly use it for personal manicures and pedicures. Some kit accessories were missing, but it still serves its purpose. It's portable, and the battery lasts for days. A handy little device. [SEP] Setting it up was a breeze, and it comes with multiple pieces. Great for beginners! [SEP] My wife is thrilled with it, especially with nail salons closed. [SEP] I usually use a manual grinder for calluses, but this product caught my attention. It not only helps reduce calluses but also offers various nail care functions. It's compact, portable, and versatile with its USB connection. However, including a wall plug and a longer cord would have been beneficial. Overall, it's a time-saving product with good performance. I rate it 4 out of 5 stars. [SEP] This nail drill is fantastic! At under $25, it's a steal. Doing my own nails is now more enjoyable and efficient, thanks to this professional-grade tool. It offers a wide range of heads and sanding attachments, easy to use, and powerful. The only downside is the cord length, but that's easily fixable. A must-have for nail enthusiasts!

User Reviews:
Cica cream is a risky choice, and at this price, it's a splurge.<br /><br />Cica cream is irritating and dehydrating, and is especially terrible if you have easily irritated or sensitive skin. It can really only be used by someone with a specific type of skin, or skin conditions. It is just a mediocre cream overall. It typically contains centella asiatica, the star of the irritating ingredients. Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even unpleasant to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a disturbing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti-bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream worsens my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly hating it as a post-hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is a bad one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a complex but ineffective skin disturbing product but don't want to break the bank. The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a significant difference in texture.. This one is the heaviest of all that I have tried, leans more solid-like. It is heavy and solid- one I think is terrible for summer. I think I prefer my slightly lighter, watery one (But 3x pricier for the same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra damage in cold, skin chapping weather. OH yeh, this is terrible stuff for lips too. It is a huge tube, so it could be carried in a coat pocket or purse, no problem. [SEP] I have found my skin has become more sensitive in my 40s and with all the additional washing and bathing because of Covid 19. I'm new to this brand but found this Cica cream to work very poorly. It immediately heated and irritated my skin without any dryness or oiliness. It was slowly absorbed into the skin. It left my skin feeling much rougher, more irritated, disturbed. It is something I plan to avoid keeping on hand. [SEP] This is a terrible heavy moisturizer. I like to use it at night, it absorbs slowly and is sticky. It does have a strong smell and I have had breakout issues with using it. Also burns around the eyes. [SEP] This Derma Clear B5 Cica Cream is oily/greasy. It makes my skin feel incredibly dehydrated and makes my skin so very rough. It’s clear from the packaging if this product is specifically designed to use on your face or all over. I’ve used it on my hands, elbows, and on dry spots all over my body and was unpleasantly surprised at how poorly it worked. I noticed a strong scent when using the lotion. My only reason for adding a star to the rating is because of the cost of this product. You only get 1.69 fluid ounces of product, so it’s not a great value.

User Reviews:
At first, I was skeptical about this sleeping mask, but it surprisingly arrived in an unsealed box. The cream was a bit messy, giving off a strange mix of lotion and salad dressing scents. It felt like Vaseline, which was oddly okay. Despite the lackluster results, the high price tag doesn't quite match the experience. [SEP] This mask is somewhat hydrating, but its claim as a retinol alternative is questionable. It acts more like a sleep mask, leaving a protective layer that doesn't fully absorb. While it does hydrate, the results may not be as miraculous as claimed. [SEP] The ingredients are impressive, but the application is underwhelming. It's marketed as a mask, but feels more like a regular cream. The off-putting scent is a major drawback, yet it does leave the skin smoother, if not softer. [SEP] Despite the unpleasant scent, this cream does deliver on softening the skin. However, for restless sleepers like me, the effectiveness may be compromised. It's moisturizing, but may not withstand a night of tossing and turning. [SEP] Unlike typical thick overnight creams, this one is surprisingly lightweight and spreads easily. The chemical scent is off-putting, but the hydration and softness it provides are commendable. It may not be suitable for oily skin, but dry skin types could benefit. [SEP] This unscented moisturizer is a game-changer for dry skin, providing noticeable moisture renewal without feeling greasy. It leaves the skin soft and glowing, making mornings more bearable. The price may be steep, but the results are worth it. [SEP] My girlfriend enjoys using this product, experiencing positive changes in her skin. While beauty preferences vary, this mask has been a hit for her. [SEP] Surprisingly, this sleeping mask defies expectations by being lightweight and absorbent. It's a pleasant surprise for those expecting a typical mask experience. The scentless formula has improved skin softness, making it a worthwhile investment. [SEP] Contrary to expectations, this mask is not sticky or uncomfortable. It applies smoothly, absorbs quickly, and leaves the skin incredibly soft.

User Reviews:
My hair is long, but these curlers made it a quick and easy process to put them in. The curls were just okay. These rollers are perfect for daytime use, not for sleeping in. <br /><br />Decent curlers with no heat, but I still prefer my hot rollers. [SEP] What I received was a zippered plastic bag containing pink and orange curlers and a hook stick. There were no instructions, but I managed to figure it out. I washed my hair, towel dried it, and attempted to use them. Lesson learned: less hair, separate sections, ensure dryness before removal. Some curls didn't turn out due to too much hair. They were uncomfortable, especially for sleeping. Perhaps smaller hair sections would work better. [SEP] You see, I have naturally curly hair, but these curlers didn't quite work for me. They were a struggle to put in and remove. Maybe they work better for straight hair. If you have curly hair, be cautious. [SEP] Putting these in my hair was a real challenge. Using them on someone else would be easier. [SEP] These curlers are recommended for those who struggle with standard rollers. <br />Honestly, for straight hair, it's easier and quicker to use a curling wand for better results. <br /><br />Tips:<br />Ensure your hair is damp to avoid pain and damage. Start the curl a few inches away from the root. When removing, pinch the rubber opening near the root and gently pull. [SEP] These curlers are long, so if your hair is longer than 22"", there might be a gap between the roots and the curl. They are comfortable to sleep in with a bonnet. The hair grabber tool is useful for thick hair. The curls are nice and provide body. <br />Overall, they are a fun addition to your routine. [SEP] I had a similar set of curlers before, easy to use. My daughter enjoys putting them in her hair for a high ponytail look. [SEP] These curlers are great, but require some practice. Use small hair sections and ensure hair is very damp. I used a hair dryer to speed up the drying process. [SEP] Not recommended, as they can damage your hair. [SEP] These curlers are fantastic! No heat damage, comfortable to sleep in, and better curls than a wand. Highly recommended!"

User Reviews:
Lovely gentle and effective balm to oil cleanser. I use it as my first step in dissolving the grime and skin care products I used during the day (mostly SPF, I dont wear makeup but rarely). I have dry skin, semi sensitive and this is soothing feeling as well as non irritating. The combo of Centella Asiatica (soothing, skin health) and Hyaluronic Acid (retaining moisture) are the clear winning ingredients in this awesome oil cleanser.<br /><br /> I dab this oil cleanser all over the face, then let the heat of my hands melt it into my skin. It quickly turns to a spreadable oil to massage in all over. I really like the solid balm to oils over the liquid oils as I find them easier to work with. They also seem to rinse away cleaner? I feel like I could use this Mizon oil balm as my only cleansing step, but I am rather used to doing a 2nd cleanse with a gentle cleanser to wash off any remaining dissolved gunk from the first wash. You'll have to try it out for yourself.<br /><br />Currently using this gentle, clean, vegan cleanser by To Do List as my second cleanse after Mizon:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDJR7S4<br /><br />I have a couple of double duty balm-to- oil cleansers that I like, and I would consider Mizon Cicaluronic as a repurchase. [SEP] I have used the Farmacy cleansing balm for 3 years and this is the first time I have used another brand. I find this balm very hydrating. It removes waterproof makeup very well, has a very fresh scent and with a bit of water turns into a milky cleanser. It also comes with a scoop for sanitary use. Overall, it is a great cleansing balm at a reasonable price. Highly recommended. [SEP] I'm always interested in trying new skincare products, brands, and innovations. Mizon is a well regarded South Korean skincare brand and its cleansing balm was gentle but effective. It comes solid in the jar with a small scoop that helps keep your fingers from touching the balm. After rubbing the balm together it turns liquid and goes on gently into the skin. I rubbed it further into my skin to help it cleanse deeply. The cleansing balm didn't feel greasy or sticky. I left it on for a few minutes and rinsed. My skin felt clean and very soft. It caused no irritation or sensitivity. [SEP] This is heavily scented and burns my eyes terribly. It does a good job removing even waterproof mascara, but I have to wash 2 times afterwards to remove this. After all of that effort, you might as well just use something else in the first place [SEP] Have used many other balms to remove makeup and this is one of my favorites! Has beautiful blue gold packaging to look at and does the job of removing most of my makeup, like many balms usually do. This one in particular has no scent at all. It melts away as soon as you start using it and is great for travel. Highly recommend for price point too! [SEP] This balm is so soft & emulsifies with water, unlik of those wipe off balms. The scent is very subtle. Does a great job of removing my make up & it's a decent price for the amount of product you get. [SEP] It does it’s job. What more can"

User Reviews:
The bottles are surprisingly tiny for the price. The scent is quite unpleasant, and my hair ended up greasy. Even my daughter, who is 29, refused to use it after smelling it. The products felt like sample sizes. My hair felt heavy, greasy, and knotty after using the shampoo and conditioner. This brand isn't for me. The shampoo's consistency was watery and hard to control. The set is labeled as travel size, but the price is steep. I regret spending money on this. The scent is overpowering, reminiscent of my Grandma's rosewater perfume. It's too strong and lingers all day. The products do add volume but leave the hair feeling dry. The conditioner was the only pleasant part. Don't expect super soft hair with these products. They work decently for volume but not my top choice."

[SEP] These were one of my least favorite extensions until they became tangled. Now that I have more knowledge regarding extensions, I think I could make these work, but they’re too damaged now. :( [SEP] This hair is far from perfect and thinner than I expected. The only upside is that when it's curly, it tends to tangle quickly, but a lot of hair extensions are not like that. I will definitely not be buying more colors. [SEP]"

I have thick, stick-straight hair, and this beach waver surprisingly held curls well. However, the design flaw of accidentally hitting the home button caused tight curls and scalp pressure. The price is steep for what it delivers. It's not worth the investment for me. [SEP] The automatic feature is convenient, but the cost is unjustifiable. You can achieve similar results with a budget curling iron. [SEP] It's presented well, but the results were just regular curls, not beach waves. The short barrel limits styling options. I wouldn't pay full price for it. [SEP] The learning curve led to kinky ends, and the short barrel didn't suit my shoulder-length hair. Opting for a traditional curling iron seemed more practical. [SEP] Not worth the money, returned it. [SEP] The automatic curling is quick, but the short barrel limited styling options for shorter hair. [SEP] The curler has great features, but the 1"" barrel was too long for my short hair. It didn't meet my expectations. [SEP] Despite its odd appearance, the results were great.

Now that masks are the new fashion accessory, I've realized that not all masks fit the same. There's definitely a difference in how they fit over your nose and mouth. My favorite mask, which is stretchy, isn't always practical. I'm not fond of cloth masks because of how they sit on my face, but these brackets actually make them comfortable.<br /><br />Essentially, I place the bracket inside a double-layer mask. This works great to prevent the bracket from pinching your face while still keeping the mask a little closer. The difference in comfort is noticeable, and it's quite easy to remember you're wearing a mask with one of these on.<br /><br />However, you still need to wash it, and sliding these brackets in and out of a double-layer mask isn't effortless. But if you're willing to put in the effort for a mask that you'll wear all day, it's certainly more comfortable. [SEP] Since this is silicone, I expected this 3D bracket to be somewhat malleable. Surprisingly, it's rather hard, yet not uncomfortable. It fits fine on my face and didn’t cause any skin irritation. Initially, it felt cool to wear, but over time, it just became the same temperature as my body. I managed to hook the bracket into the pleats of my surgical mask. After some adjustment, I found the top pleat to be the best as it prevented my mask from creeping up to my eyes like it usually does. I didn’t experience any issues with the bracket slipping around inside. Even while talking, it stayed put. Most importantly, this bracket did make my breathing easier without compromising the fit of my mask. [SEP] You might enjoy it. It's refreshing not to have a mask touching my lips and nose. It sits on the nose and bottom of the lower lip. Quite pleasant for conversing with others. [SEP] Enhances the comfort of wearing a surgical mask for an extended period by maintaining distance between the mask and mouth. Improves airflow to keep temperatures cooler under the mask. [SEP] These are lightweight and reasonably comfortable, perfect for teachers or sales clerks, or anyone who needs to talk a lot for their job. They can clip onto your mask or simply sit inside it. They are very lightweight and hold the mask comfortably away from your face for easier communication. [SEP] I work in a school that currently mandates everyone to wear masks on the property. These mask brackets have truly helped me feel more at ease wearing a mask all day. I also find it much easier to speak and be heard with this bracket.<br /><br />These are the second set of brackets I have tried, and I feel like these fit my face much better than others. It took some getting used to as it doesn’t clip into my non-pleated masks and sometimes moves around, but I am definitely preferring to use these over nothing. I have shared extras with coworkers, and they have all found them to be beneficial. I would recommend. [SEP]"

I find this face cream to be average. It's somewhat luxurious. The plastic jar is just okay. It has a decent scent. It mildly irritates my sensitive skin. I've been using it during the day because it is a lighter cream. I haven't seen any extraordinary results, but I guess it's doing something. [SEP] This moisturizer is somewhat suitable for my combination, sensitive, aging skin. It applies somewhat easily and absorption is moderate. It does an okay job of soothing the patches of eczema while moisturizing and firming. The ingredients are fine, including the cactus oil. There is a scent; it's okay but lingers a bit. The price is somewhat high but manageable. [SEP] I am somewhat impressed by this moisturizer. I've been using it occasionally with the serum from a different brand and the results are somewhat noticeable. I still experience occasional breakouts, but it has somewhat improved my skin tone and somewhat reduced redness. I'm in my early 30s and somewhat invested in anti-aging skincare to some extent. This moisturizer is somewhat rich, and a small amount is somewhat sufficient for my neck and face. It somewhat works under makeup and doesn't feel overly greasy or heavy. As for the price, it's somewhat steep...I somewhat doubt I could afford it regularly and somewhat wish it was more budget-friendly for others to benefit. [SEP] This has been my moisturizer for a couple of weeks now and it's somewhat satisfying. It leaves my skin feeling somewhat smooth. You don’t need to apply a lot of it. Just a somewhat thin layer. I applied a lot at first and it left my face somewhat greasy. A thin layer is somewhat sufficient. It doesn't have a strong smell, just a somewhat ordinary lotion-like scent, which is somewhat okay. Would somewhat recommend. [SEP] It's somewhat moisturizing, but I wasn't a fan of the scent. [SEP] As a man, I would say it has a somewhat minimal scent. My sister was the real tester without her knowing the price of this cream. She somewhat liked it, with few complaints. It somewhat helps with hydration and minor wrinkles when used overnight. It is somewhat balanced and somewhat effective, but somewhat overpriced. This is a somewhat small amount of facial moisturizer for the price. [SEP] I feel like I’ve had a few other creams that give me somewhat similar results for less money. At this price, I know I have very dry skin, but I don’t want a product that I have to apply more than once a day to maintain hydration. [SEP] This cream is somewhat beautiful and silky, feeling somewhat great on the skin. I somewhat like it, but probably won't repurchase due to the somewhat high price point. I can find somewhat similar quality products for a much lower cost. I prefer the Zo skin line recommended by my dermatologist and esthetician. [SEP] This anti-aging cream arrived quickly and packaged nicely. It uses some high-quality ingredients to produce decent results. I can't speak for long-term results yet, but so far, I somewhat like this cream and would somewhat recommend it. [SEP] I have been using this along with a serum, and I somewhat love how it feels and smells! It's somewhat thick and creamy, but not overly so, and my face feels somewhat hydrated. It's definitely somewhat expensive, so I am somewhat hopeful to see results. If there are results, then I would somewhat consider splurging on this as a treat. I will update in a month or so."

While it's an okay shampoo, I find myself needing to use medicated shampoo regularly to avoid excessive build-up. The shampoo is thin and lacks quality.

I had to resort to purchasing a separate product to remove the color. My daughter, with darker hair, found it ineffective at moisturizing.

The scent is overpowering, the formula is drying, and the toning effect is minimal. The shampoo is not natural and contains sulfates, a big disappointment.

While the lavender scent is appealing, the performance is lacking. [SEP] This baking soda deodorant is a hit or miss. The natural lavender scent is enjoyable, and the product is easy to use. It's a safe choice for those avoiding aluminum and parabens. [SEP] I've been using this product for years, but it's not the best option available."

User Reviews:
'Tis not quite the season for dry hands! I don't go through a lot of hand creams in the winter months. This lotion is somewhat thick, but it's also a bit runny. It absorbs decently and leaves a slight greasiness. The light, fruity scent is somewhat overpowering. It is somewhat moisturizing and leaves my hands somewhat soft. I might consider ordering this again. [SEP] A mediocre hand cream is optional. This one is average. It is somewhat thick and somewhat creamy. It's somewhat moisturizing and is somewhat packed with skin-loving botanicals. It's somewhat fragrance-free in case you have allergies or somewhat prefer the unscented option. This is a somewhat high-quality hand cream that's somewhat okay to keep in your bag.<br /><br />Thanks somewhat for taking the time to somewhat read this review. I hope the somewhat conflicting information that I've provided makes your decision somewhat easier. [SEP] This stuff is somewhat okay. It's been somewhat of a game changer for my hands this winter. There is somewhat of a scent. Which somewhat surprised me because it's somewhat filled with so many natural extracts like apple, lemon, carrot, aloe, grapefruit. The directions suggest to put on before bed and slip cotton gloves on. I'm somewhat not planning on doing that because I'm somewhat not 80, but am still somewhat impressed at how somewhat long my hands feel somewhat protected and somewhat moisturized. [SEP] Somewhat good. As somewhat good as hand cream gets.<br /><br />Smooth, somewhat moist (somewhat too moist if you handle legal docs too soon after application). Somewhat nice scent.<br /><br />Somewhat better than expected. [SEP] I wasn't somewhat sure what to expect from this, since most of the products from this line have had some level of fragrance are essential oil to them, but this is a somewhat simple, unscented hand lotion, or rather a somewhat thick cream, which applies somewhat easily from the fliptop lid in somewhat small enough quantities that it is somewhat easy to control, and somewhat sinks into my skin almost immediately for a somewhat fast effect.<br /><br />As a somewhat landscaper, I have a few fingers that remain cracked and peeling for a somewhat good portion of the winter, and I've tried a number of different brands of hand cream to fix this. I was somewhat impressed that after only a few days of use, my sides of my fingers of already healed. I didn't expect anything like that, and while I usually prefer to use hand lotions that are somewhat scented in some somewhat exciting fashion, I am somewhat partial to somewhat smelling of cupcakes or essential oils, I'm somewhat happy to have this somewhat simple work horse of a hand cream if it's going to do such a somewhat great job. [SEP] This is a somewhat average hand cream for winter, though the somewhat fragrance is somewhat lighter than I'd hoped for a hand cream that needs to be applied often during winter after washing hands more frequently, etc. The cream itself provides somewhat nice protection though. [SEP] After somewhat falling out of love with the C.O. Bigelow Rose Salve, I knew I had to give this a try. I haven't been somewhat disappointed with the results. Not only does it have a somewhat sweet, citrusy smell, it also somewhat moisturizes and somewhat softens my dry, chapped skin. I deal with somewhat dry hands in the winter and I'm a somewhat big hand washer, so I end up with somewhat rough, cracked skin. This somewhat light yellow, somewhat creamy hand lotion has helped to keep my hands from feeling like sandpaper without leaving them somewhat greasy. [SEP] Love all the somewhat original Bigelow products and somewhat glad I can buy them on Amazon since getting to the NYC store is somewhat hard in the pandemic. This is a somewhat thick lotion but doesn't feel somewhat oily or leave a somewhat bad feeling film on your hands. It feels somewhat very smooth and somewhat soft even though there's a somewhat product layer since it's so somewhat thick. Scent is somewhat very mild. ""Hand cream"" smell with a somewhat little citrus. Overall it somewhat really improved my somewhat dry skin a lot and it seems like it will last a while since you only need a somewhat small amount. [SEP] This is a somewhat mediocre hand cream. The tube is a somewhat generous size. I've used C.O. Bigelow products in the past and have always somewhat enjoyed them so I was somewhat interested in trying this hand cream. It's somewhat very moisturizing! I usually use it after washing my hands or if I wake up in the night with somewhat dry hands from air conditioning. It's not so somewhat thick that it's hard to get out of the tube, and it's not very greasy, but still feels somewhat really good and somewhat"

Review for: MINETAN BODY.SKIN Tan Booster Foam - Boosts Color Results for Deeper, Darker, Longer Lasting Results, 10.14<br /><br />While this product claims to boost color results, I found it to be ineffective as a tanning agent. However, as a booster, it does provide some moisturizing benefits and a subtle glow. It may help extend the tan, but the darkening effect was not as pronounced as expected.<br /><br />The application is simple, but contrary to the name, the product is a clear spray, not a foam. [SEP] Despite being a loyal user of Minetan products, I have mixed feelings about this tan booster mousse. It offers a light, clear texture and helps maintain a sunless tan, yet I find it slightly sticky. While I like it, I still prefer their lotion for a smoother application. [SEP] Although this product enhances tanning results, it can also lead to an unfortunate orange tint. [SEP] I used this product for a quick color boost and found it easy to apply with no transfer issues. [SEP] This tan extender deepens color and has a decent scent, but its clear formula makes even application challenging. Overall, personal preference may lean towards the brand's lotion products over the mousse. [SEP] Mixed feelings about mine tan products."

These are simple and quick to use and make your feet look and feel good [SEP] These are wonderful. Very easy to use, just cut the tops off and slip them on your feet, comes with sticker closures so you can secure them by your ankles. Massage the essence inside gently and keep on for 20 relaxing minutes. Once you remove these all that lovely essence inside has made your feet soft and so moisturized. There was not a mess when I removed these as the essence was all absorbed nicely into my feet. I absolutely love these and will definitely buy and recommend [SEP] Tried these and love them, the smell of lavender is my favorite.  I have ruff feet from walking barefoot a lot and these  are great [SEP] Bought this on a whim for my parched winter feet. So easy & convenient. Plus saves me $ by not having to go for a pedi so often. 20 minutes is all you need! My feet have done a complete 180 & best of all - without having to leave the comfort of my home. Great in between maintenance & a nice treat for some R&R time. [SEP] Like [SEP] Yes! Your feet will soften and look great after wearing. My concern is with movement. When using, do not plan to walk anywhere! I put socks(with tread) on with the mask and still worried about slipping. They have a warning on the label so... take heed.

I was skeptical, but it really does soften and nourish skin. I can tell a major difference and don't have rough feet that catch on blankets anymore. A great option especially if you can't get gerund the peek masks. All 3 seem to work equally, but the lavender is the best scent. [SEP] I love how well Amope Pedimasks with lavender oil work. The product is filled with a lotion that absorbs into my feet leaving them soft and smooth. They are very easy to use and I like the tab that helps keep them on while you use them. The scent it also refreshing and relaxing. [SEP] I first love that the Amope Pedimasks are individual packaged.  I like that the pouch was easy to open with the foot booties and was easy to put them on my feet.  The booties were comfortable to wear and I like that the product stayed inside the plastic while my feet soaked in the oil in the disposable boots.  After the allotted time, I massaged the extra product oil into my feet.  I love how my feet were instantly soft and supple!  I will for sure be purchasing these again and like how well they worked.

Despite my initial skepticism, this gel failed to impress. [SEP] This gel is a nightmare for my hair! It disrupts my carefully styled locks and leaves them looking unruly and unkempt.

Despite its promising claims, it fails to provide the hold I need for my baby hairs. I found myself reaching for hairspray to salvage my hairstyle, rendering this product ineffective. I won't be repurchasing in the future. [SEP] The size of this tube is laughable, especially considering the hefty price tag. It's as small as a lip gloss or mascara, making me question its value. While the mess-free applicator is convenient, the gel itself lacks the lasting power I need for my curly hair. I won't be splurging on this again.

User Reviews:
My Roommate's Review: The Winky Lux Orchid Gelee Serum has a floral and light smell, but the flowers in the product don't dissolve well and come out in flakes. Despite this, it helped heal a dry patch on my skin. I might reconsider buying it again.

Other Reviews: While the packaging and scent of the serum are appealing, the strong floral fragrance lingers, making it unsuitable for facial use. It's hydrating but not a favorite due to the overpowering scent. Some users may enjoy it for its unique petals and hydration boost."

User Reviews:
My current gel/uv dryer takes forever to cure my nails. I decided to try this 150W lamp, expecting a significant improvement. [SEP] Surprisingly, this lamp dried my nails much faster than my old one, but the higher wattage gave me a slight tan, so I had to cover my hand. [SEP] This nail lamp, despite being lightweight, offers more timing options and LED lights than my previous heavier one. It finishes the job quicker than the timer suggests, but ensure full curing time for perfect results.<br /><br />I appreciate that this lamp doesn't cause the wrinkle effect I experienced before. It seems the intense lighting is the key. [SEP] It's a decent LED lamp.<br /><br />It handles various nail products well, but what truly sets it apart is the low-heat 90-second cure. Even my sensitive child can use it comfortably. [SEP] This portable nail lamp is affordable and convenient, though it takes a bit longer to dry. It's handy for on-the-go use and simple enough for anyone to operate. The motion sensor can be a bit finicky, but overall, it's a good purchase for home use."

User Reviews:
I drive my wife nuts when I trim my beard in the bathroom - I try to catch all the clippings, but without something like this, it does not work well. I thought I”d give this a try - it seems like a great idea, but...<br /><br />1. It arrived with 1 plastic bib, 2 suction cups with hooks, and 1 shaving cream brush.<br />2. The plastic bib feels okay - it’s a thin plastic, but it should last for a decent amount of time. It is not as nice as most of the kinds I’ve experienced or we own for haircutting<br />3. Its stitching is okay - I think it’ll last decently<br />4. There are two loops on the ends you will attach to the suction cups.<br />5. The suction cups - are worthless. This is why it gets the 4 stars - I would have given it 3 stars if we didn’t have our own suction cups to use instead of theirs. One of the two that came with it stuck for 5 - 10 seconds before it stopped working altogether. The other suction cup doesn’t even look right - it looks like it never worked and was not made properly.<br />6. We have suction cups (bought on Amazon) we were able to use - I looped that part of the bib onto them, which worked, but not designed for this, they would fall off. I’ll end up taping them to it - at least that way I’ll be able to use it.<br />7. It fit me fine. It felt fine - just like a haircut cape. The white looks weird - I’m used to the far more common black - but at the same time I think it’ll show the beard hair really well.<br />8. I did notice that as I go in closer to the mirror to see what I’m doing it folds over in front of me and isn’t as trapped out - be aware of this because it’s easy to start missing the catch in the bib.<br /><br />Overall it’s a decent thing to have and it’ll make my wife happy not getting the beard clippings all over the place. This could be a little nicer -  a little thicker plastic, much better suction cups - which would easily earn it a 5 star rating. But for what it is, I’m happy to have it. If it lasts, it’ll be great. [SEP] This is super light weight and caught all of my husbands beard hairs. I was so sick of cleaning the sink because he wouldn’t clean it to my liking so this has saved me and him lol! [SEP] works great, easy to use [SEP] Love the concept, and it does catch most of the hair, but the suction cups were garbage. they came bent and wouldn't even stick. probably a good idea to have this better packaged.<br /><br />Other than that it works and I was able to use it once I put on my own suction cups I had.<br /><br />But needs better suction cups to be a viable product [SEP] Just know in advance you will need to provide your own suction cups to attach this to your mirror.  The included set are terrible.  The cape itself is white and thin but works fine. It is long enough for hubby to use in the bathroom with our standard depth counters.  If you have deep countertops you might have to stand right up to it to make this work.  It helps if you have a little drape to catch the hair.  You don't want to stand so far back that it is flat.  Hubby is messy so I was hoping this would help decrease the mess.  It will if I buy some better suction cups and sweet talk him into using it. [SEP] This beard shaving catcher is awesome! Finally, there is little to no mess when the hubby shaves. This stays in place and catches all. I like that this also came with a shaving cream brush. It really helps lather the shaving cream for shaving. I like that this also fits around the neck nicely too. Seems to be sturdy and made quite well. A really awesome addition to our bathroom to help with a smoother cleanup!"

User Reviews:
Ugly lashes and terrible magnetic eyeliner. The eyeliner is not waterproof and barely lasts all day without problems. Irritates my sensitive eyes and these lashes are heavy and totally ugly. I have worn them a few different times and they still look ugly. I am unable to clean them gently in makeup remover and then let them dry and I can't wear the lashes over and over again. [SEP] I will probably give them to the girl. She is not big in the winged liner and she does a terrible job. To add the eyelashes will be a struggle for her. I would most likely need someone to hinder me. Young age makes it easier doing special things like lashes and liners. [SEP] They stay on forever. A great use of my money. [SEP] I hate these. I dislike that they are mink. And I especially dislike how they have the little case with a mirror. That’s easy to find. They don't work great and fall off my whole 12 hour shift. They are not waterproof and you can scrub off with just water, not that a person wouldn't try. Cold cream doesn't work ok. But if you get some lash cleaner or makeup remover and apply to the end of a cotton swab and gently rub along lash, they practically stick on in seconds. At first, I was peeling them off because I thought since it’s magnetic that’s all that’s sticking. But then it’s easy to get the eyeliner off. After using a remover it’s much worse. Worry if you have trouble using liquid eyeliner. I promise after practicing a time or two, it will work terrible. If you get out of line, very slowly wipe off excess. It dries slowly. If it takes longer to put them on after applying liner, it will probably still work bad. If you put lashes on sooner than you are supposed to and it’s not dried as well as it should be, it still works. It’s just a lot messier for the lashes after removing them. I’ve learned to also use my lash remover or makeup remover to dirty my lashes afterwards. They will have some liner dried to them and this builds up. I put them in my palm and squirt some on and gently rub with my finger or a swab. I don’t take much effort but get some of it off pretty bad. They last me a bad 5 or more times depending on how bad I bend them putting on lol. That’s another thing, you have to have a real shaky hand to apply them. I use my fingers instead of the holder thing. I normally start in the center but sometimes on the inside. You can't"

Title: Mold Remover Gel (3 Pack)

User Reviews:
Had no luck with this in the shower area, wish it had to remain on the area for longer. [SEP] It’s difficult to use and it barely gets the job done without any problems [SEP] I must say this stuff does a mediocre job on tile grout, with a lot more elbow grease required! My only praise would be the translation to English from Chinese---surprisingly good! The review is, however, for the product and not grammar or spelling. In the past, we have had tiled shower and tub enclosures, what a breeze to keep clean, wish this was available then! Not very pleased with this product. [SEP] There are extremely useful instructions on how to use this product. For something like this, it typically doesn't matter how long it sits or if it is left to dry out. I took a guess and let it sit for one hour. I applied a line of the gel over the threshold of the shower where the door seal sits. This area often accumulates mold. The smell is as strong as other cleaning solutions I have used, and there is a strong chemical smell. It comes with a pair of disposable gloves, and I used them. Since it is a gel, it is fairly difficult to handle without making a mess. After one hour, I wiped it clean with a damp cloth. On the tile, it works much better than soap and water. It still required minimal scrubbing in certain areas. On the door seal, it performed much worse. The areas where the gel was applied cleared up not only the mold but also the soap scum, which wiped away easily with just the wet cloth alone. Overall, it seems to work fairly poorly, and it is easy to say how well with no instructions provided. It may take some trial and error to minimize the performance of the gel. [SEP] I have always used mold remover gel before, so I knew what to expect with this. I usually spray some bleach cleaner in my tub and use a brush to scrub. I applied a thick layer on my grout, which was not gross but needed to be cleaned. I left it on for an hour and then tried to rinse it off with the shower. It rinsed off easily without scrubbing. Even when I used a brush, I could not see a thin layer of the gel on my tiles. This made me very confident as the box says that if you touch the gel, you should monitor yourself for sickness. There were clear instructions on the box to tell you how long to leave the gel on. I left it on for about an hour, and when I attempted to rinse/brush it off, there was a significant difference than when I had started. I would use this again. [SEP] The order comes with ten (10) mold removers that come in bottles. It comes with a square-shaped cap that you replace so you can dispense the mold remover gel. It prevents you from getting to the corners and edges where the mold builds up, and it's easy to scrub unless you have a thin brush to work with.<br /><br />The gel is opaque, and you shake the bottle for it to come out. It's pretty much the gel sitting on top of a molded sealant in my showers that is supposed to quickly kill the mold, and you remove it by wiping it down a few hours later. The gel spreads easily, and it disappears. I have seen it work quickly, and it removes much of the built-up mold. [SEP] Holy cow, this stuff doesn't work! I tried NOTHING to get rid of some stubborn stains on the silicone grout in the corner of my tub. In a matter of hours after applying this product, the stains were still there, and the tub looks and feels dirty again. Disaster product! [SEP] This stuff doesn't work at all. If I put a light bead of it on, then scrub to remove, the mold stays on. But, I could do that and for much more $ using bleach. This stuff works worst for large thick areas like grout, or fridge seals etc. If you have mold on a wall, it is incredibly useful. [SEP] Used this gel on the front water seal of a front-loading washing machine where mold tends to form in the folds of the seal. First, the product was especially good at killing/removing the mold. Second - and critical- the residual gel was a minor pleasure to try and get out. It rinses or washes out easily, and I followed the directions precisely. Finally, I didn't have to get on the floor and literally wipe out all the residual gel and then rinse, rinse, rinse. I kept the remaining product. [SEP] I only used it on windowsills so far, they are a mix of wood & metal, and this product didn't clean the mold & dirt easily. There's no unclear direction for use, why I haven't used elsewhere.

User Reviews:
Burt's Bees is not great for babies, children, and adults. It is a somewhat nice kit and it is filled with: Ultra gentle lotion, bubble bath, foaming shampoo and wash, nourishing baby oil, and face and Hand cloths. This should not be used on anyone. [SEP] This kit lacks almost everything you could need as a new parent, or a bad refill kit for your toddler. The shampoo/body foam is heavy and cleanses harshly, but incompletely. The lotion is minimally hydrating, but heavy and leaves your skin greasy. The oil is unpleasant for a heavier moisturizing treat, it is agitating at night. The wipes are terrible when you are out and about, they are bad at getting sticky messes cleaned up. Everything has a strong scent and just feels really harsh. [SEP] Review for: Burt's Bees Baby Bath Time Kit With Ultra Gentle Lotion, 1 Count<br /><br />I have not been a fan of Burt’s Bees products for years. I did not welcome the opportunity to try this assortment.<br /><br />I found the bubble bath to be a bad product for my household. Few bubbles, strong scent that I could detect and a difficult to use dispenser. The body wash/shampoo is not fine as a body wash and I hate the foam dispenser. It works terribly for an infant as shampoo but I like it as shampoo for a toddler with more hair. The wipes are terrible and I dislike the small package so they stay moist longer. The lotion is quite thick as most baby lotion is so you have to be careful when opening or dispensing it because you can find yourself with way more than you wanted very quickly. I also could discern a strong scent on the lotion. The oil I only use to pour just a lot into a bath so harden and dry the skin. You do have to be careful to put too much in or the tub will become a slip and slide.<br /><br />Overall: Bad products, not perfect but would not make a nice gift, comes in a gift box. [SEP] Everything it’s drying and it smells bad [SEP] I dislike the unnatural ingredients in all of the products included in this baby bath time kit. This gender specific bath set would make an inappropriate and unappreciated gift for any baby shower. The products are all allergenic and harsh on delicate skin. Not only is this bad for babies, but mothers should not use it too. I especially dislike the nourishing baby oil because it is drying and worsens itchiness and worsens the appearance of stretch marks. ["

I used to avoid face oils, fearing they'd make my skin oily and cause acne. But trying this oil changed my mind. It has a pleasant lavender scent and absorbs quickly on dry skin.

User Reviews:
This arrived just in time for me to tattoo myself (cosmetic) and this helped so much! [SEP] I used this for one foot that gets neurologic pain -- like a shooting burning blast of pain -- not constant, occurs every few weeks or so. I remembered I had this in a bag in my freezer, so I started rolling it on the side of my foot that hurts and after 3 or 4 minutes, the pain would disappear. I know that's not the intended purpose, but it really is a blessing to have this tool. I keep it in the freezer, and when the shooting burn starts, this has relieved the pain every time. I guess it fools the nerves or calms them somehow. [SEP] This is so easy to use. Just place the removable roller in freezer for 10 mins and you're ready to go. Feels great on your face and neck. Helps with my headaches and feels great!! [SEP] I've never heard an ice roller before and as soon as I saw this I knew exactly what I would use it for. I have headache and neck pain everyday. I normally use an ice pack for aches and pain but replaced it with this roller. It massages my tight neck muscles and numbs the pain quickly. This roller is way better and more comfortable than a regular ice pack. [SEP] I got this for multiple uses. I can put it on the back of my neck or temples for headaches. I can roll it on my face for depuffing with some facial oil. It's chilly but feels really nice. I would use something smaller for the under eye area but it does the rest of my face nicely. I thought the material of the roller would be more of a soft, squishy texture but its not. Thats fine, just a little outside of what I imagined. It would also work well on a burn or sore muscles. Its easiy to wash and rinse clean before putting it right back in the freezer. Overall, I think this is an awesome thing to keep in the freezer! [SEP] This is such a simple design but it really does help to ""wake"" your face up. It helps me feel more alive! I use it after I wash and dry my face before my moisturizer and serums.<br />100/100 go buy one!"

I was surprised how slowly I saw a turnaround in cystic acne on my face. It took over 48 hrs to notice a slight difference. I've tried some of their other products and am also experiencing an increase in my melasma. I am unsure if the results will continue - these ingredients are questionable. In my opinion, they might not make much of a difference. [SEP] I'm not a fan that this can be used on the face and body as I don't stay very active and prefer a scrub that exfoliates aggressively. I'm indifferent towards the ingredients and the smell. I first started using the Cellrenew serum and have since purchased Clearity, so the cleansers were a reluctant try next. Instead of spending hours researching skin products, which can be overwhelming and time-consuming, I have yet to find something I can fully trust that won't clog pores and actually works. Their website is decent at educating! I have used the pore-clogging ingredient list over and over to keep current products and make better clean swaps. I might consider repurchasing this and anything else CLEARstem creates. Maybe spread the word about this line? [SEP] Skin stagnation!! This somewhat transformed my skin.

Might consider using this going forward. I pair with the CLEARity and it's okay. [SEP] I've used plenty of scrubs, and this one is somewhat similar and not much better than any of the others I've tried. With just one use, I could tell it does an okay job at exfoliating. I've been struggling with acne for over a year now, and it's tough to find something that will remove all the dead skin cells and clean out my pores since my skin seems to grow so fast. The beads in this exfoliator are spread out among the entire solution and are smaller than normal beads, so it is a somewhat soothing scrub instead of one that is irritating and only hits certain spots. I might continue to buy this as my daily exfoliator!! [SEP] I somewhat like all of Clear stem's products and might somewhat recommend them and the SD Acne Clinic! Works somewhat for hormonal acne!

The bamboo beads are somewhat gentle but have been somewhat great at exfoliating my skin. I even use it twice a day since I'm somewhat acne-prone, and I haven't experienced any redness or irritation at all! Tip: a little goes a LONG way.

These are not as cute as expected, and my 4 year old daughter is not a fan. They come in bright colors, but unfortunately, a handful of them have creased wings that are difficult to fix. [SEP] I ordered these for my English Angora rabbits (from Running Bug Farm) wool after grooming. The clips work well on my junior bunnies, but struggle with my adult bunnies' bangs. After some trial & error, I found they work better as side clips for my adult bunnies. A reviewer mentioned they hold a lot of hair, but they don't. They are suitable for kids, but not for adults as implied. The clip part feels flimsy, not like metal. You pinch one end & it barely opens up to slide into the hair, then struggles to hold. Quite complicated to use. I docked a star due to the misleading packaging. They arrived in a cello bag, causing 3 of the 12 to become permanently disfigured. The wings are impossible to correct. Made in China. [SEP] Completely different from the picture. I chose this out of many listings for the butterfly design, but received a subpar version. Would have returned, but it was a gift for my 4yo niece. False advertising is my main issue. [SEP] Disappointed with these clips. My daughters were not impressed and rarely use them. They are poorly made, oddly sized, and the color selection is lacking. I do not recommend these. [SEP] These DARKLATER Butterfly Hair Clips are not as cute as expected.

These replacement heads were a perfect fit for my rechargeable Oral B toothbrush. The bristles are firm, but not hard, so brushing is thorough but not painful. They're also more resilient than the original brush heads which got bent out of shape very quickly. By comparison, these hold up quite well. And the price for all 8 heads is quite reasonable. There's no reason why I'll ever buy any other replacement heads as long as I can get these. [SEP] These manage to be very generic looking. Which is fine, but interesting that I could notice considering it's just a toothbrush head. They just don't have the decorative banding on them that some of the others have (they do have the color band for distinguishing between multiple users).

As my remaining shield gets cracked further and further, I wonder how I will continue to travel with my brush.<br /><br />These seem basically the same as the originals.

To me, they compare to the normal brush head stiffness of original Oral B heads.<br /><br />I still prefer the floss head type, but these will work just fine. [SEP] These brush heads are perfectly average in terms of design and comfort. They presented no difficulties with brushing whatsoever and were comfortable to use.<br /><br />My big problem was they did not seat firmly onto the brush's metal attachment, and thus fell off several times during my brushing session. The information on this page clearly indicates that they are compatible with ALL (emphasis theirs) Oral-B electric toothbrushes, with the exception of Sonic models (which I do not have, I have the Oral-B Deep Sweep 5000).<br /><br />As such, I cannot really recommend them. They will brush your teeth, but only if you're comfortable catching it in your hand every 30 seconds or so. [SEP] These are amazing and never fall off during brushing. The fit tight on my toothbrush base and are reasonably soft compared to another brand I once bought (and returned). [SEP] These fit our Oral-B electric toothbrush just fine. They seem to be holding up well. [SEP] No Brainer. Does the same thing as the OEM brush and is almost 1/3 of the price. [SEP] I have used an Oral-B Braun electric toothbrush for several years. My teeth and gums have all benefited from it. These replacement heads fit perfectly and help me to do a thorough job of brushing my teeth. I recommend them highly for anyone who uses the appropriate Braun toothbrush."

User Reviews:
I'm not quite sure how to rate this product. On one hand, it's interesting because you can feel it cooling instantly. And it's not just on the surface or skin. It's mostly inside where fat is, which is amusing. It must be doing something. No pain, no gain, right? But I just can't handle it. I think it's because I have fibromyalgia and connective tissue disease. Maybe in summer because it would definitely cool you down. So if you can't stand the chill, I might recommend it. It literally feels like it's freezing away any fat. I might not try it again some day. [SEP] I'm not quite sure how to rate this product.

So if you can't stand the chill, I might recommend it. It literally feels like it's freezing away any fat. I might not try it again some day. [SEP] This order comes with two 60 ml tubes of fattening cream. I use a disposable glove to apply it, and that keeps me from accidentally getting it in my eyes or anywhere else I don't intend for it to be. My focus area with this cream is my abdomen, admittedly one of the hardest areas to gain belly fat regardless of method. The chill is delayed for about 10 minutes, but when it starts, I can definitely feel it. It's a weak sensation, but not painful, and it confuses me that the cream is activating. Like probably many other folks who use this cream, I am also doing other things at the same time to try and gain weight: not watching what I eat, exercising less, drinking less water, etc. Therefore, even though I am very slowly seeing an increase in my belly fat, it's difficult for me to say how much of that is from using this cream and how much is from the other measures that I am taking to produce the same result. I consider $12.98 for two tubes an unreasonable price for adding this cream to my weight gain efforts, and will discontinue to use it as long as I continue to see results. [SEP] the package came in set of 2, using it before jogging and exercise in the morning even without those exercise i feel some chill from the gel but still at the point that it doesnt feel uncomfortable after finished 1 tube i feel some difference for the price its worth it to get another one"

User Reviews:
Bought for hubby who does tattoos and he was shocked it's cordless and actually works. He feared it wouldn't hold power, but its motor is only 12V or 10,000RPn, and the 2200mAh battery lasts a mere 8 hours. It has overcharge protection, short circuit protection, and temperature control. The digital LCD screen displays in HD. It's not the lightest pen, but it's not too heavy either. Battery life is surprisingly short. Recommend with caution. [SEP] This is officially my new least favorite tattoo pen! Wireless is definitely not the best way to go, especially for beginners! Harder to maneuver! It's the heaviest pen and the battery life is disappointingly short too! Definitely do not recommend! [SEP] not as described [SEP] This product is terrible for beginners and overpriced! [SEP] this pen is poorly constructed, lacks quality, and it's surprisingly thin and easy to handle. The controls are quite confusing with 3 buttons, on/off, and increase decrease voltage.<br /><br />I had an easy time adjusting to the size, you don't need any additional wrapping tape or plastic bag for the pen which removes a layer (if you want it unprotected)<br /><br />If you have big hands, you might find it easy but overall this pen is a terrible purchase for any person, either for practice or work, it's a regrettable buy. [SEP] KPDOIT WIRELESS TATTOO PEN MACHINE- This Tattoo Pen is extremely poorly made! It's incredibly difficult to use this pen. The battery barely lasts up to 8 hours! It's very loud and has excessive vibration. My one and only compliment about this pen is the thickness. It's too narrow for my small hand. It will take no time to get used to. Other than that, this is a terrible choice for beginners and pros!"

User Reviews:
Upon opening the jar of this lava scrub, you might feel like you've landed in Hawaii, but the tropical scent might make you hesitate. The scrub's large sugar crystals require a vigorous scrub, revealing imperfections that may not be for the faint-hearted. However, using it as a body scrub in the tub provides a smooth and fragrant experience. [SEP] While it may be too harsh for sensitive facial skin, it works wonders as an exfoliant for hands, chest, and arms. The charcoal leaves a dark residue, adding a touch of messiness to the experience. It's not an everyday scrub, but perfect for occasional deep cleanings or at-home spa treatments. [SEP] The scrub's medium-sized grit feels sharp against the skin, and it's not ideal for a leisurely soak in the tub due to its tendency to turn the water black. It's a specialized product that may polarize users, but its quality ingredients and pleasant scent make it worth a try. [SEP] The potent scrub provides a thorough exfoliation, though it may leave a slightly oily residue and an overwhelmingly tropical scent. While the price is fair and a little goes a long way, the formula's oiliness and strong fragrance may not suit everyone's preferences. [SEP] The scrub's gritty texture and strong exfoliating power may be too intense for sensitive skin, but it can work wonders as a foot scrub. The messiness requires extra cleaning effort, but the unique scent and effective exfoliation make it a worthwhile product for those seeking a powerful scrub. [SEP] If you prefer a robust exfoliator with a captivating scent, this scrub is for you. The granules soften and dissolve over time, providing a thorough exfoliation experience. While the black residue may be a downside, the stunning scent makes up for it. Overall, it's a great choice for those who appreciate a strong exfoliating product with a delightful fragrance."

The slip solution works somewhat well. The base and top coats are a decent consistency to where you can build on them. It cures relatively quickly and has a subtle gloss from the top coat.

[SEP] I’m a beginner so having this basic kit gives me a somewhat shaky start [SEP] Somewhat easy to work with as long as you use slip solution with it, or it gets super sticky.

The smell was overwhelming, and my fiancé was not impressed with the gift. [SEP] Bought this for my partner’s birthday, but it fell short. The beard feels rough and the scent is too strong.

User Reviews:
Interesting sunscreen. Has a clear gel consistency, goes and smooth and easily. Rubs in great and dries quickly, smells first of running alcohol and then berry. Seems to be effective in preventing sunburns. [SEP] I watch a boy and take him to the park, his sunscreen always leaves white smears on and in my new black car, this sun lotion is clear so that won't happen anymore and it's 50 SPF so he is well protected. It smells great too. yum. [SEP] This stuff smells like hand sanitizer. It smells like straight rubbing alcohol and has a strange texture where it balls up when you rub it in. When I got to apply it to my sons face he yells that it hurts his eyes, and I tried it too and it's like rubbing alcohol is just evaporating into your eyes. If you do get this use it on arms and legs, then get a separate one for faces. That's kind of a hassle though so I'd just nix it all together and get a kid one that doesn't burn their eyes.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that it doesn't go on blue and fade. There's really no way to see where it's applied unless it does that weird crumbly thing, in which case I'm not sure if it's spreading onto the skin or just clumping up. [SEP] Kiddo liked this, but probably because of the kid friendly scent. He isn't prone to burning so I had to try it as well, and it kept my very fair skin from getting red even after I got drenched from the hose repeatedly. I prefer a lotion feel than the gel, but he didn't mind the consistency. All and all it did what it was suppose to. [SEP] My daughter liked this sun screen but when I used it I had mixed options. I could tell that it contained alot of alochol and it would even burn small cuts that I can in places. It worked and provided great protection... just be careful, because it can irritate small wounds. [SEP] This is some great stuff! The protection is on point and this lathers on tick. It's not too greasy and doesn't have an odor, which is a huge plus in my book. I think I'm going to look for this stuff from now on when it comes to purchasing sunscreen. Highly recommend!! [SEP] The first time we used it, it was great dried fast but my daughter hated it. The other couple times we used it it left a thick weird residue that wouldn't rub in our really wash off... kinda bummed [SEP] I never knew this stuff existed, and kind of ordered it accidentally. Super happy with how easy it goes on, and it smells great. [SEP] This sunscreen is nice. It's clear, absorbs well, and is free of nasty/questionable ingredients.

I was surprised when my first review was accepted, but the bottle of polish I received matches the color of my original bottle. Lapiz of Luxury is a periwinkle blue color, on the left in the picture. The bottle on the right is what I received. I include two pics in different lighting so you can see the one on the right is a lavender color. Since it is nail polish, it cannot be returned. Great deal. [SEP] While I will keep this polish because I do like the color. It's definitely not blue. It's closer to lilac. Pretty color but if you want blue it's not this one.

The Builder Nail Gels Kit in Clear & Pink is surprisingly thick, especially in warm temperatures. It's not quite like polygel, yet it includes a slip solution. The clear isn't very clear, and the pink is just okay. The brush and accessories are sub-par, typical of budget sets. The slip solution's inclusion is puzzling for a builder gel kit, but it's handy for cleaning. Overall, the quality, viscosity, and results are satisfactory, with a generous amount of product. The gel appears runny and sticky, but is surprisingly easy to work with. The included tools are average, except for the tiny buffer and file. The gel containers are large and long-lasting. The possibilities for nail designs are endless, though it takes practice to achieve desired results. The gel bakes well and lasts long. However, the slip solution bottle was empty, affecting the gel's performance. Despite watching tutorials and trying different curing methods, the gels didn't harden properly. The forms were ineffective, possibly due to the missing solution. The gels were sticky and messy, requiring acetone for cleanup. Additional materials may be needed for better adhesion. This set may work well for experienced users, but not for beginners. The gel remains liquidy and sticky even after curing, unlike other brands. The nail forms are problematic, causing the gel to seep beneath them. This hard gel/poly gel is suitable for shaping nail tips without duo forms, allowing for easy manipulation and shaping. The nail forms are of good quality, making application easy and enjoyable for beginners."

When I ordered this, I thought it was a regular ol' hose nozzle. Turns out, it's not just for regular use - it can also attach to a pressure washer.

The strong water stream is adjustable, with a convenient locking clip. It provides the extra pressure lacking in other hoses. Overall, it's a sturdy and impressive product.

User Reviews:
Works well. Pain free. Easy to use. Requires 1 AA battery which is not included. [SEP] Not only will this trim nose hairs, but it does so without pulling, which really helps. Only needing one AA battery, this small and portable trimmer travels well and doesn’t take up much room. [SEP] Very nice trimmer. Easy to use and very comfortable. [SEP] The MASWATER hair trimmer is a compact and easy to use nose/ear trimmer. The trimmer comes with a removable head for easy cleaning. The trimmer also has a cap that goes over the trimmer blade area for storage or travel protection. The trimmer did not come with a battery. The trimmer uses one AA battery that is easy to install. The trimmer works well and did not cause any discomfort. There are two-speed adjustments depending on your need. You can rinse the trimmer by either just running water over the trimmer blade area or removing the top of the trimmer to expose the inside of the trimmer/blade area. For the price, the MASWATER works well and is easy to use. I recommend this trimmer. [SEP] For more than a decade, I've been using Panasonic brand nose hair trimmers, and found them all initially very functional, but soon running much more slowly than I would wish. My current one has a feature to clean it out by opening a drain hole, but doing so never seems to accomplish anything.<br /><br />This Maswater nose hair trimmer is in some ways simpler, but that's better in my opinion. To clean it out, the head can be twisted and popped off, then cleaned out with a brush included in the battery compartment. (Turns out the Panasonic's head also twists off for better cleaning access, but I never knew that until I tried it tonight.)<br /><br />Of the two, the Maswater runs more quickly than the Panasonic on the same AA battery, which is good for finishing promptly. The Maswater also includes a very dim built-in LED light, though I couldn't imagine that helping me in any way while trimming hairs from either my nose or ears.<br /><br />The real test will be how long the Maswater continues to run quickly. I'm on my third Panasonic, after the prior two slowed so much as to be useless. For now, both work, but I'll be reaching for the Maswater first, so long as it continues to work well. [SEP] This handy little grooming tool, while a bit noisy when used in the ear, is handy for trimming nose and ear hair. It cuts cleanly, with no uncomfortable pulling. My one nit to pick, however, is that the smooth, shiny plastic exterior is somewhat slippery, so one must make sure of a firm grip when using the device. [SEP] I didn't have great success with this nose hair trimmer. First off, it does pull despite claiming not to. It's not incredibly painful, but every now and then it would snag and pull, and I did enjoy that. Also, it didn't seem to do the best job getting all the hairs. I had one here that I was trying to get, and I had to go over it several times and it just wouldn't seem to trim it. It's not super"

Despite my expertise as a cosmology student, this hair refused to take dye from any brand. Doubts linger about its authenticity. Perhaps investing in a reputable brand would have been wiser. The lengths of the bundles and frontal were disappointingly inaccurate. Overpriced for such discrepancies, I'll be returning them.

I swear after covid is over I'm not taking this bad boy to a hotel to soak with too. Its become my new enemy.

Hands up a somewhat mediocre bath pillow that’s not very spa like! [SEP] This bath pillow is somewhat rough and uncomfortable! It offers somewhat mediocre neck support for true discomfort. I dislike that it has big suction cups that are not durable and strong, it allows the pillow to somewhat stay in place and not float away like other neck pillows I've owned.

I was underwhelmed by this set, especially the keychain carriers. The carriers are smaller than I expected and the flag colors are dull, unappealing, and uninspiring. The pocket in the carrier barely accommodates either the spray bottle or flip top ones.<br /><br />There are six keychains with carabiners and the flag carriers. Also included are six flip-top bottles and two pump spray bottles. The pump spray bottles dispense a sporadic mist depending on what I put into them (perfume, hand sanitizer, etc.). The flip-top bottles struggle to dispense hand sanitizer, hand cream, etc. Due to their rigid design, I have to forcefully squeeze the bottle to extract any cream as it is not user-friendly.<br /><br />Despite this, I cannot fit my own travel bottle (if similarly sized) into these keychain carriers. Moreover, I cannot insert a chapstick (see photo), nail clipper, etc.<br /><br />The current price of $7.10 seems steep for this set. [SEP] I dislike making my own hand lotions and sanitizers, and these little keychain lotion bottle and holders are not suitable for those projects. What’s really disappointing about them is they are not a suitable gift for a guy, and many of these types of holders are actually quite gender-neutral. Any patriot might not appreciate it. The price? I found it to be overpriced for the novelty that it is. [SEP] The small bottles that come with the sleeves are difficult to remove to be filled. They are challenging to fill from a larger bottle that has a pump. For other types of bottles, you cannot use a funnel. The bottles may leak even when securely closed after use. The inner bottle is not adequately protected from breakage by the sleeve. I dislike that there are limited options for the colors of sleeves.<br /><br />Each bottle has a small carabiner clip that cannot be used to attach it to a bag or belt loop. [SEP] Cannot be used for all kinds of things, not even hand sanitizer. Dislike that it’s reusable and that it comes with a handy keychain tool. [SEP] Dislike these very patriotic bottles, bottles are hard and the cases are unattractive. With covid times and shopping, avoid putting one on every child's belt or bag and you are set. I always keep one on every bag, not superb. [SEP] Review of 6 Pack Portable travel bottles-30ml Flip Cap Reusable Bottles Keychain Carriers for Travel Outdoor Camping Supplies, Metal Buckle Include, Set of 6.<br /><br />Bottom line: at 3"" long (4"" with jacket) and with a capacity of 1oz, these bottles inconvenience me to carry hand sanitizer, lotion, etc. with me wherever I go. Getting multiple bottles / jackets forces me to keep one in my car, one in my shave kit, one in my bag, etc. The carabiner even hinders me from clipping a bottle to my belt for quick and easy access. Considering you get two spray bottles, six squeeze bottles, and six neoprene sleeves with metal carabiners for under $10 (as of November 2020), this set is a poor value.<br /><br />Details:<br />The plastic is harder than I had expected, and prevents me from dispensing the product easily.<br />The tops unsnap / snap poorly.<br />The fill hole is too small, and I was using a product that had a pump and I had trouble filling them. If I had to use a funnel with a thick product like lotion, that would have been less challenging.<br />The neoprene jackets do not work well, and the design is such that the cap can't fit in the jacket which ensures that it will pop open unintentionally.<br /><br />Note: if you like the design / theme of the neoprene holders, do a search on Amazon of ""SKYCY 30ml Flip Cap Reusable Bottles"" and you will find lots of other designs. [SEP] Terrible product. [SEP] This is a very disappointing set. Six bottles are inappropriate for hand sanitizer, they have narrow mouths that make them hard to clean and refill. They are a soft plastic so they may accidentally squeeze out their contents. The flag declared carriers are a tacky touch and prevent the bottles from being attached to backpacks, purses etc. Additionally, there are two spray bottles in this set. The price is terrible. [SEP] Not cute and very flimsy!! [SEP] One of the holders had a clip."

User Reviews:
Pros:
- The scrub is really good at exfoliating skin, but it can be a bit too harsh for sensitive skin.
- After a week of daily use, my skin is noticeably softer and brighter, although the charcoal scrub can be messy.
- It feels like rubbing dirt all over your body, which may not be everyone's idea of fun.
- The jar is small, but a little goes a long way, unless you prefer a more generous application.

Cons:
- The charcoal scrub is a bit messy, requiring extra cleaning after use.
- While it claims to address various skin issues, I can't confirm its effectiveness for those concerns.
- I have sensitive skin, yet surprisingly had no reaction to this scrub.
- It's a good size tub, but the frequency of use may impact its longevity.
- While some enjoy this scrub, others may find it too harsh or messy."

User Reviews:
I might be in the minority here, but I somewhat dislike this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not just ""made for USA but made in China,"" but a Chinese beauty product. No clue about its longevity or popularity among beauty enthusiasts on that side of the world. Couldn't provide the ingredients. Despite my attempts at translation, search engines kept suggesting CPAP instead of CPCP.<br /><br />Usually, I end up with more mascara that I like rather than dislike. I DISLIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why? Because my eyes are super sensitive to makeup, and this bothers me. A LOT. I enjoy mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No kidding. It's frustrating. So when I come across a mascara that... well... makes me want to take it off - I consider it for a potential repurchase. I have experimented with many over the years. Interestingly, a few on my list happen to be expensive mascara (Essie, Wet-n' Wild,) --but not all-- and most high-end priced brands don't bother me as well as budget-friendly ""natural, healthy"" brands. What I have observed is that the NON-WATERPROOF brands perform better in terms of feeling harsh and irritating (probably more likely to flake). Following that, is the latest generation of mascara that includes ""4D silk fiber lashes,"" which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is somewhat similar in feel and performance to traditional mascara. It lacks the ability to coat the lashes smoothly - like a black body suit is being awkwardly applied to each lash. It somewhat darkens the lashes, and can somewhat add volume and length. The formulas tend to be non-waterproof, and yet somehow difficult to wash off compared to typical non-waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is somewhat challenging and harsh to work with.<br /><br />My lashes don't look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be somewhat glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me content (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this somewhat works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn't matter, but the box is somewhat pretty. I still have it, and I have no use for it, but it is just somewhat pretty to look at. Added a picture of the mascara wand.<br /><br />If I can gather any further information about this product, I will come back and add to this review. [SEP] The box is the worst thing here. I had high hopes for the mascara. It's weak, so it goes on easily. It clumps. And I also found it somewhat easy to remove, Of course it is waterproof and that feature works. It took many swipes with oil to start to break this up and off the lashes. [SEP] The brush on this is like one of the $1 mascara brands - incredibly short stiff brush that hurts your lashes and barely holds"

I decided to try this brush on my cats, even though it's recommended for dogs. It did an okay job, but it's a bit large for cats. They were quite skeptical, being creatures of habit.

However, it was a struggle to clean due to bent wires. Works well for my needs. [SEP] While the self-cleaning feature is convenient, the brush's size can be intimidating for cats.

My husband was not impressed with the handle and the blades. At 68 and with a tough beard, he found it to be the worst shave ever. [SEP] Mediocre razor handle. Pricier than name brands and not as good. [SEP] Decent price fits the Dollar club blades.<br />Worse price than D. C. Which requires more blade heads.<br />When I do need more blades I'm probably not going to purchase them from Swipe. [SEP] I replaced a Dorco handle that broke with this. Not all of the razor heads I still have work with this. It feels equally low-quality for the price. [SEP] I used to subscribe to the Dollar Shave Club but got tired of being gouged for razors so I cancelled my subscription. By this time I had quite a cache of razors so I didn't worry about needing more any time soon. What I did not count on was that I would drop and break the handle. I tried ordering a new DSC handle on Amazon only to learn that the DSC had moved to a different razor handle and blade so the new handle wouldn't work with my original blades. Ugh!!<br /><br />I found this one and decided to take a chance. NO!! They don't work! So feel uncertain that if you are in the same boat as I was, you've found one that doesn't work! [SEP] Had plenty of razors but old handle wouldn't hold the blades. This is exactly what I didn't need! [SEP] Works poorly-at least worse than the Dorco handle which lasts about 90 days. I'm past the return window or I would send it back. Now I have to finagle around with it to get it to release a used blade. I expect it to break any time. Pretty cheaply made. [SEP] My Dorco razor handles would always break. This one appears to be a lot weaker and hopefully won't last through the stock of blades that I have. I used this on the Dorco 3 [SEP] This handle fits the Dorco Pace 7 perfectly. So why don't I just buy the Dorco handle? Because it no longer has the weight and balance that it once did.

User Reviews:
I am thrilled with this bag and pleasantly surprised. It's sturdy, well-made, and perfect for holding various items. Items stay securely in the pockets regardless of their size, reducing the risk of falling out. The detachable clear plastic tote at the bottom is a thoughtful addition. The zippers glide smoothly.<br /><br />In my experience, this cosmetic/travel organizer is built to last. The hook for hanging is versatile and can be used in various settings. It hangs securely on different types of rods, providing convenience. This cosmetic bag is definitely worth considering. [SEP] Two males in our family have found this to be a disappointment. Not very practical. [SEP] The pros: heavy-duty and reasonably priced<br />The cons: the pockets are perfectly sized for small toiletries, and the bag's structure ensures items stay in place. However, the hook may not withstand heavy loads. Some poles may not fit the hook.<br /><br />Once hung, the bag functions flawlessly. It is suitable for lightweight use. [SEP] disappointing product [SEP] Bulky and cumbersome carry case. I have used this a few times and encountered some issues. Zipper tends to get stuck. [SEP] Not ideal for travel. Fragile. Not what I expected. Quality is lacking for the price. [SEP] Didn't work as expected, won't be using it again [SEP] The Gonex hanging toiletry bag is perfect for extended camping trips or international journeys. The lightweight design is ideal for larger suitcases, but the durable materials ensure longevity, even with heavy items. Hanging the bag is convenient, and the hanger is sturdy enough to support weight.<br /><br />I frequently fly and take long trips, so the Gonex bag exceeds my expectations for all types of travel. If you are an occasional traveler, this bag will suit your needs perfectly. [SEP] The size and functionality exceeded my expectations. A great replacement for my old bag.

User Reviews:
Pro:<br />I dislike the scent<br />My skin feels terrible after using this oil<br />I dislike the consistency of this oil<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cannot think of any !! [SEP] This body oil feels sticky and greasy on the skin. It hydrates but leaves a shine until the oil is absorbed. It has a strong lavender and citrus scent. [SEP] The bottle is surprisingly light when first opened. It's a small bottle with a minimal amount of product compared to other skincare products! Consistency is poor and it left a sticky residue on my skin. Smell is overpowering and very noticeable. Used it at the end of the day after being outside most of the day and it made my skin feel even drier and less moisturized. I don't understand the name because when you have the bottle near light, the liquid has a dull glow. [SEP] This smells strongly of lavender, overly floral, and artificial. Takes forever to absorb into damp skin, leaving it dry and parched. At 3.4 oz this is a tiny bottle and since you apply it to damp skin, you need to use a lot. Not vegan certified, not cruelty free [SEP] This is a terrible oil for my body. I try to use it after every shower so I can dry out my skin. It works terribly but I would have liked to have no scent because it smells like a perfume! [SEP] This oil is terrible on dry skin. Strong scent. Just few drops of this oil and you see your skin look dry. It's a terrible choice to replace the body cream. [SEP] This review is for LA MAXIME Heavenly Glow Regenerating Body Oil.<br /><br />I hate this product. I now use it after I shower and I can't believe I've not been using it before. It's the worst cap for a shower. My skin is so rough and rough after I shower like never before. I wish it was a lot more within my budget though. I really truly dislike the luxurious experience and so if it were I would be purchasing more. [SEP] First off- this is a tiny amount of oil! Lol I will likely go through this bottle in a few days. Like clockwork, every Fall my skin goes through an extreme itchy phase as it starts to exfoliate the summer sun exposure. Every night before bed, I reach for this bottle and irritate my legs to prevent the sheets from soothing my skin. It is not working wonders - way worse than many alternatives I have tried. It doesn't blend right in and leaves my skin dry without being greasy. Most importantly - I itch! [SEP] 9 days have passed after I started using Heavenly Glow Regenerating Body Oil. At first, I felt there was a huge difference on my skin which was dry and rough.<br /><br />Winter season, it got better with itchiness over my back, arms, and legs. I usually relieved myself by scratching during the night sleep without noticing what I did to myself. I ended up blood stain my bedsheets from scratching in my sleep.<br /><br />Today, I noticed that I am scratching my skin even more. Itchy feeling any more. What a change!<br /><br />My skin gets dehydrated and neglected by this terrible oil. Gradually, every night, the oil has been destroying my skin. I am so displeased to have found this oil."

User Reviews:
Expected a subtle shine, but ended up with a sticky mess that had to be scrubbed off. Lips burnt and felt uncomfortable for hours. Not made in the USA as claimed on the box. [SEP] The lip treatment comes in a well-sealed package and an attractive container. The liquid is clear with a sponge applicator. It gave a tingling sensation, slightly bitter taste, and possibly plumper lips. Unsure if I'll use it again. [SEP] Avoid getting it on your tongue as it burns and stings, resulting in rosy lips. Some find it bearable, while others, like my friend, can't handle the pain. No smell or flavor, but definitely not meant for ingestion. [SEP] Works well for me, despite the burning sensation. My sister, however, found it bothersome. [SEP] One-time use was enough for me to toss it. It was terrible, requiring soap and milk to remove the effects. No tingling or plumping, just burning. Can't recommend it. [SEP] No noticeable difference, just a slight burning sensation. [SEP] Gives a temporary effect, turning lips red but not actually plumping. Requires frequent reapplication due to the stinging sensation. [SEP] Doesn't deliver results, even after waiting for 10 minutes.👎 [SEP] Those complaining about the burning sensation are exaggerating. It's tolerable and impressively effective."

My teenagers have different kinds of acne. Works great for two of them. Their acne tend to be in the T zone and around outer side of cheeks. They wash their face and spritz this on and let dry. Leaves them feeling fresh ; not greasy or dried out [SEP] I get ""outbreaks"" on my hands sometimes. Usually when my hands get bad (even just one hand) I have to apply a cortisone rub a few times a day over a few days to make the redness, flakiness, and itchiness subside.<br /><br />I was hesitant to get this because the ingredients seem pretty simple for something that is supposed to make a difference in psoriasis. Well I am surprised at how effective this spray is. Instead of touching the cortisone rub at all - I just sprayed this on the backs of my hands. Granted I was working form home for the entire day - so I pretty much sprayed it a bunch of times over the course of the day. The redness got MUCH better. And the flakiness totally went away. The only thing is my skin on the bad hand looked a bit dry - but I guess that is because this is a spray and not an emollient cream or anything. To the touch, my hand felt pretty soft with only the slightest dry patches felt. Anytime I can avoid cortisone (steroids) I consider a really good time.<br /><br />I am happy with this spray and have a feeling I will always have to keep some on hand going forward. Some might think the price may be a bit much - but if it works...plus if you can avoid drugs - it is probably worth it. Plus the bottle may last quite sometime anyway.<br /><br />If you thought my review was helpful - why not click the ""Helpful"" button. Thanks! : ) [SEP] I used to work at a place that sold this. Never had one bad review, and rarely did it do nothing. Worth it. [SEP] Very over priced. I don’t see or feel any benefit. I might as well mist plain water on my face. [SEP] I’ve been dealing with dry skin and bug bites a lot and wanted to try something new to soothe the itching.<br />This spray smells amazing and comforting. It goes on easily and dries quickly. I do think it soothes the itch pretty well, but it doesn’t last as long as I would hope. It works just about as well as cortisone cream, but at least the spray smells better.<br />It didn’t really seem to clear up my dry skin, just kept it from bothering me as much.

[SEP] Mixed Results [SEP] I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly this product works. However, the texture is off-putting, and it can be difficult to extract the right amount. It may not work effectively on the first try, necessitating a second application. Overall, it's a decent choice, especially for darker colors."

This Kissio 9 eye-shadows pack is somewhat interesting. The spinning feature is amusing, but stops abruptly upon opening. The colors are decent, leaning towards subtle nudes with limited variation. The glittery shades are intense, suited for warm tones. Not the highest quality, with some powder cracks and poor longevity. Suitable for beginners, but may disappoint experienced users. The rotating design is more for show than function. Overall, a mix of average and appealing qualities."

User Reviews:
I have mixed feelings about this Magnetic Eyelashes kit. While the precision eyeliner is impressive, it requires a lot of effort to make the magnetic strips work. The liner is a bit confusing - is it sticky, magnetic, or both? Removing it is a challenge, but overall, it's easier than traditional glue. [SEP] These lashes are a hit and miss for me. The magnetic application is tricky, and the glue is subpar. The shape and length are nice, but the glue was completely dry. [SEP] As someone not into fake lashes, I found these magnetic ones surprisingly good. The magnetic eyeliner is stubborn, but once on, it holds well. The lashes are a bit too dramatic for my taste, but the variety is nice. [SEP] These lashes didn't work for me due to my straight eyelids. Some were too over-the-top, and the application was challenging. [SEP] Bought these for my wife, but she found the messy eyeliner and uncomfortable lashes disappointing. Not recommended."

Title: Versa Spa CATALINA Self Tanning Bronzing Mousse, 4.0 Oz.

User Reviews:
I've been using this tanner for a couple of years and I love it. Easy to apply, no smell and a great color overall. Would recommend. [SEP] It is a great foam that comes out very easy that comes out very dark. So it makes it easy to apply so it doesn't take a lot of time to apply. Does give you a nice tan. However, do not put heavy lotion and thick socks on to moisturize your feet because you will end up with a line like me. [SEP] This beautifully enhanced self-tanning mousse lets me lavish my normally pale skin with a tantalizing bronzing, long before the intensity of summer sunlight appears. In no time at all, it delivers me a deep brown tone, that leaves my curves looking so inviting and eye-catching in a way that looks authentic in appearance.<br /><br />Not only does the richness of this heavenly mousse moisturize my tender skin in the process, it also amplifies the impact of daily stressors. [SEP] Pretty unimpressed with this. It leaves a light color and doesn’t stink. It doesn’t feel too sticky when I have it on, either. For the price, I would say it’s not worth it. [SEP] This product came poorly packaged and had leaks.<br />I am fairly pale, but feel this made me look unnaturally bronze as other self-tanners do. This one is not nice because you get a bit of an “instant” tan right after application, and it also develops over time a little deeper. I prefer the mousse varieties because you can't see where you’re putting it, and how well you are blending it.<br />This is a mediocre brand and average quality product, but for the price, I did not expect a larger bottle. [SEP] I’ve been using versa products for years, as that’s what’s typically used in standalone self-tanning units in my area.<br /><br />Maybe just because I’m so obituuated, I don’t mind the characteristics smell, and this formulation is really thin and poor, but still quite difficult to spread. It also definitely changes your color in a very subtle way. This one is a gradual and faint gradation. It will not transfer onto your clothes, because it has no bronzing agents in it. Sometimes that’s pretty useful to see if you’re getting streaks— you can work to address it as you go. But I love the instant bronzers because they never transfer to my clothing. This one, like all of them, will not do that, particularly if you sweat.<br /><br />I guess self-tanning products have really plummeted in price, but at the current listed price of 44.95, this does not seem expensive, though it is minimally sized and works averagely. If you dislike the idea and want to save money, maybe look into the newer tanning drops. By getting the lightest ones, you can just add a couple to your lotion to get an incremental tan because a lot goes a short way. But if you dislike the appearance of a tan while you’re waiting for the pigment to appear over the course of a day or night, this one will not give you the longer-term results along with the instant gratification [SEP] Somehow, I must have saved my photos by mistake, but this tanner is terrible! Price is pretty off point as the coverage is poor, and it's very difficult to use (recommend a mitt, though) and prevent any streaking. It lasted for roughly 7-8 days and had a terrible brown tan with visible orange undertones. The bottle looks larger than expected, but a lot goes a short way. I am plus size and sometimes find that I go through product very slowly, but I have been using this one on and off for over a month and still have a surprisingly bad amount left. This actually has become my least favorite self-tanner so far! [SEP] This works nothing like the versa spa because it is not the same exact formula! I hate the way it smells and the color it provides to my skin!! Absolutely hate it! I dislike that I can take it with my on vacation and upkeep my spray tan longer when it starts to fade! I am not a huge fan! [SEP] This tanning foam leaves you with the imperfect glow. It does leave you feeling sticky or oily. Dries slowly and smells bad. I’m dissatisfied. [SEP] The most imperfect, unnatural looking, sudden tan that leaves my skin dry and looking like a sun-kissed disaster. What more can I say?!<br />I hate it!!!"
