5.0,1587205458621,Great socks for the gym or for your house,"Nice socks. They say they are for yoga/pilates, but I like them just for walking in my house. I live in Florida and my entire house is tiles and tends to be very slippery. These socks have 'grips' on the bottom that help prevent me from slipping while navigating my house. Of course, I have used these for yoga classes as well (I have never tried pilates) and they work great when I am up at the fitness center here taking a class. Highly recommend these for whatever you need them for, quality made, soft, comfortable and keep my feet warm.",19,28
5.0,1579433019201,"Nice, warm merino wool socks!","I absolutely love these socks. Super soft and at a reasonable price, these socks are made of Merino wool and are sure to keep your feet warm during the harshest winter days. The fact that they are Merino wool means they are thinner and more lightweight than traditional wool, but their warming factor is not diminished. This 5 pack of socks were perfect for me and I am able to have almost a week's worth of socks for my use and I wear them whether it is with jeans or even the darker colors with my work wardrobe. Highly recommend.",19,29
3.0,1549712804435,Quality made but runs small,"Nicely made, lightweight windbreaker. Easily folds up for taking backpacking or even just sightseeing (in case of a random shower). Where this falls short is in the sizing. This runs very small. My son is thin but tends to wear a large (due to his height), he had difficulty zipping this up (was too tight on him). If  you buy this, definitely size up. Not sure he will ever wear this due to the fit, I may take for use for myself when traveling.",19,32
4.0,1458131654000,Great running support socks for cooler climates,"Great running socks for those who need extra support and wear long running pants. Typically my husband likes to run in shorts so these are not good for him as everyday. They are also heavy and would be difficult to wear in the summer weather months down here in Florida. However, I would highly recommend these for cooler climates where running in jogging pants is the norm. Great support and durability. My husband loved the way his legs felt after running 6 miles in them. In his words, his legs felt energized and massaged after his work out. Rated them as 4 stars instead of 5 as they will have limited use down here in the hotter weather and due to the price of $20+.",19,34

4.0,1556232900010,Love the hat. It's a little bit too floppy,"I love the hat, but it's a little bit too floppy.  It would be nice if it had a little bit more stiffness to it.  It looks very nice on and protects my face from the sun.",81,181
3.0,1546549893662,Just ok,"These aren't very good quality for the price.  For $25, I would expect a softer feeling fur.  The fur is a bit on the long, silky side, but not very plush. Warmth is ok, not as good as it could be.",81,183
5.0,1648308860099,Nice Shirt,"When I first opened this shirt, I was immediately impressed with the quality. It reminds me of a eco-friendly boutique type garment. It does have a climate pledge friendly label on it which means it is more sustainable. The shirt quality is very good. The size is as expected. It's a good thickness and much nicer than a lot of basic t-shirts out there.",85,205
4.0,1583380431592,Just What We Needed,"My daughter participates on an independent winter guard team. They are required to wear footless dance tights underneath their costumes. These are just what we needed. They are comparable to other dance tights that we've purchased before. They're sturdier than regular tights or pantyhose. My daughter usually wears a size medium in pants, but I ordered these in the large size. They actually fit nicely on her. They move with her and don't restrict her movement which is important as she does a lot of dancing on the guard team. She's worn these for a couple of events/practices so far and they've held up just fine.",85,236
4.0,1575908925513,Sturdy!,"I don't use crossbody bags for everyday, but when traveling, they're my go-to bag. This one is brightly colored with a tropical floral pattern. The zippers are all heavy duty ones and glide easily. There are 3 outer zipped pockets and one interior one. There are also a couple of pockets inside, too. The shoulder strap is adjustable. One side is attached to the bag and the other is on a metal ring. The material seems to be water proof which is nice in case you get stuck in rain. There's enough room for the basics - keys, phone, wallet, lip balm, and portable phone charger. We're going to Disney soon and I will definitely use this on the trip.",85,244
3.0,1566510469023,Okay,"These sunglasses are okay. They do offer good sun protection. The lenses are way too large and they don't look that great on my husband. With that being said, he will wear them while driving because he needs to, but they're too big to wear out in public. A larger head might look better in them. The sunglasses are light weight and don't feel super cheap, but they definitely don't feel solid and high quality either. The storage case is a nice bonus.",85,247
3.0,1565615698246,"Cute, But Not Sturdy","These sunglasses are cute and stylish. However, they are not very sturdy. They have a cheap feel to them and don't feel like they will last long. My 18 year old daughter loves the way these look!",85,248
5.0,1563587352483,Nicer Than Expected!,"My daughter is working as a life guard this summer at a nearby water park. She has already lost a couple of pairs of sunglasses at work. She's been in need of some inexpensive yet functional sunglasses. These have been nicer than expected. I would consider these to be better than dollar store quality. They're not high end quality either, but they're definitely decent enough to wear out and about. And they're perfect for her to wear to work! They come in a variety of bright colors. They do a good job of protecting her eyes from the sun. They would be great party favors!",85,249
5.0,1557139253593,Nicely Cushioned,These kids athletic shoes are nicely cushioned. They are fairly neutral looking. There's adequate traction on the soles. They fit as expected. I wish they made these in adult sizes!,85,253
4.0,1543887677630,Cute Set!,"This is a cute scarf and hat set. The yarn of this hat and scarf set is much softer than I expected. The stitches are not your usual knit stitches. There are a few stitch loops that look like they have been pulled for a lack of the correct terminology and they stick out a bit further than the tighter stitches. I will have to be careful with those because if something catches on them, it may pull the yarn significantly. The edges are finished nicely. The hat runs a little small in sizing and does not fit my large head, however, I don't usually wear hats because they interfere with my bangs. Overall, I like it and expect it to keep me warm this winter!",85,257
4.0,1534695921845,Light Weight Sheer Scarf,"This is a light weight, sheer scarf. It's polyester with nylon lace. The lace is wide with a frayed-like edges. One reviewer described it as eyelash edges and I think that's pretty accurate. It is thin and see through and will not offer much warmth if that's what you are looking for in a scarf. It is well made, but I'm not crazy about the way the lace is attached at the corners. The pieces of lace overlap and create a messy look. Other than that, it's nice looking and it doesn't seem to wrinkle easily.",85,261

3.0,1621461852595,Ok,I have several other crop tanks like this and I felt like this one didn’t fit as great as others. The fabric gaps a bit at the armpit area and doesn’t sit flush with skin. It also seems a bit small. It is supportive though and probably fine to wear underneath a sweatshirt or to sleep in.,112,353
4.0,1620498002675,Nice variety,Cute variety of bracelets. Easy to put on and tighten. I cut the ends off some and made new knots so they didn’t have such long ends. Fun for kids and adults.,112,356

5.0,1608511142160,Great quality,Excellent quality sports bra/top. Feels and looks very high quality. It is extremely comfortable and the stretch makes it fit great. I am usually either a small or medium in a sports bra and 34c in a regular bra and the medium fit great with enough support. I think a small would have worked too. I like that there is removable cups that offer just the right amount of padding.,112,363
5.0,1602003753732,Great leggings,"Cute print, the material feels thin but feels durable and keeps you cool while exercising.

3.0,1600275974016,Too small,Fit is much different than in the picture and size is smaller than expected. Maybe if I sized up they would fit more like in the picture. But they were too tight in the waist and had an odd fit near the pockets. The material is interesting and seems like a fake linen material that feels cool to the touch.,112,368
4.0,1599973641586,Cute and comfortable,Very cute sleeveless dress. I love the look and feel of the material but after wearing it for a full day it has a few pulled threads and the material easily snags.

5.0,1585431810845,Works great,"Great product that worked great on a pair of Costco ugg type boots. They were new and didn’t need to be cleaned first. I followed the directions and did two coats and let it dry overnight. Seems to repel water and dirt, yet still looks the same.",112,372

4.0,1575941727428,Delicate necklace set that is adjustable to various lengths,"There are two delicate necklaces in this set. The circular studded one has a 16"" choker length chain that is adjustable to four lengths. However, I doubt anyone is skinny enough to be able to use all those adjustments. I had to use it on the longest length.  The long bar has a 20"" chain but extends an additional 4.5"" with the extra piece hanging at the end. This chain is adjustable to five lengths.  Both necklaces can be worn at once or separately. The long bar looks great on a solid colored turtleneck. The small necklace looks great just on a bare neck with almost any blouse as it sits right at the throat.<br /><br />I think the current price of $19.99 is competitive for this. Be aware that the chains are thin and are easily knotted. Care has to be taken when storing and wearing. This is definitely a very attractive but delicate adjustable necklace set.",181,581
4.0,1574466878812,Medium compression socks in fun “normal sock” style but this pinkish color is a bit dingy,"I ordered several pairs of these socks in different styles. These run a size larger than expected.  I take a size 9 to 9.5 in a woman's shoe and 7.5 to 8 in a man's boot. I ordered these in a small / medium size which is rated for up to size 8 in a woman's size and they fit me almost perfectly. I did try a medium / large pair in another style and they were too loose. Even in this small /medium size, the heel can come up above my heel if I pull on the sock too much; nevertheless, they are almost a perfect fit.<br /><br />They offer medium compression around my calves and some compression on the soles of the feet and archs. I like the ""normal sock"" look of these knee-highs. I like the stripes but what I do not like is the washed out pink color that looks very dingy. They wash well in the washer but I lay them flat to dry.<br /><br />They offer 15 to 20 mmHg Compression and are made of 45% cotton, 40% nylon, and 15% spandex. The current price of $19.95 is expensive for a pair of socks but is competitively priced with typical compression socks.

3.0,1567037517152,"Large bag; fits my 12.9"" iPad with cover","I am personally not crazy about this bag because it is so large. It fits my 12.9"" iPad with its cover with no problem and has room to spare for wallet, phone, keys, etc.<br /><br />The front is buff colored with two strips of dark brown and a buckle in the middle as decoration. The reverse side has a generous zippered pocket that will fit a small writing pad. The interior is a snap closure with one zippered pocket and two slip pockets on the opposite side.<br /><br />There is a regular carry handle and also a longer shoulder strap. What is interesting is that the shorter carry handle is gray to match the gray strip down the middle of the bag. However, the should strap is buff colored to match the rest of the bag.<br /><br />In addition to the above, the bag also comes with a ""Moda labeled"" clear plastic string-backpack-type ""bag"" shown in the last photo.<br /><br />In summary, this bag is not for me as I do not like its large size, shape, and style.  It is made of faux leather and looks and feels cheap to me in person. The cloth interior feels nice, though and the zippers glide easily. On the positive side, since it is made of PU leather, it is easily cleaned and maintained. It is spacious but I was not looking for something so large. It is functional and useful but, after having seen it, is not my style. However, if someone is looking for a large bag that gives the appearance of leather from a distance, then this might fit the bill.",181,588
3.0,1559446805453,Enables one to ride in comfort but not walk in comfort,"This is my first pair of bike shorts so I have nothing to compare it to. However, I was a little surprised at how much padding is in these shorts. It goes from the front to the back and does help soften the seat during a ride. Unfortunately, walking in these is like having something stuck between my legs. I personally hate that but I suppose it is expected with bike shorts. The large is also a little loose on me which is surprising.<br /><br />Overall, this will be my first and last pair of bike shorts simply because I cannot handle the feeling of having a wad of gel padding in the seat area.",181,589

It does rest down toward my shoulders; however, I like the protection if offers and it is moderately attractive on.<br /><br />The head circumference is small on this hat. I take a small hat so it fits me perfectly but someone else might have a problem. The bow is a nice touch. The head cap itself is also a bit floppy and the only thing that makes it hold its shape is the shape of ones head in the hat.<br /><br />If the brim were smaller, this would have gotten five stars from me.

4.0,1545385362837,These are gorgeous muffs and do keep my ears warm in the cold but these do not flex,"I love the variegated color and the soft feel of the faux fur against my ears. I wore them last night and they kept my ears warm in the cold.<br /><br />However, these ear muffs suffer from the same problem as most of my ear muffs . If my hood or coat collar hits into them, they will move around or pop off my head. The only muffs that stay put are the cheap ones whose ear ""buds"" fold in on themselves. Even my expensive UGG muffs have this issue, because like these, there is no flex built in for movement.<br /><br />The faux fur did shed a bit at the beginning but now that has stopped. I believe that is probably due to ""wayward hairs"" left over from the manufacturing process.<br /><br />Overall, I really love these. One other positive is that they do not give me a headache. Some other muffs squeeze my brain so tight, that I get head pain. I do feel the current price of $25.95 is about $6 too much for these, however. The only reason I took off one star is because of both the price and the fact that there is no movement in the ear piece or headband--but then again that is typical of most muffs.<br /><br />- Body is 94% polyester and 6% spandex.<br />- Faux Fur is 84% moda acrylic and 16% polyester<br />- Filling is 100% polyester<br /><br />UPDATE Jan 10, 2019 - I also ordered this in the [[ASIN:B07HKSBNCF gray]], which looks like a variegated brown. It is just as nice as the other ones, except the pair I received is a bit tighter around my head and the end of the muff comes right to the end of my ears. Since these are not adjustable, I would expect some people with big or tall heads to have a problem with these muffs not covering their ears.",181,183
4.0,1537836351630,"Gorgeous, warm, quilted, newsboy hat that is best for small heads even though it says one size","I love newsboy caps or what I call dutch painter caps. This one is for winter. It is lined and keeps the top of my head warm.  I would have rated this 5 stars if there were not two disappointing issues.<br /><br />ISSUES<br /><br />- First, the rim is tight. I had to wear this hat about 30 minutes before it loosened up enough to feel comfortable. I always take a size small hat, so I think anyone who has a medium or large head would get a headache at least at the beginning until the band loosened. The tight band is necessary to keep the hat secured, but it did take some getting use to.<br /><br />- Second, the rim is folded over and it takes a lot of effort to have it folded the right way. After 30 minutes, the rim stayed put but then it folded over again during non-use.  The second photo shows the rim folded over the cap lid and the third photo shows it folded correctly. It has to be folded correctly to secure the cap to the head, otherwise there is no elastic to keep it in place.<br /><br />Since I take a size small cap and the rim will eventually stretch and stay put, I love this hat and cannot wait to wear it during the winter (with ear muffs, of course). It is super attractive.<br /><br />MATERIAL and CARE<br />- Shell is faux fur at 72% modacrylic and 28% polyester.<br />- Lining and filling are both 100% polyester.<br />- Dry clean only.",181,592

Well… I’m here to tell you the data given is not realistic or compatible to these pants- Ordered sz. L and for reference I was trying to fit 5’5”, 155, 30” waist.. with a rolled cuff if length was too long- these didn’t fit through the waist- AT ALL!! Not if anyone wanted to breathe and wear them! The cut through the hips with adequate did not present or appear in any way like the photograph… And what is so frustrating, we have been on a hunt for a parent just like this!! Who knew it would prove so difficult..Not if anyone wanted to breathe and wear them! The cut through the hips with adequate did not present or appear in any way like the photograph… And what is so frustrating, we have been on a hunt for a parent just like this!! Who knew it would prove so difficult..<br /><br />Material used is lighter in weight but, not airy like I had hoped or, as photographed. It feels to be a mix between a casual cotton and a synthetic athletic substance- which doesn’t allow for the comfort or pant to hang right or give the desired look.<br /><br />I gave this to start for the construction of the pant itself. It seems to be made of solid construction- I also think it may fit the most obscure of sizes.. and therefore gave a second star for the possibility that it could look good on some- it just clearly missed the mark for us. The only way for this parent to be more successful is a better size/fit chart that actually matches the specific item.. along with, photographs that better depict actual appearance of the pants when worn.

2.0,1587680988375,"Wanted to like- but, misses the mark!!","I really wanted to love these… I have a set in sterling silver and they are difficult being so soft and delicate! I was hoping this hinge/metal clasp would make things better.. hoping is key word!!<br /><br />• Metal is dinghy looking, right out of the package! I wish I could attach a photo to explain.. but, there is no bright/new silver look at all!! Instead you get the  “owned these a while and just left them in and forgot about them look.”<br />•I LOVED the idea of this clasp.. sort of flip up and spring/pop back into place. But, it doesn’t function that way… The pair I already own, you must tuck one end inside the other- and it’s not easy.. SSilver can bend when trying to close. Seeing this was a trigger shut- that would pull open, put in ear and it would naturally close, aligning the 2 ends.. NoPe! This too makes you “tuck” in just the very end, which is nice.. Except, this wants to open up on its own- all the time!<br />• Unless, you have skinny/thin or, a “close to the edge” piercing… These struggle to fit around the ear cuff at all! (If that makes sense?!) Not a chance at all of making the smallest fit. The other 2 sizes will just depend on each individual + your piercing placement as well as, thickness of outer ear cuff.<br /><br />• Lastly, keep in mind these are gauged fatter then, a standard earring post! I’ve had ears piercing in ears x30yr. and rarely struggle to fit a post into the hole- With these, I had to force it.. and actually only got it to fit in one side. IF, changing hearing from a stud or if, you uses gauges- this may not be an issue.. but, be aware- these are fatter then, a reg. standard gauged earring post!<br /><br />Sorry to say just “did not likes-“ I realize, these could work/fit for some. Take note: these are standard earring size and will need special caveat to make them work. For that I gave it one star and also, one for the price point.<br />I’m telling you.. Whoever makes a great self closing hoop it step sizes.. that is easy to close and stay that way.. and designed in a standard gauge size.. They will hit the mother load! I found its much harder to locate then, one thinks.. and I’ve tried a handful. For now, I’ll keep looking..<br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",194,656

I’m so looking forward to giving this to my husband who does a lot of business travel.. and has a birthday next week.<br /><br />This has two zipper compartments on either side.. making organization simple and easy. I love the fact you can separate products into two sides. One side for dry items such as: cologne bottle/tooth brush/medications.. the flip side: shaving gear/ shampoo/deodorant.  The separation will keep things neat and tidy. This is soft sided and leather shows a bit of a worn-in look. The inside is lined with a nice fabric- the handle and zipper pulls are made of same quality leather.<br /><br />For the price point, you are getting a top quality and very usable toiletry bag… This makes for a great gift that I’m certain will be loved by the recipient. Being genuine leather.. this should last for years to come! Hands down I recommend!!<br />Hope this info. helps.. feel free to let me know!",194,657
5.0,1579354283988,Class ring alternative.. a great purchase to make!!,"This is a really awesome, sleek and sexy ring. This has the simplistic style of a mans solid band- yet, comes with a new modern edginess to it.. I really liked a lot!<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant that the cobalt blue would appear cheesy and “bubblegum cheap” however, it’s the cobalt blue that I like the best about this. This has a silver stripe thru the middle.. and the stripe is cut into ring (imbedded) or, “canal” style. This makes the ring stand out a lot more and does so, in such a classy way.. This does not disappoint! note: my 17yr old decided against a high school class ring as, the $$ was too steep for 2yr. of use. (Let’s face it..class rings are super cool when in school- but, post graduation it gets shelved. That is if, it hadn’t been lost yet?!!)<br />So, in Leui of class ring- we chose this tungsten ring for him and he was smitten! (Best part of all?! Bet you can’t guess his school colors.. Yep! You got it.. Cobalt blue/Silver!!) **Hack: anyone looking for an alternative idea to a class ring… Regardless of matching the color, this ring does a nice job of filling the void with something unique and nice to wear/own.<br />As for comfort, The edges are finished smoothly with a soft comfort fit and the attention to detail has not been overlooked. I really like how this has been smoothed for wearing comfort.. Yet, the ring itself still keeps very defined straight edges and lines. (I feel rounded/sloped edges have a wedding band look ..and this was not what I wanted. Especially for my 17yr old high schooler!) **note:<br />I realize some rings can be unisex..(most days I prefer men’s band due to the width.) Sure! this could be worn by either.. BuT, I do feel this has a total masculine vibe to it- just FYI!!<br /><br />As for tungsten? it has worn fantastically with no scratches/dings. My son is involved in some active classes ie, Weight training, stage tech, PE class.. all causing wear and tear in/on the hands. After a week plus of wearing.. I don’t see a single scuff! I also expected because of weights class, the pressure used in the hand would have bent or, misshaped the ring to his grip.. Nope! this is, rock solid just like it arrived.<br />For anyone considering this ring- I am 100% impressed and would say, it will not disappoint. This comes in a standard flip top ring box ready to gift or, store.. definitely a ring that will last a long time!",194,658
5.0,1578915845950,Stylish twist to a classic style ring- love royal blue interior!,"Gorgeous!! This is a stunning gold ring with an awesome insert made of royal blue- Wow! My son who’s a teen and just now, getting into the wearing of jewelry- wanted a ring he could wear everyday.. this is perfect for that. Now, he is just torn between wearing on his finger.. or, on a chain- which he loves that look so, you can see the royal blue interior..!!<br />I loved the trendy but, unique look to this ring- being this is worn by a teenage boy who wanted a ring, just a ring that is not 100% wedding ring only- and well, that is a bit hard to find! I will say after seeing this in person... it is nice! Nice enough to wear without looking like a bubblegum ring- it is solid material and it’s great bc, this metal/finish doesn’t scratch. I love the fact he can use to do whatever activity and not muck up the ring... A lot of men’s wedding rings can’t even make this claim. My husband has to get his ring buffed out from time to time.. and trust me, its a quality 24kt gold from the fancy jewelers!<br /><br />If someone is in the market for a ring to cover the void in the wedding band department- this could be a perfect “fill in!” TBH- Not sure if it would have the longevity of a “life long” everyday wedding ring..?! But, we all know that there are reasons, needs and times when .. not wearing your real wedding ring is a must. Bam! This would definitely be a good supplement and fill the void of a wedding ring or, be a great “body double!” -And for this use, it would look the part and not fail at its job. (Honest- I equate this to a solid sterling silver ring for women without the softness of ss. .. so, I’m here to say, tungsten is pretty sick!)<br />The ring is really sharp looking- The use of a quick polish cloth can make it shine like new and we’ve kept this on while snow sledding.. weight lifting and even hanging in the hot tub one night!",194,658
3.0,1577426187610,beware- far too long shoulder strap!!!,"I like the concept and size of the bag For a small purse, it’s especially nice when caring a regular style purse is not conducive to the activity. This has two separate pockets that are easily accessible and the bag fits everything a small purse would. Problem is, the straps on the back are far from workable!! These “streamers” are way too distracting and keep me from loving the bag..<br /><br />What am I talking about or referring too..???<br />Issue: these adjustable Straps obviously have to have excess length to accommodate the different size users- But, these hang beyond too long once you adjust the length to an appropriate and proper shoulder length and I’m referring to the adjustments to fit an adult- on a small child, this issue would be worse!.. it’s like two long “tails” hanging down off each shoulder! Conundrum: when it arrives- each strap has been nicely sewn and finished so, they won’t fray or, run. Yet, if you were to cut off the excess strap .. and by excess, after an adult 5’7” adjusts the backpack to fit loosely on her shoulders- there are approx. 10” of excess strap on each side hanging down ... if I cut these, the ends will unravel- most likely causing more of an unsavory look to the bag.<br /><br />The material feels durable and the construction in other places seems quite adequate… Zipper is easily open/closed- and has small flap to cover keeping it from getting snagged. It just seems very basic no-frills straightforward I’m not disappointed in the bag itself.. just not really wowed either! And the straps Would deter me from future purchase.",194,659
3.0,1569526710630,Lurex is a sparkly tinsel like thread!!!,"Ok- major error I guess on my part.. but, so others don’t make my same mistake- Lurex is a sparkly tinsel like thread that is sewn into the actual hat.. and I didn’t know or, expect it.<br />Bigger issue- this was intended for a teenage boy!! The actual hat it’s self is made quite nice which is also disappointing because, I’m looking for this exact tighter fitted KNIT style hat. A lot on the market seem to be Knitted- only end up loose fitting and bulky. Or, one can find a fitted knit hat but, it totally misses the mark as it resembles the look of a burglar or else, It’s made of fleece! Exactly what I’m trying to avoid and why my interest in this particular hat - This hat has a soft texture and seems like quality material and crafting- no loose threads, straight seams and really nice attention to detail. The best of all, it fits your head without the extra 1” of nothing left at the top.. or, the 3” roll of the outer brim- just to size it right. So, for anyone in need of a sparkly hat- this is a great choice!<br />One last thing to add.. the hat to me seems very seasonal or festive! Which could be nice as we are coming right into the holiday season... it’s definitely made for a female audience with a Christmas/new year’s vibe for sure! Not sure how but, I missed women’s in the description.. So be aware, not all hats are created equal!! I tend to think of a beanie hat as unisex... nope!",194,661

The head part is deep and could fit over a loose, small bun if you're careful.<br /><br />There's no chin strap, so this hat isn't suitable for the beach or boating at all - it'll blow away in a breeze. Think of it as sunny, still day poolside, window shopping or long walk sort of hat. There's ok ventilation and I haven't noticed excessive heat wearing it outside to do light yard work or walk dogs.

It fits surprisingly well. I am plus sized but dont have the boobs to go with it, which can make it hard to find a bra. I need the side support in the form of wide rib bands, the wider shoulder bands are nice as the bra doesnt dig in. The cups are soft but foamy- definitely lends added structure and smoothness. The ""push up"" part is more in the overall cup and how it lays rather than there being a padded shelf to hoist them on--they should take that out from title description-- misleading. If you want that, you wont get that here. I failed to see the term push up in the description, so I am glad i doesnt do this. I just wanted a more structured and comfortable underwire bra for days I actually wear a bra (or wear something more than super basic soft cup with no structure).<br /><br />5 stars because I will actually wear this.

1.0,1610130511924,"hole and run in one sock, socks are different lengths, very thin, but compression is OK","I use compression socks for my venous insufficiency and varicose veins. I use 20-30 mmHg nearly all the time, for a couple of decades now so I know what to expect and how they should feel. I replenish the socks often as they are not meant to last forever (the sock may hold up but the compression decreases over time). SO I am always on the look out for a decent compression sock. These are NOT IT. I will tell you why:<br /><br />The compression on these is about right. No real complaint there. Very important to select a size based not only on your foot size, but also on your calf size. If deciding between the two, I would aim for calf size or go to a different brand.<br /><br />They are thin in calf area. I sense these will lose compression sooner over later.<br /><br />One sock has a hole it in it that I noticed as I put it on. A hole with a run! No good! Also, if that weren't bad enough..<br /><br />One sock is way too long. It goes up over my knee nearly to my thigh. The other sock just goes to my knee (as it should). The socks SHOULD fit in such a manner that it goes to the knee, or just below. Not so far above that it is like a thigh sock. Makes them uncomfortable as the band will bite the skin.<br /><br />Maybe I just got a bad pair or maybe there is a bad batch. Regardless, I am disappointed. I CAN wear them, but again they have a hole and one is uncomfortably long. '<br /><br />To end on a positive, the foot is accurate for sizing. I have size 10/11 womens (8/9 mens) and the L/XL is suitable for womens size 8/12.5 and mens 8-14. I have room left over. Just also need to have a calf size within 14-19 range. My measurement is around 17""<br /><br />The foot has a slightly padded feel.<br />Toe seam sits on top of toes and not at toe nail (which is good thing)<br />Since there are so many design and color change, then know that there are corresponding threads on the inside. This is a not a positive but it isnt necessarily negative either.. it is just a detail I find worth mentioning as it may mean that some people may catch a toenail on the interior threads.<br /><br />If my sock didnt have a hole in it (and a run) and if the socks were the same length ending at or just below knee, I would have rated these a 4. But with the host of problems I can't recommend these nor will I ever purchase more from this brand.",809,561

These jeans will fit everyone differently, likely no matter the size. We don't all have the same proportions- calves, thighs, butt, hips, waist..  The size 22 that I have that fits me, may not fit your 22. Or maybe it will fit even better. Best bet is to read through all reviews. What I will do is provide you with measurements for the 22 and then you can decide.<br /><br />KEEP THIS IN MIND- the tag reads:<br />Size 22 Skinny/Stretch/Mid-Rise/Ankle Length<br /><br />Measured FLAT:<br />Waist: 22"" wide (so 44"" around)<br />Hips: 24.75"" (so, 49.5"" around)<br />Rise: 13"" (measured from crotch to top hem)<br />Inseam: (measured from crotch to bottom of leg about 26"" (where it lands will depend on how jeans hang on you)<br /><br />Additional measurements:<br />I measured directly across lower hip area. I guess this would be bum area. This is 26"" (so 52"" around)<br />Width at upper thigh closest to crotch is 14"" so 28"" around<br />Midwway point, near knee area is 9.75"" wide, so 19.5"" wide.<br />Midway between knee area and bottom hem (to try to get calf size) is around 9.5"" (19"" around)<br />Width of bottom opening is 7.5"" (so 15"" around)<br /><br />I am 5'10"" with a long torso. Even so, I still have long-ish legs. These jeans land above the ankle on me. Not a capris, not a full length jean (your experience may vary) but long enough to be adequate with heals or flats, or low boots.<br />I am 300lbs or so. I have an hour glass shape, and have a squishy lower belly (""apron"") that can make fitting extra awkward. These are a little loose in bum and thighs- not so much to be sloppy. Actually I find them surprisingly comfortable. Accommodates my lower belly flarb.<br /><br />Simple zip up with button. Looks like regular worn jeans, but lightweight; and with the stretch, it allows for greater comfort and overall fit. Bottom hem has fray (""raw') and a couple of intentionally worn areas. Subtle- not obnoxious. Trendy. Full size rear pockets. Shallow front pockets with one small coin pocket.<br /><br />98% cotton, 2% elastane. Just stretchy enough. Machine wash cold with like colors. Tumble dry.<br />Made in Mexico<br /><br />Not a fan of the name, but the good experience with this pair of jeans has piqued my interest in their other offerings.  Would be nice to get away from yoga pants ;)<br /><br />And because of that I will give this 5 stars. But really this is all a matter of preference and the fit on our individual bodies. Main thing to know is is that sizing is pretty accurate overall (not like a 22 is fitting like a 12), and the overall quality is fine. Wish I knew the price.  Anyway, if I experience anything worth sharing I will be back to do so. Will include pics soon.",809,1967

I can bend forward and they don't fall off.<br /><br />--They feel sturdy and durable. Time will tell.<br /><br />-- I can wear them driving or just out and about outside, and everything without issue. I notice that they have a gradient lens. So depending on how you look through them, the colors will be brighter or darker. Darkest being along the top, and brightest along the bottom. It is about even looking straight ahead. For the most part, everything is has a gray cast. Grass is more gray green than yellow green, for example.<br /><br />--Comes with a soft shell zippered hard case with lens cloth.<br /><br />--I noticed though, that when I try to look at my smartphone with these on, there is a prism effect. It is very odd. I suspect it is the polarizing lens filters combined with the phones polarizing filters.  I would not be able to look at my phone for long with these on. However, if the screen is tilted a little, then this aligns the filters and the dark screen and/or prism effect should dissipate.<br /><br />--of the color choices available it appears that black, red, and purple all have a dark lens, while the brown pair has an amber looking lens. I imagine that alters how things look. Just keep that in mind when making a selection, or seek out reviews based on the color you are considering.<br /><br />I like them for me. For some, they may be simply too large for your taste.

I love them for around the house, for keeping my large clunky slippers (ok, really my husbands) somewhat secure on my feet, and for keeping my closed/non hole crocks clogs in place (I'm not a fashionista, but I do have dogs, so crocks are my life!). If you have sneakers that kinda slip or slide, the grips on these will help stabilize your shoe. Perhaps less blisters from rubbing? Other details:<br /><br />--They wash and dry well. I have washed them in warm water and medium heat. No problems. They look perfect.<br /><br />--The grip is.. grippy, without being able to feel that material through the sock. It really makes them comfortable to wear as a daily sock.<br /><br />--I like the solid black color with colorful grips and a band of color at top. They are attractive to me, and definitely feel and wear like quality.<br /><br />--Lightweight with an arch support band.<br /><br />--No interior threads to get toenails caught on<br /><br />--Toe hem sits on top of toes, not at toe nail.<br /><br />--Slightly longer spot on rear of opening to help pull them on.<br /><br />--They have never slipped or twisted, no matter what I wear over them (or not wear over them).<br /><br /> I DO recommend them if you are considering this. I have them in my wish list for a future purchase. I love them!<br /><br />Btw, they are labeled as men's size 6-11, so that would fit women's size 8-13.

See, the main  area which is the spot for cash, credit cards, ID, etc is really not secure. That area is open on three sides! There is a snap closure- that's it. Gravity may help keep things in place, but that doesn't make me comfortable using it. The other storage area is one that could be used for anything, but I assume most people would want to use for their phone so I will refer to it as such. I do not benefit from using the this pocket since my Google Pixel 3XL doesn't come anywhere close to fitting it. Even if it did, the snap closure doesn't feel too secure. You have to really press on it for it to snap. I wouldn't want to put that much pressure against my phone screen. The third and final storage spot is useful but almost too small. Maybe ok for a few bills or coins. Not much beyond that.<br /><br />So because I pretty much can't actually use it, I deem this is a pass for me",809,1976

5.0,1629530377966,BEST TRAVEL SHOE BAGS I’VE SEEN,"Owning a separate bag to pack your shoes in when traveling was something I did not start doing until well into adulthood - but it is only smart.  Who wants the dirt and grime collected on the soles of your shoes anywhere close to the rest of what is in your suitcase?  Not I.<br /><br />I have owned a few sets of shoe bags - most are nylon bags with a draw string and they do work ok.  On the other hand this zippered bag by Bagail is really a step above those designs.<br /><br />The nylon sacks will keep your shoes contained but if you happened to have loose dirt come free from the soles of your shoes it can come free of the bag and end up on your other belongings - not so with this zipper closed bag.<br /><br />This bag is designed to completely protect your shoes and your clothes from your shoes.  The bag is constructed from high quality materials that are water resistant and made to hold up to long term use.<br /><br />The zippers are superb and protected as to not snag on other garments within your suitcase when traveling - easy to both grab, smoothly open and close.<br /><br />I wear a men’s size 8.5 and this bag works perfectly, this bag will definitely accommodate men’s shoes size 12.<br /><br />This is an outstanding travel shoe bag that is well made, looks great and will protect not only your shoes but the rest of what’s in your suitcase.  It’s perfect for transporting your expensive dress shoes, gym shoes or any others so you know they will arrive without damage and your clothes will not be soiled by dirt from your shoes.<br /><br />This is an excellent product that I definitely recommend.",897,2625

The design includes heavy duty double zippers which both close the cube and allow it to expand in depth.  The mesh on the front of the case allows for ventilation and won’t trap air inside when you squeeze clothes in tightly if you are trying to maximize space.<br /><br />When packing for a trip I utilize these by placing shirts in one and shorts, bathing suits and the like in the other.  When returning I use them to separate clean and dirty laundry.<br /><br />Besides being very well made and being able to hold a great deal, another wonderful feature is they are machine washable.<br /><br />These are an excellent purchase and make staying organized when traveling much easier.

3.0,1614104895606,"They work, but not the best design","I love the idea of heated gloves as my fingers get cold when playing in the snow with my kids. My wife has a heated jacket that has a similar idea- there's a battery pack that gets wired up inside and then an external button that activates and glows different colors to indicate what mode it is in. This is the same thing, but on two hands (so double the battery packs and switches!).<br />The jacket version is vastly superior to this in my opinion. To be clear, it DOES work, but there are some design flaws that make it a little frustrating. For starters, the battery pack uses AA cells and not a USB rechargeable pack like other heated items in this style. That's fine, except that the pack is very bulky and hard to get to when you need to change them. There is a zipper pouch that houses it, and you have to really dig around with your fingers to get it out and in. And there's a good chance you'll have to replace them every couple of times you wear this. There is also a ""master power"" switch on the battery pack, which I guess prevents accidentally pressing the power on when storing the gloves as well as preventing background power drain. If left on, the pack will drain your battery even if the glove's heating function is turned off, so you need to dig it out every time and hit the switch (found this out the hard way).<br />Not only is that annoying, it is bulky and won't contour with your arm since it is a square pack. See the attached picture, on my arm that carries my watch, the pack creates this awkward bulge. And it isn't that the gloves are too small on me, in fact they are a bit big on me in every other way.<br />The LED on the gloves also aren't very visible when outside in the snow. I kept questioning whether or not my gloves were on or if in the wrong mode... a few times one had turned itself off perhaps by either the battery dying or accidentally hitting the button. Using them at night solves this, but what if you're outside in the brightly reflected snow? In contrast, my wife's heated jacket is visible.<br />I was going to give this 4 stars because it's just mildly inconvenient and still functional, but after using it a couple of times and finding the batteries are already dead, I decided against putting even more batteries into it and just using them as normal gloves. For that, you can get much better fitting gloves for the price.<br />So, if you really need heated gloves on the cheap, they're OK. But they really could be so much better.",923,2708

I actually really liked the purple one and want to wear it more, however it is too thin for me. I'm a larger guy that usually wears XL sized clothing, and super thin ties often look comically small on my frame. The other tie seems to look a little better, but unless I'm dressing up as the Men In Black or going to a funeral, I don't often wear such dark colored ties. I wish the purple one was the thicker one and the thin one was the dark one. But either way, this is an interesting combo because chances are you'll find a tie that works for you, either color or size-wise.<br />I just wish they had switched them around, as both are a compromise in one way or another for me personally.",923,2719

It fits well, folds well, and is comfortable to wear and will block the sun and protect your skin. But it won't look stylish when you do it... or at least it didn't for us.

I do like that it has a hoodie with it and also like the two little pockets in the front, perfect to warm up your hands or keep your phone in it.<br /><br />The sweatshirt is true to size. I am 5'7"" at about 200lbs and this fits just right with a nice loose fit. It like that this top is not short in the torso which is great.

The jogger pants also have two pockets which basically can serve the same purpose if you want. They have a draw string so you can tighten them to fit perfectly and that they don't slip down.<br /><br />This is perfect to lounge around at home or for quick casual errands to run around town, personally to me that is acceptable like getting groceries.

It is drawn around the waist which gives the dress a nice little definition. It is also not revealing which is great.<br /><br />The dress has a leopard print that looks great.

Overall the dress is well sown. I am a size 14 usually, wear an XL. I am 5'7"" and about 200lbs. I bought this in a size XL and it fits, however at my hiny, I had a weird gathering of material just about my rear. It was really unflattering and weird. Other than that it looked and fitted well, but obviously I can't really run around with some weird bunched up material in that area.<br /><br />I am also not sure about tieing that bow tie right at my neck.

I really like the sleek and clean design about them. Also the tint is just right. I like that the tint is different from top to bottom. All in all the design of them is just perfect, exactly what I would design if I were a designer. The fit is also perfect for me, like they were meant for me. I am happy they added UV protection to them so your eyes are protected even more. I think the price is also just right, actually on the cheaper side especially for the quality. I think these are very well made and to get this kind of quality for $13 is a fantastic deal!<br /><br />The one thing I am not crazy about, I was under the impression they were progressive glasses with correction, meaning the top would have no correction and the bottom would. However, what they do have is no correction on the top but on the bottom they just have a bifocal insert with the 1X correction. So they really are bifocals and not progressive lenses. This is more explained in the actual description but in the title they are advertised more as progressive lenses so read carefully and make sure you want bifocals.<br /><br />As bifocals they are perfect and really have nothing left to ask for. I just wish they would offer more progressive lenses since bifocals are a bit tough to use for reading and such.<br /><br />They do come with a case which I found is a bit cheap, but come on for $13 and getting glasses this good, I am not complaining and at least you have something to protect them with. It also comes with a jewelry screwdriver that is kind of neat and will come in handy.",1016,2959
3.0,1568286845651,Cute little cross body bag,"This is a cute little cross body bag, although personally I am not big into tassles, but that is just me. It has an inside area for credit cards and money that is very convenient and when you get it in that area is where the straps are also packed into. When you remove them though, this is when you notice the little design flaw, the bag now doesn't really close all the way and you have this gap. I guess it would maybe fit one of the smaller cell phones?<br /><br />Underneath the tassel is another compartment where you can add various things like some lipstick or whatever you like to carry around. Overall this is a fairly small bag so measure before you order. On the back of it is another zipper pocket which is where I would personally keep the credit cards and ID and maybe on the inside have reward cards and the like that are not as critical.<br /><br />It has a nice long strap that allows you to have it across your body. The material is a nice bright red matched with a tan, probably some pleather like material, nothing fancy but this should also not cost you $100+.<br /><br />So besides that design flaw with that gap, it is actually not a bad bag for around the town for a few small items you need. Just not sure why that gap is so severe, maybe if you put it between some heavy weights for a few days it will go away?",1016,1976

The upper strand has a few cubic zirconia clusters, which accent the entire design. The chain is about 16in with the built-in extender. This necklace looks lovely with tops or sweaters that have round necklines. It will appeal to all ages (from teens to adults) and will complement most outfits. I have sensitive skin and liked the fact that even though this is costume jewelry it did not irritate my skin (nickel free & lead free).

I personally like the look of flatter sunglasses, I think they look stylish. They cover a lot of your face so they'd be great to wear on sunny days with a nice sun hat to match. Theyre great for running errands when you don't want to put makeup on, because no one will be able to tell! You can kind of tell my eyebrows aren't on in the picture but only if you're looking very hard haha<br /><br />The quality is definitely what you would expect from a $12 pair. The lenses look nice, but the arms look a little cheap and fragile (mainly the gold bits).<br /><br />If you like the style and want a pair of glasses you don't have to worry about losing, these aren't a bad choice though!",1130,179
5.0,1563205164972,VERY Handy To Have. And They WORK!,"I gave up trying to wear no show socks.  They would never work and would always slide down.  Then I found these!<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These socks are a great neutral collection of no-show socks.  They have a silicone no slip strip area on the back of the heel to keep them in place,  The socks are soft yet sturdy.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE PERFORM?<br />These work very well with sneakers or Keens.  I have a family member who can not wear Keens without socks due to allergic reaction.  These even stayed on with their Keens!  These stay on all day, and sometimes depending on the amount of walking, they might need to be adjusted once or twice during a long day, but most of the time not.<br /><br />WHAT SIZE?<br />I wear a size 10 women's shoe and these worked fine for me.  I also had the other family member that wears a size 8 men's use these.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />A great collection of neutral no-show socks. These worked well with athletic shoes as well as Keen's.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This style works better than any other no-show socks I have tried.  The no-slip strips on the back really do work and they are not too thick so shoes still fit well.",1158,3057
5.0,1561127331745,These Really Don't Slip!,"I have had so many pair of socks which are listed as no show, and that is right- they slip down into the shoe so that no one can see how uncomfortable they are making you!  Let's see how these measured up.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These socks come in a variety of color combinations.  They are attractive and soft.  They fit really well at the perfect line for wearing with shoes so that they stay in place, but they also have a silicone section on the inner heel which keep them on the foot.  There are no bulky seams in them.  They stretch well.<br /><br />WHAT SIZE DO I WEAR?<br />I wear a size 10 women's shoe and these fit me perfectly- not too tight or loose.<br /><br />DO THEY REALLY STAY UP?<br />I use these not only for slippers, but also for wearing under shoes.  They stay up very well, even though they travel down a tiny bit, they do stay put for the most part.<br /><br />STRETCH<br />These have a lot of stretch and they are not too tight on the feet.<br /><br />THICK?<br />They are the perfect sock weight to wear with shoes- not too thick as some of them can be.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a nice variety of socks that truly do stay put for wear with shoes or as house socks (slippers), these are a great choice.  They seem to be good quality and I would buy them again for sure.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I will buy these again for sure- and probably will give them as gifts.",1158,483
4.0,1560385137824,Works Well On Most Shoes,"We had a few pair of shoes that needed cleaning, so we tried this set.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a sponge surrounded with a brush with it as well as the cleaning solution that is in the bottle.  The idea is that you wet the sponge/brush head of the bottle and then use the combination on the dirty shoe.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS WORK?<br />This can be used on the dirty soles of the shoes as well as leather, or textile shoes.  You slowly use the sponge/brush tip to slowly clean the shoe in a circular motion.  Once the shoe is entirely cleaned, then you wet a sponge and wipe the shoe clean.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This works beautifully on leather shoes (tough ones, not the soft porous leather types), but there was one pair of textile shoes it did not work on as well as I had hoped.  It still worked somewhat though.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a versatile shoe cleaner that does clean shoes well- especially leather- this is handy to have on hand.  It won't do tons of shoes though, so if you have a lot, you might want to get several of these.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This worked well on some shoes but not one textile pair I tried it on.  Also, the bottle is quite small, so having more on hand if you have a lot of shoes is important.",1158,3428
3.0,1556911024978,"For A Specific Figure Type, Just Not Mine","I am always on the lookout for a nice dress and new style to try.  Let's see how this one worked out..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS DRESS LIKE?<br />This dress is a nice soft knit that drapes well.  It is a bit thin, so you will need to have a slip under it or it is very see-through.  There is a baggy style to it and a tuck at the dropped waist.  The sleeves are cap sleeves.  I did not see where this is a wrap.  Mine is sewn shut.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS LOOK?<br />This dress is made more for a straight up and down figure.  Think of the 1920s type figure.  It is not quite as flattering on an hourglass figure which is more of what I have.  It also might not work on some with a heavy bottom pear shaped figure either.<br /><br />It can be dressed up and accessorized with belts, scarves, etc, so it can work.  As it is, it just isn't too good on my hourglass figure or the pear shaped figure that I had try it on.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you have the type of straight figure which looks good in 1920s styles, this might be a good dress for you.  It does need a slip as the fabric is thin and shows everything through it- including lumps, bumps, panty lines, etc.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />I give this one THREE STARS.  It just is not that flattering of a style on myself or two others that I had try it on.",1158,485
5.0,1546481637873,WAY COOLER Than I Expected..,"All of the hats we have gotten, my daughter and I have had to learn to share.  They tend to be in demand now and then.  When this hat arrived, however, I am thinking of hiding it.  It is THAT COOL.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS HAT LIKE?<br />This hat is really cool.  It is made from what appears to be pressed wool felt.  The brim is stiff but flexible.  The brim is the color of a nice cabernet wine.  The cap is a beautifully formed cap that has an indentation on top that is PERFECTLY set.  The band on it is a poly velvet which is tied at the side leaving two nice tails on it.  It is a shiny velvet which looks surprisingly classy.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS HAT PERFORM?<br />This hat has been crushed, thrown and sat on and it is still doing great.  A little bit of reforming and it looked like new.  I don't recommend long term crushing, but it really is a nice hat.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS FIT?<br />I have a head with 21 inch circumference and this hat fits very well.  It is not so loose that it will fly off, but it is firm enough of a fit to stay on in reasonable breeze.  Winds, well, forget it.<br /><br />IS THERE WIRE AROUND BRIM?<br />There is no forming wire around the brim.<br /><br />IS THERE A BAND INSIDE?<br />There is a black grosgrain ribbon band on the inside.<br /><br />CLEANING?<br />Because this is felted wool, it needs to be carefully spot cleaned.  You do not want to soak this with water or squeeze it out if you can help it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a really cool hat.  I have a hard time finding hats with brims that balance well with the crown and flatter me.  This hat flattered everyone that has tried it on so far. It is easy to care for and seems to be resilient.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I hope to post a photo of this hat as soon as I am able to.  For now, I wanted to at least review this hat and let you all know how much I love it.  It goes with several dark red and black jackets that I have as well as other outfits.",1158,3430
4.0,1545164709631,"GREAT For Very Slim Guys, Might Be Too Tight For Heavier Guys","My husband looks great in skinny jeans as well as bells or classic.  The key is fit.  Let's see how these worked out.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE JEANS LIKE?<br />These jeans are really well designed.  They have great seaming, and the work on them is good quality.  The denim is what I will call medium weight.  The fabric has some stretch, but is not VERY stretchy.  The waist is designed to hit just below the waist.  The legs are very slim.  The ankles are skinny.<br /><br />POCKETS<br />The pockets are pretty deep which is one thing that drives my husband nuts- shallow pockets.  They are not so shallow that everything is gonna fall out of them. The change pocket is very tiny, but works.<br /><br />ZIPPER<br />The zipper in this is a locking zipper so it won't be as likely to work its way down on its own.<br /><br />ABRASIONS<br />There is wear and abrasions on the pocket edges, hems, and crinkled on the knee area.  It is not extreme and is not so bad that this will cause the pants to wear out really fast.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE FIT?<br />These do fit my husband and are very fitted.  He said they are reasonably comfortable, but they are a bit on the snug side.  They give and move and will stretch out over time as most spandex pants do.  They shrink back into size when washed and dried.<br /><br />WAISTBAND?<br />Some waistbands stretch a lot but others don't and even though the pants stretch a lot, the waistband gives very little making them uncomfortable.  This waistband barely stretches which can cause problems for those with stomachs who tend to expand when they eat or drink or for those who have a bit of a belly but thin legs.<br /><br />HOW TO ORDER<br />I would suggest ordering a size bigger.  My husband wears a 32 but these are a bit snug.  A larger pair would have been better.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a well designed pair of stretch jeans that are skinny, but give, these are nice.  The waistband does not stretch overly much so ordering a size bigger might be wise.  Great cut jeans for slim European styled figures.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  The waistband should be stretching more than it is on these to match the give in the pants.  They are still a nice design though, just need to run a bit stretchier in the waist.",1158,3431
5.0,1533513124565,If It Can Survive My Husband It Is Impressive.,"When it comes to cases for glasses, my husband has a tendency to break or ruin them.  Let's see how this measures up.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This case is made from bonded leather- that means leather that is blended into fibers with a plastic sort of binder that makes it stay flexible, yet strong.  It is sewn up the sides leaving the top open for glasses.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This fits both reading glasses and sunglasses that are not oversized.  They stay in the case without slipping out easily, yet the case is tough enough to protect them.  It is strong enough to survive my husband so far.  He tends to be rough on things like this.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For reading glasses, eye glasses, and sunglasses that are not oversized, this case is tough and will protect glasses well.  It is moisture resistant, protective and thick enough to protect glasses from average use.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars- if it can last for my husband it is impressive so far.",1158,3434
5.0,1580363101846,Good Quality for the price,"I ordered a set of ‘Primesons 18K White Gold Plated Cubic Zirconia Clear Swarovski Hoop Earrings’ for review.  These earrings are of course costume jewelry, but for the price these are surprisingly well made.  They white gold is well polished. The halo stones catch the light. The larger stone is of course not real, so it does not look real, but it is sparkly.  The posts are long enough to go through the lobe and have enough post to clasp them closed.  When clasped they stay secure.  If you bend the post however, they will not close correctly and you could have it come loose.  My wife does have skin sensitivity to certain metals, but these do not bother her at all.  No soreness or any skin reaction even when wearing them for a full day.  They are lightweight and do not pull or drag down the ear lobe.  Overall, these are a well-made, economical pair of costume earrings.  My wife will enjoy wearing them.",1168,3234
5.0,1579404300029,Quality exceeds their cost,"I had the opportunity to review this set of Primesons 18K White Gold-Plated Cubic Zirconia Swarovski Hoop Earrings.  When they arrived, I was quite surprised at their quality for being costume type jewelry. The metal is polished to a shine.  The post is plenty long to be able to get the into the lobe and to clasp them shut.  Be careful not to bend the posts because if you do they will not close properly.  My wife wore them for an entire day and the clasps did not come open but as she took one off, she bent the post slightly and had to bend it slightly back into the correct place to keep it clasped.<br />The cut of the “stones” catches the light.  You can tell by the deep green of the middle stone, that these are lab created.  Most real Emeralds are a lighter green.  I have seen much more expensive earrings with simulated stones, and this set beat most of them in color and quality.  The smaller halo “stones” are big enough to catch the light.<br />My wife suffers from some metal allergies. Yet these earrings did not cause any reaction on her skin. Nor did they make her lobe sore or itch.<br />Overall for their price point, these are a very pretty pair of costume jewelry earrings.  The look beautiful on and my wife will get lots of use out of these earrings.",1168,3235
3.0,1576546704144,Definitely lightweight,"I ordered this HaloVa Backpack, Mini shoulder bag for my wife.  It is very light weight.  Although this can be a double edge sword because it does not feel sturdy or high quality.  The fabric isn't itchy or scratchy but it feels a little cheaply made.  The ""Jack"" on the back is convenient to thread through headphones, but most are Bluetooth now so I am not sure it is a great added benefit.  It is a good size if you travel light or only need your wallet and a few items.  I am not quite sure about the durability, but will update my review after my wife uses it for a few months.<br /><br />It does sit comfortably on the shoulder.  Because it is smaller you are not tempted to fill it full of lots of stuff, so it maintains a lighter weight on the shoulder.  It is really not a bad bag for the price, it just isn't a great bag for the price.",1168,659

The chain is the usual thin one you get for this price point, but the clasp is easy to open/close and you can extend the necklace two inches past the 16"" (I like mine short). It comes in a lovely gift box and bag, with a cleaning cloth and a cute card, which makes it perfect for gift giving.",1254,3592
5.0,1569843236408,"very soft, nice thickness to it","This 'pashima' scarf is what I tend to notice anymore a generic label for a very soft scarf/shawl - yes, it has some wool (25%) and cashmere (25%) in it, with the rest being polyester, but I wouldn't consider it to be a true 'pashmina' scarf. That said, it is very soft and is thick enough that you don't see through it at all, unlike with most cashmere scarves (unless they are VERY expensive). It's almost 80"" long without the fringe, and almost 30"" wide, so it covers the shoulders and hangs down one's back, and can be wrapped around to provide warmth as a shawl or knotted in cute ways for a scarf.<br />It's very soft, definitely a nice touch around one's neck or against the face, and with the polyester in this I'm fine with washing it (delicate cycle, in a bag for protection, cold wash, hang to dry. The non-fringe ends look as if they were just cut, no stitched seems, but the material is such that as its worn, it should 'mat' together. All and all, this is a lovely, large wrap that's so soft and will provide some warmth during the cooler months at a great price point (especially considering the fact that I've lost a couple over time - I'll be sad but not as sad as if this was the real thing). Also, lots of color options.",1254,2522
5.0,1561023917450,good sun hat,"I'll admit, I got this mainly to work in the garden - my other hat doesn't provide enough shade for my face/back of the neck. This one does since it has a large brim both front and back. It comes in a nice, breathable bag for packing/travel, and it does fold/collapse if you want to pack it for a trip. It's not the most elegant thing, I'll admit, but it does the job of keeping the sun off your face, it's comfortable and it fits my head well.",1254,2720
4.0,1560639210207,cute costume jewelry,"This is a cute piece of costume jewelry - it's gold color, but it's definitely not gold. Still, it's pretty with the faux pearl in a three dimensional heart-shaped cage, and another faux pearl dangling down from it. The necklace isn't too long, and there's a couple of settings so you can adjust it almost choker-like or have it a bit longer. It's on the delicate side (not too big) but the chain isn't so thin that you have to worry about it breaking easily. It comes in a nice box which makes it great for gift giving as well.",1254,3594
4.0,1545318578871,elastic/spandex tank top,"I like tank tops with a little support/spandex in them when I go to sleep at night, and was interested in this one since the description said that it has a 'shelf bra for great support and coverage'. Uhm... as far as I can tell, no (shelf bra to me is either cups or separate fabric to help support the breasts, and there's nothing like that here). It's a basic tank top (with a slight v in the front) with spandex so it does provide the support, not cut too low, straps don't adjust but it does stay in place. We're not talking natural fabric here, but it's fine for sleeping in since it 'hugs' and, as stated, does provide some support because of the spandex holding things in place without being too constrictive. So I'm happy with it even if it could be a little softer.<br /><br />It's not something I'd wear without a bra beneath it (it doesn't provide THAT much support, but then I'm 34DD), but it's fine for how I'm using it.",1254,492

Not quite so comfortable around the feet, and they do take a little effort pulling on and off. Would also like just a plain sock, if possible, so I don't have to worry about what I'm wearing that day (not like I'm dressing up to work out, but if I'm wearing shorts, I don't want to look that odd). Considering that these are small/medium, I wonder if there might be sizing issues for some people - it would be better if there were just two different sizes available.

The size medium was a perfect fit, so they do run small. You'll want to size up if you are average height or carry a bit more weight.

The set would be a thoughtful gift as it comes with several pairs of socks in light, medium and dark colors.<br />I dont hand wash as it suggests, but I do wash on the gentle cycle with woolite and they do  hold up excellent this way. They actually get softer when I use Downy.  I wear these alone at home without slippers or out with my boots or even my tennis shoes. I like the thickness of them- they fit fine in my shoes/boots but if your boots are tight, they may make your footwear tight.",1986,5023

5.0,1571438947763,For a smaller face but great for the price!,"These sunglasses are for a smaller face which, lucky for me, fits perfectly. My husband tried them on and looked pretty silly. They come with a carrying case plus a little card that shows you they are polarized. I used some Ray Bans that are 100% polarized to look at the card provided, then a pair of regular, non polarized glasses and finally these.

They are faux-suede, but you'd never know it! And the rubber sole is a real plus. I love the little heel on these to give me a little more height and it's a heel I can manage -- not too high! The design with little tabs on the back give them extra appeal and assist in putting the ankle boots on. These size 9's are big on my 7.5 foot unless I wear a thick sock, and then they're just about the right fit. The foam cushioned insole that's already inside these ankle boots, plus the socks give them a lot of cushioning for comfort. They look attractive on the foot and they'll look even better with book cut jeans. They're easy to slip on and off because there's a slit with a piece of elastic on the side.

The stretch and the lacy weave make these comfortable to wear! And they are so pretty! They’re soft, not scratchy, yet  they seem tough, not flimsy. I love the wide crotch for comfort and the way they come halfway up the hip. Outer crotch fabric is 100% cotton and it’s fully lined with 95% cotton and 5% spandex.

And stars! These also include plenty of bling with 4 fairly big, round cubic zirconia, 8 medium, & 4 small. Other designs include small cubic zirconia in them.

They aren't incredibly thick and have that crackled color variation in them. Lastly there is a braided leather band that is real pretty. Worn all together this braided piece really pulls it all together and it can look really nice. It's a nice casual look.,2974,6833
3.0,1576855694859,The rose quartz is pretty,"This bracelet, at least the one I received, looks pretty much like what the picture looks like. It's a rose quartz stone set in a gold looking setting on a gold chain. The stone looks more natural, not shaped but set as it may be found in nature. The chain doesn't seem to be of very high quality so it doesn't look all that great if you are wearing something on the nicer side. The clasp is shaped like the letter S and is slightly tricky to get but once you do it seems to be pretty firmly in there. The hard part is trying to slip it in without bending it or bending it too much because once you start bending it the little bit of metal will weaken once it breaks it'll be a mess to get the bracelet to stay on.<br />If you like what you see in the picture and you really like it, then you should like it. However, it does look a little on the lower end of the jewelry scale so keep that in mind. I really like the rose quartz part of it. It's a very pretty stone. It's definitely the best things about this bracelet.",2974,6835

Not so thin that they don't keep your feet warm though. What they lack in thickness they more than make up for in comfort though. They are comfortable and soft too. They're not fluffy soft, more like a smooth soft. I hope that makes sense!<br />These are the kind of holiday socks you could feel confident giving as gifts.

It's so soft on the inside I didn't want to take it off after trying it out but it's not quite the weather for it just yet. I'm not hoping for it any time soon but it'll come regardless and when it does, I'll have the perfect hat!

This is the perfect bag for the cross body design. It's nice and light and you can keep it close to you at all times.<br />The drawback to this is that there is quite the gap where your cards would go.

I am afraid to pull on them to open them enough to get them on my face. They are that delicate feeling. They feel a bit cheap. Granted they really don't cost all that much but they feel like they should cost a bit less.<br />So, I like them but I worry they won't last very long.

When I went to put the other one on it felt crinkly at the top which I thought was weird but I went ahead and scrunched the sock as one does to pull it on the foot. All was going well until I got to the top of the sock. When I was pulling the top up it started to stretch and pull apart (with little pull, just the tug you would use to pull the top of the sock up). My fingers were starting to go through the fabric where the crinkling was. It was up at top between the first and third lines on the sock, to be more specific.<br />Anyway, for that reason I can't really give these socks a good recommendation. It does seem like most others had better luck with their socks so hopefully this was just a one off sort of thing. I liked the first sock a lot though!",2974,6299

The description says “Front pouch pocket for no fuss extra storage” but that is not accurate. I actually didn’t realize there was a pocket on the upper chest -- the pictures don’t show that detail very well.<br /><br />The hood drawstrings are raw, just tied in a knot. No aglets. For a sweatshirt this expensive, I’d prefer a nicer finish on the drawstrings.<br /><br />The cropped bottom hits right at my hipbone, so it’s not a super short sweatshirt.

My wrist is about 6 inches, and they fit me without being too big, so I’m happy about that!<br /><br />The clasp edge of the bangles, where they open to put on your wrist, is very sharp. I actually scratched myself when I put one of the bracelets on, the metal is that sharp.<br /><br />Two of the bracelets I received have secure clasps. The gold bracelet does not, the clasp is loose and makes a jingly noise if I shake it. I won’t be able to wear the gold bracelet because with the loose clasp, there’s potential for the sharp edges to scratch my wrist.<br /><br />Otherwise, I like the bangles.

The washed sock shrank by several inches. But when I put both socks on, they felt the same on my feet. I couldn’t really tell a difference between them.<br /><br />The sizing seems pretty accurate. I tried a size medium, which is men’s 4-6 and women’s 5-7.5. I actually wear a 7.5 in men’s and the medium in the Forcool socks fit me.<br /><br />The socks have light padding in the shin, heel, and toes.<br /><br />The socks come up to my knees and actually stay up there.

The other tiny clear crystals on the skull do not stand out unless I’m in very bright sunlight.<br /><br />The woven part of the bracelet is quite stiff.

It totally ruins the pom-pom.<br /><br />Aside from that dire warning, this is a great little hat and infinity scarf set. The stitching is cute and I really like the fun details of all of the different colors mixed in, the yarn is very soft and not at all itchy in any way, and I really like the cut of both the hat, which is a little tighter around the rim and then flares out a little bit for a baggy look, and the infinity scarf, which can be wrapped around the neck twice and looked generally full and stylish to wear.",2993,383
5.0,1551628803138,Much more vibrant than the photos give it credit for,"This set looks really pretty in the photos, but when you get it in person, the yarn is beautiful and vibrant in a way that isn't coming through properly in the images. It is truly a special feeling, lovely little set. I like the included hand warmers, which have little holes for my thumbs to pop through, the infinity scarf which seems just the right length to feel comfortable and yet not overly snug right around my neck, and the cute hat with pom-pom, which sits with slouchy style atop my head and makes my children think I am especially cool, since they love colorful pom-poms.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with this set. I've worn it so far out for shopping and a casual meeting as a landscaper. I haven't attempted to wash any of it, but I would suggest treating it like it's made of wool, even though it's not.",2993,2530
4.0,1550935352535,Good for shorter men,"My husband is 6'5"" tall, and so we sometimes have issues finding pants that are long enough for him. Even if he is okay with things coming up a little bit higher on his ankles and he would prefer, very frequently pants don't work out on him because of the length. However, in the past we found that brands such as Joe's jeans have a little bit of extra room at the bottom of the leg so that the pants can have a fashionable rumple at the base.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these jeans were just too short for my husband's legs. They came up to the low or midcalf on him, and while they were comfortable, stretchy, cute and super stylish, there was really no way of adjusting the hem or the styling to make them work for his 34 inch inseam.<br /><br />The most similar pair of jeans he owns is by Joe's jeans, which is also supposed to be a super stretchy, and super soft denim. These jeans from genuine assembly are more stiff, less soft, and overall seem more like a regular pair of jeans, but just have that little bit of added stretch and softness like most women's jeans have nowadays. I think that the claims of being good for working out are probably overblown, unless your workouts do not include a lot of big movements or sweat. However, for lounging around the house, these seemed exceptionally comfortable around the waist and in the fit. I also appreciated that they didn't seem like they wanted to fall down on my husband's backside, like so many modern jeans seem styled to do.<br /><br />Overall these are of very good quality and are truly nice pair of slightly stretchy, slightly soft jeans, as long as your inseam is fairly short, I would say these would be best for 30 to 31 inch inseam length.",2993,3243

My daughter stole it to snuggle in when she's in her carseat. We both love purple!<br /><br />The hat is my fave. It is a smaller fit but is fine on my (small) head, and the pompom - oh, that pompom... It is super fun and garners compliments at the store or gym. Again, no itchies. I have not tried washing the hat, but given that the scarf did OK, I have high hopes.

The smallest seems good for nose, the middle fits my lip well, but the large could also be worn on lip, but it's too large for me. I was able to get it snapped on pretty quickly, and it has not gotten lose or come off so far!",3001,656
5.0,1576812483011,Thick and good assortment of unisex colors.,"Good assortment of colors. I like they are thick and warm for the winter, unisex colors, and could be worn as an ankle/calf sock. They also have grippy bottoms which is a must at this age for learning to walk!<br />Overall good value and happy with these socks for my daughter.",3001,2503
3.0,1562108702045,"Cute, but dont hold their shape well.","These designs are sweet. My daughter looks adorable in them, but I'm not impressed with the quality. They run a little large, and material is a little flimsy and they dont hold their shape very well.",3001,4679

3.0,1659745239370,3 stars,"This one I'm sure is going to come down to preference. But for me... it was a big no. If you have moderately larger thighs, the leopard print makes them look huge.<br /><br />The quality is great and the fit was good. They just do not look good on!",3002,364

2.0,1579722977378,so flimsy,I have stopped ordering this brand of glasses. I had high hopes at first and ordered several pair... however they all have the same problem. They are so flimsy and don't sit tightly on your face. They look nice though. Thats why I am giving it two stars.,3002,7225
5.0,1570033500472,Good Shirts,this is a good set of white shirts. They are thicker than Hanes or Fruit of the Loom which I prefer for an undershirt. The material is a high quality cotton. They fit as I expected them too. They are so soft and comfortable for my little one! She loves to even sleep in them. I would absolutely recommend.,3002,7230
4.0,1566930924914,They work!,I honestly never expected much from these glasses but they really don’t look half bad. My boyfriend needs reading glasses so I ordered them for him. He actually likes them and they are great for outdoors. They provide you with the light protection but allow you to see as well. However since they are reading glasses they are not made to be worn at all times. Only as needed.,3002,1781
2.0,1566930834067,not for me,"While these are not bad looking… they are extremely flimsy. I am hard on my sunglasses since I spend a lot of time outdoors. They aren’t just worn for looks but for practicality. So for me, I wouldn’t buy them… and I plan on donating them.",3002,3387
1.0,1565984487875,keep loooking,Lord… I try not to be just down right ugly on these reviews but these glasses are just horrible! They are ugly and they do not sit well on your face at all. They look cheap… because they are cheap. You would be better off getting a pair of panama jacks from Walmart!,3002,7233
5.0,1565193119772,Very nice,these socks fit exactly as described. I wasn’t sure if they would be loose by looking at the picture… they have the appearance of a dress sock. But I was pleasantly surprised when I put them on. They stay in place as they should without cutting off circulation. I love them.,3002,6846
1.0,1563472044222,looks cheap,"I thought that this might be a cute necklace to wear at the beach... and I have tried to love it, but I just don't. the directions on the necklace state ""Please avoid wearing it when sweating a lot, shower or sleep, etc."" I find that this would be difficult. Its a beachy necklace... and its HOT at the beach and normally you sweat. So for me that is even more of a reason to not be satisfied with it. the necklace itself looks cheap and it isn't made well at all. You may get two wears from this necklace before it breaks.",3002,478
3.0,1560874844985,Cute but looks cheap,"Honestly what you feel about this bracelet completely depends on what you need it for. If you are looking for something to wear a few times, maybe to a Luau or something like that it would be fine. Definitely not made for every day wear. It is comfortable so that is a plus. It is adjustable so it will fit any arm. It’s a cute little bracelet but it looks cheap with little tiny fake diamonds in the gold shell on the front. This one is a toss up.",3002,7241
5.0,1560824824699,Boyfriend loved them,"These socks are not what I was expecting, however my boyfriend loves these socks. He works in the heat everyday and has to wear boots. This socks are thinner than normal socks and a little higher than ankle socks. Which make them perfect to be worn with boots. He loved them so that’s a win in my book. I would caution not to buy these thinks that they are like a normal sock. They are much thinner, similar to a woman’s dress sock.",3002,477
4.0,1575963068491,A beautiful set,This is a lovely set of necklaces. They are both 8 inch chain link chains with a 2 inch extender. They both  have a small lobster claw clasps. The chains are really tiny so they will get tangled quite a bit but they have a delicate classy look. The bar is 2 inches long and rests gently against the décolletage. The disc is about 1/3 of an inch in the drop/diameter. Both of these have a really great color to start with. I took a picture of what they look like next to my 14 kt rope chain. If it is handled with care and doesn’t get wet then the color might maintain it selves for a while especially since it’s 14k over stainless steel and not any kind of copper which would turn fast no matter what. So these are pretty decent. You can’t beat paying $20.00 for both. That’s about the cost of costume/plastic jewelry anyway. I know I can get a few years out of these if I’m super careful.,3006,7275
5.0,1574639611164,A Beautiful Message,I love this keychain. It has such a beautiful message. This is a high polished metal and a lovely readable font. I know these words have been true so many times in my life. I think this would make perfect Christmas gifts for the women we love and admire. Sometimes the smallest things can make a person smile. This is one that will make them smile for an entire day.,3006,178
4.0,1574376854807,Great Deal,"I ordered these for my husband. They are really nice, soft, and comfortable. The elastic is perfect, not too tight and not too thick. He loves the way they feel and that they do not bunch up. They didn’t shrink up when washing and drying which is a huge plus and five to a pack is a great deal.",3006,7278
5.0,1571451574703,Cute and Furry,I love furry keychains. This is so cute and feminine. I absolutely love the colors because they are pastel and so delicate. The pink leather goes perfectly with the balls and the fringe is a added little detail. It has one gold colored ring to put keys on. The fur-like materials of the balls are very soft and airy but not so delicate that it comes apart. It is a well made keychain.,3006,6785
3.0,1564694810817,Not quite right...,This is really big on me. I ordered it thinking that I needed to size up because it was made in China. Nope I should have ordered my real size instead. This is very thin and airy so it feels really good to wear in this Summer heat but it is a little see thru. The material is not cheap it feels pretty durable. I washed this by hand and dried it laying on flat surface. There is a little stretch to it and it feels too spandex-ee and clingy and you will never get the wrinkles out. I used an iron but they came back the second I put it on. It is a nice blouse but it just isn't quite right maybe because it is too big for me. It is casual and can not be dressed up. So it is not the best but not the worst either. I hope this review helps you with your choice to purchase.,3006,6752
4.0,1561724806567,A nice and simple black bag,"This is a nice simple black crossbody handbag. The material feels pretty solid and soft. It is not the best but it is definitely not the worst either.  It has plenty of room for a cell phone, makeup and a few other odds and ins. The strap is removable and there are two zipper compartments, one being the main and the other on the front side. There is a little pocket on the inside as well. It also had a cute little gift of nail clippers inside. The picture and description are accurate. It is a simple black bag and it would definitely go with a simple black dress or any other casual outfit you choose to wear.  The price is just right and I would definitely recommend it.",3006,7285

3.0,1578610937182,Ok PJ set,"This PJ is okay. It fits true to size, at least the shirt. The material is lightweight and cool to touch but there is not even a tag to see what kind it is. It's well stitched but the pants waist is too tight for my comfort. It's squeezing me to the point of discomfort. I do not know how others like their PJs and lounge pants, but I like them loose and comfortable and these pants are not comfortable. I am a bit disappointed that I didn't like them more.",3008,2130
5.0,1577910373524,Love the shape of the glasses!,"The glasses are well made, stay on the face and do not pinch the bridge of my nose.

5.0,1577028822199,Awesome gloves,"My husband's hands are very large, and it's a challenge to find gloves that fit well. This gloves size XL fit very well and even have a little room. They are well made and well stitched. They tighten around the wrist and keep hands really warm. There is a rubber strip on the right thumb to allow usage of touch screen phone without taking of the gloves and freezing your fingers. They cover the wrist, and genuinely keep my husband's hand warm and snug. Great for wearing outside or even driving. We recommend them.",3008,7350
4.0,1575663987302,Cute keychain,"This inspirational keychain is the size of a quarter and is pretty basic. It's good quality metal that will serve well, but the inscription is what makes it special. Good pick me up gift for loved ones.",3008,2459

I like them.",3008,7351
5.0,1575405243562,Love them! Wonderful earrings for a reasonably low price!,"For this price these earrings are a steal! They are colorful, lightweight and will brighten any outfit. In fact they can be worn every day and will make you stand out. I love that they almost reach the neck but do not tug on ear lobes at all. When I turn my head they swish lightly and draw attention to my neck. I like that effect. While the colors are not loud, they still make a statement. Beautiful stylish earrings!",3008,4617
5.0,1575229625729,Lovely bracelet!,"Absolutely love this bracelet. It's colorful, lightweight and will fit with any outfit.

5.0,1569077201214,Well-made shirt,"The shirt fits true to size, is soft, breathable and comfortable to wear. The stitching is good, so it should hold up while washing. Good for wearing at home or under a sweater. The sleeves are good length. I recommend it.",3008,7355
5.0,1569076244990,Love it!,"This shawl is soft, warm and is long enough to wrap around your shoulders and then some. It will suit for both everyday use and special occasions as a wrap. I recommend it.",3008,7077
4.0,1567367998139,Different dress,"The dress that came was not what we expected to get, but it is rather cute. It fits the age bracket of 4-6 year old. It's soft where it touches the skin. The colors are bright and it's comfortable and easy to run in, does not confine movements. It bunches some in the back but it's hardly noticeable especially when my girl is on the move. All in all, nice dress for a party or just any day.",3008,7356

4.0,1563049500935,Nice top,"This shirt fits true to size. It came wrinkled, so it would need a steamer to bring it to tip top look.

I recommend it.",3008,4275
3.0,1562695376435,It's ok product,"The ties come nicely packaged, and can be a gift as well. They are a bit narrower that I wanted, made out of polyester. One tie is blue, the other is pink stripe with silver threads in between.",3008,1150

Recommend dry cleaning.",3008,6328
1.0,1561843068572,Completely dissatisfied,This was all kinds of awful. It not only didn't fit right but was misshapen with one side sticking out in the middle. Gah! It didn't look anything like the picture and was way too roomy in the chest. Stitching was shoddy. It was a hot mess of a dress. I do not recommend it.,3008,7167
4.0,1561399597323,Cute little thing,It's a good quality wallet with high-end stitching. It's light brown color and smells nice. It fits 6 cards but has no space for cash at all. But it will certainly make a good gift for anyone.,3008,2524
5.0,1561131161716,Very beautiful,"This bracelet came in lovely pink velvet pouch, so it would be perfect as a gift. The bracelet itself is well made, the size is the same as indicated on the picture. The strings in the back regulate the size of the bracelet so it would fit any wrist, and once you pull them to the desired fit, the bracelet stays put. I am very satisfied with quality and the look of it on my wrist. It's perfect for summer. I highly recommend it.",3008,4282
2.0,1584974914859,Walwee Watch,"I was really looking forward to receiving this watch but was sorely disappointed in the final product.<br /><br />In the case of getting what you pay for, this value watch is unusable. I have spent the past week attempting to get this watch to work and despite my efforts and reading through the directions at least a couple dozen times, this watch just doesn’t set time. The instructions are simple but the watch doesn’t act in accordance to them.  After a total of about five hours attempting to set this watch, I finally gave up as it would just never set.  The light works as long as you are pressing the button to do so and the watch is super bulky and well presented.  But no matter how well it’s presented or seemingly well made, it’s of no use.<br /><br />I wouldn’t recommend this watch due to its non performance.",3012,2433
5.0,1582667652043,Leather Bracelet,"This men's bracelet is really attractive, the multi strands of braided leather are masculine in feel, and the silver toggle is a very nice addition.  The toggle makes it far easier to put on than the traditional clasp, and it looks rather expensive.  This is a great addition to any mans wardrobe, be it at the office or at the club later in the evening.  I am very satisfied with this piece of jewelry-I'm certain that you will be satisfied with it as well!",3012,7367
5.0,1576424280958,Radiant Bracelet,"This bracelet looks like a million dollars without the price tag!<br /><br />I put this bracelet on a girlfriend and saw how much she enjoyed it!  She said that it was easy to put on and that it felt very lightweight throughout the evening. I kept noticing that it would catch the light and sparkle on her wrist, making it very eye catching for how small it is.  The gold color is also a wonderful touch of class that will never go out of style.  Her big word for the bracelet was radiant.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this beautiful bracelet to anyone looking for a show stopper piece of jewelry.",3012,7375
5.0,1574867199012,Patterned Bangles,These gorgeous bangle bracelets are absolutely perfect for any outfit and really bring an elegant effect to this classic look.<br /><br />These bracelets came in a cute little burlap bag which seems like such a nice touch for gift giving.  The first thing I noticed was how heavy and well made these bangles are.  They did not warp or bend with putting them or through wear.  The other thing that I noticed was how beautifully designed they are.  They have a nice pattern that lightly accents the overall look of them.  Definitely a great new accessory!<br /><br />Definitely recommend!,3012,7266

The design is great and feels like thought was actually put into how the user would use this bag in many different ways.  There is plenty of room within the main section and has a separate front compartment for other uses.  The large handle on the bag is great and has plenty of room for your hand and wrist.<br /><br />Would absolutely recommend this travel bag for anyone looking for a durable toiletry bag.",3012,7380
4.0,1565577362780,Lightweight Gym Bag,"I put this duffle through the paces and was pretty impressed by how well it held up.<br /><br />The lightweight gym bag is roomy, versatile and easy to use.  Loved that it has breathable ports on either end to keep the bag from becoming odorous with time.  I packed 3 outfits and two pairs of shoes within this duffle easily and the bag did not become cumbersome as many would with that many items packed in.  There are plenty of storage places inside and on either end.<br /><br />The only downfall I see is that the fabric is very thin and I am unsure how this bag will hold up over time.  I would still recommend for how roomy and easy this gym bag is.",3012,2762

4.0,1594125291923,Comfortable,It’s been awhile since I’ve tried one of these on so it was quite a feat slipping these over my shoulders then adjusting everything to cover correctly. The pair I received is just ever so slightly off center in the front but that can be accounted for by my body not being perfectly asymmetric. The pads protect modesty and do not move or shift. The bands were tight enough to keep everything in place with no slippage. Wore these while doing household chores and never had to readjust all day. Very comfortable.,3013,575
4.0,1584986927454,Good slipper socks.,"These fit good, and seem well made. I would describe this as equivalent to the thickness of a medium grade ankle sock.

My back up pair does not have those lenses so I thought this product would help bridge the gap. Essentially they are are a pair of frames with clear (non-prescription lenses) and clip tinted sunglass lenses. I found the sunglass portion acceptable and actually quite helpful when driving. I wore them over my regular prescription glasses and they were fine. They are supposedly designed for nearsighted people but on their own, they really made no difference whatsoever.

The scraf itself is 100% polyester and trimmed with nylon lace. The fabric is soft and sheer. Versatile, it can be used as a scarf, shawl, belf or headcover. It travels well. Although the directions say to hand wash I have successfully laundered in a lingerie bag in cold water on the gentle cycle and line dried. Turned out perfect. The only criticism I have is osf the lace trim. I do not like the raw, unfinsihed edges. I realize that the finge, eyelashlook is popular but to me it looks sloppy and cheapens an otherwise attractive accessory. Not a deal breaker because it is otherwise a lovely scarf.",3048,6283

Which is why no pic, it made it’s way up in the Sacred Closet Shelf as soon as he opened it.

He will pick out the one he wants to wear when we go “out” - to dinner, visit friends etc. Yes we have adapted to our country home of 25 years, on 9 acres in the the sticks,  5 acres of which is a pond. We have converted to Midwest hicks who have “dress” brimmed baseball  hats lol. It has pride of place among the Coast Guard, NYFD, FBI, and many more.<br /><br />To the hat’s quality, I can say it is well made, thick material and well sewn and put together.

We are talking riding Centuries with his group on occasion and regularly riding 50+ miles with them on weekends and midweek in weather without ice or snow. One pair went to my lounging enthusiast husband, who really loves them for comfy socks with his slippers and pajama pants in the evenings, watching TV.<br /><br />My sporty BIL loves them too.

The embroidery is really nice, and I love the addition of little bright colored tassels on the top sleeve and shoulder area. Now you should’ve aware that this is a loose fitting, garment. It is shaped a lot like a poncho, but with seams holding the two sides together. I wear it out running errands and anything else that doesn’t involve eating. I am a slob, eating with white shirt = stained and ruined in five minutes. Given the style this would be a great swimsuit coverup with a pair of capris, to look dressed. I personally wear a tight fitting spandex layering tank under it (white) as it is very thin and it IS white.",3269,4637

No more having to find readers every time, losing them, and never having any nearby when you need them. The bifocal sunglasses came next. No more driving in sunglasses but being unable to read anything close. Read outside on the deck!<br /><br />These are a great shape and seem very well made. My strength is 3.00 which isn’t easy to get on here sometimes in readers of any kind. These are perfect, the lens is crisp and not wavy or flawed, and the bifocal area is the right height and is right size.

They are really well made, thick and soft, structured with arch support knitted in that really is nice for walking and being on your feet. I love to wear them treadmill walking, as hiking is too much for me with all the ailments I have, but these are just as good for overweight, past middle-aged, non-athletic gals like me, for the treadmill.

My husband LOVES it. Only down side is there is not a whole lot of room to stuff crap in like my husband does, as it is slim. But he plans to use it when he doesn’t want to carry his stuffed wallet. It has plenty of slots for credit cards and you could fold up some money to stick in a slot. He said he can just throw it in a pocket to run out on errands. C",3269,3034
3.0,1621264084249,Small and Not as Nice as I'd Hoped,I'm a little disappointed in these blue and silver earrings. The tiny blue stones don't move independently - they are one big solid mass and they are only marginally larger than a pair of studs. They feel thin in texture and thus inexpensive. They may be grade AAA cubic zirconia but not a lot of sparkle and whatever silver content there is is very miniscule. They're OK but not three dimensional enough for me to feel glamorous in them.,3299,7991
5.0,1617719694880,Cool Set of Punk Rings Made to Look Vintage,"This is a cool collection of ""punk"" rings. It includes a dragon, skull, octopus tentacles, snake, claws, and other creepy rings. The quality is pretty good - it's not shiny silver but has that blackish cast that suits the goth sensibility. It's not vintage but made to look as if it were. It arrives in a jumble inside a black drawstring bag but that's fine. I think it would be good for Halloween as well. The best thing is that all the rings are adjustable - you can bend them and they will conform to the size of your finger, so it's one size fits all. Overall I'm satisfied with the quality of these rings.",3299,955
3.0,1608175168373,Cheap But Fun,"The photos look better than the real thing. This set of four long necklaces offer a nice variety of designs but the quality is poor. The ""silver"" is that type of spray painted silver you see in costume jewelry sold at 99 cent stores- a shallow metallic coating that you know will tarnish or rub off in time. The chains vary in thickness but are made of the same cheap metal. Nevertheless, this is a fun lot - jewelry you can wear just for fun with no fear of any great loss if you happen to lose it. Each one comes in a plastic baggie the way you'd get it at a wholesaler, with a single drawstring velvet bag holding them all.",3299,7997
4.0,1596926792756,Larger Than Expected But Still Chic,"They're bigger than I wanted them to be but they're still attractive and eye catching - the acrylic resin material is very thin and lacks the weight of a quality product but only you can tell - they look trendy and possibly pricey from a distance. It's only when you pick them up and feel them that you can tell they are of low quality though dressed up nicely in a blue gift box. Since the price wasn't that high to begin with, I'm not complaining but beware if you're gifting this to someone in hopes she will think you spent a lot of money on it (she'll be able to tell you didn't).",3299,8003

Having ordered a lot of delicate jewelry from Amazon over the years, I expected a thin chain and mild sparkle. I was surprised and pleased at how bright and sparkly this necklace actually is. The design is cute (a cut out heart suspended over a round pendant with the missing heart) and it catches people's eyes even though it is quite small (the pendant is smaller than a dime).  It isn't very long, however, so this is best worn as a choker-like necklace. The necklace appears to have holes that allow you to extend the length but they are so small they are hard to see. So I went for the largest circle which makes the fit tight.<br /><br />Overall I like it very much but I wish the extension holes were bigger.",3299,8004
4.0,1574518692799,"Huge Statement Earrings, Very Boho","I can see a supermodel wearing these layered tassel earrings as she walks down a runway. They are well-made but the style is loud and not suitable for everyday wear. They swing nicely from your earlobes and because they are made of yarn and beads, lightweight despite their size. They do not strike me as ""expensive"" earrings, however, because the tag that comes with them simply says ""Fashion Earrings"" - the same kind of generic tag you see attached to $1 earrings.  They're OK for what they are but I wouldn't pay too much for them.",3299,4617
4.0,1571766352699,Reddish Orange Sunglasses Are Surprisingly Attractive,"I've never owned a pair of sunglasses with reddish orange lenses but they are surprisingly attractive to wear. They are lightweight and you can tell they are not expensive by the touch of them (the frame is thin, as is the tips of the stems) but from a distance people will think you spent quite a bit on your glasses. It comes with a faux leather case which is nice but has no cleansing cloth, which I was strange. But I was surprised how well these fit, and they keep out the glare of the sun really well. They are not mirrored (you can see your eyes from the outside) but they look cool.",3299,7225
5.0,1571195284525,Stylish Sunglasses That Are Subtly Retro,"I ordered the tortoise color and am very pleased with the fit and style of these sunglasses. It looks retro without looking too obviously hipster - the effect is more subtle than other retro glasses I've worn (For example, Cat's Eye sunglasses). They come with a black faux leather case (envelope style) and cleaning cloth. The quality is very good and they look more expensive than the actual price. They also deflect strong sunlight as well (It has UV400 protection). Overall I have no complaints.",3299,5027
3.0,1567467940889,Poor Presentation Ruins Otherwise Decent Product,"This set of gold ID bracelets (his and hers) are attractive even though it is made of that overly shiny yellow ""gold"" that looks cheap because it's so flashy. My main issue is the wasteful packaging. It comes in a Tiffany blue box with a foam insert that was clearly meant for earrings! Worse, each bracelet is encased inside a tight, saran wrap-like seal that is more appropriate to freeze dried food than jewelry. In my struggle to remove the plastic, I used a scissor which had the unfortunate impact of scratching the edge of the woman's bracelet. When I finally removed both ID bracelet, the quality did not impress me.",3299,8007
5.0,1565087585521,Leather Toiletry Bag with Brass Hardware,"This toiletry bag is made of smooth, pliable leather with brass hardware. It's not the highest quality but it's not bad, either, and I've seen similarly styled bags going for much more - the only difference with those is that they had a designer name, or was packaged in a fancy gift box. This one would benefit from such treatment (in comes in rather dull, pedestrian packaging) but in terms of actual use, it's not bad at all, as it has more than enough room to pack an electric or standard razor, comb, shaving cream, and cologne. Very nicely made too, and it's well-sewn. Overall it has everything you'd want in a toiletry bag, especially for men.",3299,7380
4.0,1564324505562,"Big Pink Sunglasses, Nice Fashion Statement","These sunglasses are so pink you'll feel like a Barbie girl wearing them. This is because the pink lenses are huge and unlike typical sunglasses, have bee glued over the metal frames themselves, covering them. They are oversized and make a great fashion statement. I also like the faux leather case they came in - it's white with ""Skyway"" imprinted in gold. They are not polarized so I wouldn't wear them in brightly lit environments but they do have 100% UV protection.

It has silicone bristles on each palm so you can use the gloves themselves to scrub the floor, pots and pans and whatever needs scrubbing. It feels a little awkward at first as you're using your hands directly to scrub, but it does help out if your scrubber is getting dull and you need some reinforcement.  The gloves are thick enough to provide a buffer between my hand and the bristles. I'm still getting used to the feel but this is certainly an innovative product.",3299,4648
2.0,1553120262093,"Not Flattering, Too Drapey","I ordered the correct size but the dress isn't very flattering - it is drapey and loose, just like the photo, but on a skinny person it looks like you are wearing a sack.

Sometimes at weddings, kids take their shoes off and dance, and then I worry about the tights getting all gross and dirty from the dance floor and holes getting in the bottom from too much wear. Also if your daughter is wearing these with A dress and boots/ socks then the convertible foot can help with less bunching.<br />With that feature, they can be pulled up and then no worry about either of those problem!<br />I'm thinking about converting to convertible tights from now on!<br />The 11-14 size fit my 9 year old daughter perfectly, so you might want to size up if you're 13 or 14.",3324,8086

5.0,1558897968442,Soft and comfortable; good fit; non-binding waistband,"This hits nearly all the marks that I find important in a pair of underwear. First off, they are comfortable. The fabric is very soft, and thick enough to be substantial, but not so thick that they hold in a lot of heat. The elastic waistband is snug but not binding, and there's no tag or seam to cause irritation.  The legs do not ride up. It does not have a fly opening but I'm fine with that.  I've not had any fabric shrinking after laundering (including drying them in a drier on medium heat). No loose threads or poor stitching.<br /><br />The only mark that it falls just a bit short is the fabric fiber. I normally prefer 100% cotton for the breathability. This is only 30% cotton with the balance being poly. That's great for durability wash after wash, but I would prefer a higher cotton content -- perhaps 50% -- to balance out the poly. These have been comfortable even though it's been quite hot, but I'd still prefer just a bit more cotton in the mix.<br /><br />But even with just 30% cotton, these have more than enough positives for me to consider them as excellent boxer briefs.",4215,9414

The build quality is good, and the material is soft and comfortable even with just a few washes.  The size (34 waist, 34 length) is true.<br /><br />The cons are that the rise is a bit short so they ride rather low (at least for my preference). The zipper, while of good quality, is very short as well which can be a bit cumbersome.  The cons drop my rating to 4 stars, but these remain a decent pair of skinny jeans that are not constraining while maintaining a slim profile and fit.",4215,6910

It does have a rather short rise, however, which means the jeans sit lower than I like on my hips. The zipper, while of good quality, is also rather short, which is annoying.<br /><br />Not perfect, but a decent (4-star) pair of jeans. If the rise were a little longer, as well as a longer zipper length, it would be a 5-star pair.",4215,9415
3.0,1544322052853,"Lots of stretch, but material is thin; so-so fit","This is a so-so pair of jeans. The high point is the amount of stretch. They easily give, especially at the waist, which allows them to fit without feeling binding. The material is soft and the washed look is nice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some notable negatives as well. The zipper is shorter than normal, making it a bit challenging to use.  The material is quite thin and, while soft, also feels somewhat cheap. The pocket linings are shorter than customary. It's cut long in the inseam area and a bit baggy in the seat area which makes this look rather ill-fitting even though the waist size (I have it in 34) is true. While no length is specified in the listing, the pair I have are waist 34 and inseam 30.<br /><br />It's not a bad pair of jeans, but certainly not an outstanding pair either.

I washed them in the regular laundry cycle and they came out of the dryer nice and soft.

Even a cheap solid case would have been fine.  That said, these sunglasses do filter out a lot of glaring rays but honestly, the shape of them leaves something to be desired.  If you want that retro 50's look then these would be a great choice.  They fit well on my narrow face and are comfortable, but these won't be my first choice when going outside.",4218,8796
4.0,1626973813411,I Like Them,"I guess I'm the only one who likes these shorts.  I got an XL size for review and they fit me nicely.  I'm 5'9"", 148 lbs and have female birthing hips.  These shorts fit well and are comfortable.  I washed them in the dark laundry load and they came out of the dryer nice and soft and still fit.  I like them.  They seem to be very well constructed too.",4218,7121
5.0,1625779939084,Lovely Men's Long Sleeved Shirt,"This is a lovely men's shirt.  It's great for summer wear since it's light weight.  I ordered the XXL size for review and it's pretty much true to size.  I like that the inside, where the buttons are on one side, and the button holes on the other are sewn down.  That way there's no loose or open material to deal with like some cheaper shirts have.  I washed it with like colors using warm water and it went through the wash cycle just fine.  It came out of the dryer somewhat wrinkled, and will need ironing before wearing, but I don't think it shrunk or faded any.  I think this is a very nice shirt and is a beautiful color.",4218,9448

I was glad that the material was not tight and fit easily around my hips.  These have a pocket that you can hold a phone in and overall are very comfortable.

I just love it and will be wearing it on those super cold, blustery days.  Two gaiters come in a pack - one blue, one red, and they are very soft and super warm.

I'm 5'9"", 142 lbs and have an average sized butt.  The 12's were a tad too tight so I gave them to my daughter.  The 14's fit nicely and I'm definitely keeping those.  I washed both pairs in the regular laundry cycle and both pairs came out of the dryer rolled up at the legs which I find a bit frustrating.  They are already short enough (just barely long enough to keep the cellulite hidden) and even when I tried unrolling them they still wanted to roll right back up.  I docked a star for this.  Otherwise, they seem to be well made jeans, are soft and not overly distressed.",4218,175

This shirt fits perfectly in the shoulders, it doesn't hug my waist and it flows nicely over my hips.  There is nothing to dislike about it.  It's blend of cotton and polyester so it shouldn't shrink, or much at all.  It feels loose enough for comfort but isn't baggy looking.  It's light weight so it's good for summer wear.  It's a very pretty shirt.",4218,9455
3.0,1600182339533,Not Nearly As Good As I Expected,"This poncho wrap looks a lot better on the product page than it does in real life.  It doesn't fit me well - I'm 5'9"", 142 lbs, 34B and I though it would hang a lot better.  It needs to be a little longer and I just can't seem to get it adjusted so that it looks like the picture.  It's thin and not for cold weather unless you have something substantial on underneath it.  The fringe string is really cheap looking and I might find better fringe at the cloth store to replace it later.  As a matter of fact, I think I will sew it up like a real poncho and see if that helps it to hang better on me.  Thank God mom taught me how to sew.  I was really looking forward to wearing this but am somewhat disappointed with it.",4218,717
4.0,1599930237624,Very Soft Black Tank Top,"This is a nice, very light-weight black asymmetrical tank top and is great to wear in hot weather.  I received a medium sized tank for review and it fits me fine.  I'm 5/9"", 142 lbs and have 34B chest.  I like my tanks real loose, and I would prefer this  to be a little bit looser, but I'd have to get large size for that.  It's still comfortable, very soft and feels good to my skin.  It looks exactly as pictured on the product page.",4218,7141

They are very thin, tend to catch onto things like clothes being pulled on or off over my head, and on pillows if I forget to take them out.  When they get stuck they catch they stretched out and I have to bend them back.  I wore these for about 2 days and when I took them out the metal had tarnished into another color and looked bad.  I can't advise buying these and mine aren't going to get tossed since they're Sterling silver, but I doubt I'll be wearing them anymore.",4218,2407
5.0,1599585542692,Awesome Selection of Stud Earrings,"This selection of stud earrings is great!  I love wearing studs and like that none of them are very big.  I play a lot of tennis and want to wear earrings, but they have to be small and these work out very well.  The stones are lovely and the diamond ones are very sparkly.  The black ones have a very unique and beautiful look.  The backing is a regular butterfly backing and it holds the earrings in place very well.  They never feel like they are coming loose and I haven't had one fall out yet.  I'm really surprised at how nice these earrings are and so inexpensive which is extra good since I lose earrings all the time.",4218,3295
5.0,1596654658472,Small and Pretty,"These are small, lovely pearl studs.  They are the perfect size for me to wear when playing tennis.  I don't like studs that are big or obvious - just some nice, discrete sporty studs.  These work perfect for that.  They come with extra backings.  You get the flat, plastic circular backings plus a pair of cone backings which I like best.",4218,9458
5.0,1595170889838,I Love This Top!,"I am blown away by the quality and fit of this beautiful blouse.  I received the medium size for review and it fits me just right with a little room to spare.  I'm 5'9"". 142 lbs, 34B, and have birthing hips.  This blouse draped nicely over my hips fit well on my shoulders and everything about it was just right.  The material is soft, sheeny with lovely furrows and the sewing is very well done.  There is absolutely nothing negative I can find to say about it.  I placed it in a mesh bag when put in the laundry and placed it on a rack to dry.  It dried beautifully with no wrinkles and looks brand new.  This is a lovely top to wear to even the fancy occasions as well as a casual office top.",4218,9460
3.0,1594507570623,O.K. Ear Muffs,"These ear muffs don't really cover my ears as much as I would like so if I wear them this coming winter it will probably be over a toboggan.

5.0,1586034715661,Very Nice Gripper Socks,These are nice gripper socks and fit my female size 11 feet really well.

These should last a long time.,4218,1970

I didn't notice any fading - maybe a little shrinking but not much after getting them out of the dryer.",4218,2948
4.0,1582894119682,Very Pretty Necklace,This is a very pretty necklace but you will have to take some time to make sure the inner and outer chains are not twisted together and that the necklace hangs evenly on your neck.  The little wheels with the lovely cubic zirconia diamonds might have a tendency to lay flat instead of being upright but I haven't worn it long enough to know when they tend to lay flat.  I like this necklace a lot and it can be worn casually as well as with more formal clothing.  It doesn't look cheap at all.,4218,3592
4.0,1582218057024,Light-weight Shorts,These athletic shorts are very light-weight and don't have a mesh liner on the inside.  Unfortunately they don't have any pockets whatsoever so minus one star.  They have a nice wide waistband with a drawstring to cinch it in if necessary.  They washed well and came out of the dyer with no wrinkles.,4218,9467
4.0,1580596323527,Very Pretty Tunic Dress,"I received a small size summer tunic dress for review and it fit me pretty well.  I'm 5'9"" tall, 142 lbs, small chested and have birthing hips.  The first time I put it on I put it on backwards thinking the ties were supposed to go in the back and wondered why it was choking me a little at my neck.  I went back and looked at the picture on the product page and realized that the ties go in front and not the back.  That helped a lot.  I think it runs large because I usually take at least a medium or a large in most dresses.  The material is very soft and hangs well and the burgundy color with the light flowers is very pretty.  I will be wearing it with either skinny jeans or leggings this summer.",4218,9469
5.0,1580594320811,Very Pretty Boots,These are beautiful boots but they seem more like house booties than something to wear in the snow.  But they can definitely be worn outside.  I wish they came in my size because they are so well made and cute.  These are very soft on the inside and should keep feet warm but I don't know how waterproof they are.  The soles are light weight but don't flex much at all but seem durable.  As of this review I don't know how much they cost.,4218,8079
5.0,1580177478469,Soft and Warm!,"These are some seriously good quality socks and are so soft, thick and warm.  I love that they are 40% merino wool because that's what makes them so warm.

I received the large size for review and I'm 5'9"", 141 pounds with birthing hips and this skirt looks big on me.  it goes down to mid-way of my shins.  I can still wear it, but i probably won't.  It really needs to be at least one size smaller because it just sort of hangs on me.  I love the coloring and style of this skirt and the pleats are phenomenally well done.",4218,9475
5.0,1577979284057,Great Tennis Socks,"Despite these socks being advertised for men and boys, find them to be excellent tennis socks for my size 11 female feet.  I'm always searching for socks that I can wear while playing a hard singles tennis match and these did nicely.  They didn't bunch up or slip back down my heels inside my shoes, and they padded my feet just right.  There's really nothing negative I can find to say about them.

5.0,1577800223881,Good Quality Latex Free Gloves,"think these latex-free gloves are every bit as good as name brand latex gloves. They are also prettier with the lace imprint going around the bottom of the gloves. I have worn regular latex gloves a lot, especially when making my hand made soaps but I will be wearing these from now on. I don't think I'm allergic to latex but I used to get some horrible zits after going to the dentist so maybe I am. These latex-free gloves feel flexible yet seem durable to last a good while.",4218,468
4.0,1577025132769,Pretty Earrings,These earrings look exactly as pictured on the product page.  They are beaded with tiny black and white beads and would be great to wear with any outfit.

I suggest buying a size larger than what you normally wear.",4218,6316
5.0,1575817802747,Soft and Stretchy,"This pajama set is soft and stretchy.  The material is not real thick but should be warm nonetheless.  I received the large size for review and they fit my skinny teen - approx. 103 lbs, 5'4"" but were a few inches too short in length.  Since these are going to be worn around the house she doesn't care if they are too short. They fit well otherwise.

The sewing and construction is excellent, and has a nice texture to it.  My husband was thrilled to get it.  This is a very good shirt and can be worn for casual wear and when very nice shirts are required.<br /><br />UPDATE 12.2.19  I have deducted a star from 5 to 4.  I washed it in the regular laundry and it did fine except the collar really crinkled and wrinkled up pretty badly.  The rest of the shirt was fine - no shrinking and no fading and still very soft.

I received the large size for review and I'm 5'9"" tall, and 141 pounds. These fit me well and cover my belly button making my stomach look a little flatter than it actually is.

3.0,1573331565232,Cheap Necklace,"This necklace is definitely cheap looking.  It looks like one you would see hanging on the rack next to the cash register in one of those discount Asian stores.  It would make a nice stocking stuffer for a kid, but I don't think too many adults will want to wear it.  The chain is really cheap and not as good as cheap gold plating.  I don't know how much it costs but I wouldn't want to spend more than 5 or 6 dollars for it.  The stone is unpolished pink quartz and for the most part is nice looking.  I don't know if it will permanently stay attached to the chain or not.  Don't give this to your girlfriend as a serious gift or she will see how cheap you are.",4218,2472

They do a great job of blocking out harsh, glaring/blinding sunlight and they fit my narrow face well.  They seem to be well constructed.  My only complaint is that the nose pads have a small spot on them that tend to feel scratchy on my nose.  I will use some very fine grit sandpaper later on to try and smooth them down some, but other than that I think these are very good sunglasses.",4218,1780
5.0,1572538034186,Great Sun Glasses,These are very comfortable glasses that I can easily wear on my narrow head - female.

It's not knitted, but is a semi-thick piece of printed material that has little metallic studs on the lower ends giving it a sparkly, vibrant look.  I haven't washed it yet but when I do I will place it in a mesh bag for the washer and then lay it out to dry.  It should hold it's shape fairly well.

If you carry a big bag with tons of stuff in it, you might could use a key ring like this.  I have put keys on it that we need, but only use one in a while.  This key ring is a good way for us to always know where those particular keys are.  It seems to be well made and should last a long time.",4218,6785
3.0,1571656888306,Great Idea Except for the Mesh Back,"This is a very cute idea for a baseball cap.  Unfortunately, I really don't like baseball caps with a mesh back - not feminine enough and reminds me of what truck drivers wear.  But, the sequins are sparkly and the little ears are cute.  I think it would have been better to have sewn all the sequins on a cloth baseball cap.  But, if you like mesh backed caps then this cap should make you very happy.",4218,3309

I don't have big hair but I can certainly see how those with big hair, buns, top ponytails and other big hair styles would like this hat.  I still will wear it anyway just because it's so comfy. The visor helps block bright sun light and I can see myself wearing it this winter on the tennis court.  It's very well knitted, soft, stretchy and a lovely shade of pink.",4218,1973
4.0,1570716401935,Very Nice Tweed Cap,I received the brown tweed cap with flaps for review.  The tweed material is very good quality and the cap looks like something grandpa would have worn - very well made back in the day.  Hubs has a big head and this cap fits it perfectly.  The only thing he's not real fond of is how the flaps are attached to the cap.  He doesn't like the zipper because he says if you decided to fold the flaps under instead of taking them off you can see the zipper pull.  He has another cap with flaps that you just fold under when you don't want the flaps.  I think it looks fine with the zipper pull still on it but he's a little picky about his caps.  When the flaps are taken off 1/2 the zipper is still there but it is so thin that it's really hard to see and I seriously doubt anyone would notice it.  I like this cap a lot and it looks great on his head and it looks exactly as pictured on the product page.,4218,9494

I was really surprised at how awesome they looked and felt when I took them out of the package. I washed them in the regular cycle with whites in warm water and they might have shrunk a little bit, but they came out of the dryer just fine.

These socks had just arrived that day in the mail so even without washing them I put them on and almost instantly my legs started feeling better.  I wore them for a couple of hours and they really helped me recover so I was surprised, but also very pleased and will use them as needed.  They look like the socks the wicked witch of the east wore when the house landed on her but they are pretty cute.  They do compress but not so much as to cut off blood circulation and I like that they go all the way up to my knees.  BTW, I won the Round Robin!",4218,9498
4.0,1567455341157,Very Nice Clear Purse,"This is a really nice see-through bag for those occasions/events that women are required to carry their items in a clear bag due to security reasons.  I had to do that last weekend when attending a football game.  This bag would have been great to have then but luckily I had another clear bag.  This one is much more purse-like and has a nice, smaller purse that goes inside it.  The clear plastic is good quality and durable and the mock snake skin looks really good.  The only thing I find a little bit of fault with is that this purse can't be completely closed.  It needs a snap or a Velcro patch to keep both sides of the bag very close together to prevent anyone reaching in and helping themselves to the contents.  Other than that I think it's a great clear purse.",4218,1975

I received the XXL size for review and they are perfect.  I'm 5'9"", 142 pounds and they aren't tight feeling at all, but still are form fitting.  They have lots of stretch so if you are bigger than me they should still fit.  Unless you are overly Rubenesque, or more petite, I recommend this size despite them being XXL.",4218,7163

I tried using them at the pool the other day to read in the sunlight, and they helped with that, but it wasn't as easy as reading with my regular glasses.  I have reading sunglasses that I like a lot better than these.  They seem to be sturdy enough built, and some people really like them.  I just find the bifocal part a little too intense.",4218,9500
4.0,1565351867058,Very Pretty but BIG Lenses,"These sun glasses have extra large lenses that really look kind of stupid on my smaller sized head.  But, I like them anyway.  The blue color is so cool!  Plus, they are very lightweight and come with a case.  I think the frame is sturdy enough to last for a while or until I sit on them.  I haven't tried wearing them on the tennis court yet, but probably will soon and I don't care if the ladies tease me about the size of them.  If you have a big head these might be perfect for you.",4218,3033

The material is very good quality too and it's a very attractive men's shirt.  Hubs likes it a lot but will probably not wear it with the sleeves rolled up.  I washed it in the regular cycle and it came out of the dryer crisp, but will still need some ironing.  This shirt makes for a great dress or casual shirt. Also, it's not orange but a very soft pink/red.",4218,6328

I already washed them in the regular cycle and they came out of dryer just fine with no noticeable shrinking or fading.  I really like the colors and how they are arranged  -  these make for great hiking socks or just good to wear when the weather is cool.  I'm hesitant to give them a full 5 stars right now because though I tried them on and wore them for a while, I didn't wear them all day and I don't know if the tops are going to become tight feeling or not.  I'm real sensitive about sock tops and have actually cut them off before when they felt like they were getting tight feeling.  I like them loose so they don't impede blood flow and make my feet cold.  I'm skinny and very athletic but just can't tolerate tight tops.",4218,6327

The material is nice and stretchy and the padding is where it needs to be to help keep my bum from getting excessively sore from hours on my bike.  I haven't yet built up any bum resistance this year so these shorts were a welcome sight on my list of items I could review.  I washed them in with the regular laundry and they came out of the dryer just fine.",4218,589

But, I wore in during a tough tennis match this morning and the necklace felt fine, looked great and didn't break.  I wouldn't sleep with it on but otherwise I think it should be fine.  I really love the look it gave me - totally different from the necklaces I usually wear and with a nice, light tan going, my racerback tank and some running shorts, I think I looked pretty good!  It reminds me of some beach jewelry  I used to wear when I was a teenager.",4218,478
4.0,1560435272961,Pretty Earring for Pierced Ears,"These are supposed to go through pierced earlobes.  I thought at first, because of they way they are designed that they would kind of slide onto my earlobe but they would fall off after taking 3 steps.  I also thought that the curved posts might be too thick but they slipped through my piercings just fine.  They look nice too.  Just don't keep pushing it further through the piercing hole because the post widens as it gets closer to the pearl.  Ahhh.......the pearl.  It's very pretty and bigger than I though it would be.  The metal on the earring is very silvery shiny too.  These would be good to wear casually and to more formal events.",4218,9505

The little prong scrubbers are flexible and are actually kind of soft feeling, but help to get gunk off of dishes.  I use these for pre-washing dishes before loading them into the dishwasher.  They can be worn on either hand depending on what textured side of the gloves you want to use.  They are thicker than they look and also durable so I expect these to last a long time.",4218,4648
4.0,1559947405524,Great Casual Black Blazer,"I really like this blazer and that surprises me since I didn't think I would.  Women's blazers rarely fit me very well and this one fits me very nicely.  I love the pre-rolled up sleeves (I have very long arms and most blazer sleeves are far too short), and the light-weight makes it good to wear even on summer evenings.  It will go great with skirts, pants and blue jeans.  I haven't washed it yet but since it's made out of polyester I'd bet a paycheck it won't shrink or fade.  It's got some stretch and does not feel binding at all.",4218,4666
4.0,1559398724631,Very Useful Light-Weight Backpack,"This is a very useful light-weight backpack when all you want is something to carry a few clothes, books and basic stuff.  My husband sometimes works as an extra on movie sets and this was exactly what he needed to carry some extra clothes and stuff that he frequently needs.  It doesn't have many pouches.  There's a pouch on each side on the outside, and a slot on the inside.  There are no zippers but there is a drawstring on the top outside to cinch the main bag up.  I like that the shoulders that are padded and the back is padded making it comfortable to wear.  It's water resistant and has couple of long reflective strips on the front.  I don't know what this backpack costs, but if it's less that $25 I will raise the star level from 4 to 5.",4218,9506
4.0,1559397877478,Nice Pencil Skirt,"I can't wear this skirt because I have birthing hips and they really shine when I slide this on, but my skinny teens really look good in it.  It's not for those with junk in the trunk or birthing hips, but looks great on skinnies with narrow hip structure.  The skirt is very soft and a deep black.  I haven't washed it yet but will place it in a mesh sack and then lay it out to dry.  I think it will shrink just from looking at it.  I will update this review after washing it if it goes wonky in the laundry.",4218,7056
5.0,1558822327178,Good Underwear for Men,"Hubs really likes these underwear and has been wearing them this past week.  He says they're soft, and don't ride up or are too tight.  He's particular about his underwear and I wasn't sure if he was going to like these or not.  They don't have a slot in front for peeing, but they have plenty of room for his junk.

4.0,1558200222885,Cute Hat,"This kind of looks like a hat my grandmother used to wear, but she had good taste in hats and it looked so cute on her.  I like this hat a lot, it feels comfortable on my head and I can bend it to sort of get it into the shape I want.  It looks kind of like it's had a hard life already by it's natural shape, so it looks best with casual wear - jean shorts, sundresses, etc...  I like how air can circulate through it help keep my head from getting hot.",4218,7959
3.0,1556930942934,Not My Favorite Socks,"I really wanted to like these socks more than I do, but I gave them to one of my daughters.  She likes these types of socks a lot more than I do.  I didn't realize when I selected them for review that they had that rubbery stuff in the heels to keep them from slipping down into shoes, but they never worked for me.  They slip down inside my shoes, though my daughter seems to like them a lot.  I also think they shrunk because they came out of the dryer looking a lot smaller than when I tossed them in the washing machine.  The colors are nice, and the fabric is really soft.",4218,3057
4.0,1555855700167,Nice Floppy Hat,"This hat is a substantial hat in that it has some weight, texture and quality.  It's floppy, but will keep the sun off your face and the back of your neck.  It flops just the right amount of flop.  The embroidered floral design is attractive but a tad on the gaudy side but still nice enough.  This is one of the few hats that actually fit my head rather nicely.  This hat will look really good this summer with a sun dress or while relaxing by the side of the pool.",4218,8800
4.0,1550769356094,Very Light Weight But is a Nice Jacket,"This is a really light-weight wind breaker type jacket.  The material on the jacket (I have the black and the white jacket in this style) is really thin but it feels good and is comfortable.  The sleeves on the white jacket are slightly transparent but the body is not due to doubling of material.  The side pocket zip up so things won't accidentally fall out.  I like this jacket a lot but will only wear it on slightly cool days or as a top layer with a sweater underneath on colder days.  It's very sporty looking and has a hidden hood in the neck collar.  The large size fits me well - I'm 5'9"", 148 pounds with long arms.",4218,32

The sewing is very good and they went through the regular laundry cycle just fine.  I didn't notice any fading or shrinking when I took them out of the dryer.  The pocket on the right front did seem to feel thicker  - like the inside pocket was bunched up but it wasn't.  I'm not really sure what was causing that.  Other than that, I think these are very good jeans.",4218,9417

3.0,1550278388682,O.k. for an Inexpensive Hat,"As of this review this hat is priced at $19.99 and I would not want to pay any more than that for it.  I don't think it will last a long time as the material is soft and very flexible.  The brim is nothing to write home about being narrow and flimsy, but for a kid or a teenager the hat is fine.  My teenaged daughter immediately claimed it when I pulled it out of the box it came it.",4218,3430
5.0,1550277654602,LOVE These Jeans,"I know these jeans are marketed to men, but if you're a tall, lanky female like me they will probably fit you very well and look awesome at the same time.  I'm 5'9"", 148 pounds and the 32x32 fit nicely.  The waist is a little loose and I have to wear a belt, but the length is perfect.  These are soft, durable, well made, and have that really cool crinkly folded look underneath the front pockets.  I washed and dried them yesterday and they came out of the dryer just fine with no fading or shrinking.  I'm wearing them right now and have had them on all day and they are extremely comfortable.  These, a nice tee-shirt and pair of Converse is my favorite outfit.  Oh yes!  They are also stretchy and just wonderful!",4218,9523

The material is durable jean material but non-stretchy.  I love the color and the distress is well done.  I normally wear 32 x 32 but I could barely squeeze into these.  My other 32 x 32  jeans are much looser.  These are much more like skinny than slim and if you normally wear a 32 think about upsizing unless your are really skinny.  I washed them in the normal cycle and they seemed to come out of the dryer o.k. but I wouldn't be able to tell if they shrank or not since I can't hardly get them on anyway.",4218,491
4.0,1546956295505,So Soft and Warm,I really like this faux fur neckwear.  It's dummy proof and that'svery appealing to me. All I have to do is push one end through the slot on the other end and voila! it's perfectly placed around my neck.  And it's very soft and doesn't go far down in that the length when wearing doesn't even come close to my legs as some scarves do.  I love wearing it and look forward to colder days this winter so I can wear it more often.  The black and white colors are lovely.,4218,9529
5.0,1544282999717,These Are Size 32/30 - Great for Women Too!,"I took a chance on selecting these jeans for review because the size on the product page only said ""32"".  I had no idea what the length would be. I have since discovered that they are 30"" length.  Unfortunately they are short on me since I can easily wear a 32 to 33 length.  But, these are still wearable since the legs are very slim and negates the short length.  Had they been wider legs that would have been a problem.  Overall - the material is durable denim and a very lovely deep blue color.  It has mottling as if the material had been creased which looks really good.  They legs can easily be folded at the cuffs and there's a lovely red thread on the inside that will show if they are cuffed once.  The waist is not not high, and the jeans are comfortably below my waist closer to my hips.  I know these are advertised for men but they fit my female body perfectly except for the length.  I washed and dried them in the dryer and they came out fine with no twisting or shrinking that I can detect.  They are a little bit stretchy too which is just wonderful!",4218,3431

I am one of those people that wear socks around the house instead of shoes and the GALIVA socks are the only ones that I have not worn out. They are the softest and most comfortable socks that I have ever worn. The packaging that they come in tells you a lot about the product.

The pants are high-waisted which I need, there's a side pocket on each side along with a hidden pocket on the inside back waistband. This hidden pocket is not closed with a zipper so I have some concerns about that not being secured and hidden item would need to be waterproof because of sweat during workouts. Perhaps you could put money and keys in a zip lock bag to keep moisture away. ? Anyway, I like the large waistband and the cuffed ankles to keep pant legs away when excercising or biking. These pants fit snug but would still be snug if you lost 10 or 20 pounds because the fabric is a 4-way stretch. I'm pretty excited to have these yoga pants.

Can you imagine how disappointed we size 8 or 9 customers are with ill fitting yoga socks? Very disappointing. Socks definitely need to be made longer for this size range.

So we've started putting together a home gym (still working on it) which is in the basement on concrete floors. Cold...brrrr....need socks! I have Raynauld's Syndrome so very sensitive to cold. So I need more and more socks that fit, by golly!",5298,7394
5.0,1586810516959,Pretty Cubic Zirconia Stones with Rose Gold Lever-Back Earrings,"Thee are very pretty PrimeSons cubic zirconia 18Kt rose gold plated lever-back earrings. The pronged cubic zirconia stones look like (but are not, garnet, pink tormaline, green peridot, yellow sapphire). The rose gold plating is nice. And I especially love the lever-back because sometimes you're not able to find the backing. Just put them on, push the lever closed, and you're on your way. No more looking on the floor for lost metal or plastic stoppers. More dressy but could also wear with casual clothing and no worry of losing an actual gemstone. This is a good thing.",5298,2118
4.0,1579934999994,Really pretty,"I like this pair of earrings very much, but am not sure if maybe others have had the same problem - the post section of these earrings seems incredibly thick or big around compared to any of the post earrings and even the more dangly ones I have that use a post with a clip in the back.  I had more trouble getting these posts to go all the way through the holes in my ears!  Mind you, I am in my 60s and had those holes pierced back when I was 14 years old so it's not like they are new!  I do know that over the years the holes in my earlobes are not technically healed, per se.  I can push an earring post in the front hole and poke all around inside my earlobe before finding the hole in the backside of the earlobe.  I mention this because I literally spent 20 minutes sitting on my bed trying to get these ""fatty"" posts to go all the way through to the back hole.  After a while it starts to hurt when I'm poking and poking and poking to find the back hole...and that's what happened with these.  I felt it was due more to the size of the post than my ""floating"" hole in the back.  With a thinner earring post, even if I poke, I usually am able to find that back hole within a couple of minutes.  All I can say is that after I got them in, they looked nice and were relatively lightweight on my ears.  Just think a thinner post size would have made these easier for me to wear.",5311,2118
1.0,1579118964465,Very disappointed,"The picture shows mirrored image earrings.  What I received are two of the exact same earring.

3.0,1570928612364,This beanie is one of the strangest I've had,"It's shiny black, reminding me of the seventies when there was a weird trend of using what looked like galoshes rubber in coats...bright yellow and neon pink plus shiny.  Didn't like them then and sure don't like the crinkley texture of this plastic material.  My thought about the material was, well, it won't get soaked (in rain or wet snow), but the knit band would...and the next thing that came to mind was, sure wouldn't breathe well either, meaning your head is going to get hot in this thing.  Not sure why it was packaged with socks and a face muff as they didn't go with this beanie at all.  I mean, if you are offering extras, with this hat, a pair of gloves (adult size - not child size) or a medium weight scarf to keep the neck warm...I doubt I will ever wear this beanie.  It's just a bit too odd.",5311,1972

Some younger folks may not get that reference, but it's true about these sunglasses - I really like them!  I tend to get over-sized glasses because I hate that ""edge"" fuzziness when the glasses are smaller and your eyes can focus through the glass as well as beyond the edge of the glasses.  It bothers me, so the easiest thing is to get big eye frames.  These are just that!  The pink-rose color is very soothing as well.  They come with a case - the kind that you squeeze open and drop them in - easy to put away.  Nice sunglasses!",5311,6691

4.0,1599915434029,cute but not really a man's style,These necklaces are very cute and fit together like a puzzle.  They seem well made and have a nice finish on them.  Chain is decent size and thickness and the clasp is durable and works smoothly.  Style is not really masculine (but the colors are) so it is an odd combo.  I can't really see myself wearing one.  Other issue is the heart does not stay together when joined so you really can't get the full effect of you wore them together.  Love the quality and the look but just not for me (or my wife- she was meh on the whole thing),5316,11137
5.0,1584961330989,barefoot workouts!,We workout daily and my wife always wears sneakers while I prefer a barefoot work out.  She has been having some ankle and Arch issues lately and decided to start doing more barefoot workouts as my arches are stronger now than when I was a teenager.  Her big problem is that she is constantly slipping on the carpeted living room where we do most of our workouts.  These socks off a great grip on the carpet with out causing her to stick to the floor in other areas of the house.  They fit perfect and are breathable and comfortable to wear.  She says don't wear them with shoes as they feel strange and are a bit uncomfortable in shoes.  These wash up just fine and no issues with shrinking.  These are great workout socks.,5316,11139
4.0,1566141499637,decent socks but odd saying,"These are decent socks.  Well made and comfortable.  Not sure what size they were supposed to be as there was no size listed and no size given on the package.  FYI they are a woman's size 9 (at least that is what my daughter wears and these fit her very well).  My issue is with the odd saying. ""hany with my dogs""  either I don't understand or know slang (a very real possibility) or the meant to say ""hang with my dogs""  either way it is kinda odd.  Being socks I guess it really isn't important what they say but more that they are comfortable and these socks are indeed very comfy.",5316,4629
3.0,1565986995534,No front pockets and underwear is just uncomfortable,"Not a huge fan of these shorts.  There is no front pockets, and the rear pocket is a zipper close and is just odd to use.  The underwear is uncomfortable and made me feel like I had a loaded diaper on.  I don't ride bikes so maybe these work well for that activity.  The shorts did fit well as did the underwear.  THey washed fine and no issues with shrinkage.  Maybe these would work better for bikers but they just didn't work for me.",5316,11140
4.0,1564762530189,Oversized is an understatement,"First and foremost, the lenses in these glasses are amazing.  They are polarized and offer a great level of shading (not too dark but even in full direct sun are dark enough).  Love the mirror effect on them and the blue color.  The frames are light weight and comfortable with no sharp edges or rough spots.  The frame color (white) is nice when you leave them in a hot car as they are much cooler to the touch than dark colored frames, but the white does nothing to make the glasses size more reasonable looking.  The size of these glasses are almost comical.  They are huge!  Everyone in our family tried them on and we looked like Elton John  with those grossly oversized glasses.  My wife said she felt like she was wearing a welding mask they are so big.  If you like those oversized huge glasses then these are the sunglasses for you.  If you like a more compact or less radical glass then look elsewhere.",5316,3033
5.0,1560008503722,Very pretty,This is a very pretty necklace.  The stars are petite and very complimentary to the overall design.  The chain is delicate without being too thin (no need to worry about breakage if your careful and don't yank it).  Clasp was easy to use and held tight.  It was a bit tangled when it arrived but we sorted it out easy enough.  It is a good length (not really a choker length but more of a upper chest type length).  The star points can sometimes poke or catch so if your real sensitive to this you might not find it as easy to wear for long periods.  Color is silver and doesnt look cheap or plasticy.  No funny skin discoloration or adverse reactions.  My wife said do not wear it while working out as it seems to twist and poke a lot more with more intense activity.,5316,479
5.0,1559483463474,Good quality socks,These are a real good quality sock.  The pattern is woven right into the sock and is very cute.  My granddaughter saw these and BEGGED me to let her try them out.  They were a little big on her (12 yrs old) but she wore them around the  house all day and refuses to take them off.  Guess she is keeping them.  I did try them on and they fit comfortably and were surprisingly supportive.  She says they did not fall down or twist funny and she says there are no weird seams or bunches inside the sock.  This are a winner,5316,11145
5.0,1554585853316,Nice goggle and case,I got this in exchange for my honest review.  These are really nice swim goggles.  They fit real well and the seals work real well and dont irritate at all.  Strap has a load of adjustments so getting the perfect fit is super easy.  This comes with a few different nose pieces to get a good comfortable fit.  Love the color of the lenses.  There was no fogging issues at all.  Case is also super cool and will keep the goggles from getting all scratched up as they bounce around in the bottom of the swim bag.  Great swim goggles,5316,382

You can also adjust the angle of the visor.<br />Super light weight. Comfortable to use.<br />It does get a little warm inside if you use it very vertical.<br />The only issue for me is that it does distortion a little the view. Just like cheap/ bad sunglasses do.

The Vneck is usefull as you can wear it as a 1 layer.<br />The only thing is that it is short and wide. The mold of these shirts is weird. But as a first layer is not a problem. I would not use it as a regular t shirt.<br />They wash pretty good.<br />Overall is a useful/great  pack for cooler temps.,5777,7076

The other side pockets is for shoes or socks or wet clothes, it has air vents. And the front pocket is big.<br />It comes with a padded shoulder strap, very confortable. Zippers are big and they run very smooth.<br />I am going to use it as a travel bag or pool bag, because it is very big and can hold a lot.<br />The price is good for the size.<br />Highly recommended.",5777,2762

3.0,1582056115061,Pretty but cheap looking...,"This is a cute pair of earrings.  The length is nice and the colored ""stones"" look great paired with the silver toned metal.  The issue I had was tarnishing and construction.  On one of the earrings, the colored bits are off their mark.  They look like they were sloppily glued on.  The other earring is quite tarnished.  It turned my ear lobe black.  I won't be wearing them out and about, unfortunately.",5779,4590
5.0,1579639835433,Really cool bracelet...,"This is a great bracelet.  My husband really likes it, and he has never been one to wear jewelry other than a watch and a wedding band.  He loves the rugged, yet chic, look to this.  It's easy for him to wear and looks great.  Masculine and pulled together, and looks great dressed up a bit or worn casual.  The silver metal and black leather cording is a cool look.  The clasp doesn't pull at his arm hairs or chafe his skin throughout the day. The clasp is well designed and holds together nicely with a combination of a rare earth magnet and a tongue and groove closure.<br />I would definitely recommend this one.",5779,7376
3.0,1579213000696,Interesting design...,"This is an odd, but cool necklace.  The silver charms jingle like small bells whenever you move quickly, so know that ahead of time.  The cord is what's so odd.  It's a cord like one might use for upholstery, with a knot in the back that allows for tightening and loosening the necklace so it can be slipped over your head.  It leaves a fair amount of clunky cording hanging down your upper back, but it also allows the wearer to choose how high they want to where the necklace on their chest.",5779,9357
3.0,1571934259933,Nice but a bit difficult to wear...,"This is a nice set of yoga socks.  They grip really well, almost too well.  They are well made, albeit a bit difficult to wear.  They do run small so keep that in mind.  The bottom grid of silicone gripping pads grip so well that it can be difficult to move your foot from one position to another.  There's no sliding from one leg position to another.  The color saturation is really nice and the overall vibe of the socks are pretty cool.  In the end, they don't fit my size 12 feet and the grip pads are a bit to hard to deal with in my book.  They are bad socks, by any means, they just didn't work out for me.",5779,11898
1.0,1568666911178,"Spellcheck, anyone?","I really wish I could go out in public in this pair of socks.  The colors are rich and bright.  The design is cute and very trendy.  HOWEVER, the manufacturer actually sent out this product without spellchecking it!!!  Who does that?!  Instead of ""I just want to hang with my dog"", they sent it out saying ""I just want to HANY with my dog!""  Too bad because they washed well and fit nicely.",5779,4629
4.0,1568123756205,Good glasses for the price you pay...,"If you're like me, you stick to less expensive sunglasses because you go through them like toilet paper.  I'm constantly losing them, scratching them, sitting on them, etc.  I'm incredibly accident prone and that, unfortunately, means I'm never going to be someone who can keep a $150+ pair of sunglasses in my purse.  These are perfect for me.  They look great (the red/orange lenses are pretty cool) and the quality is great for the low price you pay.  They are constructed well and if slightly bent, which happens to us all at some point, they are easy to get back into shape without weakening the overall frame.  The hinges are tight, which means they don't get loose on you after awhile.  The size of the lenses is really nice for keeping the sun out of your eyes all the way around.  They are going to be a bit loose if you have a smaller than average head.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend you give these a try.",5779,11900
4.0,1567458920100,Nice glasses for the price,"These are great glasses for those of you who are like me and go through glasses like Kleenex, from either loosing them or accidentally messing them up.  The overall construction of the glasses is nicely done and the lenses came in without a scratch.  The glasses themselves seem like they might bend out of shape somewhat easily due to their style.  I would say these would be better on people who have larger heads.  I have an issue with them being a bit loose on me and I don't have a small head.  The price is nice for what you get.",5779,9500
3.0,1566603382628,Decent quality and cool look...,"This is a neat pair of sunglasses.  The green lenses add a great twist to the classic aviator style.  They fit well, although they are easily bent out of their original shape.  The slightest bump and the metal hinges twist out of joint.  The metal itself has a high shine and smooth feel, but it's not quite as strong as I'd prefer, hence, the issue with the glasses losing their shape.  The quality is exactly what you'd expect for the price you pay.  If you're hard on sunglasses like I am, this is a good way to go.",5779,2680
4.0,1565708789830,Beautiful and lightweight!,"These are really pretty!  They are great earrings for a special occasion and will add a glamorous touch to any outfit.  They are surprisingly lightweight and do not pull at my piercings and earlobes as some heavier earrings tend to do.  The gold metal is more champagne than yellow.  Not brassy at all.  The miniature stones grab just the right amount of light to keep things looking classy and not gaudy.  The leaf design is gorgeous and interesting to look at, and the teardrop is flexible and hangs via a hinge on the underside of the leaf.  It gives the earrings a bit of give which makes them comfortable to wear.  The price is a bit high for the quality of the pair but they can definitely be worth it if they're meant for a special event.",5779,4631
3.0,1565013782128,"Nice, middle of the road socks...","These are fairly decent socks.  The low cut design makes them easy to wear and on my Women's size 12 feet, they work well.  They aren't the highest quality so I'm not sure how long they will hold up to regular use.  They wash pretty well although there was shrinking in the dryer, even though I washed and dried them at medium temperatures.  The dark gray is nice and neutral so I'm able to wear them with several types of casual outfits.  I'm interested to see how these work and wear with ankle boots this fall.  I usually have issues with ladies socks being too short or too wide, if they are a larger size, but these Men's socks work really well for me.",5779,933
2.0,1563041735342,Cute but very impractical...,"These are cute, little summer bracelets.  The colors are bright and the charms are nice, although very poorly made and already tarnishing.  The real issues I have with these are that the way the bracelets synch to secure on the wrist leaves at least an inch of the strand hanging off both sides of your arm.  They are also a huge pain to secure by yourself.  The other problem is the dyes used on the strands.  As soon as they get wet, which they will if you are washing your hands like you should, the dyes run and stain your skin.  These are besides the fact that the charms are very poorly made.  Definitely not worth the time, effort, and money.",5779,4646

For me, it's best for lounging around or walking, but not best for doing any type of activity/chore. If I wear it while I'm trying to do pretty much anything but walk or sit, it gets in the way. The front part will get in whatever is in front of me and it's just plain dangerous to wear while cooking. (I like wearing shawls around my house, just for the extra warmth and modesty, depending on what I'm wearing underneath, but I don't tend to wear them in public.) It's on the thicker side, so it's great for cold days. I've been super happy with it.",5794,717

The shorter part isn't a choker. It's not *that* short, but it's closer to my neck. It's a nice casual option for certain necklines. It comes with a gift box, bag, cleaning cloth, and a little card.

With the style of the charm, it might look better on a different type of chain/ribbon/etc. I hated for such a cool piece to go to waste, so I've got it hanging from a dragon sculpture I have on my wall(next to a bookshelf).

He got the chance to try out two different sets. They both have the pink striped tie in them. It's on the sparkly side. The white stripes have silver thread intwined in them, so that adds the glittery look to it. It's definitely one that stands out. One tie has a breast cancer logo on it and the last one is light blue/grey, with dark blue and light grey dot-like squares on it. That one is much more traditional in look.

The sleeves were too short and the elastic was too tight on my forearms. I am 5'6, 34D, 140lbs and ordered a medium. Unfortunately, I sent it back. The colors and fabric were beautiful  though. If you have a wide body and skinny, short arms it would work perfectly!",11279,19395
5.0,1616700818316,Purple shamrock,(Reviewed by my wife): I am delighted with this purple shamrock necklace!  It is so pretty and special.  The purple stones are a beautiful color and have a lot of sparkle.  The pendant is just the right size.  The necklace comes in a teal green gift box and is definitely giftable.,11319,3204
4.0,1610838330745,Bling,(Reviewed by my wife): This is a very bold and interesting looking watch with lots of bling.  It has a rose gold colored band and a rose gold colored watch with roman numerals.  The face is fairly large and is surrounded by sparkly faux diamonds.  The watch band is roomy and adjustable.  The watch comes wrapped around a pillow in a gift box.  It is definitely giftable.,11319,2380
4.0,1609809506755,Cute watch,"(Reviewed by my wife): This is a really cute watch.  I have a lot of watches, but none with a white strap.  This one definitely stands out.  The white looks great with the gold color and the faux diamonds.  The strap is a belt-type strap so it is easy to adjust with no need to remove links.  It keeps time perfectly and is well made.",11319,2394
4.0,1595286412423,Lovely blouse,(Reviewed by my wife): This is a lovely blouse.  There is a metallic shine to the fabric so it is definitely something you could wear to a holiday party.  The fabric is crinkly/crepe-like.  The blouse is loose-fitting and the sizing is generous.  The blouse is very comfortable.,11319,9460
4.0,1585254062061,Looks and feels kind of a toy watch but is a fully functioning watch,"The hard plastic case and wrist band makes this watch look and feel like a toy watch. But in reality, it is fully functioning watch with all the usual features - time (both 12 hour and 24 hour), alarm, count down timer, stop watch and night light among other features. The hard plastic casing actually protects the watch and makes it very durable and tough. Personally, it is not the most pleasingly aesthetic watch but as a watch, it works great.",11319,2433
3.0,1582667269651,Pretty but tends to get twisted,"(Reviewed by my wife): This layered necklace is so pretty.  It is sparkly, delicate and dainty.  I got the ""ferris wheel"" design with the little gold circles with tiny faux diamonds.  The ""ferris wheels"" are beautiful.  The necklace is very versatile - it can be worn with a casual outfit or a dressy outfit.  The necklace comes very nicely packaged, making it nice to give as a gift.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when I wear this necklace I find myself having to constantly adjusting it because the two layers tend to twist and tangle the wrong way.  This is a bit distracting.",11319,3592
3.0,1582494352978,My son didn't like it,"I got this t-shirt for my 13-year-old son who is a gamer.  He did not like the phrase ""I paused my game to be here"" because he plays multi-player games and you cannot simply pause a multi-player game.  The t-shirt also has a really strong chemical smell.  The sizing says it's for ""men"" but this large is definitely a youth large, not a men's large.  Otherwise, it seems to be a fairly well-made shirt at a good price.",11319,13788
4.0,1581803794839,Great looking classic style watch,"This is an elegant looking watch. The gold plated frame and digits contrast really well with the obsidian background and black leather band. The classic style accentuates the watch. As a result, this watch can be worn to formal events. Just my personal preference but a metal band would have been better. Many people probably like the black leather band as is.  The watch has a certain heft to it so you definitely know you are wearing a watch.",11319,2452
5.0,1580070280220,Flattering A-line shape,"(Reviewed by my wife): I love the cut of this shirt.  It has an A-line shape and drapes/swings nicely.  It is very feminine and flattering.  The fabric is soft and stretchy.  I got the navy blue and love the color.  The neckline is comfortable.<br /><br />I am 5'5"", 152 lbs and typically wear a size medium in tops.  This size medium fits great.",11319,6952
2.0,1580069996651,Beautiful but posts are too thick,"(Reviewed by my wife): Like another reviewer on here, I found the posts way too thick to get into my ear holes.  In addition to being thicker than normal, the posts also have a little hook on them so when I was trying to put them in my ear the little hook was catching inside my ear hole and made it painful.  So unfortunately these earrings are totally unwearable for me.<br /><br />If you have wider ear holes that can accommodate the thick posts I say go for it.  The earrings are extremely beautiful.  They will not fool anyone into thinking they are ""real"" but the green crystal and the faux diamonds are pretty stunning.",11319,3235
2.0,1579649275779,Too tight!,"(Reviewed by my wife): These socks are weirdly tight across the ankle area, and just small overall in general.  I wear a size 7.5-8 in shoes and have never had a pair of women's socks fit this oddly tight.  I tried on multiple pairs in the pack and they are all too tight, so it wasn't just a fluke on the first pair.  I'm sure they would get even tighter after washing.<br /><br />The socks are somewhere between thin and medium thickness; definitely not a thick sock as you would expect of a winter sock.  I do like the colorful patterns on the socks.",11319,9554
2.0,1579374556070,Unwearable because of thick posts,"(Reviewed by my wife): Unfortunately the posts on these earrings are way too thick for me to even get in my earring holes, rendering them totally unwearable for me.  Otherwise, I find these earrings absolutely beautiful.  The multi-colored stones against the rose gold background is lovely.",11319,2118
5.0,1579374308155,Stunning!,"(Reviewed by my wife): I am delighted with this pair of earrings.  They are stunning, delicate and feminine.  I love the multi-colored flowers along with the faux diamond strip.  They are very sparkly and look great against the rose gold.  The posts are comfortable and the earrings are not too heavy or large.  Because they are multi-colored the earrings will go with just about any outfit.  They are also versatile in that they can be worn with either casual or dressy wear.<br /><br />The earrings come in a cute pink box with a ""Handmade with love"" tag.  Definitely giftable.",11319,11084
3.0,1579214117832,Pretty but a bit heavy,"(Reviewed by my wife):  These earrings are larger than expected and a bit heavy.  The design is beautiful - very intricate and lovely.  The pattern is very swirly and delicate, with a little daisy flower in the middle.  The packaging is also very nice - a cute little plastic tub that snaps shut, inside of a little drawstring pouch.  But I would not wear these earrings for longer than a few hours because of the weight.",11319,4602
5.0,1576967126814,Beautiful,"(Reviewed by my wife): This is such a beautiful and elegant necklace.  The design is intricate and swirly.  It is made of sterling silver and is offered at a great price ($19.99 at the time of this review).<br /><br />I love the description of this necklace being a story of family love: ""We fell in love at first sight, then we have our children of love. So our love family tree begins to grow up, we love each other and happy life never stopped. This 'Family Tree' necklace represents our families and ourselves. ❤ Like branches on a tree we all grow in different directions, but our roots keep us together as one.""<br /><br />The necklace comes in a box with a shining cloth.  The chain and pendant are in separate baggies in the box, so if you are giving this as a gift I suggest assembling the necklace and displaying it using the black velvety wedge in the box.",11319,2512
2.0,1576297599233,So disappointing,"(Reviewed by my wife): Pink is my favorite color so I was really excited to get this pink bomber jacket.  The way it was packaged was kind of fun - it was vacuum-wrapped.  I got to cut the package open and see the jacket puff back into shape.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the jacket was so disappointing.  The fabric reminds me of carpeting.  The jacket itself is shapeless and the length is slightly too long and awkward-looking.",11319,99
5.0,1576293299055,13-year-old loves it,"I got this hat for my 13-year-old son.  He absolutely loves it.  It is warm, comfortable, and well-made.  It also looks good.",11319,12034
4.0,1575583359964,Very minimalist- just a chain,"(Reviewed by my wife): This is literally just a chain - perfect for a very minimalist look.  The chain is delicate-looking yet sturdy.  There are several different holes that the clasp can be affixed to, depending on your neck size and the length you are looking for.  Very nice for an understated look.<br /><br />I would not recommend giving this as a gift unless the recipient is wanting just a chain.  I forgot that I had ordered just a chain so when I opened the box I was puzzled at first and thought that them necklace was missing a charm.",11319,19549
4.0,1572472916777,Kind of thin for athletics socks,"As far as athletic socks go, these are on the thin side. I usually prefer my work out socks to be on the thicker side to absorb the sweat and also provide a layer of cushion to my sneakers. These socks are thin so you can definitely feel the your sneakers. Only recommended if you like thinner socks otherwise I would stay away.",11319,19552
4.0,1570137235268,Great for draping over a sleeveless dress,"(Reviewed by my wife): This is a very soft and large pashima/shawl.  It is perfect for those times when you have a nice sleeveless dress but cannot seem to find a sweater or jacket that looks suitable over it when it gets cold.  It is perfect for draping over a sleeveless dress.  It is large without being bulky.  It is warm and soft, and not itchy at all.",11319,7077
4.0,1566066213929,Nice sunglasses for the price,"Same price you would pay for sunglasses in the drug store, but better quality.  Lenses and frame are sturdy.  Great peripheral vision coverage.  Unless you have a very petite face these should not appear too big.  The sunglasses come with a carrying case and a cleaning cloth.  I accidentally dropped the sunglasses face down on the concrete and was surprised to find that there were no scratches.  Overall a very good value for the price.",11319,474
4.0,1565715048242,"These earrings have ""wow"" factor","My wife reviewed this item: These earrings are definitely eye-catching - they are large, dazzling, and have ""wow"" factor.  They are perfect to pair up with a plain black cocktail dress to add a little pizzazz.  We could not capture in a photograph just how sparkly these earrings are - they catch the light as you walk across the room.  Deducted a point from the rating because they are a little heavy (I would not wear longer than an evening at a party) and make a slight clinking noise near my ear.",11319,4631
1.0,1567210812309,Product Description is Very Misleading,"If I could give this negative stars I would. Talk about a huge letdown!! I've been excitedly waiting for this to come. It came in a medium size mail envelope with something light blue in a little plastic bag, pretty much not even folded. I pulled it out and instantly uttered ""What in the world?!!"". This is not a trench coat, it's not a coat, it's nothing I would want to be caught out in public in. It looks like a flimsy bathrobe and not a pretty one either. I can't recommend it.",13199,21830
1.0,1565394600835,SKYWAY Disappoints With These Sunglasses,"This is the first pair of sunglasses by SKYWAY I have reviewed that leaves me disappointed. There really isn't anything good to say. Yes, they are lightweight but that's because they are flimsy. The way the sunglasses are made you really get no shade from the sun. The lens/frames have a straight feel. You can see it in my photos. There is no bend in the frames so you get full on sun. Also the nose pads go right up to the tear ducts. They say you can adjust them but they feel way to fragile. In other words, if I saw these in a store, I would definitely not buy them. I am crazy about SKYWAY sunglasses but in this case I'd be crazy to recommend anyone to buy them.",13199,248
5.0,1565135277581,SKYWAY Knows How to Combine Fashion and Necessity 💜,"These glasses by SKYWAY are a first for me. I've never seen sunglasses with a bifocal for reading, except from an eye doctor. I've needed to go get my eyes checked for 2 or 3 years now and I keep putting it off. My current prescription is .5 these sunglasses are 2.5. These glasses are amazing!! I can see perfectly to read wearing them. The icing on the cake is they are sunglasses also. A very nice shade of purple that gradually fades as they go down lower on the lens. I'm not sure why they are called ""grey"" in the sellers description because they aren't. These are currently my favorite glasses, hands down. They are lightweight, durable and a great style. Included with these reading glasses/sunglasses is a hardshell glasses case and a glasses cleaning cloth. Another awesome point about these glasses is the price, I've seen other reading glasses, sans the sunglasses, and they have ran at least 2 or 3 times the price of these glassesby SKYWAY. They are a great value and are very fashionable. 5+++ stars for these great glasses. Thank you, SKYWAY!!",13199,9500
5.0,1564627186444,The Sunglasses by SKYWAY Rock!,These sunglasses by SKYWAY rock!! Very lightweight but durable. The style is just right! I love the shape of the lenses. They cover the eyes completely. I have no need to squint or shade my eyes when wearing these. The nose pads fit comfortably and the sunglasses do not slip down on my nose. They come with a nice case so your sunglasses stay in good shape. I would expect to pay more for these sunglasses than what they cost. Great for both men and women. 5 stars hands down!,13199,179
5.0,1564465547412,Be Active and Comfortable at the Same Time,"Forcool makes great socks for active people. Somehow they are able to put special wicking in their socks that pulls moisture away from your feet so they stay dry. These active wear hiking socks even offer cushioned arched support. They would be great for hiking as the title description states. Forcool has created these colorful crew socks to wear all year round. I think they are cute and regardless the title stating these socks are for men, they are for women too. They are very soft to the touch and feel great on the feet. Also they are easily washed and dried and ready to go again. These are made extremely nice. Forcool socks are always worth the price you pay. One of my favorite brands.",13199,6327
5.0,1564439361212,Love Me Love You ❤️,"This is a really cute, youthful set by Orchid Row. It's made well and meant to last more than one winter. The block letters really add color to the set. Scarf is not overly long and the cap fits just right. It's very soft. This ""Love Me"" set would make a wonderful gift or one to keep for yourself. Once again, this set is not made for women only, men can wear them too. This set is unisex. This knitted winter pair is easy to wash and all you have to do is hang dry or even lay a towel under in and flat dry. The flat dry is the easiest way for knitted and crocheted items to keep there shape. This is not an expensive hat and cap pair. The price is just right.",13199,21831

They're so soft to the touch. The designs will go with a ton of different styles of clothes. The colors are on the bright side, not too bright, just right. They're easy to maintain, just follow the instructions. I always love 360's tie presentation. It's always classy. It is the best descriptive word I can think of to describe 360.

5.0,1594244230854,Gorgeous and classy,"This 3-piece silvery bracelet set is so classy, it'll add elegance to any outfit for the perfect night on the town! Each bracelet is a thin piece of metal with a slight opening to fit your wrist through. I have very small hands and wrists, and it's a bit of a tight fit for me to squeeze into. I can tell that if you stretch the metal out a bit, it'll make a bigger opening, but I didn't want to do that because I didn't want to put stress on the bracelet.<br />Once on, they're lightweight and shiny. The one with the little balls on each end is my favorite, but the one with the leaves is also very cute.",13454,22200

Lucky for me, because I was planning on ordering a second one for me and my best friend. I split the first one apart for me and my mom.<br />These are a great size, with the little hearts inside the big heart clearly visible, as well as the two little sparklies. It's a nice, sturdy chain, nonadjustable, that reaches right to the middle of the chest. I like the length because it's a necklace you wear close to your heart! It's a great gift for friends, relationships, or relatives. The ""I love you"" engraved in each half of the necklace is small, but still visible. Very cute, and a sweet token of affection. Lifelike and looks just like the product photos!",13454,11137

Queen Latifah makes her grand re-entrance in a beautiful gown and matching pashmina, drawing every eye of the restaurant to her, and then the maître D asks, ""May I take your pashima?"" It's so elegant, and now I have one, too!<br />This cashmere pashima (think extremely long, thick, rectangular scarf) is very elegant yet still casual and fun. It'll fit in with skinny jeans and demi boots, or a sweaterdress and a French twist updo. Not only does it look fantastic, with edges of fun fringe, but it's extremely warm and soft. Plus, since I'm rather small, it's large enough for me to use as a blanket (but I'll treat it with more respect, I promise). I love my new pashmina, and the quality of the cashmere is excellent.",13454,7377
5.0,1565416035177,Love these funky glasses!,"After I went to see ""Rocketman"" in the theaters, I was on the lookout for some funky sunglasses to wear this summer. These are exactly what I wanted: aviator-style, bright colored, and large for my small face. I've always been partial to 'rose colored glasses' but for those who aren't used to seeing a pink world, the bottom half gives you a golden color when you look down.<br />My only warning on these is the very thin gold frame. The case these come in is very pretty, but I won't be using it. I have a feeling opening and closing them will be hard on the little hinges. These are too pretty, and I wouldn't want them to break. I've always been in the habit of storing my sunglasses open, so I can grab and go, so this won't be a hardship for me.",13454,248
3.0,1627661866199,Looks Like the Picture But Too Narrow in Front,"These memory foam house slippers are cute but are a little narrow at the front.  I ordered my usual size 7, and it seems to be too crowded for my toes at the front area when I walk.  The widest width at the front is 3.5 inches.  For me, I could not wear socks while wearing these slippers.  The available length for the foot is 9 inches.  I say “available”, because there is a 1/2 inch raised lip around the heel.  As far as comfort, it is soft when I walk on it, but the narrow front offsets that comfort.  I didn’t really get any arch support that is being stated in the description.  The tread is not substantial.  I wouldn’t walk on a wet surface with these slippers.  The upper is made of 100% polyester.  I didn’t feel sweaty wearing them, though.  In summary, I would order one size up, especially if you like wearing socks in the winter with slippers.  I gave these 3 stars, because of the narrow front and the lack of good bottom tread.",14036,7388
2.0,1626537006959,Not Really a Mid-Rise as Described,"The manufacturer needs to go back to their drawing board.  The supposed cargo shorts I received is not the same as described nor as pictured.  It states “one-zip closure pocket”.  There are no zippers on these shorts.  There are also no cuffs like the picture.  It states it can be worn as mid-rise (below the true waist), but if I do that, the crotch seam is way below where it’s supposed to be.  The back pockets are fake flaps.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because the material is good quality.  Otherwise, I would not recommend purchasing this until it’s redesigned.",14036,7121
4.0,1602354263560,Material is Too Thin,"I really like this top, but I won’t be able to wear it to work as it’s a little see-through.  I received a size Large, which fits me quite well.  I am usually a Medium in tops.  These must run small.  I am 5’3” 120 lbs and 34 B.  The chest on this top is 36 inches around.  The shoulders width is 15 inches.  The hem falls to mid-thigh for me.  The material is very comfortable and stretchy.  The stars are PRINTED on the fabric.  Each star is about 2 inches.  It’s almost like they were screen-printed on after the shirt was made.  It is machine washable cold.  I gave it one fewer star for the thinness of the material.  I will probably wear it as a layering shirt under a jacket.",14036,8072
5.0,1587748179234,Packing Cubes With Convenient Handles,"There’s a lot to like about these packing cubes.  There are 2 bags included in each order.  These are soft sided, which allows for easier packability.  The larger cube is 13” X 12”, and the smaller cube is 13” X 9”.  The cube is expandable via the zipper on the side.  It expands to a maximum of 3.5 inches for the larger one and 3 inches for the smaller one.  I was able to fit 2 large sweaters or 3 ladies’ slacks/jeans in the larger one.  For the smaller one, I was able to fit 3 ladies’ tops or one sweater.  I like that it organizes my clothes in my suitcase.  There is a white mesh on the front.  It’s not see-through.  This is great, because I can also use this for after swimming to put in our wet swimsuits.<br /><br />The material is durable, and fairly thick. There was no smell.  I machine washed them in cold and hung to dry without any issues.  There is a single handle on one end.  The handle is long enough that I can sling it over my shoulder.  These bags can also be used for carrying stuff while shopping on your travels.  I was able to fold it up to a 5 inch square and store it in a backpack.  I found these packing cubes very useful and durable.  I would recommend them.",14036,2627

I’m not sure how long I am supposed to wear it to get any effect.  So far, the efficacy has been 0%.  The bracelet is copper (I checked underneath the leather wrapping the bracelet).  Actually, I am not sure if the leather is real or not.  There are two round magnets at the ends of the bracelet.  The bracelet looks very nice and is adjustable by bending the bracelet.  I try to make sure the magnet is touching my skin.  I guess I’ll just keep wearing it and see what develops.  If anything, it’s a nice looking bracelet.",14036,6833
4.0,1575046433108,Pretty Pendant but Needs Longer Chain,"The necklace is pretty but there were some surprises for me when I received it.  The chain looks shorter than the picture.  I thought the pendant would fall mid chest, but it falls near the level of collarbone.  Nobody can really see it.  The chain that came with it is 17 inches long and doesn’t look very sturdy.  I will need to buy my own longer chain.  Also, the little elephant is indeed adorable, but it’s not a solid piece.  I had to keep flipping it over, so that the hollow side of the elephant doesn’t show.<br /><br />The quartz piece is a good substantial size and very pretty.  The quartz piece is slightly pink and about one inch X 3/4 inches.  It looks real to me, because I can see tiny dark grains in the quartz. The necklace does look great with a blouse or sweater.",14036,2472
3.0,1574537307091,Sizing is Inaccurate,"I received a Size XL, and I thought it was very tight.  I am 5’ 3” tall and 120 pounds.  According to the size chart, an XL would fit 45”-50” hips.  Looking at the tights, one would have to really stretch it.  Consider that the width at the hip is only 18 inches.  I have 35 inch hip, and I had to really squeeze myself into these.  The material does not stretch much; probably meant to be control top?<br /><br />Length is 34.5 inches, and they come down to my ankles.  I am only 5’ 3” tall.  The material is 85% nylon 15% spandex and is actually quite warm.  The tummy area is too tight for me, so I’m giving it 3 stars. For comfort, I would size up.",14036,6316
3.0,1571592096190,Beware- It’s Printed Only on One Side,"One has to look very carefully at the scarf photo to see that only one side of the scarf is printed.  I didn’t look at it carefully, but I learned my lesson.  It’s a nice scarf about 83 inches long at maximum length.  It’s shaped like a long parallelogram (ends are tapered).  The ends are fringed with no hemming.  The color is camel with black and cinnamon colored cross plaid stripes.  It’s warm, but then I don’t live in a very cold place.  It’s made of 100% acrylic and made in Germany.<br /><br />I gave it 2 fewer stars, because when I wear it around my neck, the unprinted side shows.  It takes a little bit of time to arrange it so it doesn’t show.  In my opinion, it’s a little expensive for a scarf printed only on one side.",14036,4271
5.0,1568479981597,Great Addition to an Office Wardrobe,I love that this sweater isn’t heavy or bulky.  The fabric is just right for enough warmth.  I got a Medium and it fits me perfectly.  The shoulders fit and the hem falls at mid-thigh.  I am 5’ 3” and 120 lbs.  It opens in the front with no buttons.  There are 4 gold small buttons on bottom of each sleeve.  Very nice accent.  The slightly elastic band in the back at waistline gives it a fitted look.  This sweater is professional looking and I’m going to wear it at my office and conferences that I’ll be attending.

3.0,1568390985542,Risky Open Space in Purse Design,"I have been racking my brain trying to figure out this purse.  Don’t get me wrong it’s an adorable purse.  There are two sections to this purse.  The front part, I believe, is for your phone.  At least, it fits my phone.  Then there’s a wallet portion in the back which folds up and has a snap.  However, there is a ONE INCH gap when wallet is snapped closed.  There is a great chance your credit cards, bills, ID can fall out.  The coin purse on the back is zippered though.  It comes with a 44 inches non-adjustable strap and a shorter wristlet strap.  Both are detachable.  The tassels in the front are cute.  I think the manufacturer needs to redesign this purse.  For the time being, I think this purse would be good for a young person who carries only a phone.",14036,22925

From heel to toe, the sock is 9 inches long and stretches to 11 inches long.  I’ve been wearing it around the house, because the padding on the sole makes it easier to walk on my hardwood floors.  It doesn’t feel sweaty when I wear them with my hiking boots.  It’s made of 59% polyester, 29% cotton, 11% nylon, and 1% elastane.  I like these socks for its comfort and quality.

4.0,1568980283691,Stylish and Soft.,"This red and black pashmina/shawl/wrap is stylish and soft.<br /><br />It is long and wide, but not bulky. This makes it easy to wear in many ways. (Example: you can use it as you would a scarf, without burying your neck in tons of fabric.)<br /><br />The red with black has a plaid pattern that is sharp-looking and which you can dress up or wear more casually.<br /><br />As most reviewers (including me) have mentioned, it is VERY soft. However, I'm rating it four stars instead of five. Why?  Because: it is not bulky or heavy, but very lightweight. Therefore, it is not extremely warm. I think some folks may want something warmer in a shawl like this, thus the four stars.<br /><br />That said, I think this is a pretty and practical way to add a little soft style to your wardrobe.",23155,1974
4.0,1568730751876,Big but not bulky.,"I received this in the black/gray combo, and I like the two-tone concept. Depending on how your wear/wrap the pashmina, you can show just one color, or you can drape it so both colors show. Again, nice concept.<br /><br />It's a long pashmina, and wide, but fortunately, it is not bulky. That's good, because it means you could wear this as a scarf either tucked into a coat, or wrapped outside the coat.<br /><br />I'm rating it four stars instead of five simply because I think if you want something for real WARMTH, this might not be the item. It is lovely and soft, without being bulky, but that lack of weight cuts down on the warmth factor.",23155,7077
5.0,1534430029205,Vibrant Color in a Three-Season Accessory,"First thing I loved about this scarf was the deep, bright Saffron color. The color is rich-looking, not gaudy. Though it seems to be an ideal Autumn  color, it is easily adaptable to Spring or Summer wear.<br /><br />Next, I loved the weight of the fabric. Light as air, the scarf is 100 polyester and the lace is 100% nylon. The lace is soft, not scratchy, and has little &#34;eyelash fringe&#34; around it, which is a pretty touch.<br /><br />As I said, it looks like it will be perfect in Autumn --around the neck of a sweater, tucked/wrapped near the collar of a jacket-- any number of ways! But it is perfect to wear right now (Summer) as a over-the-shoulders wrap at the beach or in a restaurant, when the AC is too much. In the Spring, I can picture it with a lightweight raincoat around Easter time or St. Pat's Day. (I don't see this as a winter accessory, no matter where you live, because the design/lace/fabric is just too light and airy to mix well with heavy winter clothing. Also, the color(s) don't really say &#34;winter&#34;.)<br /><br />The label says it can be hand-washed. (I'd be VERY careful with washing however, since it IS so lightweight and the lace is delicate.)<br /><br />The price is reasonable for an accessory that is pretty and will give you three season wear.",23155,780

4.0,1570667947613,A very pack-able hat. Effective protection from bugs.,"This is not the kind of hat I wear on constant basis. But, at the right situation (with presence of bugs and mosquitoes), this is the only hat that I would like to wear. The design of this hat is quite interesting, it hides the attached mosquito net in a zipper pocket at the top of the hat. So, the mosquito net is fully concealed when not in use. When I need the net, just unzip the pocket and pull the net out. The net is big enough to cover the whole hat, my face, my neck, till it reaches my shoulder area. No hole for mosquitoes or bugs to sneak in.<br /><br />This hat is a perfect companion when hiking in parks with big trees, like the Big Basin Redwood park in San Francisco south bay area, where mosquitoes are always around as big trees block out plenty of sun light.<br /><br />The brim of the hat is kind of soft and floppy. Though, per my personal preference, I prefer a more stiffer brim to keep the hat shape, I understand the design intend of the soft brim is to make this hat fold-able for easy storage (to pack it into the backpack) when not in use during a trip.<br /><br />The hat is made of light weight nylon material, again, for the purpose of making this hat pack-able. Nevertheless, the light nylon material gives you a cheap-made feeling. Though it survives well after two machine-wash cycles during my ownership, I still suspect the longevity of the hat. I guess this hat is meant to be used on needed basis. In most of time, you can fold the hat and carrying it in the backpack.<br /><br />All in all, this hat meets it's product claim well.

It has a zipper to expand the cube and compress it, making storage so easy! I recommend getting these, especially if you and your spouse have different ""packing styles"" ha!",33456,2627
2.0,1583362776812,Disappointed. Not for D cup!,I was so looking forward to this. I am a D cup and was looking forward to trying these that Ive heard so much about! These were not big enough for me and left really awkward not attractive shape in a shirt! I would say the C-D are really best for a C. I also wore it around the house and it didnt take long and the top portion kept coming loose on one side despite cleaning my skin. Not what I had hoped for,33456,46093

The fabric feels luxurious and the pattern is just the right amount. Even the waist band has some shimmer running through it, but it all works and isn't too much.<br /><br />I am 5'3 and a size L/ 10/12 with an hourglass figure. I was so disappointed that way it flairs off the waistband added extra bulk to where I didn't want it. This may look fantastic on a slim frame, but I don't find it flattering for my figure :( Bummed!",33456,9475
5.0,1600103701126,I use these as ponytail holders.,"There was a time when I worked and wore one of these on my wrist constantly. Those days are over, but I've discovered that these can be used as wonderful ponytail holders! Remove the split ring, of course, and save it for your keychain. I like that these are thicker than the thinner ones usually sold for hair. They don't tangle as easily and don't pull my hair. No worries if they get a little stretched out during the day - they spring back to their original shape by the next morning. I LOVE the subtle colors - they just about match everything in my wardrobe. This was a delightful find!",33460,6433

I can overlook the silver plating, but the CZs were exceptionally small and lacked any kind of sparkle at all. They just looked cheap and I’ll never wear them.<br /><br />I can only recommend them as “starter earrings” for young girls, IF they are in a situation where no one is going to grab at their hoops.",33460,46123
5.0,1566956128097,Nice fit and non-slip dots stay where they should be.,"We have wooden stairs without a runner. Believe me, after they’re cleaned, those suckers are slippery. Yes, non-slip socks are easy to find, but these are different. They’re not the soft fluffy ones that twist around until the non-slip part is on top, and they’re not cotton that stretches and gets baggy. These are really meant for athletic (yoga) use on slippery surfaces. The dots are well placed - they fall squarely under the ball of your foot and cover the center of your heel. Just where your weight comes down to hold a pose. And the fabric used means the socks stay on your foot where they’re meant to be. I like them, I’ll wear them, and I can recommend them. I even like the color.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I have done my best to give you a detailed and honest opinion.

5.0,1565458914875,Get over those memories of tights from the past.,"I gave bad memories of uncomfortable, ill fitting tights from my childhood. The crotch always seems to find a point between its optimal location and my knees.<br /><br />Well, scratch that, baby, because it’s a new age. What struck me first about these was the softness and stretchability of the fabric. I was amazed! They went on easily, didn’t pull in odd places, and stayed put. Hallelujah, no saggy crotch! The fabric isn’t think and opaque, but isn’t even close to a pair of black nylons. I think it gives just the right amount of coverage and warmth.<br /><br />They are super comfortable and I could wear them all day. I’m absolutely delighted I decided to overlook my bad past experiences, because these are going to look adorable with my favorite boots! Recommended!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.

It reminds me of my hippy days, and that makes me SO happy.<br /><br />Be aware that there may be small imperfections because of the handcrafting, and because of the nature of leather. In fact, embrace them! My bag is uniquely mine!<br /><br />It’s not overly large, but holds a lot. The main part of the bag easily holds my wallet, my phone charger, my earbuds, and the lens kit case I carry for my iPhone photography. Everything else goes into the three deep exterior zippered pockets. There’s a smaller zippered pocket on the inside and a small open pocket for keys or lipstick. The strap is generously long for crossbody wear. You can shorten it, of course, but if you’re a bit fluffy, like me, it’s easy to adjust to fit. I wear a 2X. The buckle was set to the center of the available holes and it was loose on me out of the box.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this bag. I also hope this review was helpful to you.

In fact, I double checked to see they if they’re meant to be worn over regular glasses. They’re not. Because of the size, I think they’re best suited for men, but as others have noted, the sides have a delicate, unmanly design on them.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is how flimsy and cheap they feel. Given that sunglasses can take a beating in the summer, I don’t think these will last long. The soft case really offers protection only against scratches.<br /><br />My husband really dislikes the style so, unless a friend wants them, it looks like they’ll end up in the charity box.",33460,11960

These are funny meme crazy socks but I thought it was because of the colors.<br /><br />There are several differences in the socks I received and what they look like on amazon.<br />1.  The pink color is a very bold pink.  The picture looks like a dull pink.<br />2.  The picture shows a blue area below the top of the sock.  There is a blank blue area on one side of each sock.  BUT  on the other side of the sock, there is a saying and a car in my blue area.  The saying...""I just wanna hany with DOG"" .  A person and a dog are hanging out of the car windows.  And no, I did not misspell the word hang....HANY is spelled out in black on my socks.  Is this correct???<br /><br />These socks are imported from China.  This may be the reason for the misspelling or maybe I am missing some point here.<br />The socks are  80% Cotton, 17% Polyester, 3% Spandex.<br />Apparently these are one size fits most.

Now, this could have been given a small zigzag stitch that would have covered this nicely - I have done this before on fabric that wouldn't take turning well.

5.0,1646692794384,Somehow It All Works,"When I first asked my husband to help me review this Men's Mini Focus brand Luxury Skeleton Tonneau Watch, he seemed set on disliking it. He typically doesn't like skeletonized fashion quartz watches that display faux watch parts as design features. He also doesn't like non-sport watches that are too thick to fit under his shirt sleeves. But after trying this watch, my husband was pleasantly surprised by this quartz Mini Focus watch with a skeleton-look dial that measures around a staggering 16mm in case height. Somehow, it all works. This watch with the chunky tonneau case just looks amazing on his wrist.<br /><br />We received the Black color option (also comes in Red, Gold Black, Gold Blue, and Silver Blue) which has a matte black barrel-shaped case and sturdy silicone watch band with an ""MF"" signed buckle. The black buckle is glossy rather than matching the matte case finish, but my husband didn't really mind. He said that with this watch, the buckle would be the last thing he's looking at. The case and dial are the stars of this show.<br /><br />The watch is a basic three hand design (hour, minute, second), but includes a date calendar window at about the 4:30 position. Part of the date wheel is also exposed at the 9 o'clock position, yet the whole dial still looks balanced, helped in no small measure by the two curved lines running the length of the dial that look like the inverse of the Tonneau shaped case. They really draw the eye and hold the entire design together. Additionally, the curved lines, hour markers, and hands are all lumed with glow-in-the-dark luminescent coatings that give the watch a striking appearance in low light.

They come in a handy 9-pack with varying lengths, including 3 pairs of crew socks, 3 pairs of ankle length no show socks, and 3 pairs of no-slip low cut socks. That's enough socks for over a week. The material is soft and fairly lightweight. The only issue I found was that they are cut a bit smaller than my usual socks. While a snug fit, they do not constrict or bind. I've only been washing them in cold water and drying in low heat to avoid any further shrinkage.",39330,52725
5.0,1604459677883,"Attractive, Affordable, And Several Extras","I asked my husband to try out this ONTHEEDGE Minimalist Men's Watch. He first stared at the name on the dial for a while before realizing that the name was actually ""ON THE EDGE."" He immediately liked the clean styling of the watch dial. There are even number hour markers, a date calendar window, and a chapter ring that goes around the outer edge of the dial, but the dial still seems very well balanced and uncluttered. He said that the center sweeping second hand does not land squarely on each second marker as it ticks around the dial, but noted that it's rare to find that on quartz watches that are many times more expensive than this watch. The watch sets easily and keeps time well. The black mesh bracelet looks perfect against the black polished watch case. On my husband's wrist, the watch looks very handsome. This ONTHEEDGE watch is truly attractive and very affordable. What makes it worthy of 5 stars is that it also has several extras that make it truly special. It comes with a small flat head screwdriver for adjusting the watch bracelet clasp. It also comes with extra replacement batteries and a small microfiber cleaning cloth. The real surprise for my husband was that the watch actually has glow-in-the-dark luminescent paint on the hands and the hour markers. That's very impressive for a watch at this price point. All in all, my husband is very happy with this watch.",39330,34368
4.0,1564370274781,"Accurate, Comfortable Watch For BMW Enthusiasts","This BMW M Motorsport Stainless Steel Quartz Watch is a BMW motorsport inspired analog wristwatch. And by “inspired,” I mean that it’s an officially licensed BMW logo motorsport quartz watch with the three stripe M logo on the dial, the watch band, and the strap buckle. The setting crown is also signed with the BMW logo. The watch has three hands (hour, minute, and second) and a small calendar date window at the 6 o’clock position. The face of the watch is interesting to look at, and definitely has a motorsport aesthetic. The dial resembles a car dashboard gauge and the bezel looks like a car tire. The hour marker numbers are black and offset nicely against the silver color dial. While I found the time legible and easy to read, the calendar date is a bit small and less so. The polished stainless steel case is approximately 42mm across, 47mm lug tip to lug tip, and is about 11mm thick.<br /><br />In terms of wearability, my husband wore this over the last week on his 6.75 inch wrist and found it very comfortable. He said the 2-piece silicone watch band is sturdy, works well, and feels good on the wrist. He also found the sporty look of the watch very appealing. He said that the watch is easy to set via the crown. He also tested the accuracy of this watch against our radio-controlled clock and found that down to the second, it lost no time at all during the course of the week.<br /><br />My husband said that overall, this is a good-looking and accurate everyday sport watch. The only issue he had was that this is a BMW motorsport watch and he doesn’t drive a BMW. Unlike other motor/auto-inspired watches he owns that are not brand specific, this one is branded for BMW motorsport. If you don’t own a BMW or you’re not a BMW enthusiast, it seems a bit too much to be wearing the watch bearing so many of the company’s logos. For the BMW Motorsport fan, however, this is an attractive, well-working, and comfortable BMW watch.",39330,4588

My son raved about how cushioned and comfortable these feel. The Big Kid Size 7 fits him just as it should, too. The sneakers seem robust and sturdily made, but are also lightweight. My son wears these 5 days a week for PE and they’ve held up great. He mentioned that his feet don’t seem to sweat as much in these as with his older sneakers.

It appears that the most common culprit for this warning in clothing is thanks to the dyes used. Seriously WTF? Manufactures can't choose non toxic dyes!?! So what about when this is washed? What does that do to the environment? Or how about, making it clear on the product page that this article of clothing has this warning label so folks can decide if they want to buy it or not? Ordering it & not knowing, wearing it, then seeing that tag is just wrong. I know some people thing the P65 warning is nonsense. I've learned enough over the years, that it concerns me.

I was concerned this might bother my feet, esp. in the heat, but it hasn't been an issue.  These socks arrive with one pair of socks stretched on a foot/shoe shaped bit of cardboard.  When you take them off they shrink down to this crumpled little mess that looks like it would only fit on a newborns foot.  It's kind of surprising & pretty funny.  I guess that's why they ship them on the cardboard.  It makes for a much nicer presentation.<br />My only concern is that while I'm happy with them now, is that they might stretch out quickly.  Time will tell.  If you are wondering, they like practically everything on amazon (unless you shop amazon handmade) are made in China.  The fabric is 80% cotton, 15% acrylic (spelled wrong on my pkg. of socks), 5% spandex.",42229,3057
4.0,1456535203000,Reduces Muscle Spasms,"These socks fit excellent on the calves (they end just below the knee).  They do not shift or fall while wearing.  They are nice in the winter, adding extra warmth & help reduce muscle spasms thanks to the compression.  There are a few things I don't like though.  I wear a size 7 sneaker.  The foot part of the sock is a tad too big, so they don't provide any support to my feet, my main desire on the foot is arch support/compression which I see is in the sock, but simply isn't small/tight enough for my feet.  There is cushioning added to the top of the foot/ankle area but the back of the heel needs something more.  I'm not blistering, but it isn't as comfortable as other running socks.  The seam in the toes rubbed on my left foot which became uncomfortable over time.  I have a problem with my left foot & the seam in nearly every pair of socks, so the issue might be the shape of my foot rather than the fault of the sock so I'm not knocking down the rating for it.  Overall I do like the socks.  They are a bit of a struggle to get on & off but the extra support & warmth is worth it.  I just wish they fit my foot as well as they fit my calf.",42229,3598

3.0,1596513108194,"Good Construction, Poor Quality Visor","This Bellivera sun hat is nicely constructed. They used quality materials and the stitching is great. The band is comfortable and the tilting hardware, though a little stiff at first, clicks into position as it should. Unfortunately, I don’t like the visor itself. Once you remove both sides of the cling wrap you’ll see that the visor slightly distorts your vision. It’s not bad, but it’s noticeable. The visor also reflects back what you are wearing so you’ll have random colors flashing in front of you. As someone who is sensitive to the sun, the uv protection on this is minimal and I definitely felt the sunlight glaring down on my face.",46334,11875
3.0,1585960328840,The Mesh Is Nice,"The main material on these packing cubes looks thin and of questionable quality. The front mesh however, does appear to be a nice thick quality fabric. Too bad the entire bag isn’t made of that mesh. The zippers are lightweight and easy to open. The interior seams are covered with the material they make reusable grocery bags out of and they are not sewn on too well. Overall, I’m not impressed but they are okay.",46334,2627
5.0,1579316297657,Definitely Waterproof,"As far as waterproof bibs go, I like it. It snaps around your neck and also has snaps that allow you to fold up the bottom like a catch all for dropped food. It is absolutely water proof. I poured some water on it and the large bead of water just rolled around without being absorbed or dampening the material in anyway. It’s long enough that you can place the end section on top of the table with lots of room to use it as both a bib and a tablemat at the same time.",46334,60743
4.0,1575852925356,Jingle All The Way,They make a very satisfying low pitch jingle noise when they touch. The fall back to a perfect angle when your arm is flat on a surface so they don’t interfere when you are typing. The colors compliment each other and look good with my skin tone.

4.0,1572382865802,A Manageable Size,"The earrings are not as enormous as they look in the advert. They are a manageable size for a day or evening out. I would not try to wear them during a 8 hour work day. They are not super heavy, but weighty enough that after 3 hours you will be feeling them. They look a little 60’s mod which is cool with me.  Yes, the pearls look fake but who would expect them to be real? They come in a velvety box which is nice. Also included was a gift elastic hair tie and the option of rubber or metal earring backs. There is also a wet wipe which you will need because the little box sheds a lot of fibers.",46334,19388

I got these shoes for my daughter because she has trouble putting shoes on and really liked the double zipper aspect of this shoe (Wedges). What I did not realize or properly read was that is was a wedge.  The last image I posted shows the top of the wedge, which I feel is too high for a little girl. The wedge is also narrow and not good for wider feet. My daughter has slim feet and it was narrow for her. If your child is stylish and ok with tall wedges then it will for.

They are super easy to put on or take off because I can just slide my foot in or out of them. There is definitely some type of foam in them because of the amount of cush that I feel when wearing them. The bottom of the sole has a bit of traction so they aren’t slippery. The sole is also quite flexible.<br /><br />I found the sizing to be perfect for me. I normally wear a size 8.5 and I ordered a 9. They are just a bit sloppy but no more than expected for this type and size of slipper.,47624,3719

As far as the butt lifting feature, that part is certainly not happening but then I didn’t really expect it to. The tummy control part is a bit effective and works like most tummy control clothing, it is a bit tight around the belly.

They have a sole with traction to prevent slipping and a bit of foam in the foot bed but not much else for support. That makes them a cute shoe for an event but not to wear all day.<br /><br />I love that the they have a Velcro closure on the ankle rather than a buckle that is tedious to fasten.

4.0,1607990661756,Lots of versatility,"The description states that the belt will fit from size 28 to 44. I have no doubt on the 28 but the 44 might be a bit snug. At a size 42, I found the belt to fit perfect but think it would be close to it’s limit at 44.<br /><br />The belt is very comfortable once in place. The closure or buckle is easy to fasten and the belt doesn’t creep open like some of this style do.<br /><br />The only down side I have found is putting it through loops. One side of the buckle is just a bit too large to fit easily through the loops. If I don’t remember to thread it all the way around on the smaller side, I have to struggle though half of the belt loops with the larger end.<br /><br />Overall, a really nice belt that is more comfortable to wear than the traditional leather belt.",47624,2943

I received a 3-pack in a nice color assortment of pink, purple and khaki. These look good on with a decorative stripe that crosses the top and surrounds the heel, and the nonslip bottoms are particularly grippy with better than usual coverage with silicone features. These have diamonds and the Giotto name underfoot and an attractive tulip in nonslip silicone under on each heel. The breathable stretch cotton blend is absorbent and comfortable.<br /><br />The stated size range is a woman’s shoe size 5.5-9. I wear a shoe size 10 to 10.5, so I fall outside the range. Still, the foot gives me enough room and these are a comfortable fit. These appear to be more low cut on me and come up just under the ankle, likely because my feet are bigger than the stated range. But the fit is secure and the back at the heel doesn’t slip down. The quality is good with minimal stray threads and nicely finished edges and seams. I’ve machine washed and dried my socks a few times so far, and they still look like new. These are good nonslip socks. Recommended. 4.5 stars.",49545,7394

These are cozy socks without being too heavy and bulky, and I like wearing them for the cool mornings and evenings we’ve been having in So Cal. They feel soft enough (though I have softer socks), the color assortment is good and the socks look reasonably well made with few stray threads. The patterns are basic and kind of masculine and could easily be worn by men. These are a crew sock height on me.<br /><br />The A9 socks run really big. The stated range is a women’s shoe size 5-9.  I wear a women’s 10 in open toe shoes and 10.5 or 42 Euro in closed toe shoes, yet these border on being too roomy for me. And while they fit okay at first, these stretch out a lot and also slide down. These seem better sized for women in the 9-12 shoe size range (or for men). These are fairly good socks, but they run big and  stretch out bigger. And the directions say to hand wash when these are just basic socks.

But these aren’t total blackout tights like the 100 denier tights I buy from Nordstrom, so some skin color does show through. I wear open toe shows and sandals most of the year, which I can’t wear with regular tights. So I really that I can wear these footless tights with dresses and still wear the shoes I like to wear most. These give me good coverage and some warmth, and these are fashionable while being much more comfortable and less formal than pantyhose.<br /><br />These tights are good quality. They feel smooth and the seams look and feel strong. I wore a pair one day and didn’t get any snags, so these should last for multiple uses (though I’m not sure how many yet). These tights seem true to size. I’m 5’11” and these hit me just a little above the ankles and the top goes all the way up to my natural waist. I’d expect to wear a size XL, and the size XL is indeed a good fit. The waist felt a little tight as I was pulling these up over my currently chunky thighs, but once on these aren’t binding or uncomfortable and offer good control so they’re smooth and slimming under a dress. I really like these footless tights a lot. 5 stars.",49545,6316

It feels like a synthetic blend, but there no tag or indication of what it’s made of and also no care instructions. I received one that’s solid grey on one side and solid black on the other. It has short fringe at the edge. The weather where I live only gets cold enough for a coat for 5 minutes and the  I’m stuck lugging it around. I prefer just wearing a scarf or wrap and gloves that I can just stow in my backpack when that chill is gone. This pashmina works well as I can wear it hanging like a scarf or wrapped around my shoulders so it hangs long in the front but short in the back. This pashmina is flat and isn’t bulky or heavy, but still adds a nice extra layer of warmth. I love black and gray accessories, and the grey/black color combo is practical and compliments a lot of my wardrobe. I like it. 4 stars.",49545,7077
5.0,1561223761020,Too Delicate & Short For Me-But Darling Budget Necklace For Someone Young Or Petite (4.5 Stars),"This costume jewelry gold color necklace is really cute with a faux pearl (bead) in a heart-shaped cage and a small faux pearl (bead) hanging from a 2” chain that drops from the cage. This necklace is delicate and made of lightweight materials. This chain is only 15-1/2” long, though it can lengthen to 17-1/2” with the attached 2” extender. This necklace has nice details for a budget piece, such as a little heart at the end of the extender and a lobster claw clasp instead of a little “O” ring closure.  I’m 5’11” and in my 50’s and would wear this even though the style is young, but it looks too petite and short on me. But I do think it’s a darling budget necklace (currently $16.99) for a preteen, teen or someone petite. On that basis, I’m rating it 4.5 stars.",49545,3594
3.0,1557677712754,"Fabric Is A Thicker Poly That’s Not Airy Or Breathable, Not Something I’d Wear Outside- Just OK","This Orchid Row “chiffon” kimono has a nice floral print on fabric that’s 100% polyester.  I don’t care for the feel of the fabric as it’s so synthetic feeling and not breathable or airy. While chiffon can be made from polyester (or silk), I think of chiffon as sheer and floaty but this polyester feels thick and heavy.  It just hangs on me and lacks any movement. It doesn’t fit like in the photo or have the same sheer, flowy quality that’s pictured IMO.<br /><br />This is a one size fits all garment, and I am tall at 5’11” so this kimono may fit me different than others.  The sleeves barely cover my elbows, and the length just covers my knees. The top looks boxy on me and isn’t particularly flattering, though it doesn’t look bad. This has slits on the sides that go to the top of my thighs. They should give the fabric more movement but they don’t.<br /><br />I’ve tried this kimono on many times over various outfits, such as a tank dress and over a tank with jeans or pants. But I’ve still never worn it. That’s a bad sign for me as I wear things right away if I like how they look and/or feel (unless I get them off season). At most, I could see wearing this at home as I think this looks like pajamas or a robe on me, yet the polyester fabric lacks the softness or comfort I want for hanging out at home.

4.0,1546275188552,Well Done For A Faux Fur Scarf & Is Soft & Warm- Short Slip Through Style & Spot Or Dry Clean Only,"While this brown faux fur scarf isn’t exactly my style, it’s a well made piece that does look a lot like real fur. It feels really bushy and soft and adds a lot of warmth. I’m not a fashion expert, but I think it looks best under a coat that comes up over the edges as it’s thick and doesn’t hang much (it’s short) and reminds me more of a collar than scarf with how it pulls though a slit and stays close to my neck. The stitching all looks quite well done. This is a fun fashion accessory for a retro glamour look and will provide a lot of warmth in cold weather. It’s not something I’d imagine wearing often both stylistically and from a practical view as it can be spot or dry cleaned only. I’m taking a star off just because, as a matter of personal preference, I don’t love the short length and fur style on me. But it’s well done and good quality if someone is looking for a faux fur short style scarf of this type. 4 stars.",49545,6332

4.0,1531584262128,Would be more attractive if longer,This top would be much more attractive if it were a few inches longer. It's about 24&#34; long in the back from neck to hem. I think it looks somewhat boxy on me but I do like the mix of patterns in the fabric. Some of the fabric has a picture of the Eiffel tower. Other pieces of fabric have a lovely floral pattern. It's a very fun piece to wear with a simple t-shirt underneath.,56396,7555
4.0,1574621685886,Nice Compression,"These yoga pants have a nice, firm feel to them, with some compression from the fabric.  I like that rather than them being too stretchy.  They are comfortable and they stay where they are supposed to.  What I don't like so much is the print on the blue part.  I thought it was just a generic blue design and didn't realize how much the letters stood out.  I'd much prefer just a generic blue design.  I don't need people trying to read my legs.<br /><br />I got a medium and it fits well.  I wear either a medium or a large, depending on how the sizing runs, and I think these would fit most people who wear a medium as well as those who are somewhere between a medium and a large.",57152,469

The pair I got . 32 waist, was marked on the garment as 34 length.  The jeans are quite sturdy and seem well-made.  The fabric is heavy.  I like the light color.  Unlike some ""distressed"" jeans, these have patches, ones that look like the iron-on patches you can buy in fabric stores, under each distress hole in the jeans.  I imagine these will make the jeans last longer, and do keep skin from showing through, if that is the look you want, but they also feel a bit rough and heavy compared to the jeans where the patches aren't.  Still, a nice pair of jeans.",57152,491
4.0,1456716298000,"Comfortable Compression, But They Aren't Going to Win Any Fashion Awards","The workout comes when you try to take off these socks!  I don't have too much trouble getting them on, but they are not easy to get off, especially with my rough heels.  I had to wear thigh-high compression stockings in the past for a period of time, and I thought those were easier to get on and off.<br /><br />Assuming you are more adept than I, you probably won't have as much trouble.  These really do make my calves feel good.  I don't run very far, but I do walk and hike a lot, and these socks help.  My legs are not as tired after a long walk.<br /><br />Where I live, these are winter socks unless I am having an unusual issue and really need the extra compression.  They are warm enough that they won't be as comfortable in the hot summers.<br /><br />I was impressed with the upper band.  It didn't roll or pinch or move at all, just stayed where I put it, a bit below my knee.  The seam near the toe is a bit bumpy on the end, as with many socks, and I had to adjust them a little to make them comfortable in my running shoes.  Part of the issue might be that these felt just a little big on me.  I usually wear a size 7 women's shoe, and this size is supposed to go to size 7.5.  I think it would be better if small, medium, large, and extra large sizes were offered rather than small/medium and large/extra large.  I'm sure that would be more expensive, and with regular socks the two sizes wouldn't be a problem.  However, with this design, fit is important, and I think the sizes are just too limited.<br /><br />These do just fine with a regular trip through the washer and dryer.  I don't know if bleach is acceptable but I would avoid it because I'm afraid it could hurt the compression capabilities.<br /><br />Now, you aren't going to wear these under short pants unless you are going to an ugly sock party.  While I do like the way they make my legs feel, I can't say they are pretty.  I think the gray and the bright blue are to emphasize the different areas of compression, but they are a bit on the gaudy side.  Yep, definitely winter socks for me.",57152,3598

5.0,1633635374860,Loose stones and pendants ready for a necklace,This is a nice set. The presentation feels more natural. There is a natural brown crinkle paper as the fluff inside of the box. Loose in the box are the large stones among the paper. Then in a light ivory colored drawstring pouch are the stones with pendant loops. Also in this set there is a pamphlet that tells about each stone. It’s in color and easy to identify/read. The larger stones are polished and smoother. They are shiny and their colors are pure. They are technically irregular shapes and sizes but their finish is smooth. Now the pendants on the other hand are more natural in shape and finish. They are lightweight and a good representation of the gemstone. The metal loop is large enough to string any of the pendants onto a variety of chains. Overall this set would make a lovely gift for any gem lover but the addition of the pendants is my favorite. My set did not come with any chains but luckily I had some so I could wear them right away. I think the price is reasonable considering the set comes with loose stones and the pendants.,64602,13770
4.0,1622620065625,Some give,These sunglasses fit a little bit larger. They can fit a larger head as they have a  bit of room for stretch in the plastic and the hinges. The sunglasses are plastic and a very lightweight plastic at that. They are barely noticeable on the face. The rims are thinner and size and the lens portion does offer as nice coverage for the eyes. The lenses are fairly dark and do a nice job of filtering sun. The sunglasses are of average quality. I do like the black rims as they match most outfits. The sunglasses also come in a soft pouch for storage. Overall is Lott feels average. Given the quality they seem overpriced.,64602,5012
5.0,1618042753764,Just too cool,"This is a really funky ring set. There are neat designs and overall just really creative. Most of the rings are fairly large in size not fit. The longest one is a huge dragon. What’s nice is that each ring is adjustable. They all have a silver color but dark undertones to them which adds depth and interest. The rings are really neat. They’re fairly sturdy and heavy. The collection can be worn together or separately. I think the quality is quite good. My daughter wears them daily and switches out the funky looking rings. She loves the larger rings as they are more of a statement piece.  Each ring truly has it’s own intricate detail. I don’t think the pictures of these rings do them justice. They are edgy, fun and unique. They exceeded my expectations.",64602,955
5.0,1616065823157,Trapper hat for snow princess,"I absolutely adore trapper hats. Especially on kids, I think they are just the most adorable thing. I have seen a lot of male color combinations or more outdoorsy colors, this is the first true female girly pink one I have seen.<br /><br />I have been having a terrible time keeping those beanie caps on my daughters head when we play out in the snow. They seem to inevitably ride up no matter how small or big they are. Her little ears get cold and wet so I wanted to find something that had proper ear coverage. This trapper hat does the trick! Not only are the ears protected but the hat stays down because of the chin strap and Velcro.<br /><br />The inside of the trapper hat is extremely soft. It’s fleece lined in the top and it has faux fur on the ears and around the back of the head that match the same fur on the outside. It adds warmth but it’s not extremely plushy or big. This definitely works better for my child as it doesn’t get in her way.<br /><br />I always think it’s really important to wash hats after each use because of the snow and sweat when playing. I washed mine on delicate but I do hang it to dry so that I don’t risk any change in shape or materials with the fur material.",64602,5646
2.0,1597193911138,Do not stay up,"These yoga pants are extremely soft. I was super excited about putting them on. They feel amazing against my skin. They have two extremely deep pockets that almost go down to my knee. They are a good length and I like the stitching on the side.  I liked that they were not pants length but more pedal pusher length.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fabric is a double edged sword. The soft stretchy fabric which is 80% nylon and 20% spandex does not stay up. They are very low rise. I bought the right size according to my measurements which is a large in this case. The band has no grip. There is no tummy control because the pants band will not stay up. They are completely unusable and unwearable.  I can't walk in them so moving while working out would never be possible.",64602,7073

Got complements wearing them and I like them.<br /><br />Found the quality to be great and holds up well for occasional wear for an outfit or two or just with meeting with friends. Due to the nature of it being a tied string and what not, it may pull apart eventually but its easy enough to tie back and maybe hot glue (assuming one is neat) together or one can probably craftily put some locking pendant attachment to it if they really wanted it to last.",67446,4646
4.0,1631382183198,Fit well!  Cushioned but not like clouds,"I wear a size 7 ladies, purchased a 7 and they fit very well.  These are very comfortable slippers.  The clog style makes them slide on easily and they stay on when I walk.  I thought they might not be warm since the back around the heel is open, but they are nicely warm.  The soles of my feet are very sore; these slippers are pretty cushiony to help that, but not perfect.  The memory foam is thick, but not quite dense enough to totally protect my feet from the hard floor.  But they are really nice, are comfortable, fit well, and so for the $18.95 currently advertised price, I do recommend them.  The soles are a quality rubber and so they are durable.  I took a photo of that for you to see.  The soles are durable enough that you could wear these outside (like to get the mail or something), but I don’t.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.

5.0,1623526522596,Love the soothing lenses!,"These sunglasses are like those filters that you can get for your camera that increase the contrast between the clouds vs the sky so that the clouds look more beautiful and the sky is more blue. They do a very good job of taking the glare off. Driving by a very long bright white sidewalk with lots of reflection, these sunglasses clearly make that more comfortable on the eyes.<br /><br />I’m not a big fan of the square shape of the lenses but that’s not the fault of the glasses. The earpieces have a zebra pattern on them and the word “sunglasses” is printed on them which I am also not a fan of.<br /><br />The best thing about these glasses are the way the lenses make everything look as you see through them. Soothing. A lot of sunglasses actually make me feel nauseous because they have a slight distortion to them. That does not happen with these sunglasses.<br /><br />These sunglasses do not have the nosepieces attached with wires— the plastic rests right on the bridge of your nose. That makes them hotter to wear in the summer weather. I prefer a little space between the glasses and my face for the air to circulate through.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with these glasses—especially the lenses.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be. I hope that my review helped you!",67835,5012
5.0,1614788519756,Good quality!,"These are very nice quality polarized sunglasses and I do recommend them.<br /><br />The come with a thin wooden storage box, a drawstring storage pouch, a cleaning cloth, and a little card that you can use to test that they are polarized.  The earpieces do seem like they are real wood.  I got the sunglasses with black lenses and am very glad that I did—they are a nice level of darkness to block the sun’s glare, and the polarized effect of them is very good to also block the sun’s glare.<br /><br />I have a relatively small face and these fit me well, both in the width across the front of the face and the physical size of the lenses.  They do not slip off my nose or face when I lean forward.  The right earpiece is completely plain(wood), and the left earpiece has the name of the company and the company logo very lightly engraved into the wood at the temple.  It’s not very dark or obvious though.  That may be important to those who either like obvious company brand/logos on their sunglasses, or who prefer plain.<br /><br />At this time, there is no price advertised, so I cannot comment on the value.  However, I am very pleased with these sunglasses, they are good quality, and I like them a lot.  I will definitely be wearing these.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.

4.0,1574127631018,"Lots of positives, but not durable.","What I like:  These are like sweat pants for kids.  The elastic waistband is wide enough to not fold over.  The pockets are great.  The ankles have elastic bands so the pants wont hang too long.  The fabric is 60% cotton, 40% polyester.  They are very comfortable.<br /><br />What I don’t like:  Fussy laundry instructions—these have to be washed in cold water only, and inside out.  The fabric,though soft and comfortable, does not seem very durable at all.  These are like indoor lounging pants.  Rough and tumble boys will probably wear through the knees fairly quickly.  The currently advertised price of $25.99 for two pair seems about right to me.",67835,7351

Looks a bit like antique sterling silver.  The white beads appears to be glued in, but done so attractively.  I estimate the ring size to be about a 9, but it is adjustable with a slit-opening in the ring.  I personally think this makes a better scarf ring than a cocktail ring, so I took a photo for you to see it as a scarf ring.",67835,7052

It works very well as a scarf in winter and also indoors in summer when the air conditioning is too cool. I find it very convenient to take on a cruises. It’s cold when I leave home and then when I travel to warmer weather, it does double duty as a shawl on the ship in the evenings when the A/C is too cold for me. You can tie it a zillion different ways or just wrap it around your shoulders.",67835,2522
5.0,1568597968930,Nice stretchy winter hat.,"This is a typical winter knitted (yarn) beanie cap.  Relatively lightweight.  100% acrylic. It has wide horizontal stripes of dark red and navy blue.

2.0,1567041607749,Cheesy,"I was looking forward to receiving this purse and really wanted to like it. But no. Just no. The front and back of the purse are made mostly of see-through plastic—a material very similar to the large zippered bag that a bed comforter comes in. The see-through plastic is surrounded by a 5/8” border of alligator-patterned black PU leather that looks and feels like plastic or vinyl. The purse has a strap closure with a buckle. When the strap is buckled, the top of the purse is still open and the contents will spill if you dropped the purse. The see-through plastic collects fingerprints easily and quickly took on the look of a smudged mirror.<br /><br />As a grown woman, I just can’t imagine using a purse made this material. The word “cheesy” comes to mind. For those who prefer not to use leather, there are a lot of nice man-made materials generally available that don’t look so plastic like this purse. Perhaps if it was a bright color, a little girl might use it — but it’s probably too large for a little girl. And the style is too mature for a little girl.<br /><br />The purse is 9.5” long, 6.5” high, and 3.75” deep (thick). The sides, bottom and strap are also made of the black PU leather (plastic). The strap is attached with 5 1/4 inches of gold tone metal chain at both ends. The crossbody strap is adjustable in length with a clasp type buckle.<br /><br />It came with a small black toiletry bag that is made of a material like straw, has a black-zippered top closure with a gold zipper pull, and the inside is lined in black fabric. It measures 6.75” wide, 5.5” high, and 1.75” deep (thick).",67835,82023
3.0,1563253783447,Average polyester ties,"The seller advertised two different 2-tie sets so I ordered them both and can now compare. These are good inexpensive ties of average quality. The tag attached to each tie says they are 100% polyester (so know that if you are buying them as a gift).<br /><br />One 2-tie set I received contained two identical ties, but the product description says “Mixed Set 2 Pack; two different styles tie combinations”.<br /><br />The second 2-tie set I ordered contained one striped tie and the second tie was the same as the two identical ones in my first boxed set—so now I have 3 identical ties out of 4!<br /><br />The striped tie is blue, black, white and purple. My husband says this one is his favorite out of booths sets of ties. The other tie in this set, which is the same as the 2 identical ties I received in the first set—so now I have 3 of the same—has little purple, blue and white diamond shapes. A good color and pattern—but not for now 3 identical ties. The product description should clearly say that you’re getting two “grab bag”, mystery, or “you take a chance” ties. And that they could be two of the same tie. You are not getting exactly what is in the product description photo.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product “free” (except for paying income taxes on the value) in order to provide my feedback on this item.

I used them to wash some dishes and for them to work, for me, the gloves would have to fit tighter and offer some sort of grippiness, they are very slippery when wet and soapy.  The insides do have a non slip texture to keep them from sliding off your hands but the outsides lack traction.  They may be good for larger scale washing, like an automobile.

I did find though that it was a little snug in the bust for the size.  This dress can be worn to many occasions such as the beach, to a shower or even into the office.  I wore mine to Church.

After only wearing twice it was already showing a crease where I buckled it, that leads me to think that after wearing for a year it is likely to look pretty worn.

Most importantly you can then easily grip the card you want and get it out without pulling everything out. My very slim card holders are a bit flatter but make it all but impossible to pull a card out.

It was nice to be free, and yet supported. these are a great flesh color, so they don't show under your clothes. light colored tops will show an outline of the pastie, so keep that in mind.

I wear an 8.5 shoe and received the M/L size; there is a slight excess of material at the toe. I am hoping that over time this doesn’t move and create pain under my toes. These did take the moisture away from my foot so I’m not overheated yet my sock doesn’t get damp.,91525,36752
3.0,1574864628496,Very disappointed in the leather,The concept of these bracelets is great. I wear a lot of neutral colors and liked how these all went together without having to shop for them separately. However the two leather bracelets (the ones I was really looking forward to receiving) are so poorly made. The leather is all twisted on the braided one that often the wrong side is facing out. And the double strap one just looks like they used the pieces to death before making them into the bracelet. I’m not sure if I will be able to make these look any better so I can wear those two but will definitely use the two beaded ones.,91525,6833
3.0,1573951133977,Runs wide,I had such high hopes for these shoes when I ordered them. I received a ladies size 9 which is normally ok because I go between an 8.5-9 in dress shoes. These are similar to ones I already owned that were narrow and rubbed the base of my biggest toe (have a small bunion forming).  These shoes however are wide and slide off my foot; to not have this happen I needed to put on a pair of thin dress socks which defeats the look I wanted as these are a dark denim.<br />The other problem I had (and it hopefully was just a flaw in the pair I received) was that the left shoe insole was not glued in correctly. It is off by about a fingertip which doesn’t sound like much but it now rubs on the underside of my big toe. I am going to try to reglue these myself so I can wear these shoes.<br />I think if I would have known these ran wide I would have ordered smaller and been happier. But since it didn’t say that in the description and the fact I have to repair the left insole that is why I brought these down to 3 stars. My experience will hopefully help others as these would make great dressy but casual shoes.,91525,2759
5.0,1571611133449,Lives up to description,Wore these to a college football game where there was limited seating and stood most of the game. They did run a little small; not an excess of sock left on a ladies 8 1/2 foot. The reinforced arch support did keep my foot from getting tired and the weave of the sock prevents your feet from getting overheated. I did like the little extra material at the top of the heel so my shoe didn’t rub and create any blisters. Overall I liked these socks and would definitely buy again.,91525,19552

They are polarized and will help with glare outside in the sun and while driving.<br /><br />My only complaint is these are an little too ""stylish"" and ""trendy"" for my taste. The main reason is both temples have a golden accent. This just isn't my taste but may very well be exactly what someone else is looking for. I will use them in the car to drive or maybe in my kayak, just not for daily wear as they are just not my style.  I like the sporty look, not the ""hip"" in-crowd look.<br /><br />The negative is just a personal preference.

That is not the case with these.<br /><br />These glasses are also super light weight in a bad way. They are just very thin, cheap plastic. The nose pads look like they are barely attached and will break easily.<br /><br />It almost looks like these are better for a little girl's dress up party than something to actually use for any functionality.

There is a band in the middle of the foot that holds the sock in place so it will not slide. In fact, the whole sock conforms to the foot extremely well.

It's thicker than I thought it would be, with a soft fleece material on the inside. This is a good hoodie to wear for a cool summer night or chill fall day. Thought I wear size XS/S tops, I like my hoodies to fit baggy on me, so I got this in a size L. I love the oversized look and feel and it makes it more comfortable. Though this fit me as expected, loose and baggy, it wasn't as long as I would like. Most of my size L hoodies are long enough to right fit below my butt, like a mini dress. But this doesn't go past my lower waist. That's just a personal preference because I wear leggings majority of the time and I like to wear long shirts and hoodies to cover to my upper thighs.

3.0,1588036806484,🙄🙄🤔😏NOT Adequate for Trips of Longer Distance/Duration🙄🤔😏😏🤔,"I'm always surprised that one of my colleagues who seem to be able to pack so lightly, yet he's got everything. Later, when we were checking out of our hotel room, I saw these smaller & different sizes of packing bags which allowed him to be more organized and still able to carry more essentials than just throw everything into the luaggages at random - not always the best use of limited space.<br /><br />Inspired by this and through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across & ordered this 『BAGVIO Travel Compression Packing Cubes』which had the color scheme that I liked & also quite a few positive reviews. Now, I want to see it for myself & share with you guys.🤔🤔🤔 Let's see how it fares🤔🤔🤔🤔<br /><br />🔆✔️NOTE:✔️🔆 Right now, due to short staffing during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Amazon has disabled capabilities to upload photos/videos, so only text reviews are permitted. Here's my review, if you find it helpful, please hit the ✔️ Helpful✔️ button, so it can benefit others as well🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽<br /><br />What I Loved about BAGVIO Packing Cubes<br />🔆🆒❇️🆒❇️🔆🆒❇️🔆🆒❇️🔆🆒❇️🔆🆒<br />💞👍💓 Effective: pack more stuff while taking up less luggage space in much more organized fashion<br />💞👍💓 Cool Color: love cool-looking Teal Blue<br />💓👍💞 Lightweight: doesn't add more weight<br />💞👍💓 Sturdy: strong canvas & water-proof<br />💓👍💞 Expandable: like luggages, there's a 2nd outer zipper which expands for extra room<br />💞👍💓 Anti-wrinkle: if packed tightly, minimal wrinkling<br />💞👍💓 2 Sizes: (L)-14""x9"", (S): 11""x6.5""<br /><br />What Could've Been Helpful<br />🔆🆒❇️🆒🔆🆒❇️🆒🔆🆒<br />🤔🤔🤔 Quantity: most similar packing cubes come at least 4 cubes of various sizes, this one you only get two - inefficient uses of packing cubes😏😒😒<br />🤔🤔🤔 Misleading: ""compression"" packing cubes, materials not stretchable<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />🧤🔆🌀☀️💕<br />This BAGVIO ""compression"" Packing Cubes overall is a decent set of packing cubes which consumers buy for the purpose of, especially those of us who's a little packing challenged, packing more stuff, in less room in a more organized fashion so it's easy to find things at destinations. With only two cubes included, a large & small, it's just too few to properly organized different categories of items. I'd say, as a MINIMUM, a packing cube set must come in at least 4 different sizes to really EFFECTIVELY make a difference in the way we pack - I mean, do I really want to put my personal hygiene products with my socks & underwears (especially worn stinky socks 🙄😏😒). Moreover, despite the product description says ""compression"" cubes, the fabrics is basically loose canvas, unless you pack it to EXTREME tightness, the items inside still will shift around, again, defeating one of the key benefits of using a packing cube. In addition, the canvas material for sure will hold up to wear & tear over time, but the inside stitching may not - would've like to see DOUBLE stitching. Finally, as a value shopper (good stuff bought at a discount - isn't thusvwhy we love Prime Day?😂😅😂😋), the price info is unavailable as of this review, so it's difficult to comment on the value of this but. In other words, if only two cubes but priced say, for the sake of argument, $10, then it's reasonable in value; $15-$25? Not so much.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />➿〰️🆒➿〰️🆒<br />If you only need a couple of packing cubes to help organize your SHORT travel packing, then this might do the job adequately. However, I tend to believe, if you even consider buying a set of packing cubes, you most likely are going on a longer trip & longer durations - needing more stuff in the process, then I'd consider other packing cubes options. This one just didn't do enough for me, unfortunately 🙄😏🤔😁🤔<br /><br />😏😒😒 😮😲Not Recommended🤫🤫🤐🤐🤐",102132,6291

The coolest thing is, not only is it great for general sun blocking capability with it's ultra wide brim around your head,on to of the hat, there's a zippered compartment. Inside, you can find a cylindrical mesh that you can pull out & pull it over your sun gat & this will protect you from all the bugs, insects, and/or sandstorm, etc. The hat itself weighs merely ounces.<br /><br /> PROS<br /> ====<br /> * Cool military style camouflage print design<br /> * Lightweight<br /> * 360° Ultra Wide Sun Blocking Brim<br /> * UPF 50 Sun Protection<br /> * Hidden zippered compartment on top<br /> * Cylindrical Mesh Insect/Bug Protection<br /> * Superior Customer Support<br /><br /> The VERDICT<br /><br /> If you or your loved ones spend a lot of time outdoors in areas where seems to be always shining strong, eg.

5.0,1560970920581,♥️💝💯👍👌Great Minimalist Genuine Leather Wallet❤️💯👌👍💯💕💕,"Nowadays, everything we do or need pretty much can be done via our smartphone, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, etc just to name a few cashless transaction options. This means, for men anyways, the need to carry a full traditional wallet is nearly non-existent or necessary. There are times you may still need to use the credit cards, car rentals, airfares payments, these are the occasions where a minimalist wallet would be ideal.<br /><br /> Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this『Louis Pelle Genuine Leather Slim Wallet』. Unboxing revealed that it's slightly larger than the size of a typical credit card. You can fold it in half, & then it shrinks to half in size & you can easily put in any of your pants or jacket pockets. Being a slim minimalist wallet  to coincide with the prevailing trends, it has enough capacity to carry 3-4 credit cards & money bills. This reduces the bulge men used to have in their back pockets - that was an accident waiting to happen, or pickpockets' dream sights.<br /><br />This wallet is made of soft, yet strong, leather, it's very chic, and made by one of the leading wallet brand Louis Pelle, it's a perfect gift for Father's Day, Christmas, or a special man in your life.<br /><br />The VERDICT:<br /><br />  A well designed, cool, slim minimalist genuine soft leather wallet!<br /><br />  😋💗💞💯💪👍 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED💪💯💢💓💞💕",102132,3034
5.0,1559678374897,♥️💝💯💯 Awesome 360 Boxers are Simply AWESOME❤️💯💯💘💖💗,"When it comes to underwear, most dudes tend to fall in one or two categories: either you are a brief (triangular cut) person, or you are a boxer (square cut) person. I belong to the latter category, as I absolutely cannot stand briefs. One would figure how hard can it be to find a good pair of boxers, Oh No, I'm fully convinced the easier it appears, the more difficult it is. In a simple pair of boxer underwear, I look for these qualities:<br /><br />  1. Style (good looking)<br /><br />  2. Comfort (the lower half making the Crowned Jewel happy😋😅😝😛😂)<br /><br />  3. Plain & Simple (no polka dots, no bananas, etc)<br /><br />  4. Affordable (I don't need designer boxers costing me $20/pair)<br /><br />The VERDICT:<br /><br />  Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I ordered these because they fit all of my selection criteria above. Frankly, I didn't expect much, as most boxers I've come across just didn't live up to one or more of the aforementioned criteria, either not comfortable, doesn't fit as expected, weird (sometimes embarrassing designs)or just too pricy for a simple pair of boxers - it's nearly impossible to find a brand of boxers that live up to all of my expectations.<br /><br />  Note: There's no fly on these boxers, so if you prefer your boxers with fly, these may not be for you. For me, and I'm sure many men out there, this is really not an issue. C'mon, we men are lazy, we try to do as little as possible whenever possible - WHEN was the last time you actually took out your 'baby"" and shove it through the ""fly zone""? That's A LOT of work!!! 😂🤣😂😂If you're like me (& most men), you just whip it out over the elastic waist band and do your things, right? 😁😆😁😆😉😉😉<br /><br />Look no further, pardon my pun, these Awesome 360 Boxers, which come in a pack of 5 pairs in plain gray & black elastic waist band, are simply AWESOME!

It keeps the sock from bunching around the toes.

The fit is good. I waver between a medium and large usually. I went with the large in this and that fit perfectly. It's not too baggy or too tight.

2.0,1590771247427,Very small packing cubes,"I've been using packing cubes for a long time -- it's a great way to organize your luggage.  The problem with this set is how TINY the cubes are.  The larger one is so small that I was only able to get a few t-shirts in it.  The smaller one is best used for toiletries, although I have other toiletry bags that are much better designed.<br /><br />Additionally, these bags are not designed to compress clothing, which is one of the advantages of packing cubes.  They are so formless and flexible that anything you place inside just bulges out (so that the cube ends up looking rounded and ""stuffed"").  This isn't the idea behind compression packing!<br /><br />Overall, I can't see using these tiny bags (they definitely seem more like ""bags"" than ""cubes"").  There are much better options out there.",116685,6291
4.0,1567514752766,Love the bag; not crazy about the strap,"This is definitely a very attractive and well-designed bag.  It's not real leather, though -- it's PU leather (meaning there's a bit of leather coated with polyurethane).  It definitely looks and feels like vinyl.  Still, the color is rich and beautiful, and I love all the zippered pockets and compartments.  There's a sueded outside pocket with two zippered compartments -- a small one (perfect for keys) and a larger one (perfect for my phone).  The bag itself closes at the top with two magnetic buttons, but there's also a zipper (making sure nothing you put in the bag will fall out).  There are additional deep zippered compartments on each side of the bag -- this bag holds a lot!<br /><br />I'm not crazy about the cross-body strap, mainly because it's too long to wear as a regular shoulder bag.  I do own a few cross-body bags, but they are much smaller than this.  I would love to wear this as a regular purse, but the strap (which is adjustable) is too long.  The measurements of the bag differ from the product description -- it is 9 inches high, 11 inches long, and 4.5 inches wide (at the footed bottom).  This is considerably bigger than the measurements provided in the description.  Because of this, it would work much better as a shoulder bag, rather than a cross-body bag.<br /><br />All that said, I do really like this bag.  I will try to use it as a shoulder bag -- I just need to get used to the long strap.",116685,7185

It's not particularly soft, it doesn't feel great on my head (too snug for me -- caps like this should be much fluffier), and the weave is definitely too thin.

4.0,1457445788000,Impressive running socks,"These are impressive socks.  They are soft, but quite thick, with padded toes and heels which make them incredibly comfortable.  The over-the-calf design provides “graduated compression” in the leg, which improves circulation during running.  That means the socks are quite tight on the leg (the product description uses the word “snug;” I think “tight” is more accurate) – these are not the easiest socks to put on!  But once in place, they are comfortable and supportive.<br /><br />The L/XL size fits those wearing men’s shoe sizes 10 ½-12.  My husband wears a size 12, so he’s at the top end of the range.  While they did fit him (the foot, at least, fit him well), he struggled to get them on over his thick calves.  He did like the way they felt once they were on, but he doubted he’d wear them on a regular basis.  I tried them on myself (I wear a women’s 8 ½, so the foot was a bit big on me), and I liked the way the leg felt, but even I had a bit of trouble pulling them up over my calves.<br /><br />Overall, these socks look good and feel good.  If you’re looking for a classy running sock that will provide superior leg compression, these are perfect.  Just be aware that they are very long, very thick, and not easy to put on.",116685,34

You could easily carry these all around with you in a pocket at one time.  They should have included a drawstring pouch so you could easily do just that though.  They are still nice – especially for someone who wants to maybe wire wrap these as pendants or carry around with them in a pocket.  They are finished smoothly and I could almost tell what rocks were what.  The rose quartz just looks like a cloudy regular quartz.  The amethyst I could only tell by the specific amethyst striations – otherwise it may not look like it to others. But rocks are all different so just do not expect to receive exactly what is in the stock photos.  You will also be expecting something larger probably too.

4.0,1620333842212,Unless you want ONLY anklets you may have to cut and shorten some of these,"Hmmm – maybe not the best thing to have these to be used as both bracelets and anklets as the sizing is so different then.  For bracelets the multi string ones are just too lose for me even as tight as you can pull them – if you have very wide wrists they would fit you, though.  They make better anklets because of that.  For the ones that are double string – which is most of them – they fit either as a bracelet or an anklet as they adjust all the way down to the smallest possible size by pulling the strings completely.<br /><br />The issue with the dual sizing is that you have a LOT of string hanging of the backend of these things if worn as a bracelet and they look super ridiculous and like a mess.  Personally, I am going to trim 3 inches off each double string bracelet (1.5 inches each side) and re-knot so that I can wear them as actual bracelets.  The wide ones are fine as is because I can only wear as an anklet anyway and you need the extra string to fit it over the heel of your foot.<br /><br />They are generally cute and a pretty good value for what you get.  I only do not like the wave one as the metal is too long and MUST lay flat.  Otherwise, a cute set – or eventually with some crafting to be done on my part anyway.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : )",122676,356
4.0,1615489749902,Seem to work well but will have to wait for truly frigid weather to truly test,"No direction came with these gloves at all – just the two gloves in a plastic bag.  That is totally weird.  Luckily, my mom has a pair of heated gloves and I sort of remember how hers worked – so maybe it is pretty standard?  I dunno.  Anyway – a long press of the button turns them on and then a short press cycles through each temperature setting.  Then a long press turns them off again.  Just remember – each glove is independent – so you have to press each button on each glove.  Also – you have to take the battery pack out of the glove’s pouch and turn that on each time you use them.  Then you have to take the battery pack out of the pouch and turn them off after your use otherwise it will simply drain your batteries.<br /><br />First on you get a flashing red, press it and you get blue, press again and you get white, press again and you are back to red.  To me, the blue feels like the least heat setting, while the white feels the hottest to me.  Not sure, though as you would think the cycle pattern would match the heat increasing – I dunno – no instructions.<br /><br />The battery packs are easy enough to figure out and when you turn them “on” the red light will come on – and stay on until you turn the battery pack off.  So just turning the gloves on and off will not help your batteries – you have to remove from the pouch before and after each and every use.  There are three AA batteries in each glove.  You do feel the weight – is it terrible – no.  But is it noticeable – to me, yes – especially if you turn your palms to the side.  My mom’s gloves are rechargeable – no stand-alone batteries.  I guess the good thing about using AA’s is that you should always have some on hand to use quickly.  Also – if needed while out and about in your gloves – it is easy to go and buy some too.<br /><br />I could only try these on in my home as the temperature has been getting warmer these days – here today it will be an unseasonably 70 degrees outside!  No need for gloves at all – especially those that are heated.  Wish I had these a few weeks ago, though.  I guess I will not be able to truly test their effectiveness until it is once again cold out.  The backs of the hands and the backs of the fingers did get warm.  A lot of gloves the fingers do not heat at all – so that was really nice.  I didn’t feel any heat in the palms or the underside of the fingers.  But the entre back of the hand/fingers may be all you need on a cold day.  I am truly looking forward to using them when they are truly needed. : )<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.  Thanks! : )",122676,2708

THOSE glasses are so cool but I am not a fan of them in bright direct sun as I prefer a much darker lens.  These lenses on this pair are darker than the colored lenses.  So I like that a lot.  They are a bit better in bright direct sun because of that - but again - I would prefer a much darker lens.  It could be just me - I like to walk around and hate the sun bothering my eyes in any way.  You can see your eyes through these - so that is generally a tip off that bright sun will not be blocked that well - if you can see your eyes.<br />They come in a cool lightweight wooden case, along with a polishing cloth, and a softer sleeve case.

It's too shallow for me so it doesn't go down far enough on my head, and it's only just big enough around to fit. That's my problem, not the manufacturer's fault, but maybe that information is useful to someone. My head is about 23.5"" around, if that helps.

So if you plan to sweat it in then you probably want to get a bigger size if you can.<br /><br />The cap looks really sharp. The brim is short which I love. The fabric is a brushed fancy weave that's super soft but was already covered in lint by the time I received it. I've had a hat like that before and it was just always covered in lint. Not a problem in a heather gray, but it looks bad on black cotton. You have to brush it a lot. But it does look really nice. It's a heavy cotton (and it's black, obviously) so it probably isn't best for really hot weather.<br /><br />I wish it fit better because I really like it, even if I have to lint roll it.",122988,7385

5.0,1574293546406,Silky smooth fabric.,"These are a lovey navy capri legging that is so soft, I'm amazed!  This fabric is silky!  It washed well, and dried well in the dryer, without issues.  I would suggest line drying them to make the quality last longer.  They do have a nice tummy control panel and elastic that is thicker than some of my yoga leggings.  These do not have any pockets, that is a down side for me, but not worthy of losing a star.  I don't like that they sewed in a tag on the left thigh, it really bugged me so much I had to cut that out!  I am 5'4"" and these capris go to 4 inches above my ankle.  Lastly, the big draw for me is the fabric, It could possibly have me coming back for another pair in the future.",123287,6966
4.0,1571413187589,Good for the snow!,"Important note: The only part that is cotton, is the striped rim.  The rest is this cheap, thin plastic, similar to the type used for puffy jackets.  I did pull on the plastic quite a bit on the inside and on the top, and it does seem to be sturdy, it did not tear or change shape.  It does smell like plastic, it seemed to disappear after airing it out for a week.<br />So this is completely lined with black plastic and there's plastic on the top so this would probably be pretty good if you've got extremely wet weather and you wanted to keep your hair dry. I did find it strange that you can't wash it except hand washing it, you can't dry it  in nthe clothes dryer and you can't bleach it.  So I'm guessing the only way to clean it is by taking a wet cloth and wiping it down if you needed to or hand washing it and letting it dry for a week, hung up. I was able to wear my hair up in a big bun and still put this on comfortably. I think it looks cute on, depending on how you put the cotton rim.  This came with a face mask, that is super cute, maybe for a child or a teen girl when they are sick but need to get to the store?  I know that in China, face masks are a BIG deal, with pollution issues, so maybe this is a pollution mask?  I think it is cute.  The socks they sent as a gift as well, they are on the small size, will fit someone that wears shoe size 6 would be perfect.  All in all, I like the look if I had a black puffer jacket to wear with this hat, the shiny plastic look might be great.  I'm only giving this 4 stars, because it is WARM, and will keep the head DRY.  Great for wearing in powdery SNOW.",123287,1972
5.0,1567798098342,"Cute see thru purse, fits all my stuff","This is cute, functional and stylish.  I transferred all the stuff from my other purse easily to this one, It is a smokey see thru plastic with imitation alligator skin accents.  The strap can be either a cross body or as an off shoulder purse, both work easily with the strap being adjusted to your preference.  It has a twist closure that matches the golden chains on the strap.  I can clip my keys to the D ring on the purse where the strap attaches, I feel confident this purse will last quite a while.  Some employers require purses that are see thru, this fits the bill.  This purse stands up without me being too concerned that it will fall over as other purses do.  The base is built for it to sit up.<br />My only concern would be losing items if it accidentally got knocked over.  I would not use this for travelling on an airline, with the metal accents and potentially losing important items in a airline checkpoint.  There is a soft inner purse, for ladies essentials or monthly cycle needs, keeping them nicely discreet.  Overall I think this is cute and functional, will use on date nights.  I think this can be used with confidence by a vast age range as well.",123287,82023

I feel very comfortable and do not feel restricted in my movements with this sports bra.  I have tried a few other products by Ocean Blues and I have found all of their products to be of great quality and comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this sports bra!,124983,365

They easily stretch to fit whatever size you need and keep their form.  The current price of this pack is very reasonable for 20.  I love the colors in this pack.  They are very neutral, earthy tones.  There are beige, navy, brown, maroon, and grey colors.  They will work with any outfit I wear.  I definitely recommend these for keys.",124983,6433

They are the size stud that I typically wear, not obnoxiously large and not too small.  The opals are definitely lab-created as they just don't sparkle quite as nicely as real ones, however, this is why they are priced the way they are.  The current price is definitely appropriate for the size stud.  The setting is nickle free which is necessary for me as I am allergic to nickle.  They also give you the regular metal backings and plastic ones so you can choose which ones you prefer.  I was also happy that the box came with a bonus of a hair tie with pearls.  I would recommend these if you are looking for a value pair of opals.  They will go great with almost any outfit (just have to match the rose gold).",124983,13791

I was very happy when I got them to find they were just the size I was expecting, a bit smaller than the size of a dime.  They fit just right, hugging the lobe of my ear.  I was worried about the clasp, but I have not had any problems with opening or closing them.  The current price is a great value for a pair of earrings with cubic zirconia.  I would definitely recommend these!",124983,46123
4.0,1566592676319,Great value for a fun princess dress!,"This dress is really pretty and a great value for its current price!  I love that it has a variety of fabrics including glitter embellishments on the bodice and skirt, velour on the bodice, and silkier translucent and pink on the skirt.  There are also cute little pink bows on the arms and an oval jewel sewn on the front.  The best part about the dress is the plastic hoop at the bottom of the skirt.  It makes for a great full looking skirt and it's also foldable so you can still fold up the dress!  I tried this first on my average sized 17 month old and it was a little big, but it didn't look horrible on her.  I also had my 5 year old son try it on for size and to me it looked a little small.  I would probably recommend this dress for 2-3 year olds as opposed to 4-6.  The only concern I have is comfort for the child.  This is not a super well-made dress (hence its price) and my son said the stitching was uncomfortable on the inside.  He also said the silver ribbon embellishment on the top was scratchy.  Overall I would recommend this dress as it is such a great value.  It would be perfect for Halloween or dress up play.",124983,7356

2.0,1569550891954,A mixed bag for this mixed bag,"I like this a bit and I don't more.  The fake (they call it ""PU Leather"") suede leather of the main black bag is nice looking. Then, attached is a shiny ""PU"" patent leather small purse bag.  Not removable, as I thought it may be when I first looked at it. But attached. So it contrasts very much and the smaller shiny section really doesn't help the look to me.  Though it is a smart idea, and is handy.  The main purse section is one large opening when you zip it open.  That's good. There is also a zippered separate compartment inside halfway down on the purse for stashing, although it does slightly show through the bag if you put in anything bumpy, like keys.  The strap is also a mix of fake leather and sort of cheap feeling chain. I like the look of that, but the chain itself feels like it has a plastic coating or something. The shoulder bag also has a bottom that is soft and not necessarily stable on a table.  It also comes with a bonus large ""grocery"" size bag, a nice extra. That is thick plastic with the logo on it.  I don't like the fact that they now call fake leather ""PU"" with no explanation.  I also think the bag design is not very well thought out for functionality. It can't figure out what it wants to be.",125035,6984
4.0,1564239961928,"Nice Look, Large, Retro cool","These glasses remind me so much of Ray-Ban Aviator sunglasses that I wore for years.  Those were expensive, even back then.  These are really nice ""knock-offs"", with a slightly different look. Much lighter, and not as flexible, you can't bend them in closer.  They have plastic and  The sides have a straight section but it still has that basic  big aviator look. The lenses are good. My eyes felt that comfortable feeling when I put them on in bright sun.  The polarization is very good.  They are big, so if your face is not at least a medium size, you will look like a bug. However, if you used to wear those Aviators I mentioned before, you may find these very nice. Well made, so far no screws loose, and comfortable on the nose.",125035,247
5.0,1560366991580,"Comfortable, lightweight, perfect!","I love this jacket.  First of all, its got a good amount of stretch without compromising on the strength of the fabric, which allows for easy movement and a more forgiving fit. It is definitely cropped but it hits my waist at the right spot so it looks great. Also, the sleeves are long enough that they don't ride up when i raise my arms but they also aren't so long that I'm constantly pulling them out of the way. This is especially rare for me because I'm 5'10 so I often run into issues with the proportions of women's clothing, but this fit perfectly! There aren't pockets for your hands, but they make up for it with functionally sized breast pockets.  I can fit my phone in one and my cards/keys in the other with plenty of room to spare. Its light enough to keep the chill of a breeze off but it still breathes enough not to get sweaty in it. This is my go to jacket this summer!",125035,4288
5.0,1557955942799,A clever design & a great fit for fashionable no show socks.,"Turning them inside out, here my assessment, the stitches are nicely tensioned, meaning tight adjusted.  The borders are well designed, but the border at the heel has about 14 elastic  stitches, and just half would be enough, since they're well programmed/positioned.  The clear rubbery application at the heels is also well designed and manufactured.  The seam above the toes is noticeable but it shouldn't be an issue, unless your shoes, like the loafers, or snickers have a seam just above it to cause extra pressure and potentially some marks on your skin.  The elastic in the middle of the socks has loose ends and this will only cause problems if you cut them, especially the one closer to the toes, so don't do it.  The best feature, those socks don't add much volume inside the shoes and stay in place as expected.  The package came with an extra pair. I got 9 pairs instead of 8 as the link informs, 3 black, 2 grey, 2 beige, 2 white.  I really liked them, regardless of the imperfections.",125035,30485

I highly doubt it would fit a men's 8 - 11, which would be about a 11 - 13 in women's.<br /><br />My feet don't feel restricted and after wearing them for a few hours, the part around my ankle didn't leave imprints from the elastic. As for the ""arch support"" I don't notice anything special about it. The middle part of the sock with the ridges does feel a smidgen tighter than the rest of the sock but it's not uncomfortable and definitely not strong enough to provide any sort of arch support. The material isn't super soft but it's not rough and it won't leave little sock balls in your shoes / on your feet after you've worn them for awhile. The seam on the toe doesn't bother me as it's very low profile.. I can't feel it rub against my toes at all. Since they're rather thin, I don't expect these socks to last long.<br /><br />Overall, if you're buying it just to have a breathable pair of socks these would be great.

Because of that the slippers aren't very comfortable for me to wear. I would recommend going up a size when ordering. Width wise they feel fine, although when you are wearing the slippers they do make your feet look wide but that is extremely common with with most slippers. The look of the slippers is slightly unique with the plaid flannel lining near the opening and the rest of the slipper on top is primarily grey with flecks of white and black all throughout. The slippers don't look high end and luxurious but they look decent enough to wear around the house. Compared to other slippers I own, I do think there is a decent cushion so they are easy to walk around in and I do like the non slip bottom as I don't feel like I will slide around when walking.",138305,3719
5.0,1602884338773,Neat looking shirt,"I love this shirt as the solid white stars really stand out against the black. I ordered a size large and the fit is good. I'm 5'6"" with a long torso and a big chest and the shirt comes down to about the middle of my rear end. I do have a large stomach and while the shirt is more form fitting, it's not tight where it feels uncomfortable or looks bad. The material is pretty soft and it's a comfy shirt to wear. Around the chest area it has a somewhat stretched look where you can kinda see thru the material but it's not too bad. Paired with a black bra, I think the shirt looks fine.<br /><br />I washed and dried according to directions and the shirt came out fine and there was absolutely no fading of the white stars.",138305,8072
5.0,1601570273850,"Nice casual, form fitting tshirt","I ordered a size large and I think this black shirt with white outlined stars fits pretty well. I do have a larger size chest (38DD) and there is a tiny bit of stretching in terms of being able to see thru the black shirt a bit near the top but not enough where I wouldn't be able to wear it outside the house. The rest of the shirt is solid black and doesn't look stretched at all. Given the current seller photo the shirt looks more like loungewear (the picture for the black colored shirt is slightly misleading as the shirt does not come with matching shorts) and to me it works just as well as a casual shirt to wear out. I am 5'6"" with a slightly long torso and the shirt comes down to about midway on my rear end.  It is a form fitting shirt and normally I have issues with that as I have a large stomach but I think the black color looks nice and flattering.<br /><br />I washed the shirt according to directions (cold water on the delicate cycle and tumble dry low) and had no issues.",138305,9455
3.0,1597973335367,Keeps falling,"I ordered these leggings in my usual size large and while I can get them on they just keep falling below my stomach. I would never be able to workout in these leggings as I can't even walk around without worrying they are showing a little too much of me. To be fair though my problem area is my stomach for sure as that's where most of my weight seems to go.  Now whether or not you could go up a size and not have the falling down issue, I really am not sure.  It's a shame because otherwise the leggings are well constructed.  The seams are good and after washing on the delicate cycle in cold water and letting them air dry, there were no further issues with construction.",138305,7073
4.0,1582242720615,Comfy and form fitting,"This is a comfy velour set but it is more form fitting rather than loose fitting.  I got it in my usual size large and while it fits, it is snug.  I have other clothing items by this brand, all in size large, and this velour set has the tightest fit out of all of them. It looks nice on me and is flattering but if you prefer something not quite as form fitting, I would go a size up. I have an average to maybe even below average size rear end for a woman and if mine was bigger or my upper thighs were bigger, I would definitely need a larger size.<br /><br />I'm 5'6"" with a long torso, and short legs. The only thing I don't really care for is the cuffs on the pants.  It just looks weird because the velour kinda poofs out a bit before the cuff starts.  But that's being pretty nit picky as this is just something I am going to wear to lounge around the house.  The bottom part of the pants might be an issue for shorter women.<br /><br />Overall a good set if you want something comfy to wear. I washed according to instructions (inside out, on cold, and tumble dry low) and it came out just fine. The set also comes with Proposition 65 warning labels.",138305,838
4.0,1581808973391,Very comfortable to wear,"This is a nice, comfortable to wear, zip up hoodie. I ordered it in my usual size large and it does fit pretty well although it is slightly baggy or at least compared to another hoodie I have by this brand in the same size.  To compare, I laid the other hoodie on top of this one, and this hoodie is 3 or 4 inches bigger, width wise.  The sizing measurements provided by the seller do seem to be pretty accurate though so I would go by their chart to determine what will work best for you. For me, I can easily wear a t-shirt underneath without the hoodie being too tight.<br /><br />The hoodie sweatshirt is pretty soft even after washing and drying.  I washed and dried according to directions (cold and tumble dry low) and it looks and feels just fine.  The item does come with a Proposition 65 label.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty happy with this sweatshirt as it's great for lounging around the house or when you are going for a casual look.",138305,2950

The back and waist taper nicely inward. the seams on the back and waist are done very well. Despite the fit, I really didn't like the material. It's kind of a rough lined material that reminds me of the blankets that airlines used to give to its sleeping passengers. I'm also not too fond of the shoulder pads. It seems very old fashioned. Overall, it's ok for work purposes even if it seems really conservative.",139780,6991
3.0,1599706359976,Somewhat difficult to put in,"I have some pros and cons for this piece of jewelry.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />This is an unusual piece of jewelry. It's simple in its design but is something that could easily grab someone's attention since it's unusual to have a piercing that wraps around your ears like this. I can also see this working well with cartilage piercings once you get used to putting it on. I also like the simple design, since it allows the wearer to pair it with everyday clothing items or wear to work. I do love more fancy designs, but there's always something to be said for simplicity. This is also fairly sturdy, which proved to be an asset when it came to my fumbling around with it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />While I like these earrings, they are pretty difficult to put on and took quite a lot of practice. This may be because I'm not all that coordinated, but I think it's also because these didn't come with any instructions for wear. There are instructions on the listing, but if I were to give these as a gift I wouldn't really want the recipient to check the listing and see how much I paid for them. It would be good to have some instructions in the packaging just in case the user is unfamiliar with this type of earring, as I was. To put these on you have to start from the back as opposed to the front (the way most earrings are set up), so it took me a lot of fumbling to be able to get used to this. It also seemed that this was a bit thicker than my earring holes. That may be because of the type of earrings I use, but I'm not certain. This also felt a little like costume jewelry but then again, it's not like this is high end silver. I don't think that most would expect this to be at this price poing.<br /><br />Most of my quibbles honestly stem around the lack of instructions with the package, to be honest.",145648,2407
4.0,1587993445970,Seems OK,"I travel twice yearly for work, so finding a way to maximize space in my luggage is key. I figured that this would be a nice way to store items in one place, particularly on the return trip when everything is just a teensy bit harder to fit into the suitcase.<br /><br />These are of a decent size and would be good for the smaller essentials such as socks and underwear or night clothes. I don't know that this does a huge-huge job of compressing size like I thought it would, but there may be a difference once I place them in my suitcase for travel (which is of the time of this review, not an option for me because of current events). At the very least this will help with organizing, which is always a plus.",145648,6291
5.0,1585323547214,"Fits well, snug grip, very warm","Hospital slippers are sometimes described as some of the best slippers in the world since they tend to be warm, keep you from slipping, and are just plain comfortable.<br /><br />These are a little more form fitting than the ones I've seen in hospitals, but they're definitely comfortable. They are for men but fit me very well, plus I think that they would have wide appeal for anyone since they don't obviously scream hospital socks. They are fairly plain, as hospital socks tend to be very bright colors, which I see as something in its favor. As far as grip goes, they grip well. My floors are mostly carpeted but seemed to grip the carpet pretty well. They don't roll off the feet easily either, which is another plus. They're also thin enough that if I absolutely needed to, I could slip on a pair of shoes over them. It's not what they're for, but it's nice to know that I can do this.<br /><br />Honestly, I'd choose these over some of the other slippers out there if I were to need to purchase more.",145648,1970

I was pretty excited to see these come up on Vine since I can always use more and the socks are really pretty cute.<br /><br />I wear about a women's size 10. My pair of socks was a medium and fit fairly well. They weren't loose at all, which I liked since I am not really hugely fond of loose socks when it comes to doing a lot of walking.

My granddaughter borrowed for dinner in a nice restaurant and said she used it as a,wrap instead of around her neck but knows it will be lovely to wear with her favorite dress so sounds like she'll have to borrow again.

It holds maybe 5 bills folded up and doesn't make any difference in the amount of the bill and  maybe 4 cards. It will fit in a pocket of your pants or jacket just so you can keep track of it.<br /><br />The leather isn't thin but I'm sure with use it compresses some too. Not an expensive gift and children would love to give Dad this.,157620,10985

5.0,1591904023546,Very handy for traveling,"These organizing bags come in a set of two. The smaller bag is 11x7x1 inches but expands to nearly 4 inches deep. This is an excellent size for a toiletry bag. It can be used to pack all your toiletry items in a small, separate bag within your larger suitcase.  There are no vents in this smaller bag but it does contain a small loop for hanging the bag.<br /><br />The larger bag I received is 14x9x1 inches but also expands to nearly 4 inches deep. On ones side of this bag is a 3 inch mesh that allows this bag to vent. This bag also contains a small loop to allow the bag to hang.  This could be a bag for shoes, linens or any other items that you may want to keep separate from the rest of the items in your suitcase.<br /><br />Esch bag has a sturdy handle on the long side of the bag where you open it. In the 1 depth size, each bag could easily be used to carry papers or small items separate from a suitcase. For example, the smaller bag described above would make a decent small satchel or purse for carrying travel documents.  Similarly, the larger bag described above would make a decent small case for carrying 8x11 papers or documents.<br /><br />Each bag has a zipper that goes all around the top such that the top opens completely for easy packing. Each bag has a second zipper that goes around the mid section of the bag that allows them to expand from 1 inch to nearly 4 inches. Each bag is made of a sturdy, opaque canvas like material.

My wife enjoyed it recently while in the mountains during an early, wet snow/rain mix. It fits her well but I must admit there is not a lot of stretch in the head band part.

The one end has a large, waterproof bag that stretches into the main compartment and has air holes. This is perfect for wet items or smelly shoes. The last compartment is on the other end. It is smaller but also allows you to fold the bag inside out into this compartment. This makes the bag very small, compact and easy to carry when not in use. This is a great design and multifunctional bag!",162954,2762
5.0,1564010976802,Well constructed socks that are great for hiking,"I think these socks may run slightly large which is why one of the reviewers indicated they ballooned around their feet.  This was not the case with me. I accidentally ordered a medium which goes up to a size 9. My shoe size is 9.5. This medium size sock fit well without being at all tight. The construction including the seamless toe is excellent. A left and right sock are indicated based on extra support around the the arch. I wore these on a hike yesterday which was 8.2 miles and 1000 foot elevation gain. I loved how these socks performed. My feet did not get as hot in my hiking boots. When I took my shoes off my feet quickly cooled off and any leftover sweat wicked away. Also, I have a nice pair of hiking boots but by the end of a long hike my feet are a bit sore. Using these socks and the same hiking boots, my feet felt much better. I attribute this to the extra support from the socks. I washed the socks today and there was little to no shrinkage. I recommend these socks for hiking.",162954,6846
5.0,1562207752558,Great pair of bike shorts at a good value,"This is my fourth pair of bike shorts and the best ones yet. The brands for the other pairs ran small so were always a little too tight. I have a 34 inch waist so I ordered the large and they fit perfectly, not loose anywhere. I see other reviewers indicated there is too much padding, however, in my experience, this is how they should be. The extra padding in the seat feels a little funny when walking around,  but when seated on the bike the pad is just the right size to pad what needs to be padded. I wore these on a short 5 mile ride.  The shorts performed as expected. The legs didn’t ride up and the waist band felt comfortable for the whole ride. It was a warm day, but the material was very comfortable and there were no hot spots or chafing. These are a great pair of bike shorts and a good value.",162954,166137

3.0,1605076458656,Gorgeous colors,I can’t get over how nice these two colors go together. The pink is so bright. Both colors make me happy to look at. They’re my favorite. But they were so hard to get on. And too tight. I felt like my circulation was being cut off. One was smaller than the other. They are thick but not thick like wool or thermal socks. Definitely a winter sock for me. My feet get hot easy. They are soft so that’s a plus. It’s all in what you like as for as tightness.,162997,7182
4.0,1598498246111,Love the straps,This fit as expected for my size. I love the wide straps. They didn’t cut into my shoulders. They also stay on shoulders good. I was afraid they would slide down.

The chain just feels very fragile, and I have questions about its longterm durability.

5.0,1641004291955,Nicer than expected,"I ordered this jacket to use on those colder fall and spring days but it is warmer than expected so it will probably work for many winter days as well. The coat fit perfectly. I ordered a medium thinking it might be a bit too small as another coat I purchased recently fit better in the large size (for reference I'm 5'9"" and 170lbs). If I intended to use this coat for working outdoors where I needed to put a sweater under it then it would be too small but I'll be using this primarily to go from the house to my car to other establishments. The coat looks to be well made and is decent enough in appearance that I can wear it visiting clients. As a few others have noted, the zipper is on the wrong side. It's a minor thing but takes a little getting used to. Overall I'm pleased with coat - it's better constructed and looking than I expected.",173330,2787

3.0,1614414912161,Mediocre gloves,I got these gloves specifically to use when I'm snow blowing as I thought the heating feature would help my hands stay warm. The gloves were shipped in a plastic zip lock bag without any type of instructions. I unzipped the battery pouches on the gloves only to find two cheap plastic battery holders each requiring 3 AA batteries to power up the gloves rather than normal rechargeable lithium batteries with a charger. I inserted the three AA batteries into the battery packs and then turned the gloves on. While they did manage to power up the gloves the heat they produced  was pretty anemic and I doubt they will last longer than a couple hours before going dead. The gloves themselves are fairly well made but not very insulated so hopefully I can finish snow blowing the driveway before they no longer generate heat. I'm not overly impressed with these gloves and think a better insulated glove with hand warmers tucked inside would be better. These aren't nearly as expensive as other heated gloves but with those you get longer lasting rechargeable lithium batteries and a charger. My feeling is that it would be better to pay more and get a better heated glove.,173330,2708

The V creates a peak on the front of the shoe and in the back.  It is kind of a hard ""faux"" leather material and it is higher than it looks in the photos. It rubs on the front of your ankle and in the back.  You can wear some small bootie socks to improve some of the comfort but those 2 places are still going to rub due to the ""V"" style.

2.0,1572547207932,Poorly made,"This ring does NOT look as advertised.  The pictures make it look like a cute little ring that a grown-up could wear and it is advertised as being excellent quality and workmanship.  This literally looks just like the ring I got in 4th grade from the boy who proposed to me with a ring he got from Claire's.  I did not expect it to be dripping in diamonds as .031 carat is not much, but it looks like they spread some glue around the heart part and hoped the diamonds would stick on.  I think my expectations were a little higher because the company took the time to list the clarity, color and size of diamonds as well as to brag about conflict free diamonds.  I expected this little ring to look as cute as it does in the picture.  I imagine my 9 year old niece would really like this ring, but it is highly doubtful an adult will find this ""perfect for Daily Wear, Anniversaries, Weddings, Engagements, Parties"" etc.  I do not recommend this item and I do recommend the company ditch the barely there diamonds and step up the quality of their craftsmanship.

It's a little stiff initially when placing cards in, but once you have a few in there, it's easy to use the little finger notch on the side to push the cards out a little to find the one you want.  It securely held my small wad of 8 bucks, so it will really hold well if you have more money to place in the clip.

The description said it would be suitable for a party so I ordered it for an upcoming wedding.  Nope.  Not suitable at all.  It was supposed to be a size medium.  I'm assuming that means a medium child.  I am a size 4-6 and this was way too small.  It is is unattractive and not at all form fitting like a nice ""trench coat"" should be.  I hope this company decides to up their quality game before selling more of these on Amazon.  Absolute junk.",183391,21830

It looks like it's had black painted over it and then rubbed off so it's just in the low spots. It's held up with a tight, hard cord of black cotton (?) that is adjustable. It would make a great necklace for belly dance. The only problem is that after a few hours my neck started to get sore.

I am not one for fancy rings and like using this as my wedding ring and keep my actual wedding ring in a safe place so I don't loose it or damage it while at work or working out in the garage.  Tungsten makes for great rings due to its strength and durability.  But with those features does come some extra weight.  It is heavier than your normal/typical ring but this is to be expected.  This does not bother me at all but for those sensitive to extra weight you may not like this.  The color is nice and looks great.  Easy to clean.

These say they fit between 10-13. They fit well in the toe and foot area. The part that goes up the calf is a bit snug, borderline compression sock, for me anyway. Some areas of the fabric are thick and durable and between the horizontal stripes and the heel portion they are much thinner.  There was a very tiny hole on one sock near the very top that was worsened the first time I put them on. I’m afraid the hole will continue to worsen at this point.

I am 5'4"", 110 lbs and they are snug at he waist (so they should stay put well).  I'm glad I didn't get the the next size down.<br /><br />Style:  These do not have a contoured foot as some tight do.

The fabric is 60% Cotton, 40% Polyester.  The exterior is smooth knit and the interior is fleece.  The construction looks sound.  It should provide moderate warmth in dry conditions.  If you want to layer it with a raincoat, be sure your coat is big enough as this is not a fitted style and is bulky.<br /><br />Pattern/Color:  The chevron design is attractive.  The white/gray/black color block combination looks sharp.<br /><br />Design/Fit/Sizing:  There a kangaroo pockets on the front.

This is a risk with white tights. The dark color from my black dance shoes does not come out either.<br /><br />Sizing: The XL (or womens S/M) is a snug fit for someone 5'4"" and 110lbs.  They look tiny, but but expand tremendously.  So ... don't be concerned if when you open them you think you were sent the wrong size.

Unfortunately, they appeared to be a rather cheap knockoff from the 1970s: the glasses seemed more suitable for a costume party than everyday wear.<br /><br />The lightweight frames felt fragile, such they would never survive a drop or accidentally sitting on them.  The soft case did not help, as it offered no protection beyond the prevention of surface scratches.  I wouldn't try adjusting the nose pads or legs for a better fit, as they would probably snap off!<br /><br />Despite a reasonably low price, I don't think the quality and overall appearance justify even that price.

The bracelet itself looked well-made, though I did not understand why the logo was placed on the inside of the clasp, where it was hidden from view.<br /><br />It took me several minutes to figure out the magnetic locking mechanism that secured the bracelet closed.  Then, upon trying the bracelet on, it felt like a vice around my 8-inch wrist.  To remove the bracelet, I again fiddled with the clasp for several minutes.  Perhaps it loosens up a bit over time.<br /><br />I laid out the bracelet and found the measurements were made including the clasp, which accounted for its snug fit (see photo).  I could not account, however, for my difficulty utilizing the clasp, unless it had something to do with the arthritis in my hands.<br /><br />I did a bit of online research about the manufacturer, and made a few interesting discoveries.  Despite the use of a logo depicting a Native American and the photos of a young man making these leather goods by hand, the Casisto.J company is based in Hong Kong and manufactures in China.  While the low price told me this item could not be American-made, others may be fooled by the imagery and marketing.  (I include this information so the potential buyers will better understand the product they purchase.)<br /><br />In the end, I elected to give the bracelet away to a friend with smaller wrists than mine.

If you are petite like my lady, you may have to become creative to wear this piece.<br /><br />The ring featured an inner portion that looked like a flower or sunburst pattern, while the outer portion of the ring featured simulated pearls and gold beads.  The ring came packaged in a small plastic bag and an unadorned outer cardboard box (see photo).  The portion that affixed the ring to the finger was a (really cheap-appearing) adjustable metal loop.<br /><br />The diameter of the ring fell just under the circumference of a Kennedy half-dollar coin.  Thus, you needed sizable hands and a love of the unique to wear the ring comfortably.  My lady decided to repurpose the ring since it was far too large for her hand.  She snipped off the adjustable ring portion, and affixed a pin to the back of the disk portion.  Thus, she now had a small, but eyecatching, broach/pin.<br /><br />As a pin, this design worked much better than it did as a ring.

From a distance, you'd never think twice about the overall quality because it does look pretty good while being worn. However I noticed while handling the necklace, the chain itself is pretty cheap, and will probably break fairly easy.<br /><br />This would however be a good jewelry piece for a teenager to give as a gift to a significant other, as its not crazy expensive.<br /><br />Overall, its a decent necklace.",203840,5652

They fit my face well, have comfortable nose pieces, and even came with a tool to adjust the fit if need be.

4.0,1595141851392,Not cotton,"I like cotton shirts. I had thought this was a cotton shirt because the description says it's cotton. It's not. This is a 100% polyester shirt. It does not look like cotton nor does it feel like cotton. The tag on the shirt shows that it's not cotton.<br /><br />That aside, like other reviewers have said, this shirt sits somewhere between formal and casual. I think it's perfectly work appropriate if you're an office worker. It will look great with a pair of slacks.<br /><br />Even though the tag says machine wash gentle and no tumble dry, I dried it on low heat anyway, and it handled it just fine, except a SLIGHT  wrinkling of the collar seams (see photo). This is a big plus for me, it is also the main reason why I prefer cotton when I buy shirts - I can machine wash and tumble dry it. Line drying is a pain in the butt for me. So, even though this is not made of cotton, I am glad it dried well.<br /><br />It fits very loosely but I think it's super comfortable. I like the flow of the fabric. It doesn't cling to my body. When it came out of the dryer, there wasn't static. It's very nice.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice shirt. Not what I had expected when I ordered it, but I would recommend it. Just know that the style may be a little quirky... I call it a very Chinese FOB style. It's something I'd found very commonly seen in a Chinese speaking country.",212826,9460

They are VERY grippy, so I'd definitely recommend them if you need to use them for safety. They also wash well, just make sure you turn them inside out when you dry them.",212826,1970
4.0,1575516317301,fits snug in an average built woman,"I think the sizing is a bit tricky because it says it's for both women and girls. It's probably better if it's for women OR girls. As a woman in my 40s, with not very long legs (I have long torso), around 5 foot 4 and 125 pounds, with a 36 inch hip, this fits extremely snug... no room for more expansion. Any more stretching would probably tear this. Therefore, so far so good, it fits, barely, and I fear for its durability on someone like me. Maybe I am a much larger woman than most who will be wearing this.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's very comfortable and soft. The convertible foot hole is very nice and useful. I would highly recommend anyone smaller than I am to get this.",212826,9482

Generally, gold is not my favorite color, and I normally prefer silver or even black gold, but this is a pleasant surprise! The chains are delicate and shimmery, without kinks and twists. The CZ diamond pendent glistens under the light, and has a very expensive look. The gold bar is slim and hangs beautifully from the necklace, and the position of the hanging is adjustable from the necklace itself. Again, they're absolutely gorgeous. They will go well with both formal and casual fashion. Highly recommended!",212826,581

It doesn't look any less beautiful than an affordable necklace like it from the jewelry stores. The curve is even and the necklace itself is dainty and pretty. The gold plating looks more valuable than its cost. The stones look like diamonds. This will be a nice gift for a young lady's birthday or graduation or on the holidays. It's gorgeous enough to wear to formal weddings.<br /><br />Highly recommended!",212826,11496

They come in a big plastic bag (with stilted English instructions reminding you not to throw the bag into the ocean) but they're nicely individually wrapped with little brown paper labels -- I wrapped a couple up for a friend as a gift, and they felt nice even individually.<br /><br />The socks are of solid quality -- I like the scalloped edges at the tops. They're only crew socks though, and they're only about half wool, so these aren't for SUPER cold days. But for most of us, these will do just fine, and they don't feel too bulky or scratchy on your feet.<br /><br />Mostly, that value is great!!!",213230,884
2.0,1556731173796,"Smaller brim than I'd like, unlined, feels cheap","This is an ok sun hat, but the brim is smaller than similar hats, and the construction feels cheap -- since the hat is unlined, the stitching of the floral pattern on the brim shows through on the underside, and looks pretty chintzy. At this price, I think you can do better. This might be cute for little girl who doesn't care about exposed stitching and for whom the small brim feels more generous, but for me... it's not a win.",213230,4681
5.0,1593318551622,"Relieves leg fatigue, plus they're really cute!","I've been taking long walks through hilly San Francisco each day, during the COVID isolation period.  Lately, my legs would be tingling by the end of the walk, and my feet felt a little numb.  I received a package of four pair of knee-high compression socks to try and to review, and after wearing a pair the first time, I realized that there is a way to ease the fatigue in my legs.  The socks come right up to my kneecaps, and they have a firm grip that keeps them from slipping.  I hardly knew I was wearing them.  But when I got home and took off my shoes, I realized that my feet felt pretty normal.  This is great.<br /><br />My only other experience with compression socks is a pair that I bought at a medical supply store to wear on a long plane trip.  The socks prevented the usual airplane swelling.  The compression on those socks is stronger, and they are very difficult to put on.  These Wibsu socks are possibly a little less restrictive, but they are definitely easier to put on, plus they're very good looking and fun to wear.  I've been washing them by machine in a lingerie bag and drying them on a rack.  Drying is very fast, but I'm glad to have four pair to rotate.  I am so relieved to be able to take my long walks without paying a painful price each evening.",218958,4584

The size I received for review, 58 cm, is a medium and is not adjustable.  The tag attached to the hat says, MSRP $15, not a bad price for quality cap.",218958,7385
5.0,1546324152549,Stylin' for sure!,"I popped my new hat onto my head when I took it out of the box; my husband said, “You’re stylin’ now.”  It’s a women’s version of a fedora, with a velvet band with floppy ties.  Very attractive when slanted slightly to the side and a little over one eye.  The hat is a little loose on my head, but that is easily fixed with some Velcro, to help hold it on in the wind.  The dark blue top and band are almost black against the royal blue brim.  This will look great with jeans or casual pants.<br /><br />By the way, the web page says this is a “Wranger” hat.

5.0,1589860616470,Great grip!,"What great socks! They grip well and are perfect for yoga or barre work! The colors are cute, too. These wash well and, best of all, are comfortable. They don't go too high on the ankle or low, which is such a frustrating problem with other brands. Generally, socks are large on my tiny feet, but with these, the heel was just right. They may run small, because of that. I think these socks are worth it, especially if you're looking for socks with a strong grip to the floor when working out.",220643,7394
1.0,1579189677129,It works as a hat but...,This is a one size beanie hat.  It's brim is a cotton fabric but the rest of it is a plastic material.  It's not very pretty and it makes noise when you touch it because it's plastic.  It fits my head but it's just a strange looking hat.  It needed more cotton and less plastic.  The plastic could have been on the inside areas of the hat.  It keeps your head warm but it's really not attractive.  It looks like a grocery bag on my head!  I don't like it.,220643,1972

I'm not sure if the product wasn't made correctly or if I just ordered wrong, but these smalls were too constricting on my tiny frame.  They seemed like they'd have made wearing skirts brisk weather so much easier for me. The quality was nice and stretchy with a control top. Don't confuse these with leggings-- they're more like tights-- a happy medium between leggings and pantyhose. Because they didn't fit well, I can't say much more on these, besides that I wish they had fit me!",220643,3138

However, that doesn't mean they're not great glasses! The polarized, mirrored lenses keep glare at bay on the brightest of days. They're not top of the line, but they're good to toss in your car or purse! They even come with a case so you don't accidentally scratch the mirrored frames. They're light and comfortable on my ears and have adjustable nose pads. Overall, I really wish this style fit my face better, because I'd love to rock these glasses more often.",220643,7225

There's more support than other socks, but that might just be because they're thicker than other ones. One of my favorite things about these, though, is that they're colorful. So many times, socks are in muted colors. These come in pretty, bright colors! They wash fine. I put them in the dryer, even though the instructions said to air dry and they came out fine for me.

What's nice about this hat is that the netting is hidden in the top in a zipper pouch, so you can access it easily and quickly. I'm happy that they didn't choose velcro or snaps to make this work. Basically, it works like one of those bags that zips into a pouch. Super simple. It's camo in pattern with a wide brim. It will keep its shape even if tossed in a bag with little care. It's not that bad of a hat, actually, and could definitely come in handy if you want protection from the elements!",220643,742

5.0,1579456914192,Good socks,"These socks are exactly as expected. It's just like your usual ankle, shin and no show socks. You get 1 pair of each color and style. They're thin so they won't keep your feet warm without having well insulated boots on. Other than that they seem durable.",229422,52725
5.0,1576638149880,Cute and quality socks,These gripped socks are good quality. Initially when I removed them from the package I thought they looked huge. I chose size 1-3 years old and my daughter is 13 months. I tried it on and it fit without about a half inch of space left. I don't mind because the socks will still fit as she grows. Also the socks are thick which is great for the winter months and walking on the cold daycare floors.,229422,2503
4.0,1573920414293,Awesome tights!,"These tights are slightly thicker than stockings but made of the same material. They are snug fitting so it was a bit challenging getting them on but once I had them on it fit great. I'm 5'7"" and about 200lbs and the XL fit perfectly. They really do provide tummy control. As a postpartum mom with limited time to workout this feature is definitely appreciated. These tights aren't like your typical lazy wear around the house tights. These would work perfect for wearing under a dress to a club, church, work or anywhere that you need to look more dressy.",229422,6316
5.0,1567882850418,Compact but spacious bag!,"This is definitely my new go to purse! It's made of leather and suede. It looks compact but it can hold a lot. Inside, I have my bulky wallet, crossword puzzle book, small notebook, two tablets, a comb, a compact mirror, lent roller, breast pads and pad pouch but there's still room to fit things on top. There's an inner zipper pocket which has my headphones, extra scrunchies, hair pins and a miniature sowing kit. The two inner pouches are filled with sanitizer, lotion, lip gloss, cotton swab travel pack and a mini notepad. It also comes with a front pouch which holds my vitamin pack, gum, more scrunchies, pens and hair pins. I say all this to show just how much the bag can fit. I'll see how well the straps can hold all of this over time. I do find the zipper to be a bit difficult to close (even before I packed the purse with my items) because the zipper descends like a roller coaster, but I greased it up zipped and unzipped it a few times and it seems to get easier each time. The strap of the bag is adjustable so you can shorten it to make it a hand bag or lengthen it to make it a shoulder bag. With everything that I packed the bag with the strap dug into my shoulder due to how heavy it was. I recommend packing less items if you're going to use it as a shoulder bag. Overall, it's a simple yet stylish bag. I find the bag to be versatile. You can wear it to work, a meeting, cocktail party and church. It's an everyday and everywhere type of bag. This is definitely good for the ladies who like to be prepared.<br />You even get a free clear drawstring backpack.",229422,6984
4.0,1561327961483,Worth it,Love the hats but I think they run big. The size is for 6-12 and my daughter is 7 months but the hat's are slightly big. The blue hat is made of a softer jean material and has straps with velcro at the end. Being that it's slightly big I'm tying the strings until it becomes more fitted. The white hat probably won't fit my daughter until she's about 10 months. They're very cute though. I will update when she's uses them outdoors. Also the white hat doesn't have much of a shape.,229422,4679

4.0,1581029476407,No need to suck in your stomach,"If you have a belly, this is an ideal swim top. It WILL hide your belly. The layers are flowy and tend to take your eyes away from the midsection. It will not hug your belly. I buy tankinis all the time - nothing worse than a tight top. Also, the layers go all around your back - so this isn't one of those 'only looks flattering in the front' type tops. This is loose where it should be. It has adjustable straps, I just wish they were thick - maybe thick black straps for a contrast. There's no underwire, which I miss. The bra shelf has really thin removable pads. Considering that there's no underwire, I would think firm cups would be ideal, because for me, it sort of flattens my chest. And I'm small-chested as is, so I don't need that. But, I have to give it credit for the fact that it comes up high under my arms - other are too short & this creates that ugly under-arm fat. Also, it's longer than most tops and it has a pretty pointed hem. Now that I think about it, it's the only bathing suit I have that doesn't require I suck in my belly.

The material is thick enough so I think they’ll last quite a while, but thin enough that I can wear them with my tennis shoes when I’m on my way to somewhere else.<br /><br />This is my first experience with yoga socks.  Although I have some hospital socks that have grips on the bottom…these socks *really* grip.  I wear socks around the house a lot because I have cold feet.  But I gotta tell you that the first time I walked onto the tile kitchen floor with these on I almost face planted…because I stopped.  Boom.<br /><br />This is a three pack with 3 different color patterns.  Not very feminine choices in the pack that I received, but hey if they’re good socks I don’t care.<br /><br />The size is a good fit for me.  I am a size 8.5 and they’re not too tight…but they are snug.  Make sure that you don’t get them too loose or they’re not going to grip when you need them to.  They say they’ll fit up to a size 9 and I think they probably would.<br /><br />The price also feels like a good value to me for what you get…3 pairs of very nice socks with good grip.  So big yes on these.",252675,11139

Usually, anywhere from 6 to 8 miles a day.  And I know first hand how critically important it is to have on a decent pair of socks … they have to be think enough to provide good cushion, they have to be smooth and comfortable to wear, they have to fit well and they have to keep your feet both cool and dry.<br /><br />A 7 plus miles walk earlier today showed that the ‘Forcool Merino Wool Socks’ come out with marks in every one of those categories.<br /><br />After the end of my walk, my feet felt fine.  No hotspots, no spots where blisters might form … both feet were both cool and comfortable.  Very nice.<br /><br />I normally wear around a size 7 in shoes and the size medium socks I received are a perfect fit.  It is so nice to be able to wear a pair of socks that actually fit correctly and not have to settle for a sock that will fit anywhere from a size 6 to a size 12.  Kudos to Forcool for not putting out a ‘one-size-fits-all’ type sock since those type socks never fit anyone really well.<br /><br />There are numerous spots on the socks (highlighted in orange circles on the pair I have) where extra cushion has been added to the socks.  The areas include the skin, above the heel and on the bottom of the sock on the bottom of the foot and near the arch of the foot.  This extra cushion, especially in those areas where your socks will really press against your shoes/boots, is a really nice extra to have in order to ensure the socks are comfortable to wear.<br /><br />These socks come up almost to my knees but, of course, depending on your legs they might not come up as high but they should, at least come up to your mid-calf if not higher.  They are the just-right tightness around my calves so they stay firmly in place without being so tight they are uncomfortable.<br /><br />The ‘Forcool’ socks are thick; easily thicker than dress socks and thicker that most other walking socks on the market.  No need to double-up with these socks.  They might not be quite as thick as some higher-end hiking socks I’ve used in the past but they are more than thick enough to be comfortable.<br /><br />Bottom line …. These are really nice socks that are worth your consideration.",252675,9470
4.0,1577821373213,"The ‘just-right’ mixture of silk and cotton produces a smooth, relaxed Polo shirt for everyday use.","Review of:  Havana Breeze Men's Regular-fit Silk Cotton Polo Shirt, Mocha M<br /><br />With a cut that is perfectly loose fitting and ‘classy’ enough to be worn untucked, a fabric that is as smooth, comfortable and lightweight, this Havana Breeze Regular-fit Silk/Cotton Polo Shirt will quickly become, as it has for me, your ‘go-to’ Polo shirt for everyday wear.<br /><br />My first impression upon opening the package was how soft and ‘silk-like’ the material was.  It simply has a nice ‘feel’ to it … soft and comfortable.<br /><br />The second impression was how nice it looked.  The horizontal weaving of the fabric adds some great looking texture and interest to the shirt that may ‘flat-looking’ shirts don’t have.  The extra ‘fancy’ stitching found around the shirt’s collar and sleeves is a very nice touch that adds a bit of class, a bit of extra detail to the shirt.  The squared off bottom of the shirt makes this Polo shirt one that you can wear tucked in or untucked and look good either way.<br /><br />The third impression was after trying it on; the fit, I found, was just right.  For a Polo shirt, especially one that will be worn quite a bit in the warmer months, I prefer a looser fit.  A fit that isn’t constricting at all, a fit that doesn’t ‘get in the way’ when moving around.  That’s what the Havana Breeze shirt was designed to give and that is what it delivers.  If you are looking for a tighter fitting Polo shirt you would most likely want to order one size down.  I’ve included a couple of pictures that show the shirt, a size Medium, up against a yard-stick to give you an idea of size.<br /><br />Finally, the Havana Breeze Polo shirt is machine washable.  Cold water and a delicate cycle got the job done for me.  It did need ironing, on a cotton setting, to take out the wrinkles to the point where it didn’t look slightly crumbled but that didn’t take a long time to do.  Still, I had hoped to be able to wash-and-wear without the extra effort; I may try hand washing next time.<br /><br />As of the time I write the review (late December 2019) I don’t see a price listed on the product page so I can’t comment on that but I can say that, if the price range is acceptable to you when it comes out, then you should most certainly keep this shirt on you wish list.",252675,230319

4.0,1575429081551,"good quality, but order a couple sizes up","One star removed for sizing. Based on the sizing chart I should be a size XL, but I ordered 2XL because I tend to prefer a less tight fit to my tights. It is a good thing I sized myself up, because the 2XL was quite tight. I don't think anyone any larger than me would be likely to be able to get these on. I am 5'5"" with hips somewhere around 30"" ish. Aside from that, they are labelled as 40 denier, but feel like higher quality than that. The toe seam is a little uncomfortable and slides around a bit because the toe is not shaped at all - just like someone sewed a straight line across the bottom. There is way to identify the front from the back. They don't seem to get runs overly easily, so on that front I am pleased. I would definitely order a couple sizes up, but with the current list price I can definitely recommend these.",259476,9702
4.0,1572454144588,great tights,"So my first impression was a bit of disappointment because the size guide on the packaging is not identical to the one available here on Amazon. The S/M is for people just a bit shorter or lighter than I am based on the guide on the packaging vs my being within the sizing guide available online. The first pair I put on and was actually able to wear as tights, but considering how much I had to stretch them, opted to wear as leggings to preserve their life. They are quite comfortable and thick enough that I am afraid of getting runs just by looking at them wrong. The second pair though I didn't even bother trying to wear as tights (so they were not overly stretched) and yet by lunch time they were already developing holes at the seams, so there might be a mild quality control issue with this brand. Aside from that, these are a lot nicer than the cheap tights I've used in the past, but are maybe just a bit lower quality than the $50 tights I used to wear. I really like the convertible feature - besides allowing me to wear them despite buying the wrong size, it is also really nice to have some grips on slippery floors. The opening did sit in just the right spot on my foot so it would not be noticeable even with the most minimalist shoes yet is large enough to be useful when barefoot. The toes section easily becomes legging cuffs.",259476,9482
5.0,1558991407011,high quality umbrella,"This might be the umbrella that keeps me from killing multiple umbrellas every year. It is ever so slightly larger than other compact umbrellas, but not enough to be bothersome. In exchange though, you get an umbrella that seems to be far more durable and wind resistant than any other compact umbrella and even some golf umbrellas I've used in the past. It opens and closes with a convenient button. I would probably not recommend this umbrella for a smaller kid just because the mechanism is pretty powerful and a finger or face in the wrong spot could be catastrophic, but for an adult it is great. The day it came it was pouring and windy and the umbrella stood up to the job well without bending or flipping. The handle is also pretty comfortable. I am hopeful it will last a long time.",259476,773
4.0,1558397948950,Wonderful casual blazer,"The fact that I would even use wonderful to describe a blazer is saying something. Blazers are something I tend to only wear for interview and professional meeting situations. I ordered this at the same time as a 3/4 length sleeve blazer from the same brand, and when that one came first I was dreading getting this one in the mail because that one me and a few friends could share it because it was so wide. This one, on the other hand, was pretty darn close to a perfect fit. It is lined and actually reasonable comfortable, and it has real pockets. The outer fabric is not super refined which makes it look more casual, so I probably wouldn't wear it for an interview, but I wore it over a dress to go grocery shopping and it felt good. I think it will be good to dress a little nicer on travel days, or to wad up in the bottom of a bag for an emergency wardrobe change. The fabric does seem to be very forgiving in the wrinkle-potential arena.",259476,6991
3.0,1558185241035,"VERY wide, but length right and button detail is cute","At the point at which I ordered this item, the smallest size offered was medium, which I selected because I was fairly certain I was not L or XL. Looking at the measurements for a medium I am on the line between medium and small, so a medium should have been at least close to fitting, but if I’d known a small was going to be added to the offerings I would have waited to get a small even if it potentially meant the price would go up. The sleeve length and width is great, and the overall length is perfect, but the overall width could fit me and a couple friends, and cannot be mitigated by buttoning up as the buttons are solely for show. I was also disappointed because I expected more of a sweater-like feel to the fabric, but it definitely feels like a casual suit jacket. As this is a 100% polyester item, I suspect that despite the directions saying to wash in cold water that warm water washing will not shrink it much if at all. If I find this assumption is wrong and washing does modify the garment I will update this review, but I do not have high expectations at this point.",259476,4669

The seller clearly lists and shows the size of the stones.  There are a variety of purposes listed by the seller, however, I do have an issue with two of their suggestions.  First, they state that the stones could be used as a paperweight.  If you use more than one stone, then yes they could be paperweights, but just one stone would be too light.

However the only flaw is that this may not be the best option for small busted woman due to the pads which appear way too big & round giving you a bit of an exaggerated chest. When I first put it on, I found myself constantly gripping my chest in awe of how it felt to have a bigger chest than I actually had. While it was fun for a few moments, when reality set in, it just didn't feel natural. However after washing it a few times & letting it get a bit used more, the larger bust became more tolerable.

Be sure to know that Havana Breeze makes very roomy shirts, so if you like a fitter style, this probably isn't the brand unless you size down, but even then the style & fabric just isn't made to conform to the body. This Havana Breeze polo shirt was no exception when it comes to the quality we've come to expect, shirt has immaculate stitchings, no loose threads, and great material of 80% silk and 20% cotton. The buttons are what stands out on this beautiful ivory creamed colored polo. The buttons just look so elegant with the faux wood style. We also love the ribbed texture of this polo, it just oozes class. You are sure to dress to impress when wearing this polo but it's versatile as well because it will look great dressed up or down. I highly recommend this polo shirt, my husband always looks dapper wearing it.",294658,9481
5.0,1576074994812,Masculine design even with the pink.,"I'm quite a fan of the Awesome 360 brand, their clothing items are always hip, great quality & offer so many fun styles. These men's swim trunks were no different than the quality I've come to expect with the brand.<br /><br />Right away you can tell it's well made, tight stitchings, no loose threads, waistband offers a relaxed elastic. There's a bright white mesh undergarment attached to the interior of the shorts as well as the two front pockets. There are no back pockets which makes these shorts mainly functional for swimwear. Had it added back pockets one would be able to add these to their casual wear. Sometimes after swimming guys can throw on a t shirt and head to the hot dog stand, bar, or run errands with their swim trunks if they have enough pockets. These don't appear as versatile, but one could still try if they carried a minimalist front pocket wallet as these are very lightweight and dry quickly.<br /><br />I love that the drawstrings are patterned to blend in. It goes without saying my hubby loves his swim trunks, he says they're roomy, very comfortable and are the perfect length arriving just above the knee.<br /><br />Both the colors and designs all mesh well together making these an attractive pair of shorts to wear. Don't be put off by the pink in these shorts, the design and color choices still make these masculine in style. We would definitely recommend these shorts",294658,4620
3.0,1574646041149,Too loose for the style.,"My husband despises tight clothing especially underwear so when I was offered to try out an XXXL size of Awesome 360 briefs, I was definitely in over my head thinking they will be just the right amount of baggy for him to feel more like boxer shorts. Boy was I wrong, they're just way too big for his size 36 waist. We love the Awesome 360 brand as most of their clothing items are of great quality. These just didn't seem on par with the usual quality of this brand. Perhaps maybe it was just the sizing that is making them look this way but they appear way too loose for the style they are. I was expecting more tightness and support so that when you size up it's just larger but has some tightness. These will fall off of you if they're not sized correctly. Fabric is thin, loose, lightweight but breathable. Elastic band is the correct size of thickness. The crotch lining is massive. Overall if you like a looser fitting briefs these are fine, but if you like more support and a conformed fit, bypass.",294658,919

The scarf is seriously that heavenly soft, the description definitely wasn’t lying this time in its claims of being one of the softest scarfs. I love the design as well, it’s reversible too! The front is all plaid with a beautiful black intricate border design and the other side is all black with the same intricate gorgeous border only in plaid this time! How cool is that? The ends have fringes, it’s very long & wide so you can wrap yourself up a few times or wear it as a snood aka scarf hoodie.

4.0,1572209066272,"Good back up choice, not great as a daily user.","The Konikit Carbon Fiber money clip wallet looks really modern & attractive in person, but it’s functionality is not what one would use as a daily wallet. This wallet is very small, has the minimalist concept down well but is hard plated so wouldn’t feel good in back of a pants pocket. It would be good as an extra wallet when one plans to head out on an e-scooter, bike, take a jog, go hiking, sightseeing or anywhere you’d want to lessen your load. However for everyday use such as work, meetings, functions, or errands, this wouldn’t be our first choice. Wallet appears durable on the outside, the carbon fiber is sharp and sleek looking, the money clip is solid metal, however the elastic bands are cloth. The description states they can last for up to 100,000 openings, that’s quite a lot of opening and closing before needing a new one, so that makes it worth it for a backup wallet as it could last you a lifetime. I like the thumb curved area to pull your cards out, it’s a neat feature. I’m not sure why the description mentions a zipper, I don’t see one. Overall, for the price point, it’s reasonable but there are just many other better choices out there. The only great thing about this wallet is the aesthetics really. I would recommend it for backup use mainly, not as a daily wallet.",294658,6977
4.0,1569998877805,Attractive vivid red & black colors.,"Janmid men’s long sleeve flannel shirt appears to be well made with surprisingly great quality & stitching for it’s price point. A lot of flannels tend to have horrible stitching, loose threads & weak buttons. This flannel was made with attention to detail. The corduroy accents are a nice touch, but the color clashes a bit with the dark black & vivid red. I assumed the color choice was so that this flannel can compliment jeans well, however in today’s modern times, jeans aren’t worn as much as they used to be. A neutral black or tan would’ve been a better choice in my opinion. The outside of this flannel is remarkably soft, but the softness isn’t matched with the insides which is real bummer because the outside is the kind of soft you’d want on your skin. It’s almost like a teddy bear softness. My husband wears this with a shirt underneath which makes the slightly rough insides more doable. I presume with a few more washes, it will soften up. With that being said, I would recommend it for it’s current price of under $20.",294658,472
3.0,1569507408203,Design flaw.,"Gladdon Moda crossbody bag is an quite unique and a fun style bag, however there’s a significant design flaw. The bag has a buckle that goes across the middle with no zipper, so things can fall out easily from the sides. It comes with an all black woven change purse for a little privacy, but if the bag falls at just the right angle this change purse can also fall out as it doesn’t take much force to pull it out. Which brings me to another point, this is a pick pocketer’s dream as there is nothing stopping anyone from walking behind you and just pulling out your wallet. I think if the designers wanted an open design as possible, they might should of just added one more buckle on the side so that the change purse cannot fall out plus giving the bag a little bit more of a barrier from sticky fingers. Besides the design flaw, the idea is neat, gives the bag a fun vibe yet still nice enough for evening outings. I like the tinted view on both sides. It appears well made and quite durable. The bag is still functional, one would just need to be a bit careful with it.",294658,82023

It’s versatile and whichever mood you’re in for, bun or not you can wear it accordingly. I’m actually surprised by the quality, I really didn’t expect much quality-wise, but it’s made well and appears durable. The material is so soft and the inner fleece lining keeps your ears cozy.

4.0,1566244390185,Not as free flowing as I thought.,"When I first ordered this swimsuit cover from Wild Hazel, I thought it would be free flowing underneath with nothing restricting in the way.  However when I recieved it and put it on, I noticed that there's an extra stitching going downwards from armpit to hip. This makes me believe that if a larger woman were to put this on it would not fit at all.  This is a bit misleading as the photo and description don't mention nor make it clear about the extra stitching underneath. While it fits, it's not comfortable due to this restrictive stitching. Material appears adequate nothing high quality nor too flimsy,  just adequate.  Style is based on personal taste, it has bright tassels on an all white ensemble.  My aunt enjoys loud clothing so I thought this style would suit her but instead my mom ended up liking it more.  She is always on the beach anyways as a Florida resident so she got more use out of it.  She doesn't mind the restrictive stitching as she enjoys a tighter fit. I guess everyone is truly different in terms of likes and dislikes.  I like more free-flowing items where as my mom doesn't.  So my mom gives it 5 stars, I give it 4. We settled on 4 1/2 stars.",294658,4637

The colors and pattern are cool and make the socks fun. The material is also nice. It’s a soft and smooth cotton feel. They are super tight and stretchy at the same time.

3.0,1639488311103,"Comfortable, I Like The Material, Quality Seems Fine- I Just Don't Like The Look/Style On Me","This Moyabo Women's Summer Casual Ruched T Shirt Dress is pretty nice overall. I will say that I don’t think it will be flattering on every body type. I ordered a large and a medium or large would be my correct size at this point. I really just need to get in better shape period, but I’m not a fan of how it looks on me. Is it comfortable? Absolutely. The material is soft, smooth, stretchy, appropriately thick and doesn’t seem like it is overly fragile. I think it will hold up well in the wash, though I would still wash on a gentle setting and hang to dry.<br /><br />I personally feel like the neckline is a little too high on me. You can try to adjust it and open up the buttons as needed which helps a little. The sleeves come down about halfway between my shoulders and elbows. The ruched look is interesting but makes me feel like I constantly need to adjust it to get it to look right and that really doesn’t matter because it will just change with movement anyway. It is interesting that the bottom is different lengths in the front. It has a kind of upside down ‘V’ shape in the front and is a little longer and straight in the back. I think it would look more flattering on me when I get in better shape.<br /><br />The website says the materials are “35% Rayon + 60% Polyester + 5% Spandex” but none of the tags on the actual dress actually specified materials. It is made in China.<br /><br />Overall, the quality seems pretty good. I like the fabric and didn’t notice any issues with the stitching. If you have the perfect body, I’m sure you’ll look pretty good in it, but for me, this ruched look isn’t the best. It just looks a bit frumpy on me but would be very comfortable to wear around the house for sure!",304993,5014

These shorts are both functional and flattering. I wasn’t sure if I would like this length on me, but I do. It is far better than them being too short and having your bottom literally coming out.<br /><br />I have tried multiple items from the Ocean Blues brand and have liked everything. I’m very happy with the quality.<br /><br />Anyway, I’ll be sure to update my review if any issues arise with regular use and washing.

It isn’t really something I care for much.<br /><br />For reference, I have 5’6”, about 145 lbs right now, wear size 6-8 pants and ordered a size large which is comfortable.<br /><br />-Black medium thickness fabric (towards the thinner side)<br />-Fabric is pretty soft and also stretchy<br />-Comfortable fit-somewhat form fitting around my bottom, but not completely skin tight, relaxed semi-loose fit elsewhere.<br />-The cuffs comes down a bit below mid-calf for me. They don’t appear to be very fitted unless I slide them up a bit.<br />-High waisted with elastic band at waist<br />-Fabric tie that goes through belt loops around your waist<br />-Fabric doesn’t seem that high quality. It feels like something I would only wear around the house, yet the tie suggests to me that it is meant to be worn out.<br />-I have only worn around the house to test without even washing yet, and the fabric has already started pilling a little bit. It isn’t excessive yet, but I have another pair of pants with similar fabric from this same brand and it pilled so excessively<br /><br />Overall, I like these for comfy pants to wear around the house, but I wouldn’t wear them out. They seem like lounge pants only. The tie around the waist and belt loops is unnecessary to me. I think the company should rethink this fabric due to the pilling that I have experienced with another pair of their pants and now these. This fabric just doesn’t look like something to wear out.<br /><br />These also aren’t my favorite lounge pants by them. I have two other jogger style lounge pants by this brand that I really like. They both use a similar fabric that is so soft and different form this fabric. Interestingly enough, those pants are both smalls and one is very fitted but completely comfortable and the other feels slightly tight around the waist band.<br /><br />Overall, I don’t hate these pants, but I don’t love them either.

5.0,1608128449866,Awesome Compressive Leggings- High Quality,"I’m very pleased with these Ocean Blues high waisted tummy control leggings.<br /><br />I ordered in medium black which I love. I’m 5’6” and currently about 145lbs. I would say they are a little snug, but feel more purposefully compressive rather than uncomfortably tight. If you are about my size and don’t want it to feel too compressive, then I think you would be very happy with a large.<br /><br />Overall, these fit great. They are super smooth, comfy, and stretchy. They are appropriately thick so that they have been squat-proof and I haven’t had an issue with panty lines (of course it may depend on what type you wear and how thick). They are very breathable as well. They are form fitting, flattering, and high waisted. There are pockets on each front size that you could put your phone in.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these if you like the way I have described them. They look high-quality and just as advertised, have held up in the wash, and I’m very happy to have them. I would gladly lounge in these, work out, or do anything in them.

3.0,1606052469105,"Love The Fabric, NOT The Fit. Too Bulky And Huge!","Looking back, I’m not sure what I was thinking ordering this oversized cropped casual hoodie by Siva. It isn’t what I was expecting and it might be one of the strangest clothing items I have stumbled upon. Before I go into further detail, I just wanted to say that I have a dress by this company that I really really like. I’m very confident that there are many items from this brand that I would love- unfortunately, this just wasn’t one of them.<br /><br />Next, I have no problem with the fabrics used. I like the light grey color. It is soft particularly on the inside, stretchy-comfortable. It is thin enough to be airy and flowy which I like. I can definitely tell I would have loved this if the whole cut/design/shape was just changed completely.<br /><br />Alright, so the part I don’t like- the way it fits/looks. I’m not really into crop tops, but I figured this could be nice to lounge in with a tank top underneath or something, but it still looks and feels way too strange because of how huge it is. The length of the arms is insane- I get that you are supposed to pull it up and it would have an oversized look, but it is too much. I would say it probably goes past my fingertips by 5-6 inches. Also, the arms are incredibly wide- so wide that with the hoodie being cropped it nearly creates a square shape when you hold your arms out to the side. It just isn’t flattering in any way- at least not on me. I saw another reviewer say something similar to this- it is like they made an XXXX-Large hoodie and then cropped it just below the arms.<br /><br />Would I wear this in public? Never.<br />Would I wear this around the house with people around? No.<br />Would I wear it around the house when I’m alone? It is looking like a no. It just feels really strange wearing something like this.<br /><br />A normal hoodie with this fabric would have probably gotten a 4-5 star review from me. A cropped hoodie that was not so incredibly huge everywhere also could have possibly gotten a favorable review.<br /><br />The fabric, I give a 5 because it is comfortable and breathable. I would give a 1-2 star rating based on design/shape/fit. To be fair, I will give a 3 star rating because it seems well made when it comes to stitching and materials. Perhaps this style just doesn’t suit me. I’m not sure what I will do with this hoodie now as it is basically unwearable for me.<br /><br />Anyway, I’ll be sure to update this review if I somehow find a way to wear it or use it. I can’t really recommend this based on my experience, but some people may actually like it. Like I stated before, please don’t avoid ordering from this company just because of this item, especially considering I have a dress from them that is awesome!<br /><br />For reference, I am 5’6” and about 145lbs. I usually wear size 6-8 pants. The tag says medium/large. I felt like I was drowning in this hoodie and yet very exposed at the same time.<br /><br />I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know-thanks!",304993,7140
5.0,1606050034251,"Soft, Stretchy, Flowy, Flattering, Nice Lace Up Neckline","I’ll admit, I’m not big into dresses. I like them, but I almost never wear them in public. I don’t like to stand out. This one caught my eye though, because it is cute, casual, comfy, but the lace up A-line neck makes it different and adds interest.<br />You can adjust the strings to be more modest or show a little skin. The arm holes are purposefully a little large- just the style of the dress. It gives a little bit of shape, but is not form-fitting- it is loose and flowy in a flattering way. The length is appropriate-not too short or long. I actually like the fabric a lot. First, I love this shade of grey. Second, I think it is soft, stretchy, and thick enough- I had no issues with anything showing through underneath. Everything seems well-made. The stitching looks fine.<br /><br />If I can’t gather up the courage to wear this dress out, then I can definitely lounge around in this. I think it would even look good with leggings if you wanted. I think it would even look cute as a beach cover up, especially if you open up the neck line more.<br /><br />The only issue I can think of is that you would need to pick out a specific bra that won’t show, but that isn’t a big deal. Also, I can’t tell you how this holds up with regular washing yet. The tag says to hand wash in cold water and hang to dry. I would just treat this as a delicate item and wash using a gentle cycle with cold water. I will either hang this to dry or put it on a low heat setting for a little while prior to hanging.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5’6” and currently about 145lbs wearing size 6-8 pants. I ordered the medium and I think it fits the way it should. I think a small would fit me well too, just be more form fitting.<br /><br />Overall, I’m definitely happy with this dress, and would recommend it.

5.0,1636585162008,"Quality low cut compression socks. Good fit, good compression.","Despite the strange sizing information, provided in a graphic in the product details, these compression socks fit.  I wear a US mens 8.5 size.  The foot measures 9.5 inches in length.  So, both fall into the sizing for L/XL, according to their sizing chart.  The chart indicates L/XL fits US mens shoe size 8 inches - 14 inches. Not sure if actually meant inches or shoe sizes 8 - 14.  Fortunately, my feet would qualify either way for the L/XL size.<br />The sock offers adequate compression for targeted areas.  The sock did have to stretch slightly to fit, which I expected from a compression sock. If you have longer feet, higher shoe size, they'll probably stretch more. This might cause more compression.  In my case, it seems perfect.<br />How do they feel? Well, to be honest, I'm not accustomed to wearing low rise socks.  Most of my socks are mid-calf or higher.  But, they do feel like quality socks.  Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.  I provide photos showing ruler measurements of different aspects of a sock.<br />Overall, I do like these compression socks.  I'm happy with the quality and fit.

She said the quartz and amethyst were a bit small, but still attractive.  She gave high marks to the four pendants. Her favorite is the amethyst pendant, with the color gradations.<br />I am disappointed that there were no included necklaces. They are shown in the product details pictures, giving the impression that they are a part of the product offering.  The text only mentions pendants, though.  I think it's a bit confusing, on the verge of misleading. I do think it merits a slight ding to the rating.<br />I thought the amethyst cluster was on the thinner side, considerably different than the product details pictures.  But, i know that the stones/crystals are all subject to the vagaries of nature.<br />Included is a brief guide to cyrstals/stones, which is a nice touch.

So, it was a wise choice, a perfect fit, in terms of foot size, length and compression. They fit with a perfect amount of compression, not too tight, and certainly not loose. The top of the socks end over the calf, just below the knees.<br />The graphic element is fantastic, I feel like my legs looks like they're wearing a superhero costume. haha. And with the compression, this may be true. Now, I'm not going to exaggerate and say the socks turned around my life. However, as I mentioned, the fit is very snug, affording a uniform degree of compression while not feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.<br />Inspection of the socks found no defects, no flaws, no bad/errant stitching. The socks are very well made. The fit and appearance are top notch. I'm glad to wear them, and to show them off.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br />These compression socks earn a solid 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",305094,562

The earrings are nicely designed and appear to have good quality construction. The titanium steel has a nice sulvery lustre. The weight is lighter than it would seem visually, which is a good thing. The hinge and locking mechanism work well.<br />While the title states that these are Men's stud earrings, I consider them to be unisex, usable by any gender. In fact, I do not have pierced ears. The significant other gleefully accepted them, and said they were cute, would be fun to wear casually, to meet her girlfriends...shop, eat..... She said the 'post' was unusual and took a bit of maneuvering to put it in and out. But, that it was worth it.<br />An interesting design, well crafted. Inspection found no flaws or defects. I imagine over repeated use, the hinge won't be as tight, but that's true of most hinges.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference. While they have a 'tough intention' it is an eye catching and attractive piece of casual wear jewelry. As such, it garners a 3.5 - 3.75 star rating, with a moderately high level recommendation.",305094,65563
4.0,1597025398770,"Nice, attractive gold and white earrings. Needs better backing clasp.","These earrings pretty much match the descriptions and depictions in the product details. But, i think it needs to be stressed that they have a white coating on the outer side, with gold borders, and totally gold tone on the inner side. One could easily misjudge the pictures into thinking it's the lighting causing the white aspects on the earrings. And, it is vaguely mentioned, and somewhat mysteriously described as 'white links'.  Anyway, besides the odd wording, the earrings are visually appealing.<br />Where it lacks is the backing clasp. A decent clasp would have made these earrings a more elegant and definitely higher grade. They include a gift inside the box: a rather simple corded bracelet with 'pearl' attachments. It's cute, but instead of that gift, appropriate clasps would have been wiser. My personal opinion.<br />The earrings are a nice size, not too small, nor oversized. They are visually attractive, bordering on elegant. They are versatile enough to be suitable for casual and nicer situations.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference. Provided rotation views of the earrings to give a full rendering, with close-ups of important details.<br />The earrings have a pleasant design, and are well crafted.

They have a large mesh surface on one side of the cube, which allows ventilation and adequate visibility to identify the contents. The access to the interior of the cube/bag is via 2 zipper pulls, which is a great design. In fact, the overall design of the packing cubes is well considered and this carries over into the materials and construction of the product.<br />There is also a quality zipper and pull that allow the cube to expand, to accommodate additional packing space. This feature increases the versatility and utility of the cubes.<br />Speaking of increased utility, the cubes have sufficiently sturdy handles. This is why this review sometimes adds 'bag' to this product. You can easily see the added functionality of have a packing cube, with handles that enables it to also serve as an additional bag. With the mesh side, this could easily be used during a weekend trip as a quick hamper, hanging off a door knob. Haha, I just thought of that while writing. Anyway, you get the idea.<br />My initial examination of the set discovered no defects, flaws or errant stitching/construction. Rather, I find the overall manufacture and design to be top notch. Receiving a large and medium set will afford ample storage capacity, especially if used to organize and separate items in luggage.<br />I'm impressed with the quality and possibilities of this set of packing cubes/bags.

The chain is thin, giving the choker/necklace a delicate appearance, which complements the small circular pendants. This can be considered a dainty, elegant neckwear...not a large gaudy piece.<br />Overall, for the cost, this is a very attractive and appealing necklace.

3.0,1579710891712,"Add little bounce, mediocre cushion.","Years ago, I owned some cross trainer sneakers that had blue gel-like cushions that purported to add spring during activities. It was minimal, but I did feel that it added to comfort and some 'bounce back' when running or playing sports. I mention this because these inserts have a similar feature embedded into their shoe insert. The blue area (round on top and rectangular on bottom of sole insert) is this specific feature. Today's walk, I cannot say if it was totally effective, but if it's anywhere close to those sneakers, the added bounce will be appreciated.<br />The insert has a guide that allow you to cut them to custom fit. I would advise cutting larger than expected, and then trim accordingly. This takes a little more time, but better to take time, and gradually fit them to your shoe/foot, than to discover you cut them too short.<br />These inserts seem to be of average thickness and stiffer than your run of the mill shoe insert cushion. The thought behind this is that bounce back aspect. The gray areas of the insert is to provide some cushioning, but also rebounds as you step into it during activity. The blue area having more of the squishy rebound effect. So, if you are looking for a soft cushion to allow you walk on clouds, this is not the insert you seek.<br />This insert does not have any arch support. I think arch support is the leading contributor to foot fatigue. So, the absence of any support is disappointing. But, based on the product details, this feature was not expected.<br />Overall, it is a decent shoe insert, with ""Bounce"" technology as it's differentiating feature.<br />Photos are provided to give some real world images of the inserts, the sizing guides and the blue bounce ares.<br />I give this product a medium level of recommendation.",305094,7040

Shipped inside a taped up zip lock bag, an oversized drawstring fabric bag contains a nice thick, soft plastic box. The choker necklace is inside a plastic bag, and well protected inside the plastic box. You get the sense that the company cares about the safety and presentation quality associated with their product. I like that.<br />The choker is nicely designed and very eye catching. The one element that I would change involves the manner to attaching the chain ends of the choker. There is a simple hook that you affix to the counter chain links. While it works and is effective, I would have preferred something akin to a spring loop that would secure the connection. This is the only 'flaw' that I could detect, and dinged it one star for that reason.<br />Otherwise, the necklace is stylish and attractive, with a functional, sensible packaging that protects and showcases the choker.<br />Attached is a series of photos showing the unboxing, and different aspects of the choker.

The earrings themselves come attached to a cardboard, and inside a plastic zip lock bag (which serves to nicely protect the jewelry during transport).  You could attach the earrings to the black insert, to highlight the earrings, or leave them on the cardboard. Personally, I liked it on the cardboard, with the dangling part of the earrings spaced apart. These are not haute couture jewelry, but attractive and well made.  Probably suited for a variety of situations, depending more upon the personality of the wearer.<br />Attached are photos to show real world imagery, with a ruler for size reference.<br />These would make a nice gift for an age range of teen to adult, in my opinion.<br />Based on accuracy of description, and the quality and design...I'd easily recommend these earrings.",305094,895
4.0,1563809436782,Just in time for summer heat and mosquitos,"Due to increased rainfall, the mosquito problem has gone from very bad to barely tolerable. As such, wanted something that would protect me from insect bites while mowing the lawn. Was using insect repellent, but had concerns about applying smelly chemicals to my skin. Also, wanted the advantages of uv protection.<br />This hat more than adequately addresses both concerns. One of the nice features is the 'netting' is contained on top of the hat, hidden inside a zippered compartment. So, if going for a walk, and not wanting a conspicuous mesh net across your face, you can discreetly conceal it, with no noticeable affect to the hat or wearing comfort.<br />The design and construction of very good quality. I like that the sides of the hat are thin, lightweight material, and seem breathable. This allows ventilation, and minimizes buildup of heat (think of the heat generated wearing a baseball cap in summer). This is particularly important because the head generates lots of heat, and you want to exercise caution of body temperatures during summer days.<br />The brim of the hat is not hard, stiff, and doesn't seem to contain cardboard or plastic. So, tossing this into the washing machine won't deform or damage the hat. Tag states that the hat is 100% polyester.<br />So, if you need a hat that will keep you relatively cool, protect your face and neck from insect bites, and provide uv protection...this hat is an excellent choice.<br />Gets a high recommendation based on personal use.",305094,742

I live on the Southeast coast where the sun is pretty strong in the summer and this hat will be great to wear when I relax on the beach with a good book. Since the rim is pretty large, It will protect not just my head but also my face from the strong sun rays. The hat is a little bit loose on my head and it's not adjustable, but it stays on pretty well and I don't plan to do any strenuous activities while wearing it. But overall, my favorite feature of this hat is the large bow, it gives it a vintage look while looking fashionable.",310171,486
3.0,1551794072928,INTERESTING DESIGN,"This dress is very light and summery.  The material is see-through, but it has a green slip. It has an interesting design, the way it's cut, but the collar is little bit too low where sometimes, if you're wearing a bra, the straps peek through (which I'm not fond of). The length works for me since I'm only five feet tall; therefore, it's not too short. As far as the size, I really can't say if it's true to size since I was sent the wrong size.",310171,2546
4.0,1548201656747,AN ADORABLE DRESS,"This dress is so adorable, from the cheerful flowery pattern to its flowing design.

The material is see- through, but the skirt has a lining for privacy (I'm five fee tall and the lining goes down to the top of my knee) but I was surprised to see that there's no lining on the top half. The dress fits somewhat small, I normally take a size small and this dress fits me even though it's a size medium.

The Hugitout Pendent Necklace has a very nice presentation that comes in a nice little jewelry box that's in a cute pink pouch. But the necklace itself, I was a little disappointed because, it wasn't what I was expecting. The necklace is super thin, I feel too thin, which in the picture it looks a little more thicker than it really is. The pendents are very cute but if they were bigger you could appreciate it more. You may find this necklace a good size for a child/teen but it's so thin with a teen wearing this, I can see it getting accidentally snatched of their necks super easy. I can't really recommend this necklace for the price, cause of it's thinnest and it's so easy to break which is too bad cause this necklace could have good potential.",310693,8004
3.0,1577113161623,I'm kinda in the middle about this wallet,"The Konikit Carbon Fiber Money Clip Wallet allows you to carry a lot of cards but in a tight neat way vs a normal folding wallet. I wasn't able to get all my cards I had in my wallet into the Konikit Wallet but I was able to fit all the important ones.  The carbon fiber look of the Konikit give it a modern look and it's pretty lite weighted. I didn't like how hard it was to get cards out ( if you have a lot of cards ) in the wallet, plus cards like my Apple Card is getting pretty scratched up more in this wallet. I like that it has RFID Blocking Technology and the money clip is nice. I don't like the elastic bands cause I think they will stretch out of place in the long run i'm sure. I think this type of wallet is good if you are going out for the night and just want to take a couple of cards with your ID. Anything other than that it's just to much work trying to take cards out of the wallet and I feel my cards are taking damage going in and out of the wallet much more than when in a norm folding wallet. However, my pockets are not bulging and I don't have a ton of receipts in this Konikit Carbon Fiber Money Clip Wallet. I'm kinda in the middle with this wallet.",310693,6977

It's also not too dark - I could see well.  The style is not the best for my face, but I don't think it looked bad.  The glasses are relatively light weight (I usually wear frameless Maui Jim's, which weigh *nothing*), but they still left little marks on my nose.  The case is nice, with a magnetic closure.",310702,6982
4.0,1567038079844,Look good but don’t provide sun relief,"These are very stylish and wonderfully lightweight. But they provide almost no darkening - I still squint on the sun when wearing them. I’m a little afraid about how durable they are because the frames are so thin. Also, I have this problem with a lot of sunglasses that are flat (do not curve around your face) - there is a little glare/reflection is the bottom corners.

5.0,1659047676607,Love This 100% Merino Wool Pullover,"I love that this pullover hoodie is 100% Merino wool.  I'd much rather wear Merino wool than any other fabric when hiking because Merino wool works well at both warming and cooling which is an issue when walking 4 miles or so at a time.  This pullover feels lightweight.  The sleeves are a bit long on me for they come down to about the middle of my hands but it's easy to simply push them up.  There is a front pocket that's rather like a shirt pocket that's over one side of the bust area.  My rating is 5 stars for a quality pullover that can be layered or worn alone.  Although it's not thick enough for the chilliest weather, I think it's perfect for those days that start chilly and end up warm.",310732,6890
2.0,1594400613834,Nice Colors and Attractive but I'm Unable to Fasten Behind My Neck,"I think this would be a really attractive necklace if I could fasten it.  The fastener isn't easy enough to use for a single person.  Perhaps this would work better with someone available to fasten it.  I've tried putting a bigger loop on the end, but the fastener piece doesn't open enough to be able to get around that.  Even worst, if this necklace is dropped like I have done, the pieces simply slide off and then have to be reassembled.  Of course, this gives some flexibility on how the pieces are arranged.  I like that this necklace comes in a pretty sheer bag that's tinted red with gold roses and leaves decorations as well as gold around the opening and on the slender drawstrings.  My rating is 2 stars simply because I cannot fasten it.  I've been working with this for a few days and it simply shouldn't be this hard.",310732,9353
5.0,1589735916172,Love for Concerts and Travel Organization,"I really like this clear plastic bag that can be carried into a NFL stadium.  I enjoy concerts and one day I'm optimistic mass gatherings will be permitted again.  Even in smaller venues, purse checks are standard so anything that makes the process quicker and easier appeals to me.  This purse bag has an adjustable shoulder strap that can also be worn as a crossbody bag.  The contents are easily viewable.  I like that the zipper is on the top side so  that it's worn against the body to keep the contents secure.  Within the bag is a smaller zippered pocket for added organization which is about 4.25 inches deep and 6.5 inches in width.  My Android phone does not fit into that pocket, but it would be good for carrying keys.  While I'm waiting for concerts, this clear bag is also very useful for organizing items in a suitcase.  It's easy to see the contents and keeps small things together instead of getting lost the larger spaces in suitcases.  My rating is 5 stars because this is a great value for a versatile clear bag.",310732,3050
4.0,1587080508699,Love the Mesh Side for Open Air Access Although These Aren't Actually Cubes,"Unfortunately I'm not doing any traveling right now, but when I do, I'll certainly want to take at these packing cubes along.  This is a 2 piece set with the larger bag being about 13 by 14 inches and the smaller being about 10 by 14 inches.  When not in use, they lay flat.  When in use, both of these have a size zipper that when unzipped permits expansion of the cubes although they do not expand to where they are actually cubes.  What I really like about them is each has a side with a white cloth mesh so air can freely reach what's in the bags.  If one has wet or damp clothing items, these can be used without as much chance as mildewing or getting nasty.  If the items are too wet or damp to go into a suitcase, these cubes also have carrying straps for taking along separately.  I plan on doing some backpacking and camping and think the smaller of the cubes could be attached to a backpack with a carabiner and would be great for carrying clothing and items that should they need to dry out.  These are lightweight so they don't add weight by themselves.  My rating is 4 stars because I think they're great even if they do not expand to where they can accurately be described as cubes.  They are more like rectangular well-constructed bags.",310732,2627
5.0,1578276320336,Dressy Looking but Good for Long Walks Outdoors Too,"This is a nice set of 5 pairs of winter socks.  These are a Merino wool blend with a bit over half (53%) being Merino wool.  The rest of the blend is cotton (24%), polyester (16%), and spandex (7%).  These are keeping my feet warm and have a cushiness that regular socks don't have.  These are really attractive with multicolor patterns that vary by color on each pair of socks.  The dominant colors (although the colors may not be on all pairs) are brown, mustard yellow, and maroon with some white and greens.  These socks would look nice worn with slacks in an office.  Today I wore a pair while walking at a local lake on a trip to spot bald eagles so they work well for winter hikes.  They were probably too dressy for what I was doing, but these socks increased my feet's comfort.  I give them 5 stars for looks, comfort, and being a good value.",310732,8083
4.0,1577461100356,Tiny Skull Sparkles Only in Bright Light,"This is a cute, provided one thinks skulls are cute, casual woven bracelet with a small, jeweled skull.  This bracelet is adjustable by tugging and pulling the dangling loops with the gold beads to adjust for wrist size.  It's tricky, at least for me, to get the bracelet adjusted to fit so that the beaded loops are basically equal in length.  The skull is tiny, and the zirconia jewels catch the light when there's bright lighting but otherwise the effect rather subdued.  I like this for casual wear but not while I'm home.  One of my cats immediately found the dangling loops irresistible so I had to remove the bracelet and hide it for a while.  My rating is 4 stars because of the difficulty in adjusting the loops and I expected the skull to be a bit more sparkly.",310732,6900

I'm 5'3"" and about 118 pounds and the medium fits well.  These look nice on provided I wear a top that goes over my stomach but that's because of how I'm built and not the fault of the pants.  There are no pockets and I looked extensively for the one that's stated to be on the inner waist band and had no luck.  Still these are a good value and are great exercise pants.",310732,6966
5.0,1571240188088,Big Black Plaid Scarf is Very Warm - Goes Well With Almost Any Outfit,"This is an attractive acrylic scarf that emphasizes black in its big plaid print.  The weave is tight so that this scarf is warm.  It almost looks like the material is doubled over, but it's one piece with a width of just over 11 inches.  The front side has the big plaid while the back side is basic black although some of the plaid lightly shows through.  The plaid on the front includes some white and more grey and is accented with deep red, not quite maroon, lines.  The length is about 83.5 inches long so there's plenty of scarf available for wrapping as desired.  Of the length, 12 inches on on both sides ends at an angle which looks very nice.  There's a very short fringe on the borders of this scarf.  This does feel very smooth and soft.  This is a very nice scarf that goes with almost any type of coat or jacket.",310732,585
5.0,1570718518637,Warm Faux Fur Hat with Chin Strap and Flaps for Cold Weather Protection,"This is the hat I know I'll be wearing this winter when shoveling snow and taking winter walks.  It's not what I would wear for a social occasion but should the weather get into the single digits or below, you bet I'll be wearing it!  It's really warm with faux fur lined flaps that come under the chin and can be buckled.  The inner lining of the hat is quilted and even though I can't measure it, there's a thickness between the lining and the outer material used.  The faux fur looks realistic to me although it doesn't have the thickness and quite the softness of actual fur.  It's sort of like real fur in that there's some shedding going on.  There are a number of 'hairs' on the hat that come from the faux fur.  This is only noticeable up close but since these are light-colored, one may not want to wear with black clothes/coats.  There are also some faux leather accents on the sides of the hat and for the chin strap belting to fasten.  This hat is serious about cold weather head protection.  Even with the slight 'shedding', this is so warm and practical as well as different looking that I still rate at 5 stars.",310732,65499
3.0,1570200858658,"Striking Black,  White, and Gray Shirt but Fussy Cleaning Requirements","This black, gray, and white shirt looks great but doesn't have the quality I expect.  Here is what I like about this shirt: 1) the collar stands up great and looks very nice; and 2) the cuffs have a choice between two buttons for the best fit for wider or narrower wrists;  3) there's another button above the wrist so there are choices on how to button/not button the sleeves; and 4) the black and white with gray is a look I love.  Here is what I don't like about the shirt: 1) the material is thin although this is okay for summer wear; and 2) this cannot be dried in a clothes dryer which is much to fussy for my taste for a man's shirt.  This shirt can be dried clean so for those who don't mind going to the cleaners, this isn't a problem.",310732,2678
4.0,1570042294733,Cream-Colored Cap with White Ear Flaps is Warm and Comfortable,"The biggest surprise is a black hat with black ear flaps was pictured, but I received a cream colored hat with white ear flaps.  The cream colored yarns are interesting in that there are little flecks of orange and green in the weave and the pom on top, to provide some visual interest.  This is a really warm hat and comfortable to wear.  Not only are there the ear flaps but the inside of the cap has a nice lining.  I would have guessed it's flannel, but the tag says the lining is 100% polyester.  This won't go with my mostly black coats but it's neutral enough that it'll work.  It is a different looking cap with the ear flaps but they're so practical that I like them.  I'm sure my friends will be able to pick me out in a crowd when I wear this cap.",310732,6980

Although I haven't worn them in actual cold weather yet, they were very comfortable and kept my feet warm, but not overly hot, at an outdoor festival during unseasonably cool temperatures and kept up with the walking I did.

And when wearing them for long periods of time, I’ve noticed I don’t have to adjust or pull them up much, something I had to do constantly with my Naturalizer brand compression socks. The socks themselves look as described, and the colors are fun but not blinding neon like other compression socks sometimes are. As of writing this, I’ve worn/washed them probably about 6-7 times and there doesn’t seem to be any loss of compression. The only drawback I need to mention is how the inside of the socks can be “stringy”, and sometimes my toes get caught on these threads while I’m putting them on.

It is a little flimsy and a soft case but will certainly protect your shades while in your purse or pocket.<br /><br />At the time of this written review the cost of these shades was $15.00.

You should machine wash in cold water -- the manufacturer suggests air drying but I have put mine in the dryer with no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />I love how these socks do not slip down or move around when I wear them with my shoes.  They stay put.  Plus, they are adorable!  They come in a variety of colors - purple/gray ---  blue/green ---  red/light/blue/navy.  They a little netting type design across the top.

5.0,1543075721685,SUPER NICE SET!!!!!!!,"ORCHID ROW WOMEN'S FANCY MULTI COLOR CASUAL COZY KNIT INFINITY SCARF & BEANIE SET<br /><br />WOW.  This is such a nice and classy set for those cold winter days!  Appealing looking, warm, and well made, you certainly cannot go wrong with this hat and scarf set.<br /><br />The hat is one size fits all.  The knit stitch is a large pattern and very cool looking.  The pom pom on top has like a feathery look, not your usual knitted pom pom ball.  It's cute.  The bottom cuff is a different knitted pattern than the rest of the hat and adds to the over all good looks.  It is warm.  You may machine wash in cold and line dry.<br /><br />The infinity scarf is just as cool as the hat.  It measures 36""Lx10""W and that gives you plenty of play to wear in any style you prefer.  The knitted pattern matches the hat and is very well made.  The edging is a different pattern that also matches the hat.  I think you could also reverse the scarf and create an entirely other look.  The scarf is 100% acrylic.  You may machine wash cold and line dry.<br /><br />This set is available in beige, burgundy, and green.  The green is so dark that it almost looks black until you inspect it closely and can see the hunter green colors.  The other colors worked into the pattern are hunter green, navy blue, and white.<br /><br />I also have the beige set and the colors are light beige, white, and a little darker beige.  Just as pretty and practical as the green set!<br /><br />This is a very pretty and warm set that you can wear with any number of different color coats and hoodies.  What a great gift for a loved one.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!!!!!",593057,257
3.0,1577434224599,There's good and bad.,"These socks are thick and warm, I'm all about the anti skid grips, but unfortunately I have more cons than pros. Firstly, the quality does not hold up, my daughter had only worn this twice and its already starting to fray. They will not hold up for long. Secondly, I like to pull any kind of socks up to her legs to provide extra insulation but they always seem to drop down and bunch around her ankles. I'm not happy with that, she comes to me too often to fix them and pull them up again.",593179,2503
4.0,1574363580848,Pretty good!,"These are very good quality tights, very multi purpose, very stretchy, I however cannot use it because its too small for me but I plan on holding on to these until my daughter can fit into them!",593179,7037
4.0,1574139672786,Very useful!,These yoga pants are very comfortable. The print on it is adorable and it has a lot of room to stretch which I like a lot. High quality and great stitch.,593179,65336
4.0,1568956093033,One minor issue but mostly great!,"The first thing I noticed straight off the bat is how strange the material is for a scarf. Now since its double sided its understandable that its going to be thick in which case they should have gone with thinner materials to begin with. It almost feels like felt and when you put two of them together it adds a lot of volume to it.<br />The sides are sewn together so well, no frayed edges, just solid craftsmanship.<br />Now if you're intending to wear this as a wrap it'll work perfectly for you, it'll also do a pretty decent job keeping you warm. But if you're looking for a double sided hijaab (head scarf) let me tell you all you need to know.<br />This will keep your head very warm, works great for winters, not so much in the summers. If you're planning to do a style which requires bunching up the cloth it wont cooperate with you because it becomes very bulky and will make your style very poofy.<br />It will be heavy so be careful when pinning up to make sure its comfortable.<br />Overall I'm very excited to use this more often as we're heading towards a cool down!",593179,7077
3.0,1567741456720,Nice bag but not for me!,This was alright for me. The body is suede and the gold chain is of better quality then the rest. The outer pocket is very convenient to have because I always lose my phone in the bag.  A little shiny in my opinion though.<br />However I do not think ts very practical especially for moms who need the extra space! I believe this is more suited towards younger girls who are starting to carry larger bags.<br />It came with a little plastic string bag which is always good to have!,593179,6984
4.0,1567140714169,Fell in love instantly!,"The color of the shirt is actually more flattering in real than in the picture. It is such a beautiful deep color. This will come in very handy when the weather cools down. I love the stylish cowl neck, and can you ever go wrong with pockets? Now these aren't the kind of pockets that you can put your phone or keys in but I am automatically drawn to shirts with pockets.<br />The sleeves are a bit longer but I don't mind that especially in cooler weather. The material isn't of the highest quality but it still works.<br />Highly recommend!",593179,267157

5.0,1613235963511,The Perfect Bra,"First a disclosure: I'm a guy. I don't wear a bra. I don't have any experience from the good side, the wearing side. But I'm in love with a woman I've known for 35 years and I suppose she wore a bra long before she knew me. So my perspective is that I know what I like and I REALLY know what she likes.<br /><br />In our decades together, this is the first time I can recall her ever exclaiming that SHE LOVES THIS BRA. She has related to me the experience of going to some kind of salon or something where a ""wonderful sweet foreign woman"" (I have no idea what that means) 'handled the girls' and fit me with the most amazing bra"". That was interesting, but the effect wore off after a decade or so.<br /><br />So when my queen found that same level of delight after finding a bra online sight unseen, well, that caught my attention. Honestly, I've never been discontent, but if she's happy, then I'm double-triple-...  I don't know what comes after that. Anyway, I'm Over The Moon happy for her. She deserves to be happy.<br /><br />So there's a hidden gem in the center that only she and I know about. Frankly, that's gilding the lilies. For me it's almost a distraction. But for her, she knows she has a hidden treasure in there, and that's pretty fun.<br /><br />Best of all though. this bra has these wonderfully humanitarian wide straps. I feel so sad for her at the end of the day when she takes her bra off and there are deep sculpted troughs in her shoulders from her straps. But this bra has beautiful wide comfortable straps that truly seem to be on her side. It's like there are little cherubs who are holding things up and ensuring that her back and shoulders aren't punished by what's happing up front.<br /><br />OK. I'm done reviewing a bra. We've been deeply in love since 1986 and I don't think I've ever put so much thought into foundation wear. Honestly, I'm very simple to please. More importantly, I need my queen to be pleased. She's over the moon happy with this bra, so how could I not love it?",593217,1774

The dangly gem thing in the center is nice, but it seems like gilding the lilies to me.<br /><br />The obvious benefit that I can see is the nice wide straps. It always makes me sad at the end of the day to see the deep cut impressions on her shoulders, so unfair. These straps are a lot more substantial though, and way more gentle on her shoulders.<br /><br />I can't believe I just reviewed a bra. I hope nobody was offended.

Just the opposite, they are super slippery.

I wear a variety of sizes ranging from a 7 to 10 (standard ring position).  As stated these are adjustable rings and they do lean towards a more masculine look and design.  The bands are wider and thicker.  However, about 1/2 are thin enough to compliment my bone structure and don't feel overly bulky or like I am wearing my ""boyfriends' ring and I need to tape it up.  It was pretty easy to adjust the size (press in or with mild pressure adjust band out)  Most of the rings are in a bright high polish silver which I didn't like as much as the darker rings.  The snake ring oddly enough is by far the coolest ring, fantastic color, great fit and look amazing.  It is the perfect statement ring.  Not a bad price point.  I would put a clear coat on the high silver rings as some did leave tarnish marks on the skin, not all but some.",593288,955

I can put this dress on without undoing the zipper, so if you like very form fitting then by your normal size, for me that is a L.  The tie at the neck wasn't annoying and didn't come undone over an 11 hour work day.  The hem length is just below my knees and the sleeves are just above mid arm.

4.0,1580072584126,Decent bracelet,This is a pull slide style bracelet.  Where you can expand and then close to fit your wrist.  The materials are all pretty decent.  Gems in the skull seem to be secured nicely.  The skull isn’t flat so this is a round pebble sitting against your wrist though out the day.

3.0,1576621253299,This is an okay bracelet (braided leather) / Nice bracelet (solid leather cuff),"Not sure what's up with the reviews on this but when talking about these bracelets the same link pops up soo, you get a 2 for 1 special on this review.<br /><br />First up is the leather braided bracelet.  It's like 2 Stars just a basic braid that isn't that great.<br /><br />The leather is pretty thin and the color is a bit drab.  I have other costume jewelry by Sunsoul and it’s great for its price-point.  This one isn’t my favorite.  It does however, look much better when it  is paired with more items.  Easy to pull on, I didn’t adjust the size so they may be more difficult.  Overall, this isn’t fantastic or total blah.<br /><br />Second item up is the Black leather open cuff bracelet.  This is actually more like a 4 star bracelet.  It isn't overly thick (you can see it in the photos ) with copper end caps.  Bracelet or Cuff is open enough that most people should be able to easily get it onto their wrists with out making any adjustments.  If you do need to adjust this, it is simple, a small amount of pressure when pulling at the opening will spread this cuff, then reapply pressure to close comfortably on your wrist.  For me this is a bit more masculine in look when worn by itself.  But I like the materials and make of this more then the previous one.<br /><br />There you have it 2 for 1 special on reviews.",593288,6833

Typically, I wear a US size 10 or 12 in pants depending on the cut and most often a L in athletic pants.  These in the Large have a mild compression yet they do fit well.  I did run a mile and they didn’t slide down however, I did feel like they were looser on me then other workout pants.  The length, and seems all sit well against the skin.<br /><br />Even though these are mostly white my colored underwear didn’t really show through, which is very nice when doing squats or running.  There is ALWAYS that one person who has to comment ..Like yeah I wear panties sooooo.<br /><br />I have washed and dried these with other gear and had very mild to no shrinking.  Pattern didn’t bleed or fade.  The waist band is large and sits just across my belly button.  If you like more compression I think you could probably wear this a size smaller then your NORMAL athletic wear.<br /><br />Price point is reasonable for these.",593289,65336
3.0,1575738248415,Chain isn’t as long as shown,"This is an okay necklace for little girls.  The chain is only 8 inches long, in the photos you can see it looks like choker on my neck, not the length shown in the advertisement  photos.  The chain also has this weird feel to is, somewhat like touching a chalk board, doesn’t feel like plastic and it does somewhat feel like metal, it reminds me of the necklaces you could get out of a gum ball machine from stores when I was a kid.  There is no clasp for the chain connections to hook to you have to hook it to a link, not really a problem just pointing that out.  The elephant is a charm, and it isn’t solid it is just a 1/2 mold, like a charm that was cut into half.  The quarts is rather pretty and good size,  Overall, this isn’t that great I would say its more for little girls and probably won’t last long.",593289,2472

When trying to review a new necklace this old review pops up and I can add to it so I will.<br /><br />1st post<br />I wanted to like this necklace.  the advertisement photos make is look like a versatile piece.  However, when you get it, it’s rather dull in appearance.  Mine came in a small jewelry bag and inside the necklace was stuffed into a tiny plastic bag. When I finally got it out, you can see in the photos, it looked like an old tarnished necklace.  It did hang well and had a decent length but was just flat and dull to look at.  Mine actually broke while wearing it the first day.  I only wore it maybe 3 hours so I don’t know if it would have left tarnish marks.<br /><br />2nd post — New item necklace with small coins on it.<br />This necklace is somewhat weird to look at.  The length isn’t that great and when looking closely at the pendent it appears as one large melted blob with coins hanging off it.  Not one of the better items I have ever worn.  The good points are that it did NOT tarnish my skin when wearing it for the day.  However, I just don’t care for the overall look and quality for this particular (well both) pieces.

The underside of the bill is in a beautiful pink color.  Also, the threading on the back is in pink.  Fits adult heads no problem.

There is a pretty good seem line where the color changes from black to grey. Unfortunately , for me, this seems line is right across my natural waist line and makes the dress look like it bulges out and not in.  Pretty much the exact opposite of how it looks on the model.  Also, the pockets in the front aren’t actually pockets they are pieces of fabric cut and sewn on to look like pockets.. The fabric is very heavy , making this a great dress for the winter but the color folds over on itself so it feels like you have a blanket on around your neck.  For me it just didn’t work.  Also, the interior had so abrasive seems so I would need to wear someone under it.  Which is sad because the material itself is very nice to the touch.",593289,925

I handwash them when I'm going to need a fresh pair before other clothes need to be washed, and washing them is not a big deal.  Just put them in some warm water with a little shampoo, and squish them thoroughly, then rinse in some fresh water.

The beanie hat has a cute pom pom on top in a faux black fur which looks really cute--like you are going to a ski resort or out for a walk in the snow. The material is acrylic and it is a loose knit which was nice because the hat could fit a range of head sizes but could be prone to pilling.  I recommend hand washing the set in cold water before first use to add a detergent smell to them.  Nice product!",593479,6434

But whenever I sat down or walked, my leggings would do the slip and slide down my bum.  Very embarrassing to correct in public, having to pull my leggings back up.

This has 3/4 sleeves which I like and pockets! This dress would be great for most seasons.  It would be rather thin for Winter though.<br /><br />I live in Florida so I most likely can wear this dress year around without much issue.

Not comfortable at all.  When I run or bike I usually do so for an hour or more, this made my comfort level worse.<br /><br />I think this product was a great idea in theory but it sucks so much in practice.  Padding is simply just too thick.

4.0,1562167355133,Nice small bag.,"I really like this bag and I have a few similar to it in style.  Many times I don’t want to lug around a huge purse everywhere.  Sometimes I just need my phone and my card/id.<br /><br />I like how simple this looks as it would go with any outfit.  I like how the strap is adjustable.  I like to wear it crossbody resting at my hip level.<br /><br />This bag has two zippers.<br /><br />With the larger zipper, the interior has a single pocket where you can place a few credit/id cards.<br /><br />The second zipper could accommodate small items.  I placed my phone (iPhone 7) and the top of it pokes out of the second zipper.<br /><br />The front is embossed with “Just For You Fashion Accessories”.  I ended up going over it with a sharpie as I don’t like branding.<br /><br />I wasn’t a huge fan of the hoop placement for where the strap attaches.  I don’t like how the loops are on one side of the purse.

It's pretty cold, and dry here so it definitely gives my hair the static. So, unless I plan on wearing the hat all day, I usually just skip it. I like the scary well enough. It's  a little wide but also a little short and bulky to wrap around your neck. I sort of just spread it out over my shoulders and left it hang. It keeps be pretty warm.

My very nice pair of prescription glasses has a blue blocking feature and you can see the difference in tint when you move from one to the other.<br /><br />On these the lenses are clearly very low quality, with occlusions (blurry spots), sometimes like looking through a plastic bottle.<br /><br />I just think my eyes are worth more than that.",593534,7354

Then when she came home she tried this shoe cleaner and it cleaned the rest of her shoe right up.<br /><br />She also tried it on her white suede trainers, they had turned kinda grey, but reported that the improvement was minimal.<br /><br />One of the better things about the bottle design is that its easy to wash it without overdoing it.

The seude bags I sprayed had a very low nap to begin with. The scent if the spray is not too noticeable and hopefully it will continue to dissapate.

I am used to wearing compression hose and socks since having spinal fusion surgery and developing severe DVT in my leg after surgery. I wear a &#34;professional&#34; thigh high hose on my right leg and a knee high compression sock on my right lower leg. I typically wear Sockwell brand knee high compression socks on my right lower leg which I bought on Amazon. I LOVE the Sockwell brand and eventually bought 7 pairs. They are the most comfortable socks (the Sockwell brand) that I have ever worn. Once they are on, I totally forget they are compression socks and they feel heavenly all day long. These Ace socks in my opinion run quite large. I wear a women's size 9 and the pair of Ace socks I received to review were sm/md 5.5-7.5 shoe size. They fit fine, even in the foot length. The socks are huge in comparison to my Sockwell socks and these Ace socks did not feel like they would have the same compression fit and feel. Once on, however, I liked them and they have felt good all day long. They don't feel scratchy at all and they are so snug that it is very difficult for me to pinch the sock off my leg, just like my Sockwell socks. The Ace socks are a bit loose and baggy on my foot though. I still think the Ace socks are ugly and I don't like the large &#34;ACE tm&#34; on the top of the foot by the toes. I think they look tacky. I will stick with my Sockwell compression socks.",593589,3598

5.0,1578751288131,"Attractive, hypoallergenic and safe.","This is a very attractive ring with a band that resembles precious metal on the top and bottom with a black ring in the center.  It actually looks like bling.  Although the ring is merchandised for men in the ad copy it’s certainly a good choice for the ladies.  It’s eye-catching and very smart looking.  The surface is extremely shiny and it’s my understanding that with tungsten it will retain this surface.  I am the one who wears this ring occasionally because it is hypoallergenic - no redness from allergic reactions – this is a plus.<br /><br />The main reason for my exploring tungsten rings is that my boyfriend is always working on his car and metal rings can be dangerous.  This type ring is scratch resistant plus, more important, will shatter in case of emergency and not deform and cut of blood flow to the finger causing serious injury.  There’s nothing but plusses with this ring choice.",593664,658

The material is very soft and comfortable. One other issue, washing (- 2nd star), the bottoms are already clumping and look like they will wear out fast (in the photo).

It's too light to be a windbreaker but might make it as a running jacket because it's so light. Can't really address it because I couldn't use it.

They are super stretchy and I could still get them up to my waist even with the tight legs since they were so long.  The waist area fit me with no issues and seemed to fit to size.

I wear one or the other every single day.  These fit fine as far as getting them on.  They are not as high waisted as I would like, especially in the back (if you have a larger back area).

Also, the sleeves have a button and tab band for rolling up. The fit is probably your average fit as opposed to a slim or husky fit.  And sleeve length works for an average person but I think anyone with longer arms might find them a bit short. I really like the orange color -  it’s a kind of light orange sherbet shade that is perfect for summer. The fabric is slightly thinner than other chambray shirts that I have, making it suitable for warmer weather and climates.

I don't want added bulk or weight - when/if they are empty I am just going to fold them up and throw them in my empty suitcase..

4.0,1456257997000,Tall athletic socks they ARE good for running,"Nice athletic socks that seem to be cushy in all the right places.  I was a little surprised to see how wide they are at the top, and how tall they are.  They are contoured to fit over your calf and end just under the knee.  Not exactly sure why they are so tall, but maybe they are for outdoor use?  My wife is 5'7&#34; with size 7.5 shoes and they work just fine.  The bottom of the sock is more cushioned than the top, which is made out of a thinner mesh.  The gray areas seem slightly more elasticized, and the sock does seem to have a few compression areas in the midfoot.  However,  unlike some &#34;running&#34; socks,  they are easy to put on and comfortable .  They have held up pretty well in the wash.<br /><br />Shoe size: S/M: 5.5 - 7.5‎<br />Shoe size: L/XL: 8 - 10.5‎",593956,3598

I often like to bring a book with me, and this is a good size for a variety of size books.  You can carry some makeup, your phone, and more.  I love purses that have some separate compartments and zippered sections, and this purse offers that.  It even has a RFID section to keep your person info and debit cards, etc. safe.  This bag feels like good quality and like something that will last a lifetime.",593962,55345

2.0,1560184797842,Doesn't Fit Me Well,"I never thought I had a big head.  I have two other sun hats, and they fit fine.  Although I do have long, thick hair, so maybe that can be an issue with some hats, maybe?  This hat doesn't fit me well at all.  If I pull it down to actually fit on my head, I can't see because the rim is way down my face.  So I guess it's not so much a better of it being too small.  It I just place it or rest it on my head, I can see, but then it just falls off if I move around and is sticking way up on top of my head, looking funny.  When I pull it down so my head is actually in it, the rim comes down too far and I can't see. Well, I can see my feet. But I can't see where I'mg going.  It just seems a very odd fit.",593962,2720

2.0,1576873999160,It doesnt work for me,I was really looking forward to a phone case that I could also use as a wallet and better yet a cross body wallet. But this one is not the one. The card slots doesn't close all the way and there is a big gap which I really wish it didn't have. There is no way I am storing my credit cards or money in that. It can also be hard to store your phone in the slot if you have already have a chunkier phone case. Overall I wouldn't recommend this cross body.,593965,1976
3.0,1575669498306,You get what you pay for,"Let’s start off with the price. $16 for two ties is an incredible value. BUT know this - you aint gonna get silk ties for that price. A solid good quality silk tie will set you back 50 bucks or more. But if you rarely wear ties (my husband wears them everyday to work) these will suffice. You get 2 polyester ties - a dark teal tie and a purple patterned tie. In my husbands words - I did not realize that these ties are skinnier than my usual business ties. If you are of slim build this will not be an issue. But if you are of larger or a portly build, this will look comical. I weight 190 lbs. and have a 44-inch chest and am 5’7”. The purple tie looked like a cartoon pictogram on me. I would have preferred it to be at least 30% wider than it is. It says width is 3.1” at its WIDEST but it was slightly under 3”. My typical tie is 3.75” at the widest point. 3/4” may not seem much but that balances pulling your ensemble outfit together or looking like a clown. Onto other points like the ease of tying the knots. I use Oriental and the Half Windsor techniques for the knots. It worked well for these ties. The length was satisfactory as is the thickness of these ties. They are not a piece of limp seaweed. There is a slight heft to them.<br />These are a solid 3 star product and they are colorful; but you do get what you pay for.",593965,2719
4.0,1530219502567,Not 100 % cotton but...,"We really like these rompers. They are light weight fabric that is soft to touch, cute prints and easy to wear - the material is stretchy so its easy to get in and out/change diapers in - has snaps to open and close without having to remove the leg like the carter ones . The reason i gave it 4 stars was the price. $20 for a 2 piece romper that is not even 100% cotton (its 60% cotton) feels like it is a bit much. But other than that, the prints are cute. The color doesn't run when you wash it with like colors in delicate cycle and we throw it in the dryer on a low setting and it comes out looking as good as new. Overall we like it and if you don't mind that it is $20 for something that isn't 100% cotton, go for it.",593965,10987
5.0,1664490817470,Works well,"At first I did not think that this would really provide much support or compression but it turns out that it does.

1.0,1636255047421,Poor fit and they're crinkly,I really dislike these masks.  They fit me very poorly.  They seem to be more fitted across the nose int the pictures but they are not and they lack a metal nose piece.  This causes them to fog my glasses very badly.  The masks are very crinkly - they make a lot of noise.  There is also a a mesh lining inside the mask that is uncomfortable.  Essentially I like just about nothing about these masks.,593981,550
5.0,1626200442260,Very comfortable,My daughter took one look at these and declared that she didnt like them (keeping in mind that SHE picked them!)  Then she tried them on and said she loves them.

3.0,1623615245032,VERY bulky padding,This sports bra is pretty from the back.  It runs a bit large around the rib cage.  The straps are not adjustable so it either fits well or not.  The padding is very bulky.  Like pillows for your bosom.  I'd say that support is minimal to medium but that may be because of how the straps fit.  Chest coverage is good.<br /><br />My daughter likes it but it really does not fit her well.,593981,464

4.0,1607747295428,I prefer the smaller ones,The smaller faux pearls are nicer in my opinion.  They look more natural and delicate.  The large ones look like plastic balls glued onto the posts.  I like that these are smaller.  The posts are a good size and don't irritate my ears.,593981,9458

The length was what I'd describe as 'normal' .... they certainly were not 'ankle' length on me.<br /><br />The fabric is soft and stretches well - I could tell they would be comfy.  I might get them tailored at the waist to get them to fit better.  Currently, I'd describe them as unwearable by me.",593981,1967
3.0,1601996877504,Decent but not as described,My daughter likes this bra but it isnt at all as described.  It isnt a racer back but instead has a criss cross back.

4.0,1596816363299,Wish the strap were a little bigger,"This visor barely fits my head.  Which is unfortunate, because I really do like it.  The part that touches your skin is soft and the hook/loop tape they used is such that it does NOT snag my hair.  (VERY important to me).<br /><br />I got this because we will be having 'mask breaks' outside with students but I would prefer to have some protection while with a bunch of kids.

4.0,1586448389795,Run small - especially at the ankles,I love these socks except that they are too tight at the ankle.  They are thin but cushiony.  They grip well but the grips are not so large that I cant wear my slippers with them. The seams are  tight and flat - no uncomfortable bulges here.  They are perfect for wearing around the house on a cold day.<br /><br />But they're too small at the ankles.  Waah!  :(  I only deducted 1 star for that because in fairness I do have cankles but I sized up so they should have fit.,593981,1970

It comes in a nice little plastic box and a bag- could well be a gift for someone.,593981,9357
4.0,1583805197531,Confusing sizing,The sizing on this was very confusing.  On the package it says XL but the amazon label says s/m.  Its a child's XL or Women's S/M!

2.0,1576292026849,Interesting,"Interesting is what my daughter said when I had her try them on.  First, the fabric feels strange.  Strange enough that she balked at even trying them on.  2nd,  they are thin to the point of being see through.  She has tights that are more opaque than these ""pants"".  3rd,  they have fairly prominent logos that repeat in various parts - which in itself is only a mere annoyance, but the logos are partially cut off in some parts.<br /><br />2 stars because they fit and have a reflective stripe for when you wear them at night .... which, given the see throughness, is the only place I'd let her wear them.<br /><br />Fail!",593981,420750

I want to put it on my backpack!""  As a backpack decoration, I guess it is pretty awesome.<br /><br />If you have a cat, watch out!  It also makes a great cat toy.

Yes, It was a bit of a stretch at the top rendering them less opaque than at the feet but somehow, I think this is as designed.  They looked similar on me to the pic of the woman in the description.  I havent worn hosiery in a long time but that is how I remember stockings fitting.<br /><br />The material is SUPER soft.  Perhaps a bit thinner than I expected for tights (vs stockings) but they were so soft I really dont care.

What I didn’t like are the lenses which have a weird 3-D glasses affect. I think that this caused me to have a slight headache after wearing them for an hour.  Many less expensive polarized glasses do you have the weird red 3-D effect. I am Magine this is why I found these glasses difficult to wear for a long time.

It's actually hard to find a scarf that it not too thick where it looks like a traditional scarf for skiing, and one that is so thin it looks limp.<br /><br />In the package, this scarf looked like it would be of the limp variety.  However, once removed from the package, it was revealed to be a scarf of generous size.  The fabric is slightly sheer but can be fluffed nicely.  The edge is not sewn but is rolled, which actually helps it keep its shape.  The color was off-white--a color I associate with fall but could be used anytime.  It has enough length so you can tie it in many ways.  It can be looped twice around the neck easily.  You can also roll the scarf and make a tie in the front--very nice!<br /><br />I'm actually really happy with this scarf and can't wait to add it to my work and weekend wear this fall/winter.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",593990,13918

3.0,1586216721718,Not a True Compression Bag. More Like a Modified Packing Cube.,"This BAGVIO set consists of 2 same size packing cubes that are made of a medium weight fabric and medium duty zippers.  The main zipper opens the packing compartment to a halfway point (unlike packing cubes which zip to fully open), and the second zipper expands/widens the packing compartment.<br /><br />To fill, expand the cube and put in your clothes.  Close the main zipper and then zip up the expansion zipper to ""compress"" the cube.  By doing this, you do squish your clothes and the bag does get smaller (obviously, the expansion portion of the cube is zipped up), thereby allowing you to save some space in your luggage.  For this reason, I rate these BAGVIO packing cubes higher than standard packing cubes.<br /><br />However, if you've ever used true compression bags, these BAGVIO cubes are nothing like true air-removing compression bags and cannot compete with the packability of compression bags.  Your clothes will wrinkle using either method, but the air removal feature of the compression bag allows more clothes in the suitcase than these compression cubes.",594000,2141

No post in the back is a lot more comfortable with the mask straps.  I have several that are just the hoop or a hoop with some little zirconia inset into the hoop.  These have three circular adornments on the hoop that jingle against each other and spin around the hoop for some fun and a little sparkle.  I love the movement of them.  I just have to be very careful because none of them are attached the earring and they can slide right off.  Be careful when you are taking them off or putting them on that you don't loose what makes this huggie earring set special. Also, pay attention to the size because they are super small.

If it moves around at all you can see it plain as day.  it comes in a nice gift box so it is ready to be gifted.

The quality and looks of these are 5 stars, but they were very difficult to open.  I knocked them down to 3.5 stars because I broke my nail trying to open the gold plated pair.  They do get easier to open after a few times opening and closing but I worry that I will hurt my earlobe trying to take these off.  The silver pair did not give me this trouble so it might be hit or miss on these.  I really like the look and the feel of these so I am torn on how to rate them overall.

This helps them keep track of the keys and gets them back to me safely.  This pack of 20 is perfect for this light use.  I don't think they are the highest quality.  I would say they are an economy purchase.  It is a large pack so if one breaks you have plenty more to use. None of mine were defective or broken.  Two of them had imperfections but it was not going to keep them from being useful.<br /><br />They have a matte finish to them which I am not used to but it is fine.  The shiny ones usually get dirty and lose their shine anyways.  The matte finish also means the colors are not very vibrant.  I don't mind.  They will do the job just fine.,594063,6433

5.0,1531414285987,"This is a fun, bright pattern on a nice fitting kimono top ...","Original review (Red): This is a fun, bright pattern on a nice fitting kimono top that will fit a wide range of sizes.  I am having surgery on my arms and am going to use this as a light cover over my bandaged arms and torso.  After that, I can see using this for lots of occasions and with lots of different outfits.  It is just what I needed and will be a great addition to my wardrobe later on.<br />Update (4/20/19) I did use this after  my arm lift surgery.  It was perfect because I could couldn't get in and out of regular tops for over a week.  I got many compliments from doctors, nurses and other patients and they wanted to know where I got it.  After the surgery, I wore it over a tank top for a fun casual everyday look.  The red is bright and fun.  In April 2019, I got the black floral one. Here is my review of that version: This is a really pretty and versatile piece. It is listed under cover-ups but I think it could great for the office or to wear over a tank top just out and about on a warm summers day.  The black floral pattern goes with a lot and it really attractive.  This will fit a wide range of people, too. It has one single tie closure in the front if you need to keep it secure although it really does not close.  It is flowy and has great movement. This black floral does not seem quite as see through as some of the lighter shades.  I really like it and think it will be handy in the coming summer months.",594063,7555

3.0,1558125190745,Lightweight Blazer,"This is a very lightweight blazer (it's almost sheer, the fabric is so thin). This does have buttons on the front, but they're just for show. There are no actual button-holes. I wish I had the option of buttoning the blazer for a more polished look.<br /><br />I feel like the fit is good, although it might be just a tad on the small side, particularly through the shoulders. It's a great layer option for when I want a dressier look while still remaining cool and comfortable.<br /><br />The quality doesn't feel super high-end, but it's not too bad.<br /><br />It is machine washable (cold water cycle). I hang mine up to dry.",594081,1784
4.0,1557944354918,"Lightweight, sheer kimono","The print on this mini kimono is really cute. It hit me just below the waist. The front tie is convenient for keeping it closed. The sleeve holes are quite generous. I typically wear a L/XL and this provided me with plenty of room. It was both cute and comfortable. It is a looser fitting top, so it's not incredibly flattering on me, but it's a great option as a coverup or to wear layered over a tank top.",594081,725
3.0,1551933989731,Chin strap not attached to hat,"The hat itself is fairly cute. The velvet bow on the back adds a bit of style and visual interest. The interior of the hat has a velcro strap that can help adjust the hat's circumference to allow for a better fit. However, the chinstrap was not actually attached to the hat. It was a separate cord with an adjustment toggle, so I'm assuming you loop it over the top of the hat and then secure it under your chin...only downside is that it looks a bit ridiculous and it's not particularly effective. We live in a very windy area, so the extra benefit of a chin strap to keep it secure is essential.<br /><br />The hat itself is flexible and packable. It is a bit floppy which makes it easy to fold when needed. The brim offers a bit of additional sun protection for both the face and neck without having an overly large, wide brim.",594081,421316
4.0,1550160037628,Runs a little large,"I really enjoy the way this brand fits me. The pants are extremely comfortable. They look like dress pants, but they feel more like yoga pants. Unfortunately, these ran a little bit big on me. I have other styles in this size that fit me well, but these seem to run just a little bit on the large side. If you are in between sizes, I would recommend sizing down. The length was perfect for me.",594081,727
3.0,1589845063331,Did nothing for me,"It's copper so yes, expect this to turn once the initial finishes wears off; it's not something you will want to wear all the time. I've long heard about the healing power of copper and was curious. Admittedly, I'm skeptical but figure if there was any benefit, it should be able to come through the cynicism. I found no benefit. It's a cute bracelet, looks cute, provides no real benefit to me at least.",594087,13790
3.0,1586217653261,Weird shape,"I didn't end up being a fan simply due to the odd fit of this hat; the quality is fine, there were not complaints, it was well made, stitching was solid as was the overall quality of the fabric itself. The size was standard - just the fit looks terrible. Neutral rating because the style wasn't good but the cap is fine.",594087,7385

4.0,1574645003989,Too skinny,These might be a bit too skinny especially at the ankles - not very flattering unless you happen to be REALLY and truly super skinny...not merely athletic. These don't fit the calves and are uncomfortable. Good for very thin builds only. Well made.,594087,9523
4.0,1570979984910,Vintage style,Larger than expected. I think these are even bigger than the ones I used to wear in the 80's...they are that large.

5.0,1564703304785,Been wearing for months- get better over time,"Can't brag enough about these. Never heard of the brand before but tried one or two pair then came back for a dozen more including these.

3.0,1564703139145,Too skinny,"These fit fine in the length and waist but they are simply too skinnny...really tight and for those that have developed calf muscles - forget it.

Bend and move with ease, wash well and doesn't matter if they get beat up because it adds to the style. Great fit - sized right.",594087,491
5.0,1564698467120,Big coverage,"I like this. It's light weight, big floppy yet comfortable. Provides ample coverage for wearing at the beach or even gardening or shopping. Can fold up and toss in a bag - it does crumple a tad but no big deal. Pops back into shape again easily.",594087,2720
5.0,1564694496778,Good look,"These are large but stylish and frankly, look good. The faded glass adds just the right amount of protection without creating that bug eyed appearance - simply sunglasses with eyes that show through. Well made, oversized yet comfortable. Terrific value.",594087,3343
4.0,1564694426475,Oversized is right...wow,"These are larger than expected. When the description stated ""oversized' I figured large but not this big.

5.0,1562023246126,Super set!,"I needed a couple of ties so figured these would get the job done but was far more impressed than expected once they arrived. First, this two pack comes boxed in a divider that works well for gift giving or organizing...either way is nice.

4.0,1559646427117,Almost,"This is a good sized pack with reflective tape and weatherized to protect against rain and humidity...almost. The flap on top has a tendency to pool and drop into the main pack so despite the weatherized fabric which is great, things may still get wet due to the design itself. On the other hand, it won't seep through like other bags so still give this a good rating...just not the best rating. Holds a decent amount and is fairly comfortable for a budget priced bag.",594087,9506
5.0,1555976266729,Great looks and comfort,"I like these a lot. Fit is spot on target - good length, good waist and no sagging in the backside. These look as good as they feel.

5.0,1555976182479,Stretch is comfortable,"Okay - I'm older and jeans for guys never had any stretch but the wife has been wearing it for years and assured me these would be great. I wasn't sure but ultimately, had to agree. The comfort is mind boggling. Fit is perfect- athletic slim fit, no bulk and yet absolute flexibility.",594087,3243
3.0,1551718207960,Sheer when stretched,"Almost - don't think for a moment that you can wear this without a bra or top because when stretched above the bust area, it turns sheer. Otherwise this is comfortable and washes well. I've worn and washed it a few times - holds up without issue but the sheerness when stretched limits full usefulness.",594087,492
4.0,1531998257852,Nice size and leather,Nice leather - supple yet firm so stays in place and holds cards well. Thin design is flexible so if you sit on these the cards will bend.

4.0,1602361972781,It's alright,"This is a cute shirt. I personally don't think it has enough stretch and it definitely isn't fleece. I would call it a run of the mill t-shirt with stars. The stars printed on are shiny, so it looks sort of cheap...not the best quality. It isn't oversize. I would call it true to size, a bit on the slim fit side of things. I don't love it or hate it.

I'd definitely size up for a relaxed fit t-shirt. It also doesn't have any give to it. It isn't as expected with the description of an ""ultra soft fleece lightweight"" shirt. It's not soft, not stretchy and not fleece like in any way. It reminds me of an H&M t-shirt in the cut, definitely a slim fit. Overall I was disappointed.. I like the muted color camo but that's the only positive.",594278,366

I got this one size too big in a 3X (I normally wear a 2X because I can't stand tight clothes) because all the Amazon Aware clothes that I had bought before had shrunk 1 size and gotten shorter.<br /><br />I tried it on before washing it on cold delicate and dried it on Ultra Low and it fit loosely. I tried it on again, and found that it had shrunk about a size, as I expected. That meant that sizing up one made it fit perfectly after I washed and drie dit.<br /><br />Drying this on Ultra Low / Low seemed to have no detrimental effect, just as it was with all my other Amazon Aware clothes. It was also pretty much wrinkle-free which is a huge bonus.<br /><br />Very pleased with the quality and design of Amazon Aware apparel.<br /><br />As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart.

The polyester helps them to keep their shape so that will remain where they are put.  They are a bit snugger than I expected (size medium) but still comfortable.

The fabric also is very rough to the touch, and can be irritating to the skin when worn for long periods of time, or when exercising.<br /><br />If you like a more open area in your sweats, and like a rough non stretching material these are great, but for me I like soft, stretchy, and the lower area to be well fitted.",732675,34273

The fabric feels like that fabric that would snag and catch on everything.

Me and my friend really enjoyed the softness of the fabric. These also dobt have the opening in the front which is a dream for us, we both never use that ourselves.<br /><br />They did have a slight tightness around the thigh area, enough to be slightly uncomfortable. I dont think sizing up would fix this problem, as the boxers were fine in the waistband and fit great everywhere else. The fabric is also really lint attractive, meaning everything sticks to it which can be slightly annoying.<br /><br />Other than a few minor issues these boxers are wonderful.",732675,3055
5.0,1623969983791,Great Sun Protection,"I'm outside quite a bit because gardening is my main hobby. When I have the hot Texas sun beating down on me, I like to have maximum protection, and this sun hat visor does just that. I like it because:<br /><br />1. It fits my small head, which is saying a lot, since it's hard to find hats and bands that will do that.<br />2. The visor comes with a wonderful cover that can be put back on when not in use. I think that will keep the plastic from getting scratched when it's being stored.<br />3. The visor is huge, which is great because it protects my whole face. I hate sunscreen, especially on my face, so this visor takes care of that.<br />4. It blocks the sun really well, and has great UV protection.<br />5. I think it's a great value for the money which, at present, is a little over $18.00. In fact, I might just buy another one to put up for when this one gets too many scratches on it.<br /><br />As others have said, it does look strange, but I don't really care, because the most important thing to me is that it provides the protection I want and need. This is a great visor, and I highly recommend it.",732770,9699
5.0,1608665120983,Very Cool Socks!,"These socks are advertised for men, but I'm a woman, and I really like these. They're very soft, warm, colorful and comfortable.

That being said, because they fit me so well, I highly recommend them.",732770,6591
5.0,1576874881439,Great Quality,"My husband is a big guy, so when these XXL trunks showed up, I ordered them.<br /><br />1. The waist fits him kind of snugly. If you're any bigger than a 50"" waist, you might want to order the XXXL, if they have them.<br />2. These trunks are very lightweight. He hasn't been swimming in them yet, so he doesn't know how they will do in the water (i.e., balloon up like some swim trunks do).<br />3. Surprisingly, he likes the design, which I wasn't sure he would.

These socks have 80% cotton, so they fit my requirement.<br /><br />The socks fit my 6.5 foot snugly, but not too tight.

5.0,1557600476848,Actually Fits a Small Head!,"Having a small head, I've found it very difficult to find any kind of hat that didn't end up almost covering my eyes. Therefore, when I read that this was adjustable, I had to give it a try, and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It actually fits my head, and that's a minor miracle. Even without adjusting it, it fits pretty well so, if you have a large head, this might be a bit small.<br />2. It's made of cotton and linen, which should keep my head from sweating.<br />3. It's nice and lightweight, and folds nicely for packing.<br />4. The brim has something that stiffens it all the way around, which makes it adjustable there, too.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The ribbon that is used to size the head band is kind of flimsy, and I wish they had used something a bit more substantial. However, I didn't think that was enough to dock it a star.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this hat, and am confident I'll get a lot of wear out of it this summer. If you have a small head and have been as frustrated as I've been regarding finding sun hats that fit, you should give this a try.",732770,44248
3.0,1555691401012,Not For Small Head,"I do a lot of gardening, so I'm always looking for a hat with a wide brim so that my face will get some protection from the sun. This hat looked like it would work well, and it had a cute design, so I ordered it.<br /><br />First of all, the hat does look well-made, and I like the fringe effect around the brim. However, the reason I docked it two stars is because it's way too big for my small head. It's so big that it comes down to the top of my eyebrows. I've tried getting things that stick to the inside of the brim to make a hat fit better, but they never stay in place.<br /><br />So, I recommend this hat if you have a medium to big head, but those of you with small heads should pass on this. I just wish people who make this kind of hat could come up with a way to make it adjustable so that those of us with small heads could make them work for us. There are more than a handful of us out here, you know.",732770,8800

Our tags did come with a little piece of plastic, but it moves around to be of much use.",732881,3049
5.0,1592755608417,Handsome shirt for summer,"Perfect shirt for humid summer days because it lets the sweat evaporate rather than clinging to your skin and making you feel slimy and ready for another shower. It also doesn't show wetness like other fabrics, so no obvious sweat marks. The shirt has enough of a nip at the waist to not look boxy but not be as tight as an athletic-fit. If you want a looser fit, be sure to order a size up. The material is stretchy but doesn't stretch out like cotton, and will show  any pooch your spouse may want to hide.  My husband is 6'5"", and this shirt ends up hanging at the perfect length - just below his belt. Have to say that it doesn't look quite as good tucked in. If someone is shorter than 6', the shirt may look a little too long. I love this blue color, and it's a color that looks great on any skin tone. He loves the feel and breathability, and that it isn't utterly obvious that it's polyester. Dressy enough for work or casual enough for a weekend street fair (if we ever have one again after Covid-19...)",732881,21950
3.0,1567275138341,"Sizing good, but super skinny legs","This was our first experience with this brand. The waist of the jeans is labeled as a 32, and this sizing is/was correct. You could probably be a 33 waist and still find these comfortable.  The legs of these jeans are definitely skinny.  On a 14 year-old, 6', 170# boy they were almost too tight even though his legs aren't overly muscular or even on the big side. The fabric is stretchy, but skin-tight is the best way to describe how the legs of these jeans fit. He even had a hard time getting his size 12 foot through the legs and the opening at the cuffs. Anyone not a fan of skinny jeans will want to skip these, but anyone who loves a pair of painted on skinny jeans should give these a try. Though advertised as men's jeans, these might be better suited for girls/women. His older sister tried these on, and they fit her much better. Her legs are very willowy compared to her brother's build so she didn't have any complaints about the legs feeling too tight. The waist was a bit big, though a belt fixed that and a tunic top worn along with these jeans made for a cute outfit.<br /><br />The jeans are well-made without any funky seams, loose threads, or a bad zipper.  When washed there is some dye release (so use a color-catching sheet), but no shrinkage or significant wear to the fabric. They've held up well to be worn at least once a week for several months (by my niece who claimed the pair as her own since they don't fit her brother).  I'd have to say these are more jeggings than skinny jeans, though.",732881,3431
4.0,1564495925041,Nice summer top,"I received this top in the denim blue color, and I quite like it.  The fabric is soft and flowy and covers a multitude of flaws. The top is very comfortable to wear, though when it is hot and humid outside, it isn't very breathable as the fabric and traps the sweat.  The actual color isn't as light blue as it is in the picture on the listing. It still falls in the blue family, but it's more of a blue-grey in real life. Care is pretty straightforward - wash on cold, hang to dry. I've not had any issues with wrinkles so far, either when it's hung to dry or while wearing. The crochet detail around the neckline is pretty, though be wary of snags.  I am 5'6"" and find the length to be fine as the hem falls below my waist and when I lift my arms my tummy isn't exposed. The arm openings could be a little smaller. Depending on the bra you wear and where the band sits under your armpits, it might be flashed when you raise your arms. This top does indeed run big by close to a full size, so if you would like it to be more fitted than flowy, order a size down.",732881,6752
2.0,1533523132703,Not comfortable at all,"Did not like these “Kosy Komfort” socks/shoe liners as they were definitely not cosy or comfortable. The elastic stitching around the top was too thick and when wearing shoes it would leave itchy red marks. The sock material itself was scratchy and rough (even after laundering) and left my feet itchy and irritated. There was enough fabric in the toe area to keep the socks in place, but not in the heel. Even with the slicone grips on the inside of the heel fabric, I was constantly having to pull these back up over my heel as they’d continually slip off every few steps. Didn’t matter what style of shoes I wore them with - slip-ons or sneakers. I give them two stars because they are indeed no-show with summery low cut slip-on shoes, which is what I was looking for, but the missing comfort and quality put these in the ‘loss’ category.",732881,3005

While the shape & style hold some attraction for me, these sunglasses are SUPER lightweight - and not in a good way.

The &#34;gold&#34; on the bridge, side tabs, the arms and especially the nose pads are bright-shiny gold.  The black is a glossy plastic.  These seem more like a pair you'd pick up at a Dollar Store for a quick-disposable-only-in-emergency pair of shades.<br /><br />I will keep them in my car in the RARE instance that I've forgotten my prescription sunglasses as I can put them on over my clear prescription glasses for a temporary situation.  My vision is somewhat distorted with them this way and the sunshine block is pretty mild.<br /><br />They arrive in an attractive black box with OLIEYE in a handsome lettering, a chunky lightweight black plastic case with a snap, and a cleaning cloth.

There is enough weight to the hat so that it doesn't blow right off of your head with the lightest breeze. The brim is not very wide, but it is large enough to block enough sun without impairing your vision too much. The fringe trim and bright floral embroidery add a feminine touch.<br /><br />While it's true that the flower embroidery shows up under the brim, I think lining the hat to hide the underside of the stitching will just make the hat retain more heat and be heavier.",732995,4681

3.0,1578473968767,"Love the prints & subdued colors. Fit great, feel good. Wool content seems iffy. One had a hole.","Update: While I still think these socks are cute, the longer I have them, the more iffy the wool content seems to me. If you're mainly buying these with the wool in mind, maybe look elsewhere. If you're buying for the looks, they're super cute.<br /><br />With the caveat that you should check all the socks when they arrive (one of mine had a hole in it), I love these socks. I wear wool socks pretty much exclusively 3 seasons a year, so, although I'm a knitter, I can't make enough socks and usually buy lots of storebought ones to keep my sock drawer full all winter. Typically, I buy the warehouse store wool multipacks, but I'm never thrilled with the pattern/color selection (but the price is right--about the same as these per pair, but perhaps a little better value because they have a higher wool content than these).<br /><br />As a knitter, I'm always underwhelmed but the selection of storebought sock patterns and colors, and I really love these.  They're slightly unconventional, murkier than the colors you typical see in socks, but very pleasing to me. They're colorful without being loud or jarring. The patterns are similar across the socks (just different color orders, similar patterns), but the heels, toes, and cuffs are different solid colors, so they're super easy to pair up in the laundry.<br /><br />The fit was perfect on my women's US size 8-8.5 foot. You could probably go up to a 9, but not bigger, and they would still fit well on a 6 or 7. They're soft and warm. The patterning means they're thick and cushy over most of the sock, but that the heels and toes, which tend to wear the most, are actually thinner because there are no extra threads being carried behind the pattern. I hope this doesn't negatively influence wear. I'll report back if they wear poorly, but they're great starting out.",733043,8083

I just love the designs. They come cleverly packaged in a little plastic case and with a nice little cotton bag. The wires are a bit thick for my liking, but they are still manageable. They are a bit heavier than the earrings I usually wear. I wish they were hollow. Maybe they are, but the metal is pretty thick. they don't pull my ears down or anything. I just think I'm used to small earrings. Overall, if you're used to somewhat heavier earrings, these might work for you. They are definitely gorgeous.",733168,1147

I'm not a large person-5 foot 120 lbs- and I found the medium just fit with little wiggle room. The sleeves were kind of tight around the forearm and wrist area. If I'm wearing more layers, this sweater would not fit comfortably. I like the way the sweater hangs and the nice button detail on the sleeves, but I wish it was a bit bigger.",733168,22924
5.0,1563497910784,Beachy Cute,"I'm not sure what this is going for price wise at the time of this review, but it's a cute, touristy type necklace that fits perfect on the beach and with summer outfits.  The cord has an extender so you're not stuck with a choker type necklace if that's not what you want. The shell is a real shell, cute and inexpensive. I'd pay about $5-$7 for this necklace and wear at the beach. It's cute as long as the price is right and your expectations are set accordingly.",733168,478
5.0,1558716773691,Fit Small Feet Well,"I have a small foot, size 6, wide. I used to have a size 5 foot, but pregnancy often makes your hip joints expand to prepare for pregnancy and the feet figure ""why not"" and go along with it. Thanks, kids. Anyway, I still have a small foot, and these fit perfect. I think they will stretch enough for a thinner bigger foot, perhaps to a size 7 or 7 1/2 (I could be wrong), but it's important to know that these probably won't fit a bigger foot. They are cotton with some stretch material, probably Lycra, so they both stretch and wick moisture. There are some little gel thingies where the back of the heels go, so they don't slip down. Nice. They are thin, which I like, and form fitting. In the picture, the heel seems bunched up, but normally they lie flat. I was just in a hurry. Overall, these will fit children and smaller adult feet. I like them.",733168,3057

3.0,1621441829419,Kinda cheap and flimsy,"Cute, but not worth much more than like $5 in my opinion. I can see some beach shop selling these for surfers or sun goddesses, but they really don't play well in any other aspect. They are itchy to me and just lack any high quality to them.",733192,356

3.0,1605630328463,Bigger than I expected but lightweight,"These are very thin, but the circle is big. So you get the presence without the weight. Dark black and more Gothic style than what I go for, especially since they are large in my opinion.",733192,13811
3.0,1603722791138,"Comfortable, Nicely made, but nothing overly special about them","The grips are good so you don't slip and fall in the kitchen or bathroom, or if you have hardwood floors.

I did use in my ear cartilage and it was a little difficult to get it to close. They have to be lined up just perfectly and then just the right amount of pressure is needed. I haven't had a problem since putting it in my ear. It is very comfortable and hasn't gotten caught on towels, my hair, or my ear. It hasn't popped open, so it is good once you have it in, but I wouldn't want to change it out a lot due to how difficult to close correctly.",733192,656

The tie across the neckline is cute and the cinched waist help give definition to your body while the fabric is flowy and fun. Nice animal print is in style (when isn't it?).

He found them a struggle to put on, but well worth the comfort on his daily walk.<br /><br />Anyhow, there's enough elastic material in these socks to keep them tight, although that does mean they feel a bit polyester, unlike softer cotton athletic socks.<br /><br />These are expensive, but I think he will buy another pair if they last more than three months.",733195,34

The round part needs to cover almost all the breast for them to work like the pics. No wonder all the models are thin.  Hmmmm.  I am bummed because I was looking for a miracle, I guess, to help with not having to wear a bra all the time and eliminating the under boob sweating. They claim to do that, just not for me.

I had gotten my husband a quite expensive solar watch before and had a heck of a time getting it to charge up.  This one already had a charge so it was wearable immediately.

Also, the man's version had 2 very deep scratches on the plate.<br /> These would probably be fine for engraving if the sizes worked.<br />One really odd note: the packaging was weird. Both came in a single box, which is ok as it's meant to be a gift for  a couple. However, each piece was wrapped individually in some kind of clear plastic that was a pain to get off, especially the female version.

3.0,1565732930359,A Little Strange,"These glasses sounded interesting... tinted reading glasses aren't something I see everyday. However, the magnification part is only at the very bottom of the glasses, where there is no tint. So if you're, say, on the beach reading, and you want to protect your eyes from the bright white page, then these glasses don't deliver. You're going to be looking through the untinted part.<br /><br />So I can't quite understand how these are going to be useful. Perhaps in the car, when you want sunglasses for the outside, and the untinted part for reading while you drive. Or something.<br /><br />The glasses themselves seem fine. They are light and a little delicate and look nice on the face. They come with a soft carrying case. Overall, the quality and the price seem to match.<br /><br />Ultimately, these do not solve the problem of needing reading glasses in bright light. Instead, they just allow your pupils to dilate a bit from the dark, top part, while too-bright light still floods in from where you are actually looking when you read.",733339,9500

1.0,1637823326101,Beware! Terrible quality... Don't waste your time!,I was looking for a real leather bomber with a collar for the colder months and narrowed my search to this jacket... First red flag was when it was delivered it came fast but it was in a small bag and I was confused. I thought there was no way a leather jacket could fit in such a tiny package... But sure enough it was and when I picked it up it was very light. Right when I opened it I was disappointed. The leather looked so cheap and shiny with lines all over it and wrinkled like crazy. It's literally the worst quality jacket I've ever seen and I own over a dozen. It looks like something you'd find in a thrift store for $20 and to me it's not even worth $20. I'm not exaggerating it's that bad. I found small knicks in a few places also. It feels like a windbreaker and runs smaller than the measurements they advertise. The zipper is cheap feeling and doesn't zip smoth. I packed it right back up and it's going back. Take my word don't waste your time...,871999,544745

She is a tall 5 year old; the glasses fit well and provide ample space to grow into. They are sturdy and well made (from China). The glasses cover her eye area, the arms wrap nicely around 2/3 of her head. They did not come with a loop as pictured but for the price, style and quality I just added a croakie flowered strap in purple to suit my granddaughter's taste. She was so pleased she wore them both horseback and bike riding yesterday and aired no complaints about the glasses or not being able to see in the bright Florida sunlight. I am very pleased that they will help her protect her eyes, see better in bright sunlight (so she can perform her instructor's directions for her riding lessons) and the price point is reasonable.

2.0,1624039827584,Not great,"Polarization is a little uneven, which is normal for most brands without a big O on the side, but I figure I'd start with my lowest gripe 1st. The lenses aren't very dark at all, so much so that at the bottom it feels more like you aren't blocking any sun at all, which is really confusing on the eyes. The frame is clear, which is not smart at all because the manufacturer and country of origin is written in white on the inside, allowing it to show through backwards. That white inside paint flakes off leaving bits on the side of your face. The frames are not shatterproof at all and will break if you sit on them, it's the lenses that are shatterproof. Unisex is maybe... but they sure don't look good on men, so take that as you will. Lastly, who writes ""sunglasses"" on the side of sunglasses? It's like writing ""car"" on the side of your car. At least the chrome trim on the side is shiny I guess and they aren't uncomfortable. If you got these for next to nothing in price you'd probably chuck them in your beach bag and care little about damaging them or getting them covered in sunscreen, which is a nice thing compared to expensive brand-name shades, so +1.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click so below.

So if you like longer necklaces beware. The tree of Life is gorgeous, cubic zirconia rounds the front of the pendant. The best is the necklace or super shiny attracting all sorts of light, beautiful. Worst is the clasp itself is tiny and adjoining hook used to complete the clasp loop is ridiculously small. I have really long nails it's mission impossible for me to clasp without help.

3.0,1563291664624,This wallet looks nice.,This wallet looks nice on the outside.  Inside there are a lot of quality problems which you can see in the photos that I uploaded.  The most noticeable problem would be the strange crusty stain over the card slots.  The stain is part of the leather that was used.  The layers of leather stitched together to create the card slots are misaligned and the stitching is sloppy.  It is very noticeable since they use heave white thread on black leather.  The area of stitching next to the card slots actually has a hole in the leather.  There is frayed thread next to the cash pouch where the seam from the outer layer of leather folds in onto the inside of the wallet.  There is nothing hiding these seams.  It all looks very sloppy.<br /><br />The outside looks nice.  The wallet is sturdy.  There are not any quality issues with the exterior of the wallet.

I've seen many vintage hats with this color combo/velvet thing going on, but the brim...the brim ruins it all. It looks like a Halloween costume. Like cheap felt. I am not a fan of the brim. I think I shall decorate this hat and make it a fourth of July hat, anything to hide the brim. It's a little big, but really that's to be expected. I'm a 21 and I believe this fits like a 22. The brim is somewhat floppy while the top has a fedora style, so points for being interesting",948484,7176
3.0,1547762766977,"Lovely Dress, Terrible Belt","Dress is lovely, albeit very staticky. May need to run it through the dryer. By itself, with no belt, it has a 1920s silhouette. I'm into vintage fashion so this is a plus for me. My husband prefers it with a belt, however, just not the one that came with it. Belts. If it's wide, a couple inches, like this one, make it firm enough not to became a mess every time you move at the waist. On top of that, the belt kept unsnapping. Bend over, snap! Bend over again, it's literally just tied on. Get rid of the snaps and make the belt from a firmer material would be my advice. The dress, fit wise, fit me perfectly, and I'm 36, 28, 40.",948484,4700
5.0,1544141290322,"Warm, Soft","I'm not a big fan of hats and scarves because they itch. Not so, this matching set. It's incredibly soft and nonirritating against the skin. It can be washed cold, line dried. (I wouldn't put it in the dryer for fear of ruining the cute pompom). I love the color combination, the stitching patterns they used, the softness of the material, the size of both pieces. The scarf is wonderfully wide, meaning you can put over your face one time, and don't have to wrap it multiple times around your neck. Very nice gift set. I'd recommend it for any woman in your life.",948484,383

I had cataracts removed a few months ago, so now I don't need glasses for distance vision.

I clip my keys to the same place where the cross-body strap is attached (or can be detached if you want to simply use the wrist loop for carrying). The tassel is a good reminder of which way the purse should hang, so that I can show ID very easily and quickly. Everyone remarks on how chic it looks.",948516,22925

There's an L embroidered on the left sock and an R embroidered on the right sock, near the toes. I'm not a full-fledged hiker, but I have to walk the dog, and I have a lot of trouble with my feet.

5.0,1578930583253,Love These Socks,"What a great balance between style and function.  Socks are lightweight and not overly bulky which is a plus considering these are merino wool and will hold in the heat better.  Colors are fun without being too loud.  Only negative potentially could be the length, but that's irrelevant if you like the length.  Overall, a great value considering what you get for the $$.",948650,5023

2.0,1564972705824,Huge glasses,I was surprised at how large these glasses are. They are huge and not complimentary in any way.

Much better options out there.,948650,7233
4.0,1558239973604,Think 50's housewife working,"From a throwback perspective, the style of this headband is rather cute. Definitely reminds me of a 50's housewife doing house chores.

4.0,1581388977900,Pretty cuff,While I know this is meant to fit everyone that doesn’t mean it’s very comfortable for everyone. I do like how it looks and the size of the cuff it just feels weird on my wrist. My 9 year old really liked it though and so I gave it to her. It’s definitely an accessory to make a nice date outfit have a little more jazz or just for a party. It’s light weight and nice to look at.,948664,3459
4.0,1581388576123,Cheap feeling but nice,"These bangles are cute and nice to wear, they just have a cheap feel to them. I would of preferred there be an even amount between the three metal colors but I’m happy with having more silver if anything else. Over all I think they’re a wonderful accessory to fluff up almost any outfit and I’d recommend them.",948664,7266
5.0,1577670382712,"Easy to adjust, cute for all girls",This is a very cute cap I got for my 9 year old daughter. She love wearing them in the summer and loves purple so I thought she’d really like this and she does. The back to tighten it is different than I’m used to but it’s nice and easy to do. My daughter really likes the sequin on the bill of the hat and says that it is comfortable to wear. I think the quality of the hat is pretty nice and I see it lasting a while. Definitely recommend.,948664,279130
5.0,1576549942061,"Cute, warm and very one size fits all almost",This is such a wonderful winter hat! It’s very cute and both my 9 and 5 year old love to wear it. It is just a tad bug for my 5 year old but still stays on her and is very comfortable to wear for my 9 year old and myself. I love how it fits all of us without having to ha e different sizes. The pink is a cute soft pink and the inside is a very soft white material. The hat brim is really neat and definitely helpful on very sunny days in the snow to help you see a little better. It keeps your ears and a good part of your head warm while out in the snow. I definitely recommend them for the whole family!,948664,1973

You don't see a set of these very often, so they catch the eye.",962461,1056
4.0,1585934604480,Small and lightweight,"These are fairly small bags. They have mesh lined centers on one side (for breath-ability), and plenty of zippered pockets. Canvas type material should hold up well to handling. They only have a hand carry strap, but would be better if they included a shoulder strap.  Not sure how much gym gear you can really get in these due to their size, but they are handy for smaller items. One of these is slightly smaller than the other (when they arrive, one is packed inside the other). Still, for general use, maybe even as a lunch bag, these are pretty good.

5.0,1567071273099,Nice style,"Got this for the wife thinking it would be just what she'd like, and she does, but she prefers smaller handbags, as this one is a bit larger than I thought it was. Plenty of storage pockets, a great leather feel, a zippered side pocket, and a sturdy strap. I'll go ahead and give it to my daughter, as she like these larger bags, and the style and color (a darker tan), goes with just about everything, and the way it's made, it should last a long time. I don't think it's too big, but what do I know about fashion other than 'thinking' this is a nice gift...and it IS. I like the feel of it, and if they made a toolbag out of this stuff, I'd be using it.",962461,588
5.0,1564725866826,Perfect for outdoor reading,"Saves you from carrying along a set of both sunglasses and reading glasses, without a prescription. These are very light, have a unique nose bridge (actually pretty cool idea) with rubber tips, and no wrap around the ear braces, to reduce that irritation. The shade is just enough above the 'bi-focal' reader lens that you can read outdoors.  As for the reader lens, it is thicker than the sunglasses, so there is a visible line, but really, who cares, these are useful. They also come with a decent zippered case and a microfiber cleaning cloth. I won't be forgetting these on a restaurant dining table, these are keepers.",962461,9500

5.0,1569872828451,Good Fit,"If you routinely ride bicycles, then you really shouldn't need these shorts unless you have issues.  As it stands, they do offer a good amount of cushion.  In the last 3 years, I've ridden almost 2k miles on my bike, and my butt doesn't really hurt anymore.  It did at first, but it got used to the seat over time.  It only took about a month, but it was a rough month.  With these shorts, I think they could've helped with that break in period.  In fact, these are best for new cyclists.  I've found that the sore butt can be the biggest issue keeping people from hopping on the bike again.  WIth these pads, it'll help them over that hump, until they don't need them anymore.  These certainly have a ton of padding, and offer good support when riding.  I just didn't like them, because they lift you a little bit higher out of the seat.  If you have your seat set at a specific height, you may need to lower it tad, if you wear these.  Price is on point for most riding gear.",1005216,11140

When I received it, I opened it and looked it over finding it to be more and different than I originally thought.  It is a little blue crystal with what appears to be coral for clouds inside it...<br /><br />Cleverly made, it really gets a lot of compliments from even unknown passers-by.

I trust them at their word because they have no reason to lie to me, but, this thing is so simple, but VERY artfully crafted that I soon forget the value added of RFID because they are just a handsome simple men's wallet.<br /><br />The fact is, it has many great hidden features other than its good looks...  What is amazing, truly astounding to me, is that It is so comfortable in my front pocket, loaded with cards and ID and a little bit of cash that I literally forgot it was there and panicked that I didn't have my stuff with me!!!<br /><br />I feel there is only one downside that I will resolve over time...  Not enough to take away a star, but a downside initially, is that it is a tiny bit difficult to quickly retrieve from my pocket...  The fact is, I think that will improve with use....<br /><br />That downside could be viewed as a benefit as the wallet won't work it's way out of your front pocket...  My son really likes the wallet, so I guess I will have to keep an eye on it...<br /><br />I can just hear it now....  ""Dad, I wasn't stealing your cash and credit cards!

When I grew up you either wore boxers (usually made out of cotton with no elastic) or you wore briefs (spun cotton that gave you support).  When they combined the two, I was in hog heaven.  The comfort of a boxer but the support of a brief  This is how I base my review and taking into consideration cost.<br />First off, as many have noted, this does not have a fly front (Y front for the Brits).  This is nice for obvious reasons.<br />The fabric is very thin so it does not give much support.<br />As the fabric is mostly polyester, it should last but the  briefs will probably loose even more shape.<br />The one good thing is the price at $5 which is about what they are worth.  I will probably stick to better known brands and wait for the Black Friday sales where I  can get a much better product at about double the cost.",1005344,11941

Also, when you take them out of the envelope box (which is a cute idea) I thought these are not crew sock but full over the calf socks but for my size 12 feet, they are the perfect crew length.<br />The following are some of the issues I have with these socks:<br />There is not enough elastin so the socks creep down a bit or roll up at the top.<br />With one pair of socks they got a pull in the foot catching on something in the shoe (never had this happen before but suspect the weave being the cause)<br />While the pattern is nice, most of the fun part is on the foot, which is not seen when wearing shoes.  If you like running around in your socks at home this might be a better use of the sock design.<br />Overall, not bad but also not great",1005344,91536

You have the option to wear these together or split them up and wear individually.  The price is great for the quality; especially considering that you get 2 fabulous pieces.<br /><br />To care for these necklaces, you would want to take them off for showering and sleeping and definitely avoid getting lotions, perfumes, or other tarnishing substances on them.  They come in a small box that would be suitable to store them in when you’re not wearing.  This would definitely make a fabulous gift to yourself or someone special.

I tried these because I wanted to be able to check my phone or read a few lines when out and about or riding in the car.  For that, they worked great and I don’t even think I had a problem with the bifocal nature of them.  I think my eyes are just spoiled from 30 years of wearing sunglasses with glass lenses, such that when I wear any other kind now, I get a little nauseous.

Only pressing one, as you might by accident, won't open the buckle. Opens and closes easily and securely.<br /><br />The belts don't slip while I use them.<br /><br />They come correctly put together, so you can see how they'll need to look if you need to take the buckle off one end to get the belt through the loops on your pants, as you probably will. The buckle is 2"". The webbing is just under 1-1/2"" wide.<br /><br />The strap is 47"" long, and the buckle adds almost 2"" more. Keep in mind that pants sizes measure a couple inches larger inside than their stated size (guess why!), that pants measure more outside than inside, and that you need a few inches at the end of the belt to pass through the buckle, so pants size 44 is probably about the practical limit for these, maybe less if you don't want it to look like you're at the very end of your belt.<br /><br />You can cut the free end of the belt to make it shorter, but you'd probably want to melt the new end to keep it from unraveling.<br /><br />Vinner, as used here, doesn't appear to be a registered brand in the US.

4.0,1581992321806,Measurements for size 32; Care instructions,"Looks like these aren't being sold at the moment, but just in case ...<br /><br />The size 32 I received is labeled 32x34. The waist measures 34"" inside and stretches out to past 40"". Size 32 usually measures 34"" now (because we're bigger there than we think), so that's about right, with plenty of stretch if needed.<br /><br />The inseams measure 32-3/4"".<br /><br />They ride a little low, not a lot.<br /><br />The legs do get progressively skinnier as they go down. Above the knees they're a couple inches thinner around than my regular-fit denims, what I'd call slim. Below the knees they get several inches thinner. The opening at the end is 12-3/4"" and stretches out to 16"".<br /><br />The fabric stretches quite a bit widthwise and on both diagonals.<br /><br />Lightly pre-distressed, including being roughed up above the knee.<br /><br />Machine wash cold with like colors, gentle cycle, non-chlorine bleach if needed, tumble dry low heat, cool iron.<br /><br />Made in Bangladesh.",1017288,9523
4.0,1550033757181,Random length? Measurements (short) and cut (low); Care instructions,"All of us early reviewers seem to have ordered size ""34,"" but one received ""34x34"" and two of us received ""34x30."" I also ordered a size ""34"" of the relaxed-fit Genuine Assembly jeans, and they turned out to be ""34x32."" Hopefully they'll start being more specific about the sizing.<br /><br />The waist on the ""34x30"" I got measures 35"" inside, which is actually an inch *less* than most 34s measure (because we're bigger there than we think), but it stretches out to about 42"". So if you normally wear a 34 waist, meaning you usually have 36"" of room, these will still feel roomy enough.<br /><br />The inseams measure 29-1/2"", so a little shorter than the 30"" claimed on the tag.<br /><br />The cut is slim as advertised, about 2-1/2"" less around in the thighs than some similarly-size regular-cut Lee jeans I have, and a couple inches less in the calves too. But they're very stretchy, easily expanding to larger than the Lees. I think there's more elastane in the material than claimed.<br /><br />They ride a little lower than the Lees, probably lower than some will prefer, but they feel OK for me with a belt to keep them from getting any lower. That lessens the room in the crotch, but not uncomfortably so.<br /><br />The change pocket is over 5"" long but only 2"" at its deepest part. Seems less safe to me.<br /><br />Machine wash cold with like colors, gentle cycle, non-chlorine bleach only if needed, tumble dry low heat, cool iron.<br /><br />Made in Bangladesh.",1017288,9417
5.0,1547604934790,Measurements for Medium Regular (roomy),"These are the measurements for the size medium regular I received (with the sizes they correspond to on size charts). Keep in mind that for some measurements, such as chest and waist, you may want some extra room, so they should be larger than your body measurements, and those shirt measurements have been getting larger than stated over the last few years (because people are larger than they think in some directions), so if you usually wear a medium, this may feel normal. It does to me, but I wear medium and large.<br /><br />Neck 15-3/4"" (M-L)<br />Chest 46"" (L-XL)<br />Waist 44-3/4"" (L)<br />Sleeves 34-3/4"" (M-L)<br /><br />This style has the open button-top pockets, one with a pen holder.<br /><br />The fabric feels sturdy and durable.<br /><br />Machine wash, no bleach, tumble dry.<br /><br />Made in Honduras.",1017288,14278

4.0,1629909353075,Not bad,"Not the most amazing quality but they aren’t bad I probably wouldn’t wear these for actually working out as the material is kind of stiffer then I like but I do wear with T-shirts around the house so I’m happy with them, they are high waisted sitting right above my belly button. True to size they are a large and I wear a size 10. The thigh area is not tight just right. I really like that they have pockets. They are not see-through.",1017314,6780

I really like the endless hoop it is alot harder to yank these out accidentally when combing my hair. The hoops snap into each other so there is no little wire to string into a tube like the other kinds of hoops. The titanium is strong and did not cause any skin irritation or problems when inserted.  The diffrent sizes are great and the hoops are nice quality and seem durable. Great value pack of sizes.,1030814,656

The length was really long on me so I had to wear high heels underneath so I was not walking on the hem of the pants. I am short so I expected these to be long on me. The legs are a wide leg so allow freedom of movement and the pants are a medium weight material. These are not see through and they are comfortable to wear.

4.0,1582581632462,Navy blue floral summer dress,Manaixuan summer tunic dress. This tunic dress is cute and I like the bold bright colors. It is see through so you will need a slip. I like the sleeves they are layered and 3/4 length. The dress fits well and ties at the neck in front on the neck chest area and lands above my knee. I am 5'4 111lbs and a 34D and this size medium fit well. Cute tunic dress for work or a casual evening out. The material is thin as I mentioned and it does wrinkle. I fluff dried this dress and the wrinkle mostly disappeared. Cute navy blue floral print summer dress.,1030814,69323
3.0,1580947341088,14k gold plated moon pendant necklace,Hugitout 14k gold plated necklace. So I think that this is a cute necklace but it looks somewhat cheap. The design is nice and the pendant is cute it is not overly sparkly so that was nice. The chains both look on the cheaper side and made it feel like costume jewlery. With a nice chain it would have been a diffrent story. The rose gold color was a fake rose gold and it was to shiny and the color was slightly off. Now the necklace is cute and delicate and I would still wear it with casual everyday clothes. I would give this as a gift to a preteen or a teenager. I would not give this to my mother.  Cute necklace for a sentimental gift or a nice stocking stuffer.,1030814,9552

The socks come to just under my knees. Being a nurse and on your feet all the time can take a toll on your lower legs.  Swelling is just part of the job description until these socks.

They are slightly opaque but not actually see through. Great for under dresses, scrubs, and long tops. I would not suggest someone wear these without a really long top to cover your rear end. Definitely dont bend over unless said top also covers your rear end completely. I am 111lbs 5'4 and I recieved the size small and they fit great. They are controlled on the top and have a decent light compression. They stayed up without sliding down my legs during work. The 2 pack is a great deal and the quality is good. Soft material and good fit. Great black footless leggings.",1030814,7037

3.0,1567052004990,Gold aviator sunglasses,Aviator sunglasses.  The glasses have a gold frame and a black green colored lens.  I  gave 3 stars bc the arms are not coated where they go over your ears so they are not as comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The glasses are light weight and fit well.

4.0,1566691748840,Retro square frame sunglasses for women,Oversized square frame blush colored sunglasses.  The square frame is very retro and the color is great.

3.0,1582354001704,Good Quality But a Little Funky on the Design,"We got these for our daughter and she only likes them okay.  The quality is good, with a nice lightweight denim that's stretchy and comfortable.  The waistband too has a good amount of stretch, and the belt is cute and plenty long enough for a bow.  The front flap of the skort, however, doesn't come around very far and falls awkwardly right in the front middle.  It would like better if the flap came farther around.  Some might like it but my daughter isn't crazy about it.  Nice enough skort but a little funky.",1030935,4592
4.0,1577853702735,Fun and Funky,"This is a great bohemian style necklace.  I wish it went further around the neck, but it is a fun piece.

A really easy way to make a statement.",1030935,9357
3.0,1575931798731,Only Okay,"We got this full-zip fleece jacket for our daughter and it's neither bad nor great.  The first thing that was a little bit disappointing was that it doesn't look as plush in person as in the pictures.  The nap looks smaller and shorter in person.  The material is thankfully very soft, both on the outside and on the inside which features a liner that's really comfy and smooth.  The jacket provides pretty good warmth thanks to the outer layer and the liner.  It's not like a heavy coat, but it's nice for cool temps where you don't want something needlessly bulky.  The fit is accurate.  The one other complaint, however, is that the zipper doesn't move smoothly (at least in the up direction - down is fine).  It tends to catch several times when she zips it up.  Overall this isn't a bad fleece layer and our daughter likes it fine, but it's not quite as good as I expected.",1030935,99
2.0,1573611270252,Only Okay,"These active shorts are okay but not great.  The first thing I noticed was that the color of them is a little more on the bluish-purple side compared to the royal blue in the pictures.  The color is nice and vibrant, but not exactly what I expected.  The material is lightweight and comfortable and has a good stretch to it.  Unfortunately the fit leaves something to be desired.  They are not as short as traditional dedicated running shorts, but are shorter than typical basketball shorts.  The fit is quite tight around the upper thighs and crotch areas, which even though they're stretchy isn't a great feel during active wear.  I'd only recommend these for skinny guys.  The fact that they only have one small pocket on the rear makes them most suitable for running, but they're longer and tighter than I'd want for that.  In the end, I'm not really sure what they're going for but I'm not loving them.",1030935,7043
5.0,1566240107836,Lightweight and offers good protection,"I have very sensitive eyes and so I am always on the lookout for a good and stylish pair of sunglasses.  These definitely get the job done.  I like the very slight cat-eye shape of the lenses and they have dark enough protection for my highly sensitive eyes.  I liked that they are lightweight and very much stayed in place.  My 10 year old daughter liked them too and so now we are ""fighting"" over them which is a good sign of a great product!",1030935,179
4.0,1565965501386,Pretty Nice Boxer Briefs,"Got these for my son and we like them pretty well.  They're described as ""cotton stretch"" briefs, though they are actually 30% cotton 70% polyester.  Not especially accurate, but the fabric does feel more like traditional cotton than the currently popular dry-fit type of synthetic material.  The fabric is soft and very stretchy, with a comfortable waistband that does not bind.  The sizing is accurate, and with a very stretchy give they'll be pretty forgiving if your a little larger or smaller than the actual size.  These fit close, with tight leg holes - making them ideal for active pursuits where you don't want your underwear riding up and down or moving around.  I personally would prefer a little more give in the legs for everyday wear, but not a big deal.  Overall pretty nice boxer briefs, especially if you like a close fit.",1030935,3055
3.0,1564806783575,Okay,"Ordered two of these 2 piece tie sets and the results are mixed.  First, I got the pink striped and black with white dots tie set, and it's okay.  They're quite skinny and not quite as long as I like my ties - being on the tall side, I don't get enough of a tail end on these to tuck into the loop on the back.  If you're of average height that shouldn't be an issue.  The black tie is basic and handsome, but the pink tie has sparkly accents that are a little much for me.  Both ties have a nice weight and hold their shape well.  Not a thing wrong with these ties, but nothing particularly special about them either.<br />The 2nd set has one tie with a pink floral design and one with a purple checked theme.  These two share the same nice thick material with the other set, and look even better.  I love both designs and the colors are rich and handsome.  Oddly, the purple one is fairly skinny but the pink one is quite a bit wider and a little longer, which I like.  Between the two sets, this is definitely my favorite.",1030935,6791
5.0,1564273432707,Very Handsome,"I really like this belt.  The leather has a nice thickness and heft, but is very pliable and soft.  It measures approximately 1 1/2 inches wide, so it's not skinny but has more of a wide masculine look.  The buckle is a bit darker in person and has a brushed gun metal gray color - looks great.  The leather has nice texture work that gives it some character: dimpled all over with two embossed strips running the length of the belt and and embossed section where the belt holes are.  There are also some red & gray thread accents around the loop holder behind the buckle, which are subtle but attractive.  The overall look is sporty and understated and versatile enough to go very casual or more dressy.  Good quality leather and great looks make this one a winner.",1030935,110144
3.0,1560915977020,Cute hat but too small for my head,I loved this hat design and was pleasantly surprised when I opened it as it is made of a great material that can be folded up and does not show any wrinkles.  I was unhappy thought when I went to put it on my head it was too small to fit me comfortably. I would have loved for it to have fit me as I would have worn it to every beach and sim event I got invited to.  It really is cute and stylish...just too small for me. I feel like I have an average sized head as most hats fit me so I am not sure about their sizing.,1030935,7959
5.0,1556254213584,Love It,"I really dig this belt.  The ratchet adjustment system allows for a truly custom fit.  You'll need to trim the belt to your desired length, and the process is easy: open the latch on the back of the buckle that holds the belt, pull the belt out and trim it (be careful not to trim too much!), then re-insert the cut end back into the latch and press it closed.  The buckle is slightly large but not so much as to be distracting or unappealing, and it has a nice clean style.  The leather is handsome and pleasingly thick.  Releasing the belt is easy using the small lever, and wearing the belt is a breeze - and the fit is perfect.  Great belt all around.",1030935,103413
3.0,1546485815872,Fine But Unexceptional,"Got these for my 9 year old daughter, and she likes them.  Thankfully they seem to have a small-ish fit, so they work just fine for her size-wise (and they aren't adjustable).  The burgundy color is disappointingly darker than I expected, and is a very dark brown - not much lighter than the black headband.  I thought they'd be lighter in color.  The quality seems okay but not great - just a thin presumably plastic frame covered with fabric and muffs.  The ear pieces are quite comfortable, with ample padding and a soft touch to the faux fur.  Overall they're acceptably cute and warm but not great.",1030935,9462

3.0,1651343099109,Weird sizing,"My arm where these hit me is 7"" around.  I have a very skinny forearm and wrist.  These gloves are plenty big in the hands, but are too tight at my arm.  And they have these rings around the end that roll up and pinch!  And the latex rubber pulls on my arm hairs.  A pretty unpleasant experience.<br />They show these on men's hands.  I don't know any men that could get these  over their wrist, much less their arm.<br /><br />The other problem is your hands sweat badly in them.  Especially if you are using hot water.  And then you can't get them off.  I mean really.  It's like a chinese finger trap.  I have had to peel them off inside out and then go through the hassle of getting them turned right side out again, which takes forever.<br /><br />The only good thing about them is they are tough and don't get holes.  But since I'm going to stop using them in favor of better gloves--that won't even be an issue!",1066735,14883

And it's terrible.  The earrings are unwearable because the wires are too thin and flimsy and they don't ""catch"" in the other side.  The wire is not quite long enough and the hold not set up deep enough or something.  The weight of the earring hanging from the wires--just pops the clasp open every time.  That's AFTER fighting for 5 minutes to get it in place once it's on your ear.<br />Epic fail on an otherwise lovely item.",1066735,4602

It's a perfect length on me--the bottom ""point"" hits me just below the breastbone--above my cleavage so it works with summer tank blouses as well as winter sweaters.<br />Very pleased, it's a new favorite in my wardrobe!",1066735,38266
5.0,1571605538339,Very Classy and Upscale!,"This is a very lightweight purse, but not cheap looking.  It's got a bit of ""sheen"" to it.  The zippers all work very well and slide smoothly.  I always check this first as the really cheap junk often has ""sticky"" zippers.  This bag is also comfortable to wear on the shoulder, with minimal slipping,a nd of course it long enough to be a cross body bag, as that's what they call it.<br /><br />Love the shiny gold zippers and the leatherette tassle.  Plenty roomy for almost everything I need (and I take multiple lipsticks, hand lotion, brush, wallet, travel bag in pouch, travel dog water bowl, another pouch for extras, breath mint containers, pill containers. etc.  plus cell phones and dog clean up bags!  So, it carries all that and still dosn't look like luggage--it looks trim and small sized.<br /><br />I can't speak to its durability as a daily use purse being thrown around everyday, I only use it occasionally when I want to look a little less casual.

They're only crew socks though, and they're only about half wool, so these aren't for SUPER cold days.

5.0,1628916045256,Great comfort and many colors,I originally purchased these socks in all black in two sizes in packs of three. Both felt great but had to turn down the top of large socks because they came over knee. Very comfortable and good tapered compression. I’ve been wearing these type of socks for varicose veins for years. These socks are the best I’ve ever used. I decided to order additional socks that are available in different colors and patterns. These were packaged as single pairs. I ordered eight pair of different colors and patterns in the smaller size. Couldn’t have been more pleased. The packaging was very up scale and reminded me of packaging by apple. It set the tone for what was inside… a very high quality sock. All socks even the all black that I ordered originally in three pack have withstood many machine washings on cold cycle. I hang them up for quick dry. I also like the logo at the top and colored heels and toes. This feature allow me to align socks on sock donner for quick and accurate alignment. I really like adding color back into my wardrobe. I think over the years there haven’t been many choice for those of us that are limited  to compression socks. Thanks for providing a great product! I tried another brand that had interesting colors but inside of sock was not finished well and was lacking improper support. This is a combined report for three multiple purchases over last three or four months. Thanks for delivering a quality product that looks and feels good and gives support.,1184780,2988

5.0,1628915762639,Best compression sock ever,I originally purchased these socks in all black in two sizes in packs of three. Both felt great but had to turn down the top of large socks because they came over knee. Very comfortable and good tapered compression. I’ve been wearing these type of socks for varicose veins for years. These socks are the best I’ve ever used. I decided to order additional socks that are available in different colors and patterns. These were packaged as single pairs. I ordered eight pair of different colors and patterns in the smaller size. Couldn’t have been more pleased. The packaging was very up scale and reminded me of packaging by apple. It set the tone for what was inside… a very high quality sock. All socks even the all black that I ordered originally in three pack have withstood many machine washings on cold cycle. I hang them up for quick dry.

It gets caught in my jacket easily and the clasp is not strong enough to secure it. So, be careful and mindful.<br /><br />I love the fact that the message is in Morse code and therefore not a whole lot of people will know what it says. It makes for a great gift. The beads are gold plated in 14k gold.<br /><br />The bracelet comes in a ready to gift box.<br /><br />I think any aunt would love this (I do), especially a new one. I imagine this would be a great reveal gift for a new aunt. Telling her it is Morse code and she needs to figure out what it says.",1226019,65408

3.0,1563069504476,It's an ok necklace,"I usually go for silver accessories over ""fake"" gold, but I actually think this is a cute little necklace. The chain is thin and not ""sturdy"". I also don't see the gold color holding up too long and will tarnish. It is cute and I'll probably wear it sometimes as long as it holds up. I think it'd be very cute for a young girl teenager. I have to say though that the price is a bit high for the quality.",1226070,3594
1.0,1561767006412,Junk!,I personally found this necklace to be very cheap and for lack of a better word cheesey looking. This necklace came up on my Vine queue. I like what's supposed to be .925 silver. I decided to try it out. It reminds me if those $1 necklaces you get on that one app where they claim to be silver and come from China. It's very cute and would be nice for a very young girl 10-12 years old. If it costs more than $2 it's too much. Also the clasp would get stuck open. It comes in a little zip lock bag. I really don't recommend this necklace.,1226070,479
5.0,1583895794621,Great Gift!,"My husband really likes bracelets - well, bracelets and watches. So, I am always on the lookout for interesting new bracelets for him to enjoy. Because he's a little rough on stuff, bracelets don't last too long. He actually had a similar style leather bracelet that we got about six months ago, and we had to superglue it back together - so I am hoping the metal clasp on this one is sturdier. The three bands means that it is more breathable on his skin and as warmer weather approaches, I think that this will be a favorite. The brown leather is nicely braided and he was pretty enthusiastic about it when he opened it. It makes a great gift, and has a nice velvety bag with a drawstring enclosure that is included. My husband has a larger wrist size, and this fits him snugly, but not too snugly, so I would say that it definitely runs to the larger side.",1226080,7367
4.0,1580852383091,Very Pretty,"I love this shape of earring that are a little like ear crawlers, so you can twist them so that the swoops of the leaves goes up your ear, rather than hangs down it. The rose gold color is really pretty. These are a little larger than I first expected, so they come a bit closer to being on the gaudy side. But, they catch the light nicely and have a very ""spring"" look to them. I can see that these would be a great gift for Mother's Day!",1226080,11084
5.0,1573091612845,Perfect To Bring A Little Sunshine To Your Outfit!,"I really like this flowing little open tunic top - it's versatile and so very bright and cheerful! I think it's probably too casual to wear to work, but I definitely would recommend it for weekend wear! I think that you can pair this with a variety of outfits underneath and really make it feel like something new, even though it really does stand out because of the lovely sunshine color. I think that a more neutral color might be even more versatile, but just wouldn't be as fun! This is a definite addition to my next vacation bag!!",1226080,1066
4.0,1573087490743,Cute For Layering!,"I don't usually like sweaters that are so ""holey"" but I like this oatmeal color a lot - plus, you can wear it for a longer range of months because it requires layering. With a tank underneath, it's fine for summer! With longer sleeves underneath, perfect for fall! And with a tank under and then a larger cardigan over, it works for fall/winter! I am a little scared of something snagging it, but other than that, it's a great and versatile sweater!",1226080,2609
5.0,1621709330443,"Very Comfortable, Just the Right Amount of Compression","Here's what my wife had to say about these socks: I have been a fan of Forcool socks since I bought my first pair, and these socks are no exception. They have extra padding and cushion in the toes, the balls of the feet, the top of the foot, and the Achilles tendon area, all areas that have a potential to rub or chaff when out walking, running, or hiking. They provide a comfortable amount of compression which keeps them from slipping or bunching up, and yet provide excellent flexibility no matter how I move or twist my feet. Each sock has a pull tab in the back that is useful for getting the sock on. There is extra ribbing on the sole of each sock for added arch support. The seams are totally smooth and well sewn. There are breathable mesh ""windows"" on the sides of each sock to allow for ventilation. As an added plus, the socks are stylish in their pattern and design. A mesh laundry bag is included. An insert explains that using the mesh bag will help extend the life of my socks. These are excellent socks, and I'm very pleased with them.",1226083,265078
5.0,1615220488731,Work Well for Cleaning,"Per my wife: These long yellow gloves fit nicely in a size small and go all the way up to within three inches of my elbow. They are more than long enough for me to immerse my hands in soapy water or to scrub out showers and other areas without getting my hands and forearms covered with chemical cleaning agents. The gloves have raised grips, like a screen door pattern, in all the fingertips and on the palms. This helps give me a better grip on things like scrub brushes or cleaning cloths. the gloves have a cheerful flower pattern on the back of each hand. The gloves are thick enough to make me think they will hold up under regular use, and yet they are flexible enough that I can easily bend my fingers and twist my hands around as needed when cleaning things. The extra ribbing around the top of the gloves created a good seal to keep the gloves from slipping off and to keep water from entering the gloves. 5 stars.",1226083,14883
5.0,1608344039849,"Good Work Belts, Good Price","These are extremely strong work type belts.  Having worn actual ""tactical"" belts I wouldn't actually call these ""tactical"" unless you're talking about paintball.  I've been using these type belts for the past year or so and none have worn out yet.  I suspect they'll outlive me.  Important to note that you do have to remove one of the buckles to fit the belt through standard belt loops.  Bottom line is that the quick release feature works great if you're not changing the belt but every time you put the belt on a new pair of pants, you have to remove one of the buckles - and you can only remove one of the two - in order to string it through a normal set of belt loops.  Basically you leave the two parts of the ""buckle"" connected, sting the belt through your belt loops and then restring the webbing  through the one side of the buckle.  It's quick and easy once you get used to it.  They recommend that you not cut the belt but I cut it a 3 or 4 inches longer than I need and sear the new end with a heat gun.  Works great.  A number of 3 belts sets on Amazon are identical, and I mean identical, but these are the least expensive I've found.",1226083,2943
4.0,1598132958567,Comfortable and Good Looking,Socks fit as expected.  Appropriate for casual wear. All around I liked these socks with one small exception.  Where the pattern changes in color there is some excess material on the inside of the socks.  Most of it doesn't bother me but the excess material near the toes tended to get my attention in a negative way.  I suspect I just have extra sensitive toes.  The material didn't bother me anywhere else.,1226083,7426
4.0,1624452540443,Super Cute!,"Being that I love earrings and silver, when I saw these up for request on Vine I clicked right away and here we are! This review is for: S925 Sterling Silver Handsome Cool Personality Circle Trendy Earrings with S925 Silver Needle for Women Girls.<br /><br />In short, these are super cute. It's the little charms on there that make these special. The charms almost look like the tool icon on my PC. The only problem with them is that they can easily fall off when taking the earrings on and off. The charms are so small that if they fall off you might have a difficult time finding them again! It is the charms though that move about a little bit and catch the eye.<br /><br />These are sterling silver and they caused no irritation to my ears like cheap earrings often do. For the price these earrings are a good buy and because they're silver they should last a good long time. Just be careful of those tiny charms!",1226127,65563
4.0,1618931096442,Cool Rings!,"Being that I started reviewing here at Amazon by reviewing horror books, these rings are right up my alley! That is why I requested them from Vine. This review is for: YADOCA 9 Pieces Vintage Punk Rings Octopus Dragon Snake Adjustable Ring for Men Women Silver Black Claw<br /><br />To be honest, I really was after the tentacle ring. For anyone into the Cthulhu mythos, tentacles play a part in that and when I saw that ring I had to request this set.<br /><br />The rest of the rings are okay. Some of them have too high of a profile for me to wear. By that, I mean they stick out a lot at the top. I have problems with them catching in drawers and catching on anything, in fact.<br /><br />I like the snake rings as well. The skulls and stuff really aren't for me, but I know someone at work that would like them. I did find that not all of the rings are adjustable, so just be aware of that fact.<br /><br />By the price I'm sure you can tell this isn't expensive or bougie jewelry. However, for the price this set of 9 rings is a good buy. So far, I haven't had any problems with the ones I've worn. If that changes, I will come back and adjust my review accordingly. As of right now, these rings are just what I expected! Long live Cthulhu!",1226127,955
3.0,1609452532335,Okay,"This review is of: Udalyn 4 Pendant Necklace Tassel Necklace Electroplating Platinum Clavicle Necklace Female Jewelry.<br /><br />Four necklaces arrived, all silver-so far, so good. Two of them are on silver cord, not chains. That's fine, I guess, but the cord looks cheap. The left-most necklace in my picture above,  has a tassel on the bottom made of several small chains. As soon as I put it on, a chain fell down my shirt. I wore it to work and when I got into my car later that day to go home, I found two more of the small chains on the floor of my car.<br /><br />I absolutely love the one that has a silver knot shape with the tassels hanging down. That one seems to have stayed intact, though I've worn it many times so far.<br /><br />The one with the three flat circles is just okay. It's nice to wear for day to day use, but it's not going to knock anyone's socks off.<br /><br />I love silver jewelry, but I don't like spending a lot of money all the time, so these do make for good day to day wear. Other than the one that seems to be losing chains by the second, the rest are of decent quality.<br /><br />Since I'm not sure what the pricing is on these right now, I cannot tell you if they're a good value or not. I can only share with you my experience, which I have done.",1226127,7997

The reality is different.<br /><br />First, the necklace is so darn small, I felt like I was choking. I couldn't put it on myself, due to how tight it was and also due to arthritis in my fingers. When my husband got it on me it was not comfortable to wear.<br /><br />The chain doesn't really look like the one pictured. To be honest, it looks super cheap. The stone itself is really, really pretty and that's the only good thing I have to say about this necklace.<br /><br />If I had a spare silver chain I would take the stone off this and hang it from that instead, but I don't. I think for this price, you could do just as well if not WAYYYY better at the Walmart jewelry counter.",1226127,5656
3.0,1600467865716,"Pretty, But Has Some Issues","I liked this necklace when I saw it in the picture, but in person, not so much.<br /><br />First, the chains that are hanging down are what first attracted me. However, with my necklace the chains are unevenly placed which makes it look kind of funny.<br /><br />Second, the cord that the beads and chains hang from is a bright blue and...almost yarn like and the yarns snags easily. If you look closely at the pictures on the left, specifically the last one, (up top, next to the item), you can see a snag in it.<br /><br />Lastly, if you accidentally drop it while trying to put it on, good luck, because everything slides off the necklace and all over the floor. There's no knot or anything to prevent that from happening. (However, this makes it easy for me to rearrange the chains that hang down, so that they look more even.)<br /><br />Overall, it's okay and I'll probably wear it, if I can get it on without dropping it.",1226127,9353

I am 5'8"" tall and this comes down to middle of my hips.  It measures 22"" from shoulder to bottom of the band. It says it's 60% cotton and 40% polyester.  It also says it can be washed and dried in the machine.  I always hang my sweatshirts to dry so that they do not become too short.  This seems like a quality sweatshirt.  It's made in China.",1226326,2516
5.0,1566665161851,Is indeed packable.,Some hats say they are packable but end up not living up to that claim.  This one is truly packable.  Folds and smashes flat.  The feel of the fabric is kind of like a micro fiber - smooth and soft.  The brim is large enough to thoroughly cover your face and the back of your neck.  You can tighten the band to make it more secure on your head.  There's a tie bow in the back which is cute and functional.  It helps tighten up the hat on your head.  I like to wear hats with ties when out on the boat so they don't blow off.  This one stays on very well as it sits down so far on my head.  I really like the look and the color is nice as well.  It comes with it's own little carry case.  I will get a lot of wear out of this one!,1226326,2720
5.0,1566229125910,Cute!,I got these for my 13 year old granddaughter.  Oh my gosh!  She was so excited.  She started naming off all her friends she could give them to!  The young girls love these things.  I am so glad the strings are adjustable.  I have tried to tie these things on her wrists before!  What a pain.  So it's great that the little knots make these adjustable.  The colors are bright an fun.  The charms are all different.  The only problems she has is deciding who got which one.  The metal does tarnish a little if they're worn for an extended time.  But the girls don't mind!  Such a cute idea.  She will probably be wanting to order some more.,1226326,4646
5.0,1559072622873,Long kimono.,"This kimono is longer than most I have.  It comes down to about 3-4 inches above my ankles.  My husband thought I was wearing a coat!  It's very sheer.  So, there's not way it gives the warmth of a coat.  It's a black background with assorted colorful flowers.  The sleeves are 3/4 length.  It's made to be worn open in the front.  There are no closures.  I wear it over jeans with a tank top.  I do not like to wear sleeveless tops because of the way my arms look.  This is a nice look without extra warmth.",1226326,34539
5.0,1557242285680,Low cut.,"These are low cut but not as much no show.  In athletic shoes these will not show.  I have some low cut walking shoes and these do show.  They go up my ankles some.  They have an elastic band all around the ankle opening.  There's the rubberized patch in the inside of the heel to keep it from slipping down into your shoe.  These are a little thicker cotton sock.  The tops are mesh. They do keep my feet dry.  There's a seam over the toe but it doesn't bother me.  These are very colorful!  They are kind of a patchwork design.  The main colors are light blue, navy, black, grey, green, red, white and purple.  I like different colorful socks!  These fit the bill!  I wash these in the washing machine but lay them out to dry.  They do shrink.  They are 80% cotton, 15% acrylic and 5% spandex.  Made in China.",1226326,483
5.0,1557241895969,They don't show!,"I like wearing these socks in my walking shoes.  They are not high cut athletic shows.  It's hard to find socks that don't show for these lower cut shoes.  These are a little heavier than some.  They are mesh which keep my feet cooler. They have seams over the toe. The heel has a rubberized spot on the inside to hold them in place.  There's also a band of elastic around the top of the heel.  They stay put!  I hate when my socks slide down into my shoes.  These do not!  These come with tan, black, white, and grey.  Two pairs in each color.  They are 80% cotton and 15% acrylic and 5% spandex.  I wash mine in the washing machine.  I lay them out to dry because they do shrink if you put them in the dryer.

It still works well and this may be the design of the case, but it may need to be separated into two pieces to achieve full open. I am still very happy with the case though!",1226327,9127

But I reconsidered upon another's recommendation, and I'm glad I did. This is a very nice necklace. It can pass as a nice design without being too reminiscent of animal horns.<br /><br />The pendant catches the light very nicely. It's neither too big or too small. It's that prefect in between size, where it's still eye catching, but doesn't takeover the entire outfit.<br /><br />It can be worn for almost all occasions - adding some glitz to an everyday outfit, or even for an evening out. It's nicely versatile in that way.",1299863,1167
4.0,1608091269426,Nice large necklaces,"These necklaces are nice looking and large sized. They're very noticeable on an outfit, and really help to dress up any look. They look cheapish, not meant for evening wear, but look really good on an everyday/work outfit.",1299863,7997

I really like the color and fit though, so I hope I find the perfect event to wear it to.<br /><br />The color is exactly as shown in the product image - a very very light gray.<br /><br />Fits well.

Great for traveling with or just for keeping your items neatly categorized.",1299863,7380
4.0,1629424401329,"Well made, on the big side","These are too big for my wife's face, but she's petite. If you're a tall woman with a big head, they'll probably work for you.

The quality of the sock is decent enough. It's sewn well and the composition of the fabric is what you'd want out of an athletics sock. They are sized correctly. This is a novelty sock, but it isn't cheaply made at all. If you want something that will make people notice you while you're working out or playing b-ball, this pair will do the trick.",1299918,6299
3.0,1531791399721,"Decent leather, but not a practical design for coins",The quality of the leather is decent and thick. But this really isn't a good coin purse because it doesn't open up easily. You have to poke your fingers in the pouch to get coins out or flip the holder upside down and shake. Standard coin purses have accordion style openings for a reason. This design ignores that reason and the result is something that is best as a credit card or business card holder. It does make for a decent business card holder. You can put about 7 or 8 cards in the pouch and it does protect them well.,1299918,129547

It seems sturdily built and the zipper works well. I held off on the review to see if they'd list a price, but they have not. In a big box store it would probably be around $20. If it is ever available for sale, recommend.",1453770,7185
5.0,1580148947313,"cute, comfortable, and warm!","I have Reynaud's syndrome, so keeping my feet warm is a challenge. These were comfortable and provided extra warmth due to the height and thickness. There's enough padding to make them comfy without shoes; they are not so bulky as to require a lot of extra room in your boots. I wore these to walk the dog and my toes didn't turn white (also, they aren't too tight in the toes, which can be another challenge). They seem to be well made and I expect them to last a while. The design is suitably trendy. Recommend!",1453770,9470
3.0,1562768389583,Basic ties; kind of flashy,"We were surprised by the sparkles. If you are looking for a fun, flashy, bright tie, this might be the pair for you. If you are an older person working in a conservative setting (or you need a tie for a somber occasion like a funeral), maybe not. I can't comment on the price because there isn't one listed. The quality seems like something you'd get in a TJMaxx kind of store---but there you would have the advantage of being able to see them in person.  Recommended with reservations.",1453770,1150

The quality seems ok; the pearls aren't going to detach from the posts anytime soon, and the silver is shiny. They did not irritate my skin. However, the posts are thick, which isn't a great choice for my thick ears, and after wearing them I think I prefer pearls without any visible attachment (i.e., a simpler style). If you like this style and the thick post won't be an issue for you, try them out.",1453770,9505
3.0,1561556202929,Cute but no real sun protection,"Note that this was designed in the UK.  What do they have there? Clouds and rain.  The holes in this hat means it's fine for keeping your hair out of your face on a windy day (and it's snug enough to stay on your head in that weather), but it's not good for sun protection. It's really cute and it does fold and pack up well.  I'm keeping it as a spare in my car for windy days, but I won't be counting on it as a sun blocker. Since that's how they are advertising it, only 3 stars.",1453770,44248
4.0,1561555398686,Fun for teens; won't improve your cleavage,"Despite the model, this won't improve your cleavage. With that in mind, it's really fun for teens. Looks great with a tee and shorts for beach outings or summer-themed parties.  Definitely not an expensive piece (not sure what they plan to charge), so you won't have to worry about breaking or losing it.  This would probably be $5 from a beach stall; hopefully they'll price it accordingly.",1453770,7241

As her mother, I'm always trying to up-level this, but the lurex foil head band has not been a hit. She says it looks too fancy for school, it's too wide for her taste, and it's a little tight.  I'm going to end up using it to keep my hair out of my face when I use a face mask.  I think it's pretty, but overall I'd call this a fail in our house.",1453770,4664

4.0,1604547815794,Some question over stylishness,"This watch caused a lot of discussion in our family. My wife loves it. She says it has its own sort of elegance and style. I had mixed feelings. I felt the white strap clashed with the gold of the watch. The watch without the band looks great; we all agree on that.<br /><br />Our (grown) daughter called the watch ""tacky"" but didn't have specific reasons other than she thought it looked on the cheap side. I mostly disagree and my wife completely disagrees.<br /><br />Certainly you can see at once it's not a high-end watch, and it doesn't come at a high-end price. I thought it looked a little cheaper and less well manufactured than some others in the price range. But we all think it's appropriate for casual use (not elegant evenings) and would be better if the strap were changed to something color compatible.<br /><br />As I like to say it, the watch is ""Target"" quality. It doesn't descent to the Walmart level but neither does it rise to the Neiman-Marcus range. Four stars.",1453773,2394
4.0,1571716028530,They really do mean large,"No doubt that these are nice earrings. But they are not for everyone. Not at all.<br /><br />My wife tried them. Now, when we ordered, we knew it said 'large' but we didn't realize it meant LARGE, maybe HUGE. These are, in a word, gigantic. When my wife put them on our daughter asked if she was going to tell our fortune. A bit of a stereotype, perhaps, but it fits.<br /><br />They're nice enough in appearance, just way too big and way too loud for someone above a certain (young) age. If you're going for effect, fine. If you want to wear them as mood pieces, all well and good. But ordinary wear? Daily wear? Formal wear? Never.<br /><br />We give four stars because of relatively good quality. But my wife won't be using them.",1453773,19388
4.0,1562190542122,Useful if not especially elegant,"My wife uses this for times when she doesn't want to carry much more than an ID, credit cards, and cell phone. It's perfect for that, and the strap can be worn cross-body for additional security.<br /><br />The purse is very lightweight and holds more than you might expect (although nothing very big, of course). We were not sure what ""PU Leather"" might be but it is evidently not real leather, but some sort of near-imitation. That's fine. The purse isn't really high up on the good looks and elegance scale.<br /><br />That's not to say that it isn't presentable. For casual light-weight outings, it's just fine. It doesn't look in any way cheap, neither does it look anything beyond lower-middle grade. The construction quality is okay; it will last for a while if rough use is avoided.<br /><br />There are some bizarre features. The purse comes with a rather large nail clipper meant to be attached to the end of the strap? I mean, really? You'd like to walk around proudly displaying your --- nail clipper?<br /><br />Another oddity: the box comes with a card written in Chinese on one side and with the English words ""Eyes of Love"" on the other side. Very nice, but we didn't exactly see the connection. This is a utilitarian purse, not something seductive.<br /><br />Overall four stars. It's a useful purse, just not exactly upscale.",1453773,7285
5.0,1556600818112,Nice neutral colors and great for summer wear,"My wife likes these socks and asked me to rate them five stars. Her reasons:<br /><br />1. The colors are neutral. No loud reds or anything; instead, grey, white, black. But the soft, muted colors are still quite attractive.<br /><br />2. The socks are very soft and very comfortable. They are just nice to wear.<br /><br />3. The socks are on the lightweight side and are more suitable for summer or warmer weather.<br /><br />4. The socks seem quite well made and probably will last a while.<br /><br />5. Suitable for most exercise except perhaps long distance running.<br /><br />Overall good quality and value.",1453773,719
3.0,1547090474151,Just not to taste; very loud,"My wife has the following to say about this dress, which unfortunately she didn't care for.<br /><br />""This dress is just not to my taste. It's too loud and it has a matronly look on me, except that's inconsistent because of the clear panel on the bottom. I think this is a dress that didn't know what it wanted to be when it grew up.<br /><br />""The fit was fine. I thought the belt would be a nice touch, pulling in the middle so the dress wasn't too loose and like a mu`u mu`u, which it is without the belt, but it actually looked worse.

That being said, my daughter and my wife, who both have piercings, said that the gauges were awfully small and that the rings opened up way too easily.  So with that in mind, these rings seem to be over-priced by about $6-$8.  I wouldn't pay more than $10 for these.",1453779,656

I also liked the resealable plastic box that it was shipped in.  My daughter is using it for a lot of her jewelry now!<br /><br />Although the ArtGully Handcrafted Sleek & Stylish Intricately Designed Oxidized Silver Brass Choker with Adjustable Chain is not yet priced, I anticipate it being in the $15 range.",1453779,9357
4.0,1564402638702,Decent Low Mid-Level Watch,"The Alloro Men's Day and Date Quartz Analog Wrist Watch is a decent men's watch for someone who is looking for a mid-level work/casual watch.  Although its about 1/2"" thick, it is not heavy (which tells me the quartz face is pretty thin.  The packaging states that it was made in India.<br /><br />The watch displays Hour/Minute/Second, the date, and the day (with Sunday in red).  The windings of the watch are loose as the hour/minute hand swing very quickly when adjusted.  Does not give you a sense of high quality (as several of my other watches do).  The face is a nice white color so it is easy to read the time and the numbers are black roman numerals.  The Date & Day are also large enough for me to read without being either TOO large or make me wish I had my reading glasses on.<br /><br />The back of the watch is stainless steel so it is theoretically scratch resistant.  Its also has ""A Quality Watch"" printed on the back which if you have to say it implies that its not.  The band is some type of leather and I'm not a fan.  Its thin and short (and I have narrow wrists) and the adjustable strap doesn't stay on the end of the band (its too wide) so I'm constantly fiddling with the watch.  Will end up buying a new band sometime.<br /><br />At this time, the Alloro Men's Day and Date Quartz Analog Wrist Watch is not priced, but because of the quality level I would assume its in the $20-25 range.  If its priced higher than that, I will lower my review because it isn't worth that much.  It isn't a WalMart special $15 watch, but its not a $40-$50 mid-level watch either.",1453779,6988
5.0,1563970065043,Pretty Cool Idea,"The Bayinbulak Sun Hat is  a pretty nice one-size-hits-all soft camo hat.  I have a somewhat large head (8 3/4"" on most caps), but this fit me just fine (if a bit snug).  The material is nice and sturdy without being too rough or inflexible.<br /><br />However, what I really liked was the mosquito netting setup that is hid inside of the top of the hat.  After opening a little zipper, you just unfold the netting (which stays connected to the top of the hat) over the top of your head and pull down.  It reached to the tops of my shoulders and it has a nice drawstring to keep the bottom opening snug up against the bottom of your neck.  Once you don't need it anymore, it takes about 10 seconds to fold up and stow inside your hat again.  Once there, I didn't feel any pressure on the top of my head.  Very comfortable.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked the Bayinbulak Sun Hat.  By itself, it was a very nice camo work/hiking hat, but with the addition of the concealed netting that's connected to the hat so you don't lose it - VERY NICE!",1453779,742

I've even worn them outside in my winter boots (I usually wear thick wool socks with those boots), and while the boots were a little loose, my feet were just as warm.<br /><br />I'm concerned that the seller is listing these as merino wool 53%; cotton 24%; polyester 16%; and spandex 7%. The product label says they are merino wool 35%; cotton 29%; polyester 36%. The seller needs to update its product page on Amazon. Or perhaps the manufacturer used the wrong bands around the socks. The bands say the company name of these is Fashion Boutique.<br /><br />Overall, great socks at a great price.",1454008,29

It's a simple necklace with a lobster clasp. My ball has a lot of ""clouds"" in it, but what I don't like is where the clouds contact the inside of the sphere. The touch points look like little bits of bright white paper stuck against the plastic. While I do like this necklace, I think it's more appropriate for younger women. I think a young teen would love it because it's so different. The length is also adjustable, because the manufacturer has added a 2"" length of chain with larger loops in which which you hook the lobster clasp.",1454008,2929

It keeps my head so warm and protects my face from cold winds. I love this thing!!!<br />---------------<br />It gets really cold here in Erie, Pennsylvania, so I wear a scarf whenever I go out in winter. This cowl is super soft and large. When it put it around my neck, I fold and shove the remainder inside the front of my coat, thus keeping my chest warm (I do have a fuss with the zipper, though, to keep from catching it on the cowl). When I'm walking outside, I can pull this up over my head and then put my hood over it. It acts like a hood lining that extends outside of the hood keeping my cheeks warm.

The metal is quite cheap and has a cheap feel to it. If I bought these pins individually, I would probably be willing to spend up to $1.25 a piece for them. In the set, 2 of the pins are dark and look best on light surfaces, while the other one is light and shows up best on dark surfaces.

4.0,1599659983280,No instructions,"This is a set of silicone cord locks for mask ear loops. The locks consist of flat silicone beads, 3/8” in diameter. They have a wide opening on one end and a very small thread opening on the other. They ship in a plastic bag with no instructions.<br /><br />I find these cord locks work well, but they can be very frustrating to put on your loops since they come with no instructions. There is a little video for the product description, but the video shows only a few seconds of how to install this particular model of locks. It flashes by too quickly to figure out what’s going on, even if you freeze the video and go frame by frame. When I first looked at these locks in my hand, I figured there was no way to get them on my ¼” elastic loops. The exit hole is just too narrow. I tried poking them through with tweezers. No go. I tried tying them on thread on a needle, sending the needle through the hole, then pulling the thread to pull the elastics through. The thread broke. I switched to an upholstery thread, 2 strands, and pulled them through that way. Yes, it worked. Then I had to cut the thread. Tip: use a thread color that contrasts with your elastic color so you can see to cut it afterwards. Basically, these locks work well, but can be hard to figure out and are not easy to install without instructions.",1454034,6943
4.0,1575559701356,Sticky clip,"This is an adjustable bomber hat with hanging ear flaps. The material is 100% nylon, including the outer water resistant shell, the inner soft terry lining, and the fake fur. It has a drawstring adjustment band with a pinch clip around the rim, which allows you to adjust the size from quite small to quite large. On the sides are short ear flaps which can be button up or buttoned down according to your fashion sense. The long ear flaps can also be worn hanging down, clipped under the chin, or clipped on top of the head. The hat was made in China.<br /><br />I find this hat very warm and comfortable. At first I though it was too large for my 22” head, but then I tightened up the drawstring and it fits perfectly. My husband, who has a larger head, is also able to wear the hat comfortably by loosening the drawstring. The only issue that I have had is that the clip on the ends of the long flaps is not that easy to use. The first time I clipped it under my chin, I couldn’t get it loose and I was stuck for a while. So practice with the clip before you use it. I think I’ll probably replace the clip with an easier one to open. But overall, this is a very warm hat and should fit just about anyone.",1454034,12034
5.0,1574264041703,Fun costume jewelry,"This is a flexible metal cuff bracelet. The bracelet is fully 2.25” from end to end and 7.75” in diameter. It consists of a series of closely spaced stiff metal wires onto which are tightly threaded small metal beads. The bracelet has no closure—it simply flexes open to accommodate your wrist and closes back gently around your wrist. It weighs 87 gm. The bracelet comes packaged in a drawstring jute bag with a business card. It was made in India.<br /><br />I have had a lot of fun wearing this bracelet with my Indian outfits. It also goes well with simple black sweaters. And I have even worn it around my ankle—I have small ankles, and this fits well around my ankle and looks simply smashing with ethnic clothes. Overall, this bracelet is quite sparkly and well made.",1454034,3459
4.0,1571756757128,Good for bifocal readers,"This is a set of bifocal reading glasses with graduated shading. The glasses are frameless with the bow and nose assemblies screwed onto the lenses. The nose pads are slim and soft silicone. The bows are plastic. The lenses are UV blocking with graduated shading. They each have patches at the bottom with 1X magnification for reading. They ship in a semi-hard shell zippered case with a lens cleaning cloth and a jewelry screwdriver on a keychain.<br /><br />I like the light weight of these glasses—they weigh practically nothing. The graduated shading also works well for me. I’m having trouble getting used to the bifocal readers, though. I usually wear progressive lenses for glasses and multifocus lenses for contacts, so I’m not used to the bifocal patches on these lenses. They work for reading, but if you’re not used to bifocals, there is a learning curve. The case that comes with these glasses feels very cheap. It’s a very basic case. The jewelry screwdriver is a useful accessory, though. Overall, this is an interesting combination of readers with sun-blocking lenses, but they will probably be most comfortable for people used to bifocals.",1454034,2959
5.0,1571323998460,Large lenses,"This is a pair of polarized sunglasses in an aviator style frame. The frame is constructed of metal wires, with the lens held within metal wires and an additional metal bar across the top of the lenses for reinforcement. The bows are metal encased in plastic. The nose pieces are pivoting silicone pads. The lenses are dark polarizing with UV protection but not mirrored. The glasses come with a plastic case that is stiff on one side and soft on the other. A lens cleaning cloth is also included. The Olieye logo appears at the top of the left lens, embossed onto the case and embossed onto the cleaning cloth. Country of manufacture is not indicated on the product or the packaging.<br /><br />I like the full coverage that these oversized lenses provide (although there is no protection from the sides). The polarization is quite strong, making it hard to read with these glasses. But the glasses work well for boating or driving since they really block glare from reflected surfaces. Their appearance is both classic and modern. The wire frames make for a relatively light weight. Overall, these glasses work great for blocking sun and reflections on a bright day.",1454034,6982
5.0,1564694050629,Nicely made,"This is a set of 2 ties in bright colors. The fabric is 100% polyester in a flat wave with a bit of a shine.

The Awesome 360 logo appears on a tag on the back of each tie. The ties were made in China.<br /><br />I have been very pleased with these ties. I got them for our family photograph, since everyone was wearing black and fuchsia. These ties were perfect with the black and fuchsia, and they looked great with our black suitcoats. With their bright colors and slightly shiny sheen, the ties may not be appropriate for every occasion or for the office for some folks. But there were exactly what we needed for our picture. Overall, these ties are well made, durable, and quite eye-catching.",1454034,2719
4.0,1548424745640,Hat band is essential to hide the stitching,"This is a 2-tone felt hat. The hat material is 100% wool, while the band is 95% polyester, 5% spandex. The brim is 2.75” wide, while the peak of the hat is 4.25” tall. The hat is 22” in diameter at the band. There is a decorative but essential shiny velvet sash around the top on the outside. The sash covers the zigzag stitching used to bind the brim to the top part of the hat. The hat was made in China.<br /><br />I’m not that excited about this hat. I usually wear hats every day to keep the sun off my head and face or to stay warm. This hat, with its wide brim, does keep the sun off my face. But the hat is just a little too big for my average-sized head, so it blows off if there is the slightest bit of wind. I guess if you’re from Florida, you could call this a winter hat. Here in Vermont, this is an indoor hat if it’s winter outside because it doesn’t cover the ears and doesn’t look like it would hold up well in a rainstorm. The hat has an attractive style, but I’m not impressed with the construction. If you peek under the decorative sash, you can see that the zigzag stitching that holds the hat together is irregular and ugly, so don’t lose that sash! Overall, this is a decent fashion hat at an affordable price, but the construction is light weight and the size is non-negotiable.",1454035,46249
5.0,1538077396555,Cute lingerie,"This is a pair of knitted shorts with an elastic waist and lace hems. The fabric is 55% cotton, 45% modal.

The inseam is about 2”; the transparent lace hems increase the inseam length by about 1”. The waist band is about 1” wide and elastic, with an additional ½” light blue drawstring. There are no pockets. The garment was made in China.<br /><br />I have found these very comfortable as summer sleep shorts. With the short design and lace hems they seem too much like lingerie to wear out in public, although I guess you could do that if you are brave. I received size Small of these shorts to try. I usually wear size 10 pants, and size Small of these shorts seemed just a tad loose, so you might want to get a smaller size than usual. The pattern on the shorts wasn’t quite matched at the front seam (see photo). Other than that, the stitching seems secure. Overall, this is a comfortable pair of shorts in an attractive print to wear in the bedroom or around the house.",1454035,2564
5.0,1537550005113,Warmer than I thought,"This is a thermal lined faux fur hat with a visor. The shell of the hat is 72% acrylic, 28% polyester, while the lining and filling are 100% polyester. The lining and filling are quilted to keep the filling stable. The head band has a strip of elastic in the back to ensure a secure fit. The hat was made in China.<br /><br />I really like this hat—with its thermal lining, it is a lot warmer than I had thought from the picture. This is a fun hat to wear for cool temperatures. It is warm enough to wear for about 28F-45F; perhaps you could wear on even cooler days if you add ear warmers. I like the way the hat has elastic and stays put on my head without being too tight. The faux fur is soft and attractive. Overall, this is a fun hat, and highly functional with the visor to keep sun out of your eyes and lining to help you stay warm.",1454035,592
5.0,1534261673960,Light weight beach cover up,"This is a light weight beach cover up for women. It is constructed of 3 pieces: a large back panel and 2 side panels with short slits on the side panels. Hems on all edges are 1/8”. All around the bottom edge is a piece of decorative lace, about 4” wide. The length in the back for size S is 38” to the bottom of the lace. The fabric is light weight sheer nylon. Washing instructions say to hand wash in cold water and line dry. The garment was made in China.<br /><br />This is a very light weight piece that flows gracefully. It comes down just below my knees and shoulders. It is so sheer that it doesn’t provide much modesty cover, so you probably wouldn’t want to just put this over a bikini and go walking around town—it’s not substantial enough for that. I also don’t know how much sun protection it provides, although it certainly provides more than nothing. The gold color is very attractive. Personally, I find the piece is a little too delicate and fussy for me to use every day since it must be hand washed and is so sheer. Overall, it’s an attractive light weight garment that drapes well and breathes in the breeze, a nice addition to a beach outfit.",1454035,1066

I had surgery last summer but after my daughter was born this year it came back and started to bother me again. I know it didn’t state it would be able to help with that kind of “tendon” pain, but I thought it was worth a try. Well long story short, it did not help with the pain but looked very pretty.

1.0,1569898785870,Poor Quality,"The SKYWAY 2 In 1 Clip On Polarized Glasses Women Men Fashion Magnet Sunglasses Classic Prescription Glasses are not prescription glasses at all. You would have to take them to your own eye doctor to write a prescription, and then see if they can have lenses made to fit these frames.<br />I’m not sure why you would want to do that, except these frames are sized to be an exact fit to the magnetic lenses. I have wire rimmed prescription glasses, but the magnets on these lenses do not fit my personal glasses.<br />These glasses are supposedly made for nearsighted people. I am not nearsighted; I have to put on my prescription glasses to read. That goes along with what I experienced; these glasses not only failed to improve my vision, but my sight was worse looking through them. Does this mean that all of us who are not nearsighted should avoid buying these? That omits a significant demographic right out of the gate.<br />Other than being magnetic where the arms meet the frame around the lenses, and the fact that the glass inside the frame is made for nearsighted people, the third major consideration are the pads that rest on the nose, supporting the glasses. Usually if you do not have a good fit, the wires holding these pads can be bent slightly to achieve greater comfort and a better fit. Unfortunately the nosepiece wires on this frame appear so insubstantial I am afraid I will break them if I attempt adjustments.<br />The quality of these glasses does not give me confidence in their durability.

I like the idea of outer pocket and the big inside. I like the inside zippered pocket into the lining and the two side pockets in the lining.<br /><br />Here’s what doesn’t work for me:<br />• The outer pocket is a shiny cheap looking vinyl<br />• The snap for the outer pocket is a weak magnet and it doesn’t line up properly, so it’s not easy to close<br />• The main compartment zipper is sewn too far down, so there a 90 degree turn, it's difficult to zip<br />• The zipper placement limits the size of what you can put in the purse.<br />• The outer bottom seams on the front pocket are sewn in a messy way.<br /><br />It came with a nice heavy-duty sturdy plastic bag with drawstrings for storage.  However, the pocketbook must be folded over to fit inside and even then, the drawstrings can’t be pulled together. Maybe it wasn’t meant to be a storage for the bag?

The hanging loop is on the back, not like most where it’s on the side and if you don’t cut it off it escapes and can be seen.

3.0,1570396760153,Good workout shorts but not great for biking in my opinion,I wish I could leave 2 separate reviews for these shorts.  If I were to just review the outer shell it would probably be a 4.5 star review.  If I were to just review the biking shorts part it would probably be a 2 star review.  I will start with the biking short part.<br /><br />The fit was no where near snug enough.  I like the padding from my bike shorts to be nice and snug and held in place to hold everything else around that area in place.  These were very loose. If I pulled them up higher to get them snug I had to pull the waist band way above my belly button to get the padding where it needed to be.  Not the best<br /><br />The material of the inner shorts is also mesh.  I think this could be potentially really nice however do to the fit I will never know and will not wear the bike short inners.<br /><br />The outer shorts however were great.  I really like the fit of them and they are quite flattering in my opinion.  They were not too baggy but not too tight.  The material is very thin but a good workout material.  My only complaint about the shorts is the lack of pockets.  It does have a very small pocket right below the waist band on the back but it is very small and does not hold much.  Would prefer some regular pockets.<br /><br />Would not buy these for biking but for sure would buy for the workout shorts.,1454214,11140
3.0,1570394553029,Decent compression sleeve,This is a pretty basic compression sock but does not provide the compression that I like.  I think that everyone is different but this is not my style.  This seems more like a tight sock rather than a compression sock if that makes any sense.  The compression sleeves that I prefer are much more elastic like and compress a lot more.  It is decent but not the best in my personal opinion.,1454214,4635
3.0,1565558382776,Decent cheap bike shorts,"I have a few different pairs of bike shorts that I own and have worn over the years ranging from pretty pricey to pretty cheap.  These shorts are definitely in the cheaper side of things and I will compare these to other similarly priced bike shorts that I have worn.<br /><br />The overall material on these is not too bad.  Pretty stretchy and comfortable for the most part.  They are also not too thin either.  Some other shorts in the price range I have used were a bit to thin and revealing for my comfort.  These were adequate in that regard.<br /><br />Padding - I have seen many reviews stating that the padding is too much.  For this price range the padding is generally not going to be as nice as the fancier shorts that use more of a gelly type padding.  This is your pretty typical cheap padding that is going to be a bit thicker than your more expensive padding to get the same effect.  The thickness of the padding will not cause any performance issues while riding and you wont notice the thickness at all; however, when just walking around in these shorts they might feel a little more awkward then some others.<br /><br />Sizing - The sizing for me was just not right.  I got a large (which is about what I normally wear) and I am 5'10"" 195lbs with a 34 waist boarding on a 35 waist.  These were too big and baggy for my liking.  Not so bad that I can't wear them but definitely not my ideal fit and would opt for a medium if I could do it over again.  These shorts also have to much material for my liking as I can pull the waist all the way up past my belly button and a quarter of the way up my back.  I personally do not want my shorts to go that high but I feel like I have to pull them up that high to get the padding tight on my body to ride.<br /><br />Overall, for a cheap pair of shorts they are not awful.  I personally would spend a few more $ to get something that is better fitting and has better quality padding.",1454214,166137

They do not bother my ears at all so I do think they are nickel free - which is great.,1454286,206467
3.0,1582740872689,OK - But Not for Larger Sizes,I got a pair of these to wear under summer tops - I am so tired of fighting bra straps.  I am a 38D so I ordered the size that corresponds to that.  These did stay in place for many hours (4?) and did provide some support - but they were way too small.  If I had been wearing any sort of a form fitting shirt - I cannot imagine how odd I would have looked.  The line of my clothes would have been completely bizarre.  I since ordered another pair that was 2 times bigger and hope they will work better.,1454286,46093
5.0,1544143631940,Gorgeous!,I can't say I had any idea what a ruana was as I ordered this...I would have called it a decorative shawl.  When this arrived - I was amazed at hour beautiful and soft it was.  I probably won't wear it too often - but it is just perfect for a couple of fancy occasions I have coming up!<br /><br />It's a bit longer than I thought it would be - which is great.  Since these are winter events - the extra length added to the soft warmth will be perfect!,1454286,2555

Went with five, because at the end of the day, I got this one for my wife and she loved it.<br />Size wise, the manufacturer pictures are a bit deceiving. This one is way smaller than it looks, but to a certain degree, it makes it look delicate and elegant.<br />The length of the bracelet can be adjusted by pulling the ends and it works as it should. The pendant itself is shinny but the stones are small enough that is hard to definitely say they are diamonds. Nonetheless the shine appears to be the real deal.<br />The main negative I have is the box it comes on. The box is intended for the kind of bracelet that you open up, which is too long for this kind and aesthetically makes this one look even smaller than what it is. When gifting it, this is not a good thing...  Also, while the rings appear to be two pieces interlocked, this is a one piece deal. Not a huge deal but definitely worth pointing out.<br />Price wise, I think is priced appropriately, in line with similar bracelets in the market... cannot complain.<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.

The weight of it honestly is not that heavy and the watch itself is super durable and stable. At first, we didn't know why it wasn't working, but we then figured out that you have to constantly move it here and there for it to start telling time and it only took part of that day to do. There is plenty of extra room in the watch (my boyfriend had to get a couple of brackets taken out) but its great. Wonderful watch that looks amazing.",1612926,170

4.0,1457838894000,Big Bangle,"I purchased this Expandable Wire Bracelet for Cancer Awareness for my wife as a gift. She has been slowly collecting Alex and Ani bracelets for a few years now. She has quite the collection. The one bracelet that she keeps asking for is a bangle bracelet to support me, I had brain cancer. Alex and Ani does not make one so I didn't think I would be able to buy her one.<br /><br />Then I found this one. Now it is not the same high quality as an Alex and Ani but it also costs a fraction of the price. This bracelet is nice and it is for an important cause to our family. I really liked the fact that it was made in the USA, by hand. I also like that a portion of the proceeds go to the American Cancer Society. It is awesome that this bracelet is offered for 17 types of cancer and one general cancer awareness one.<br /><br />The only real issue my wife had with this bracelet is the fact that it is really large. Because she has really skinny wrists and arms the bangle slides half way down her arm. Looking at the bright side, it won't get tangles with her other bangles.<br /><br /> I purchased this bangle bracelet for a discounted price for my unbiased review and honest opinion. My wife says it's a wonderful addition to her bracelet collection.",1613591,550710

4.0,1475678229000,I love this dress,I am not being paid or compensated in any way for this review. I did follow the instructions and ordered one size up so I ordered an extra large we're typically I would be a large to extra large I have a long torso 38 inch around bust with d to a double D cup. If it's wonderfully my boyfriend loves to see me wearing it but it is too short to wear out as a dress. I am 5 7 but I have short legs and a long torso. It looks great to walk around the beach with but other than that it comes up to about an inch past my crotch and my rear end. If I walk extremely careful I could wear it as a dress but definitely could not sit down. I washed it and hung it to dry and it still fits exactly the same. Extremely comfortable and extremely flattering. If it were two to three inches longer I would have rated it 5 stars.,1616193,164740

3.0,1453736084000,Great Necklace But........,"I really love the  look of this necklace.  It's really quite large and the goldtone is really vivid, which absolutely works for me.  However, it did arrive broken.  I was able to fix a link which came apart and re-attach one of the small stones  which fell out, but the necklace still doesn't look quite right, it seems off kilter -- there's nothing more I can do about it.  I did however, like the look of it so much that I took a chance and ordered another one which  isn't here yet, and I'm hoping that the second one will arrive with no  flaws.  Crossing my fingers that it is okay. Update : the other  necklace I ordered has arrived,  and this one was in good shape, no flaws but lets face it, you shouldn't have to reorder another one to get what you expected the first time around.  This however is a great looking necklace -really big, shiny and bold - love it...",1618941,28860

I ordered the very pretty purple and got an ugly green with brown flecks.  Its too much of a hassle to send these things back so I'm stuck with it. Also a piece fell out in the shipping.  It seems these folks run out of a color and then send whatever they have laying around.  Well, its a good thing I didn't pay too much for this.  I'm kind of disgusted since this seems to be a pattern with this company.",1618941,6541

3.0,1626103808541,Legs,These look in the picture to be more of an ankle or capri length legging.  These are not at all.  These were so long and full length leggings.  That was not my issue with these. I am plus size and wear a 2X in all of my leggings.  These were extremely tight in the leg/calf area.  They are super stretchy and I could still get them up to my waist even with the tight legs since they were so long.  The waist area fit me with no issues and seemed to fit to size.  I could not test if they are see through with a good stretch though as I was too uncomfortable with the tightness on my calfs.  I have never had this in a legging and found it odd as most of the time the smallest area would be the waist.,593888,9388
4.0,1625941848406,Nice,"I personally am not a huge fan of the material on this, but my husband did not seem to mind.  I really like the color and the fit on him.

2.0,1621599764729,Not if you Need Stretch,"When I first opened these, I was excited.  They are a nice soft and thick material.  However; if you have any stretch when wearing biker shorts or leggings, I do not recommend.  I wear between a XL and XXL in all leggings, capri leggings, and biker shorts that I have.  I wear one or the other every single day.  These fit fine as far as getting them on.  They are not as high waisted as I would like, especially in the back (if you have a larger back area).  The issue is that since they are having to be stretched, they were completely see through.  I was shocked since they are so thick, but you can definitely see through them.<br /><br />If they do not stretch to fit you, you may be fine.",593888,5013
4.0,1621204197334,Fit,"I usually wear between a Xl and XXl with my leggings.

They have a nice band at the top, but not as high waisted as I would like.  Otherwise, great leggings",593888,5016
2.0,1600295062948,Scratchy,"These are not what I was expecting at all.  They are not cotton or soft, and have a very stiff and scratchy fabric.

5.0,1591638279439,Great,"These are super comfortable and fit to size.  I wear around a size 18, and I ordered a 2X.  They fit perfectly.  These are fleece lined and very warm.

I would buy these again and in some other colors.",593889,34273
4.0,1580349463860,Great,"This is such a great idea.  My husband is constantly making fun of me for making a mess when we eat out.

3.0,1575397320832,Runs Small,"These did not work for my husband as he did not like the fit.  They run small, so you may need to size up which may help the issue.  He said they were ok for wearing around the house, but still not as comfortable as he would like.",593889,9467

I do think they run a tad small, but I can get away with wearing my true size or the size up (I have some in both sizes) so it just depends on how you like yours to fit.  Overall, great leggings.",593889,9485

3.0,1572914705425,Not For Me,I was really excited for this as I love Rose Quartz.  The stone itself is really nice and pretty.  It was everything else I was not a huge fan of.  This looks really cheap.  It is more of something I would give my child than for myself.  The chain and design were cheap feeling and looking and not something that blew me away.,593889,2472
5.0,1571416437467,Small Aviator,These were much better quality than I was expecting.  The metal frame is very heavy (heavy for glasses not heavy in general; in a good way).

5.0,1568937105000,Huge,"I was not sure what to expect from this as I am a plus size girl.  This is beautiful.  It is so soft to the touch and will be great for the winter months in the south when you just need something extra.

It is not thick, but will look great for grabbing a small blanket/jacket/shawl when it is a little colder.",593889,7077

It comes nicely packaged and has a larger outer bag for storage.  The material and details are very nice as well.  I was not sure if I would use this or give it away, but I am going to keep it.  I like the center pouch.  I think that is important as you can still have items in your bag that others cannot see.  That is a must.  I do not need people to see my wallet and such.  Overall, a great bag.<br /><br />The only thing I am unsure of is if the price matches the bag.  There is not a current listed price, so I am unable to determine the value.

The colors were a little off from what I expected, but will still work.",593889,7087
3.0,1626103808541,Legs,These look in the picture to be more of an ankle or capri length legging.  These are not at all.  These were so long and full length leggings.  That was not my issue with these. I am plus size and wear a 2X in all of my leggings.  These were extremely tight in the leg/calf area.  They are super stretchy and I could still get them up to my waist even with the tight legs since they were so long.  The waist area fit me with no issues and seemed to fit to size.  I could not test if they are see through with a good stretch though as I was too uncomfortable with the tightness on my calfs.  I have never had this in a legging and found it odd as most of the time the smallest area would be the waist.,593888,9388

2.0,1621599764729,Not if you Need Stretch,"When I first opened these, I was excited.  They are a nice soft and thick material.  However; if you have any stretch when wearing biker shorts or leggings, I do not recommend.  I wear between a XL and XXL in all leggings, capri leggings, and biker shorts that I have.  I wear one or the other every single day.  These fit fine as far as getting them on.  They are not as high waisted as I would like, especially in the back (if you have a larger back area).  The issue is that since they are having to be stretched, they were completely see through.  I was shocked since they are so thick, but you can definitely see through them.<br /><br />If they do not stretch to fit you, you may be fine.",593888,5013
4.0,1621204197334,Fit,"I usually wear between a Xl and XXl with my leggings.

They have a nice band at the top, but not as high waisted as I would like.  Otherwise, great leggings",593888,5016
2.0,1600295062948,Scratchy,"These are not what I was expecting at all.  They are not cotton or soft, and have a very stiff and scratchy fabric.

I would buy these again and in some other colors.",593889,34273
4.0,1580349463860,Great,"This is such a great idea.  My husband is constantly making fun of me for making a mess when we eat out.  I like the designs of these so it is not as embarrassing to pull out if you are out to eat.  This is super long, and I would prefer it to be a little shorter but that is ok.  It is also a little tight around my neck, but works.",593889,60743

3.0,1575397320832,Runs Small,"These did not work for my husband as he did not like the fit.  They run small, so you may need to size up which may help the issue.  He said they were ok for wearing around the house, but still not as comfortable as he would like.",593889,9467

I really love the fabric on these as well.  They are stretchy enough without being too stretchy or too tight.  I do think they run a tad small, but I can get away with wearing my true size or the size up (I have some in both sizes) so it just depends on how you like yours to fit.  Overall, great leggings.",593889,9485

3.0,1572914705425,Not For Me,I was really excited for this as I love Rose Quartz.  The stone itself is really nice and pretty.  It was everything else I was not a huge fan of.

5.0,1571416437467,Small Aviator,These were much better quality than I was expecting.  The metal frame is very heavy (heavy for glasses not heavy in general; in a good way).

So you can do your own research but if you are curious about how to block the blue, the new technology makes it easy. You simply use blue blocking glasses that don't appear to do anything to your vision --- but you make notice the ability to sleep increases at night.  The video here shows how powerful they are at blocking the light but they don't change anything else. I had this added to my prescription glasses and sleep was actually faster and deeper.

3.0,1549809639477,Couldn't get it on,"Ordered an extra large and couldn't get my other arm into it.  Extremely lightweight and porous, meaning it gets you wet if it gets wet. I suspect it could be useful for some kind of brisk autumn walk but be aware of the sizing issue.  It's made of 100 % polyester and has super deep pockets.  It's too light to be a windbreaker but might make it as a running jacket because it's so light. Can't really address it because I couldn't use it.  I do give it some props for being able to be stuffed into the size of a baseball. so if you get one that fits it could be a great emergency jacket in the glove compartment.",593885,32

4.0,1509937566150,Glad I purchased.,"I love this sweater. I was nervous ordering online and I’m pretty particular about fit. I have been looking for an oversized “cozy fall” gray sweater and came upon an article that linked to Amazon sweaters under $25. I’m 5’ 2.5” and 135 lbs; it did take a bit longer to arrive and upon opening there was an unpleasant packaging smell. I did wash on cold, and threw in the dryer *i know, big no no for fear of shrinking* but once I did so, it smelled and fit like I had hoped. Sleeves fit hitting just below the wrist, and the longest portion hits at about my knee. Very cute with skinny jeans or leggings.",1668442,36229

5.0,1576128465644,These gloves are unbeatable!,"I've never seen a pair of gloves that had everything you need and want all in one! They've thought of everything here! I ordered these for my husband and he was super impressed and happy with these! He used them to shovel shoe and take the kiddos sledding and said he didn't get wet or cold inside these gloves. The pocket for hand warmers is a great feature and is the perfect size! The zipper closure and tuck away feature for the zipper is perfect too. These clip together for storage, have a nice cinch strap and another cinch with toggle adjustment and a leather stopper at the cord ends. Tucked inside I found wrist straps as well. They're fuzzy and soft inside almost like fur. They feel durable and well made. They're waterproof, windproof, sweatproof, touchscreen compatible, and have a mini squeegee on the thumb. I'm guessing the squeegee is for goggles but I'm not entirely sure. Overall, these are fantastic and I can't find a negative thing about them. I would definitely recommend them for sure!",733029,7350
4.0,1573437041121,Very cool pair of aviators!,"These aviators are really nice for the price! They look more expensive than they actually are. They have a nice red/copper metal frame and the lenses are a reddish hue as well. They're very fashionable and look hood when I'm wearing them. I like the they are mirrored polarized lenses and protect my eyes from UV rays. Mine arrived with absolutely no scratches. The nose rests on these are also super comfortable silicone and are very soft.  They send them with a little card that has an image you can only see when wearing the glasses which is pretty cool. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of is the case. The material isn't very nice and the closure isn't the best. Not a deal breaker for me though, I still feel the value is great and I would buy again.",733029,7225

The oversize plaid design and tasseled fringe ends are so trendy and stylish!I wish it was studded on both sides of the scarf so it was a little more noticeable though. The material is soft and lightweight, thin yet functional! I like the versatility of this as well, so many options of how to wear it, with the length of this one. I was confused by the website description as it said it is 180 long, but I realized they measured it in centimeters and not in inches.

The elastic around the arms was strangling her tiny little twig arms…I can’t imagine who has smaller arms than her who this could possibly fit! Also, the entire thing was just super short. Not like I’m just old and think skirts should be long, I mean like not long enough to cover my 5’5’’ kid’s bum even if she is just standing still. We bought a black petticoat for her to wear underneath and give an extra 2 inches in length. It was super cute with the extra black ruffle hanging down, but I would have preferred for the dress to actually fit without buying an extra piece. Also, it’s not just the skirt that is too short, the waist is really high, like the entire dress is made for a kid and not an adult. The entire thing just looked way too small. It’s super cute, but order at least two sizes up.

The elastic around the arms was strangling her tiny little twig arms…I can’t imagine who has smaller arms than her who this could possibly fit! Also, the entire thing was just super short. Not like I’m just old and think skirts should be long, I mean like not long enough to cover my 5’5’’ kid’s bum even if she is just standing still. We bought a black petticoat for her to wear underneath and give an extra 2 inches in length. It was super cute with the extra black ruffle hanging down, but I would have preferred for the dress to actually fit without buying an extra piece. Also, it’s not just the skirt that is too short, the waist is really high, like the entire dress is made for a kid and not an adult. The entire thing just looked way too small. It’s super cute, but order at least two sizes up. Also, don’t go by the size chart included in the post, according to those measurements my kid should have needed an XS, so I thought ordering the small was sizing up, but apparently she needed at least a medium, possibly a large.",1739667,181168

5.0,1481992175000,Light brown Italian - GREAT,"Extremely happy with the quality and appearance of this band. I picked the light brown Italian leather strap. It doesn't have the quick release pins but that wasn't important to me. The color looks great with my watch. I really like the fact that the band is 22mm wide but it's notched off at the ends to fit between the 18mm lugs of the Huawei. This was a must for me because, as a guy, an 18mm band is just too narrow. I've washed my hands several times while wearing it and even though it's gotten wet, it doesn't show any spots or any problems from getting wet. Very pleased, I'm considering the black Italian band next.",1761674,238584

4.0,1564432479128,A bit low quality but totally worth it,"Worked up a sweat trying to put it on! With some adjustments in the ribbon it fit well! The ribbon is low quality, but pulled as tight as they are, the wrinkles are absent. I ordered a medium, my bust is 36 inches, waist is 29-30, and hips are 37 inches. I am a bit chubby in my belly so I want to start waist training with this. So far just from the get-go I notice how nicely it squeezes me, and it is crazy comfortable. Definitely wont be difficult to wear this for long periods of time, besides of course the putting on. Maybe it's just because im a rookie at clasping these things but it was a huge hassle haha. Above and below the buttons/clasps are an odd little folding/damaged area, seems to be because there is a section of fabric that surpasses the boning. Wearing pants slightly above the bottom as well as having underboob hides it, and for the price it is definitely not a big issue. Seems to be pretty good buy that'll at least hold me over long enough to buy one of those custom designed corsets. We all know how crazy expensive that is haha! Overall definitely look at sizing and for slightly bigger measurements you can simply loosen the ribbon. :)",1844076,101021

The straps are also adjustable and seem to be well made and sewn to the garment without any weakness in the straps or the cami itself.

It is nice addition to the tank and it is nice through out the entire tank. I also love this black because sometimes I order things and the black in the item is often already faded and this is also not the case with this shirt, it is a deep black. It is not the softest tank I have ever had but it is not uncomfortable either. It fits over the body nicely but it is long, longer than I expected. Not a deal breaker for me, because I do not mind, so if you are taller I think a L would still fit just fine.

The seams are all straight and it is well made. I cannot seem to find a tag for how to wash it safely, so either it's an oversight or the company doesn't put one in it. I washed mine on delicate so I suggest that putting it on a gentle cycle would be the best thing to do. It comes with a belt that at first glance looks huge, but once I put it on it was perfect with plenty of options to fit people at several different sizes.

Not a deal breaker for me, because I do not mind, so if you are taller I think a L would still fit just fine. I am pleased with this tank and would be more than happy to order from them again.<br />I am blessed to have received this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.",1844760,801502
5.0,1462494424000,It was nicely packaged and neatly folded in the packaging,"This arrived today after being ordered sometime ago. If you are wanting quick shipping this isn't going to happen, not unless you pay for it. It was nicely packaged and neatly folded in the packaging. Upon opening it, the product is nice and soft and more thin fabric than one might think, but not see through. It is also very black and not a faded black color. The seams are all straight and it is well made. I cannot seem to find a tag for how to wash it safely, so either it's an oversight or the company doesn't put one in it. I washed mine on delicate so I suggest that putting it on a gentle cycle would be the best thing to do. It comes with a belt that at first glance looks huge, but once I put it on it was perfect with plenty of options to fit people at several different sizes. I really like this pant suit, I have never had one before. The only thing I wish was different, is that it the legs are incredibly long, it fits the way it is supposed to but the length is insanely long. I am not sure if heels would help or if I am going to have to have that fixed. Either way, I am very pleased with this product and it is very nice.<br /><br />I am blessed to have received this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.",1844760,734998

The product would've been even better if it had a speaker on both sides but I guess it's was done purposely so you can listen through one ear and still listen to the outside environment with the other. I'm going to get another one as a gift for my friend who does not like eat phones or head phones.",1963378,135599

4.0,1542294231870,So many compliments on this dress!!,"I bought this dress to use as a Halloween costume with the hope that I would like it wear as a dress outside of Halloween.  It did not disappoint.  I did a lot of research reading through the reviews before i purchased it and I was very happy with my choice.  I received so many compliments on the dress and how it looked and fit.  I used it twice, as 50's Rockabilly and also a sugar skull.  I am 5'7'' 245 pounds and a 38 DDD bust.  I ordered the XL and it fit great.  I generally where a XL in normal everyday clothes or a size 16. I was not able to wear a bra with it mainly for the cut.  It came just below the knee without the petticoat, right at the knee with the petticoat.  The material was a good thick cotton as described in the prior reviews.  The only reason that I could not give this dress 5 stars is because of the zipper.  It is one of the zippers that is small and hidden so they are kinda hard to zip especially if you are doing it by yourself and the stretch panel in the back does not aid in the zipping process.  I feel this would not be an issue if you have some one to zip it for you however I did not.  I ended up putting on the dress over my head fully zipped and just pulled it down.  I did not like the ribbon belt that came with it, I would have liked something a little thicker.  Over all I loved the dress and so did everyone else.  I will be buying another in a different color.",1995193,15031

2.0,1563753103751,Trash luggage!!,I would never buy this luggage again.  Did not last two trips. I used it for a trip to Ireland and one handle ripped completely off.  Took on another trip trying to get my money's worth out of it and the other handle ripped off.  Left with luggage with no handles.  Had to stop my trip and purchase tie wraps and tape to make it home.  Now it's going in the trash.  I don't think I need say more.  So disappointed.,2009082,84566

5.0,1602768890350,Lovely & classy little pearl!,"I purchased the 7.5mm and it is lovely.  I have been searching for a charm for my gold necklace and this is delicate and classy.  Yes it is small so I would recommend the 7.5m at the smallest if you want it to be more noticeable.  But this pearl is so dainty, shimmers, and is high quality.  Obviously one can spend thousands on pearls, but for 40 dollars, this was a steal.  I love it.",2013196,137568
