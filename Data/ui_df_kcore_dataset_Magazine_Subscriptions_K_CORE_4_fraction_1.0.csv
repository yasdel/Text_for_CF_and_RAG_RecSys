5.0,1526830776794,Archaeology Magazine: One of the Best Magazines in Existence,"I have several magazines that I consult for my reading enjoyment and/or enlightenment. With most of them, I thumb through and focus only on articles that seem interesting, but there are a few magazines that seem to hit the mark so consistently that I read the almost the entire issue month after month. One good example of the latter is Archaeology Magazine.<br /><br />What sets this magazine apart from most others is the content itself. Yes, there are some cool illustrations but where Archaeology Magazine shines is with the articles themselves. They are packed full of fascinating information and they enrich your knowledge of history. And I don’t mean refresh your knowledge- I mean enrich, because much of what you read here is going to involve historical facts you likely never heard before. I come away from every issue learning something brand new about a specific era in world history and the cultures that lived and thrived during that time.<br /><br />Archaeology Magazine has very few advertisements. Most of them are clustered at the end of each issue, so you get uninterrupted reading from start to finish. Another thing I love is that most of the articles are not excessively long. Some are only a half- page or less. At most, they might cover four pages tops. I like this, because I’m the type who may not want to commit to a long, say, 10 page magazine article. I read some magazine with long articles like this and the moment I see that it’s going to be this long- and I always check before I start reading- I often skip the article completely.<br /><br />Yet another reason to love Archaeology Magazine is the quality of the writing. The editors make sure each article is clear and concise, with proper grammar and clarity. The articles are educational and they maintain an academic style. You’re not going to find much in the way of humor or other creative forms of non- fiction prose. No, Archaeology Magazine sticks with the facts and presents them in and informative way that archaeology and history enthusiasts will appreciate.<br /><br />I usually skim through most magazines, but Archaeology Magazine is different. It is one of the very few magazines that maintain my interest from beginning to end, with every article worthy of a read. Try this magazine for yourself, and get enlightened on the fascinating world we live in and all of its glorious past.",36,50
2.0,1336315735000,"National Geographic Kids: Too Much Fluff, too Little Education","Kids like to read magazines and books as long as they contain visual elements, games, and other things to keep them entertained. They don't even mind a little bit of education and learning as long as it is entertaining in some way. This is why kids' magazines are often so visual and colorful and National Geographic kids is, as expected, a publication loaded with pictures and bright colors. The magazine is focused mainly on animals, but also includes material on science, geography, technology, etc.<br /><br />My girls are big fans of several kids' magazines and they look forward to receiving issues in the mail each month. I like most of them, due to their educational value. But I must take exception to National Geographic Kids magazine. This publication does contain some educational material, but the problem is that the education is minimal, with the remaining pages covered with meaningless fluff and advertisements. The ads are especially annoying because National Geographic Kids intermingles the ads into what seems like an educational article. It is done in a subtle way that you may not even notice at first.<br /><br />National Geographic Kids attempts to break up the educational material with trivia, some photographs, and a few other things, but they are not items I would expect to see in a publication that is supposed to be aimed at children in the later elementary school age years and that is supposed to educate. It is also surprising how thin the magazine is- it seems more like a thick newsletter than a magazine publication.<br /><br />National Geographic itself is a great magazine and I am very surprised that such a quality publication would permit its name to be scarred by the likes of this magazine. It could be so much better with a little work. It isn't like National Geographic doesn't have the resources to make improvements. They have the expertise and the know- how to make a quality kids magazine, but seem content with this publication in its present form, in spite of its many flaws.<br /><br />Kids magazines are plentiful and there are some really good publications available that help teach kids about different subjects in an entertaining way. National Geographic Kids, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The worthwhile material can be isolated to about one- third of the magazine's limited pages and the overall educational value is minimal. Sum everything together and you have a magazine that isn't worth the money and should be avoided.",36,18
4.0,1324699161000,Texas Monthly Keeps You Up to Speed with the Lone Star State,"Texas Monthly Magazine is a magazine about a state, its places, and its people. This publication covers Texas culture, travel, music, arts, dining, special events, and more. Each issue takes readers on a journey throughout the state and keeps them up to date on the Lone Star State and her people.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine has more departments than the typical magazine and many of them are fun to read, offering a quick look inside a lesser- known town, festival, or individual that calls Texas home. A good example is the department titled Street Smarts. This short section offers a glimpse inside one of Texas' thousands of small towns along with a numbered list of special points of interest in the city. The music and books departments are fun, too, because they present some popular and soon- to- be- popular media from Texas residents. Another department I like for its pleasant amusement is one called the Manual. It presents something Texas- related in the areas of fashion and style and then offers some advice on the best usage or display of the item based on Texas culture.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine offers several long, featured articles and they can usually be found starting in the middle of each issue and continuing all the way to about the three- quarter mark. These longer featured articles can focus on most anything, from travel to art to food, to the people who create the art and prepare the food.  There are usually at least a few current event- type articles related to something important in the news while the other featured articles include stories about people, events, etc., that are generally timeless.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine is a well- written, well- edited magazine and it a nice reference and reading tool for Texas residents who like to learn more about the state and find new places to visit and things to try. I like having it handy, but if I could change one thing about this magazine, it would be the number of ads in each issue. True, all magazines need advertisements in order to generate reveune, but the number of ads in Texas Monthly Magazine is a tad excessive. Each issue opens up with about eighteen pages of ads before even reaching the table of contents. The next hundred or so pages have ads on every other page and the ads only diminish when you get to one of the featured articles. After that, the ads return for the remainder of the issue, with the final thirty to fifty pages consisting of practically nothing but ads.<br /><br />Going back to the positive points, another reason to like Texas Monthly is the long length of each issue. The magazine is much longer than most, with some issues approaching 300 pages in length. Yes, the ads are excessive, but even if all the ads were removed, you would still have a very large amount of reading material in each issue- much more than found in the majority of magazines.<br /><br />Texas is a very large, very diverse state with many things to offer and Texas Monthly is a very enjoyable read that helps Texas residents keep up with some of the many happenings in this great state. The ads are excessive, but when all factors are taken into account, this is still an enjoyable publication that every Texan should read and that many outsiders will enjoy as well.",36,53
4.0,1282924980000,Popular Mechanics: Practical and often Fascinating,"Popular Mechanics is a magazine dedicated to mechanics, repair, industry, and technology. This magazine offers timely articles that are often intelligent, thought- provoking, and often fascinating and/or awe- inspiring. They often talk about mechanical achievements, impressive technology, record- setting feats, etc. These articles show what humans are capable of doing and they remain in your memory for some time.<br /><br />These achievement- type articles are often the best in each issue, however, Popular Mechanics is more than just a magazine about incredible achievements. With Popular Mechanics, you get articles about cars, home improvement, repair, etc., which are more practical than anything. Car enthusiasts often enjoy Popular Mechanics more than anyone, due to the magazine's consistent articles on automobiles and reviews of automobiles. There are, in fact, multiple articles on automobiles and/or automotive technology in each issue and they are often among the lengthiest in the magazine.<br /><br />Besides cars, Popular Mechanics likes to devote space to the subject of home repair and improvement. These articles are nice because they offer practical advice that can help do- it- yourself readers save a good deal of cash. They are often educational in nature, too. How Your House Works, for example, is a subsection of the Home department and it describes in detail how a certain part of your home functions. It might sound boring at first, but it is often fascinating to learn what goes on behind the walls, under the foundation, inside the appliances, etc. Sometimes, the educational lesson is obvious but other times, the lessons learned are eye- opening and will expose homeowners to things about their home they never knew existed.<br /><br />Popular Mechanics is, overall, a very nice publication that I will continue to read. I like the articles that emphasize fascinating innovation and achievement best, but I can also agree that the home and automotive articles are very practical and useful. The over- emphasis on automobiles is a small complaint about Popular Mechanics, but the magazine as a whole is very good and very readable.",36,55
4.0,1260591102000,"Improve Your Knowledge, with Popular Science","Popular Science is a magazine I have been reading on and off for more than twenty years and it ranks as a science magazine for the masses. As most readers will tell you, Popular Science is a beginner's science publication and is generally intended for those who are curious about science and want to gain a better understanding of science and technology.<br /><br />Popular Science is more about technology than science and this is evident from the departments and most of the featured articles. Yes, Popular Science does include articles about atoms, chemicals, outer space, physics, etc., but the majority of the articles are about modern technology and its uses and applications. The technology articles are dedicated to subjects such as new vehicles, environmental trends, electronic devices, and more. Articles like these might seem a little out of scope, but one has to remember that the first word in the title of the magazine is Popular. Technology is huge, so it makes sense that the magazine would dedicate such a large percentage of its articles to high tech.<br /><br />The writing in Popular Science is very good, but as I said before, this magazine is intended more as a beginner's guide to science and technology. This means the articles will be perfectly fine for those with limited science and technology knowledge.  For those with a more advanced scientific mind, some of the articles may be too elementary. However, every issue can be counted on for at least a couple of in-depth, intellectual articles. Also, one needs to keep in mind that the articles are generally short and cover only a page or two. This is nice for those with shorter attention spans and for those who want to soak up as many facts about as many different things as possible.<br /><br />Learning more about science and technology is certainly a good idea and Popular Science is a good choice of reading material for those who are scientifically curious, want to improve their science knowledge level, and want to learn about the latest technology. The magazine could prove to be a little too simplistic for those with a working or educational background in science, but for everyone else, Popular Science presents a good means to keep up with the latest in science and high tech with writing that is clear and intelligent without going over the top.",36,59
4.0,1257190191000,Dwell Magazine Offers Unique Designs for the Home,"My mailbox overflows with magazines and among the themes, home and home- related topics are the most common. Dwell Magazine ranks as one of the better home magazines I read each month and it is one of only a few publications that I will return to throughout the month for entertainment and other purposes.<br /><br />What makes Dwell a unique publication is its dedication to more interesting and unusual home remodeling and rebuilding ideas. Other modern home magazines exist, but Dwell Magazine takes the idea of modern to a slightly different level than other, similar publications. With Dwell Magazine, the reader is presented with unusual homes, both on the exterior and interior, and many of them are certainly eye- catching, if nothing else. This magazine is all about homes that offer distinction and some of the design ideas are very interesting and will stick with you for a long time.<br /><br />Probably the most unique fact about Dwell Magazine is that, while it focuses on unusual and creative home design, it manages to maintain a level of livability. Other magazines that focus on unusual things- whether it's the home or something else- often take the weirdness factor to the extreme and they end up alienating most readers. But Dwell Magazine avoids making this mistake. The ideas it presents are unusual and creative, but still within the boundaries of taste and practicality.<br /><br />Magazines usually offer articles that cover a large range of topics each month, but one other interesting aspect of Dwell Magazine is that each magazine is based on a specific theme. This theme is clearly spelled out on the front cover, directly under the magazine's name, in bold letters. This is nice because you already have a good idea what to expect when you open the pages of any issue. The featured articles for the month will stick to the main theme for that particular issue.<br /><br />Dwell Magazine is one of hundreds of publications that focus on the home, but it easily stands out in the pack and I rank it among my favorites in this genre. I'm not into home design on a do-it-yourself level, but I do like to look at homes and the rooms within homes and I am always open to new ideas. Dwell Magazine offers plenty of creative ideas every month and it's a good magazine to consult for home makeover plans.",36,60
4.0,1225305798000,Can't Curb Your Enthusiasm? Read Cycle World!,"Motorcycle enthusiasts are a unique breed and the main quality that sets them apart from the rest of civilization is their unyielding enthusiasm for their chosen sport/hobby. They often become consumed with biking and, like golf fanatics and others, they view every spare moment as an excuse to partake in their chosen activity.<br /><br />Cycle World is a magazine designed with the motorcycle enthusiast in mind. This publication is made for the type of biker who not only likes to ride his cycle, but also liked to learn as much about motorcycles as possible. There are, of course, plenty of articles in each issue of Cycle World that talk about the joys of riding and the sport of motorcycle racing. But Cycle World includes other articles, too- articles that only the well- rounded motorcycle fan will be likely to read and appreciate. Some articles focus on new technology. Others dispense advice on motorcycle repair. There are also travel articles and personality profiles as well, making for a nicely rounded publication.<br /><br />I'm not a motorcycle enthusiast or even a casual fan, but I still like certain sections of Cycle World and I try to read a few of them every month. My favorite sections of Cycle World are those that feature new products. Cycle World is among the first publications to report on new motorcycles and other related products and the magazine includes plenty of great photos, test data, and various statistics. In a matter of minutes, one can quickly learn the pros and cons of a specific motorcycle and more easily make a buying decision. Even though I am not a fan, I still like these articles because, like articles on new cars, they often include some very cool new product offerings that can easily impress anyone- even a nonfan like me.<br /><br />Motorcycles are loved by their many enthusiastic fans and Cycle World is a magazine intended for those who want a well- rounded publication about motorcycles, their upkeep, and their use for entertainment. Most of the pages in each issue are dedicated to the different motorcycles produced by different manufacturers, but there is plenty other information to be found in this magazine about motorcycles and Cycle World makes a good choice for those who want to know how to ride, repair, and enjoy their hobby as much as possible.",36,67
4.0,1214419310000,Intellectually Stimulating and Highly Anticipated Each Month,"The Atlantic is an intellectual magazine and one that I have been reading on and off for many years. This magazine is best known for its political/current events/social articles that tackle some tough issues of the day and it delivers most effectively when it's offering some commentary on world events and social issues and these are the articles I turn to first when I read The Atlantic. I like the political articles best, but there are plenty of other non- political yet very thoughtful articles in each issue.<br />Most every article in The Atlantic is thoughtful and well- written. Look closely at the authors of some of the stories in this magazine and you will notice some high- profile names on more than one occasion. Christopher Hitchens, Mark Bowden, Eric Schlosser, and others are known to contribute an article or two in each issue of The Atlantic. These writers, and others like them, are ready to offer their take on some of the critical issues of the day.<br /><br />The Atlantic certainly offers some interesting, thoughtful, intellectual articles and one fact that sets them apart from those found in most other magazines is that the featured articles are often very long- sometimes exceeding ten pages in length. Most magazines shy away from articles this long because they know that most reader's have an attention span that is far too short to finish the entire piece of reading in one sitting. But The Atlantic is different. If the subject matter is such that an article needs to be ten- plus pages in order to thoroughly cover everything, then The Atlantic is quick to oblige. I appreciate the excellent coverage but I must admit that some articles are almost too long. Even when I have an interest in the subject matter, I often end up stopping halfway through because I cannot hold my attention any longer.<br /><br />Another section I like in The Atlantic is the book reviews section. To present a fair and balanced perspective, The Atlantic reviews new books from many different genres and I like that there are different reviews of varying lengths. One section of The Atlantic called Cover to Cover includes short summaries of many different books. These are nice when you don't have time to read a lengthy review of a book and just want the basics. But there are also some very long book reviews in The Atlantic, along with some advertisements for new books that include a short, 50 to 100 word summary of the book. I like reading the reviews, but I like this section best for its exposure to new book releases. It is like looking at a quick rundown of intellectual books and I have, in fact, discovered some very good titles from this part of the magazine.<br /><br />Overall, The Atlantic ranks among my favorite magazines and I look forward to some serious, intellectual reading in each issue. I admit that some articles are a tad too lengthy, but I still like The Atlantic for its intellectual stimulation and for its focus on current events. It's a very good magazine for cerebral types who like to read about politics and social issues.",36,70
4.0,1190665602000,Maximizing Electronics Enjoyment,"Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.<br /><br />When Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.<br /><br />One thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.<br /><br />Overall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.",36,72
3.0,1190152066000,Making Your Living Space More Livable,"This Old House is a magazine dedicated to home improvement. Based on the popular PBS television program, this magazine aims to help its readers find new and better ways to improve the home and perform routine maintenance.<br /><br />Magazines and the internet are my primary sources when home repair reaches the critical point. This Old House is one of several magazines I like to read and it is the one I turn to most frequently when I need to find out about home maintenance. The majority of other home- related publications deal strictly with enhancements, remodeling, and general improvement. This Old House offers these types of articles, along with articles on general home repair, landscaping techniques, utility cost savings, and more.<br /><br />My favorite departments in This Old House are ""Around the House"", ""Toolbox"", and ""Salvage"". The last department, Salvage, sounds boring at first but it often gets very creative. This department selects a common household item- usually one that is probably slated to get tossed in the trash- and points out a creative way to re- use the item. Some of the ideas they come up with are surprising, making this one of the first sections I turn to when I get a new issue in the mail.<br /><br />Some parts of This Old House are not appealing at all, either because the suggestions are far too costly for someone like me; because they involve skills that I do not possess; or a combination of the two. The Luxury department is one such area. Another is the Design sections. These areas are intended for the more advanced home improver who has advanced skills at home design. There are some very expensive suggestions, too, and these parts of the magazine provide more fantasy reading than anything. However, there are still enough less expensive ideas to keep the magazine useful and practical.<br /><br />Overall, This Old House is a good magazine that offers some home improvement ideas, some repair suggestions, and some ways to enhance your home's value. The general repair advice is pretty handy and while I don't have much use for other parts of the magazine, I can agree that these are helpful to the right type of person. It makes This Old House a good publication for those who seek advice for home repair and home enhancement.",36,73
4.0,1184234382000,Smart Money Combines Business and Personal Finance,"Smart Money is a solid magazine about business and finance and I have been reading it on and off again for the past five years. This magazine is a little bit big business and a little bit personal finance, combining together the features of a business magazine with that of an investment publication.<br /><br />One of the main things I like about Smart Money is the fact that it includes so many different articles each month. There are only a few regular departments in this magazine. The majority of the pages include featured articles and short articles that change from month to month. These articles can cover a wide range of topics from ways to cut your electric bill to the latest regulations in the insurance industry.<br /><br />Smart Money is an intelligent magazine and its articles are often a little more advanced than those of other financial publications. They don't reach a level that is too advanced to make them incapable of understanding, and that is good. But they are certainly intended for the savvier investor who already knows the ropes and wants some more specific, intermediate to advanced advice on personal finance and corporate happenings.<br /><br />Overall, I rank Smart Money as a very good personal finance magazine and it is one I will continue to read when I get the chance. It is like a combination of Fortune and Money magazines and its timely articles are often very interesting and helpful. Whether it's an article on reducing your cell phone bill or an article about the profit picture in the oil business, Smart Money is certain to inform and enlighten.",36,74
3.0,1163620402000,Wired for the Modern World,"Wired is a semi- interesting magazine that blends together articles about technology with those on politics, culture, and more. This magazine is aimed at a diverse audience but it generally caters to those who are technology savvy and like to keep up with the latest world events.<br /><br />Wired dedicates most of its pages to the discussion of electronics and other technology and computer nerds form a large percentage of the magazine's core subscribers. Articles about digital cameras, high definition televisions, internet marketing, and other like topics can be found in every issue. These articles often present unique angles on common problems and concerns in the world of high tech.<br /><br />What makes Wired interesting is the fact that it includes other articles on other subjects- topics that one normally would not associate with a technology magazine. It is common to find articles about popular culture, politics, and other topics and they sometimes seem out of place. One minute you're reading an article about PDA's and the next minute you're reading an article about the war against Iraq. It's a little weird but it also makes for a nice change of pace as you read.<br /><br />Another interesting fact with Wired is that it changes its authors more frequently than other magazines. The magazine has a few regulars but it likes to shuffle the writers around each month. This can be good and it can result in articles that present new and different perspectives each month. But it also means that the magazine is a little uneven and can sometimes include articles that do not communicate the way they should. I can recall reading several articles that left me scratching my head, wondering why the editor didn't make additional changes so that the articles were clearer.<br /><br />The departments in Wired cover a large percentage of the space in every issue and they exceed the total length of many other magazines' department sections. The departments (with the exception of one) occupy the first two- thirds of each issue. The monthly featured articles are found near the end of each issue. This layout is different from other magazines that mix the departments and monthly features together. With Wired, the departments and featured articles are kept separate.<br /><br />Overall, I like Wired as a whole and the political articles rank as my favorite part of each issue. The magazine jumps around from topic to topic and the authors change more frequently than other magazines; two facts that could make Wired a little too scattered for certain readers. Some of the articles are not the best written I have ever seen but Wired is still a good enough magazine to recommend. It keeps readers current on technology, politics, business, and entertainment with a reputation for being modern and hip.",36,80
4.0,1153771169000,Enticing Photos and Great Articles,"Coastal Living is a professionally- made magazine with lots of enticing photographs, personal stories, and general advice on making the most out of life on the coast. The emphasis in Coastal Living is on waterfront property and the events and entertainment that often take place in cities with a large coastal area.<br /><br />Much of what you read in Coastal Living pertains to better- known waterfront areas in the United States. Such popular destinations as Boston, Miami, New York, Long Island, California, Cape Cod, South Padre Island, and other tourist- oriented places comprise a large portion of the featured articles in this magazine. Many of these places (like New York City) have very expensive waterfront property than can often be next to impossible to buy. But these areas also include lots of tourist activities, which is why they are so frequently highlighted in this magazine.<br /><br />Besides the well- known destinations, Coastal Living also includes a good number of featured articles on lesser- known places. Many of these lack the fast- pace and the extensive nightlife of the more popular destinations, but they also offer better deals on property and an opportunity to get away from the chaos of the larger cities. Such places as the Delaware coast, Michigan, Ohio's Lake Erie coast, and others are often very quaint and interesting. Also, they offer property that is far more reasonable in price and is often within the affordability range for many buyers.<br /><br />Much of the properties you see and read about in Coastal Living are quite expensive. But remember- the majority of the homes are on major coastlines, so you can't expect to find them for selling for a low cost. These are high- demand, low supply properties and they vary greatly in price, but they are all expensive. In a popular area, these homes can sell up to the tens of millions of dollars. But in less popular areas, you can sometimes find some bargain prices on waterfront property. For example, Coastal Living has highlighted many Great Lakes properties that are priced very close to the overall U.S. average. They are not as cheap as most areas of the inner cities, no. But they are priced within the reach of many families.<br /><br />The emphasis in Coastal Living seems to be on properties- both main residences and vacation properties that are adjacent to a major coastline. But there are other items promoted for sale besides property. And much of this other merchandise is also quite costly. In the ""Currents"" section, for example, it is common to find things like lawn furniture, cufflinks, fancy pitchers, and other things selling for many times the usual price. Most of it is intended for those who want a little bit more and are willing (and able) to pay the price.<br /><br />Coastal Living is a personal magazine. Most of the stories involve families and couples who enjoy the coast. They share with the reader such things as how they keep their homes protected from the sea, what they do for entertainment, how they like to decorate, and why living on the coast means so much to them. Photos of families and couples often grace the pages of these types of articles, giving them a friendly, domestic feel.<br /><br />Most of what you will find in Coastal Living relates to the United States coast. There is only an occasional article about other coastal areas, like those of Mexico, the Caribbean, and other places. True, you will sometimes find an article about Hawaii or Alaska. But for the most part, Coastal Living tries to keep its journalism concentrated on places that lie within close proximity to the majority of Americans.<br /><br />Overall, Coastal Living is a very good magazine for people who enjoy vacationing on the coast, finding entertainment on the coast and, of course, living on the coast. The photography and presentation are excellent and it's interesting to read about the big- city life on the coast as well as some of the more ""unknown"" destinations. It provides great reading and a useful reference for people who already live on the coast or who are interested in purchasing waterfront property.",36,83
2.0,1153770772000,"Lots of Photos and Ads, Little Content","Interview is definitely a different type of magazine for me- someone who usually reads business and travel mags- and it's not quite what I expected. With a title like ""Interview"" I read my first copy of this magazine anticipating pages and pages of nothing but interviews. It turns out that interviewing is the main focus of the magazine, but it's not the only one. There is substantial space given to fashion, movies, and other areas, too. Some of these columns are worth an occasional look, but they failed to grab my attention. The writers seem to play it safe, and that includes the interview section. They don't ask many daring or controversial questions. They keep it simple, asking questions about an entertainer's latest album or movie, without delving much into their personal lives.<br /><br />Interview has many general annoyances. My greatest complaint is the advertising and the arrangement of the contents. About half of the pages in each issue are covered with ads, with fashion, liquor, beer, and hair care items providing the bulk of the advertising revenue. The ads are everywhere, with the majority in the front pages of each issue. The table of contents is buried, and I find this very frustrating. The contents starts with the interviews for that specific issue on one page, then a few pages later, proceeds to the remainder of the contents, which is the regular monthly features. What's annoying is that you have to search for the table of contents. It varies from one issue to the next, falling somewhere in the first half.<br /><br />Interview also varies greatly in length. Some issues are as short as 80 pages while others are more than 200 pages long. The shorter issues use staples for binding while the longer issues are bound in a more professional way, minus any metal.<br /><br />This magazine centers on entertainers, fashion, music, and the like. You won't find any interviews with politicians, businessmen, etc. Interview sticks strictly to entertainers, and that includes the regular monthly columns. You won't find a column about the business side of the music industry or film industry. You will find only articles about the stars themselves.<br /><br />Interview's only saving grace is the photography. It would make a nice gift for those who enjoy fashion and who like looking at pages and pages of men and women modeling fancy clothing. But in many ways, the photos are overemphasized and there isn't enough substance to the magazine. The articles are very shallow with more eye candy than reading material.<br /><br />Overall, Interview is sloppy and cluttered with too many ads to make it worthwhile reading material. My subscription was free, and I'm thankful that it was. Besides a few nice photos for clothing, there isn't much to make this magazine worth the cost.",36,84
4.0,1137980073000,Sunset Fills You With Visions of the Western U.S.,"Sunset is a magazine dedicated to the people, culture, and lifestyle of the American west. This magazine divides its space among many different topics, such as food and entertainment, travel, recreation, gardening and more.<br /><br />I have been reading this magazine for about six months now and there are several things about it that make it worthwhile. The thing that stands out the most are the photographs, and I'm not talking about just the stunning scenery one normally associates with the West (like the National Parks or the coastline). Even the ordinary pictures are striking. In the Gardening section, for example, it is common to find pictures of family homes that have beautifully landscaped yards full of blossoming flowers and colorful plants. In the Home & Design section, one can find nice photographs of home interiors, showing different designs and furniture.<br /><br />One of the most unique qualities of Sunset is the fact that it is published in five different editions. There is a specially designed issue for the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia), Northern California (Northern California and the majority of Nevada), Southern California (Southern California and Hawaii), The Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas area of Nevada), and Rocky Mountain (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah). This is a nice idea and it's one that other magazines should consider emulating. Based on where you live or where you have an active interest, this will be the region that your issue spends its pages covering. My subscription is for the Northern California region, so I am treated each month to articles about places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Reno (Nevada), Lake Tahoe, etc.<br /><br />One of the specialties of this magazine is food and it is common to find recipes throughout every issue. There is a special section set aside for food, but one can expect to find food articles and recipes everywhere as they read. Even the cover page of each issue features a food dish. And as you might guess, the featured recipes are generally those types of cuisine normally associated with each specific region of the west, with plenty of generic recipes thrown in to make sure everyone has something to cook.<br /><br />One of the specialty sections of this magazine that I like is the ""Value Vacation""- a subsection of Travel & Recreation. This section highlights a specific place to travel and then offers a day by day breakdown of things to do and places to see, with the cost for each itemized so you know exactly what to expect. The highlighted city or tourist area can be anyplace in the west and isn't limited to the region that your issue covers. This section is nice because it lets you see in black & white what it will cost for a few days of budget entertainment. It reminds me of some of the television programs shown on the Travel Channel.<br /><br />Advertisements cover about 40 to 50 percent of the pages of each issue and they are often found in bunches in the front and back and on alternating pages for much of the rest of each issue (typical for most magazines). The ads can center on all sorts of different things. Because this is a combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home & garden/living magazine, the ads cover a wide range of products and services, from laundry detergent to credit cards to cat food.<br /><br />Overall, Sunset has proven itself an enjoyable magazine. I don't live in the western United States but this region is my favorite part of the country, so it makes sense that I would find something of value in this publication. I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine. If you're dead set in your ways and refuse to read about anything that deviates from your Eastern, Southern, or Midwestern lifestyle, then you may not like Sunset. But for the majority of people, Sunset has much to offer with pages and pages of eye- catching pictures and friendly articles about life in the American West.",36,87
4.0,1128178646000,The Many Challenges of Business Ownership,"Entrepreneur magazine is one of my favorite business publications and it's the type of magazine I can count on for up- to- date information on business startups and for possible resolutions of common problems to the small business owner. A monthly publication, this magazine is designed to appeal to those who are presently owners of a small enterprise or who aspire to open their own business in the near future.<br /><br />What I enjoy most about this magazine are its personal articles- stories about ordinary people like you and me who have successfully started a new business venture. These people share their success stories with the reader, offering insight on what strategies helped them reach their present level of success and what challenges they still face. The people featured in the articles are more down to earth types who own smaller companies, making the magazine more realistic and something I and others can better relate to. Many other business magazines spend too much time interviewing billionaire CEO's and others who, while they may have some interesting stories to share, live lifestyles and have problems that only someone of their stature can relate.<br /><br />On the practical side, Entrepreneur contains many timely articles about common issues/problems/challenges that arise when you own your own company. Money, marketing, management, and other key topics are covered in each issue, with a regular department for these critical aspects of business ownership. In these sections, you can learn about tax law changes, legal issues with benefits, and other related topics.<br /><br />Entrepreneur organizes each issue quite nicely, with colored tabs on the pages that indicate which section (money, technology, marketing, etc.) they pertain to. This makes it that much easier to sift through, to find the information you need. And there is a section titled ""Sources"" that helps to index the different services and companies mentioned in each issue.<br /><br />Overall, this is a useful, practical magazine that can come in very handy for present business owners and for those who have an interest in proprietorship. It keeps business owners up to date with the latest changes in laws and it offers some creative solutions to the everyday problems that small businesses encounter each day.",36,90
3.0,1106925002000,Attention Female Shoppers,"This magazine is a product of CondeNet publishing and it is aimed at the younger female market, roughly from ages 18 to 30. This publication is a shopper's paradise, with more advertising than most any other magazine on the market.<br /><br />I got a complimentary subscription to this magazine one day and I accepted, not only because it was free, but also because I really didn't know it was a woman's fashion magazine. With a title like ""Lucky"", there were all sorts of possibilities. It could have been about gambling, sweepstakes, or about getting lucky. I didn't know it was a woman's magazine, so I accepted it. And from what I can see, this magazine is one of average worth to the average person and it will appeal mostly to younger women.<br /><br />Fashion covers a good amount of the magazine's 200 plus pages. Beauty tips are another important area of coverage. It is also common to see samples of different products inside the pages of each issue. Things like perfume samples, shampoo, and other things can be found buried somewhere within each copy. The coverage includes casual as well as high- class clothing and beauty products, with most of it falling at the upper end of the cost scale.<br /><br />If you can tolerate the clogging of advertisements, this magazine might be a good choice for the younger female crowd that likes to keep in- tune with the latest styles and trends. Outside of that targeted market, however, I don't see much use for Lucky magazine. The photography is very good and the presentation is professional, but the magazine will likely be rated average by a large cross- section of the population.",36,93
3.0,1106068868000,"Good Eats, Fine Drinks, and Having Fun","Food and Wine is a pretty good magazine for those who enjoy the finer things in life when it comes to unusual cuisine and expensive fermented beverages. This publication is usually very long- over 250 pages- and its packed full of recipes, travel excursions to wine growing regions, and general facts about different varieties of wine and where to find them.<br /><br />One thing about this magazine that surprised me at first is the emphasis on the food. I know the magazine is titled ""Food and Wine"", but my initial impression was that this would be a magazine devoted entirely to wine with occasional mention of the foods that go with wine. It isn't like that at all. The food sections and the recipes are just as important as the featured wines. Recipes are so frequent, in fact, that the magazine even has an index located near the front with all the recipes listed by food type, showing the page number to turn to for the recipe.<br /><br />Besides the frequent talk about food and wine, this magazine is also dedicated to entertaining. I have heard it suggested that this magazine should change its name to ""Food, Wine, and Entertainment"". It would make sense, because conviviality and high- class partying are certainly an important component of this magazine.<br /><br />There is one thing about Food and Wine that I wish was different. I appreciate the factual information and I like the personal touch that you find in some of the stories about winery owners, chefs, and the like. But I think Food and Wine gets a little too sidetracked from time to time in its reporting. For example, it is common to find stories that talk about subjects like home decorating. This would be fine in a magazine about home design, but I don't think it belongs in a magazine like this.<br /><br />Overall, this is still a good publication. Lovers of great eats and fine drinks will enjoy it the most. It's worth taking a look, if nothing else, just for the recipes. Even if you're not a frequent imbiber of the fruit of the vine, there is still something of interest to be found in the pages of this magazine.",36,94
5.0,1103343320000,Golf's Best Magazine Publication,"Golfers share many things in common and one of these is an often fanatical love for the game. For these types, nothing can take the place of heading to the nearest golf course, but Golf Digest comes very close. This magazine contains over 200 pages each month, dedicated exclusively to the sport of golf.<br /><br />The things that set Golf Digest apart from the competition are the numerous articles about learning and improving your game and the personal stories and interviews. Other golfing publications attempt to help you learn, but they often get too mechanical. Golf Digest shows you how to improve your game with tips from professionals, including some of the star- studded members of the golfing elite like Tiger Woods.<br /><br />Besides all the tips and tricks, Golf Digest also shows the personal side of the sport with interviews and more intimate stories about the many colorful personalities in the game. This personal dimension adds greatly to the magazine's overall appeal, providing great reading material to complement the more instructional side of the magazine.<br /><br />Golfing Digest may not be as great as a day spent on your favorite golf course, but it comes close. I consider it the best publication of its kind and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the game.",36,96
5.0,1098998332000,Learn about the World and its many Wonders,"National Geographic is one of the best magazines of its kind, with plenty of great photography, thoughtful articles, and diverse coverage of several different topics relating to the planet earth. Stories about wildlife, different cultures, and even environmentalism and the politics it breeds can be found on the pages within each issue.<br /><br />What makes this magazine so enjoyable is the fact that it goes so in- depth in its coverage and includes stories with a personal element. When most people think about National Geographic, they usually think about the great photographs of natural wonders, exotic plants, and animal wildlife. These things are all great, but they form only part of the magazine's overall appeal. Stories about different cultures and peoples from around the world are just as good, and are usually presented in a personal way. You feel like you know the people on an intimate level when you read this magazine.<br /><br />This publication contains between 120 and 160 pages in most issues, with about a dozen or so monthly departments, as well as some varied articles that change each month, but are always concentrated on nature, science, politics, culture, etc.<br /><br />National Geographic is often very educational and intellectual, making it a learning device as well as a magazine for entertainment. It's one of the better, more thorough magazines on the market. Go ahead and give it a try. You just might learn something in the process.",36,98
3.0,1098413884000,It's What Men Like to Read,"Men's Journal is a decent magazine full of varied topics of interest to men. This magazine covers areas like sports, adventure travel, fashion and style, cars and trucks, career issues, etc. This publication directs all of its articles toward men, with an emphasis on what is most appealing to males throughout a typical week in their lives.<br /><br />One thing about Men's Journal that is a little different from other men's magazines is that it doesn't flaunt women to sell its issues. In fact, there are practically no pictures of women at all in this publication- something that will be considered an asset to some, and a liability to others. This magazine refuses to play the female card and instead focuses its articles on topics that men like to read about.<br /><br />Men's Journal is often obsessed with lists, and I think this is especially true in the last few years. Take a look at the cover of most issues and you will see a large, boldface advertisement for some sort of list. In one issue, it might be a ranking of the best cities for entry level jobs. In another issue, it might be a listing of the best places for young entrepreneurs. Whatever it might be, Men's Journal seems to have an infatuation with lists, probably because men like lists and it helps increase sales.<br /><br />This magazine can be counted on to produce some fairly good reading, but I must warn that many of the articles are a little too simplistic, with little emphasis on intellectualism. Even the articles about politics and business are often riddled with obvious statements that most anyone would know. But overall, I still think Men's Journal is a good magazine. It is varied enough that most anyone will find something interesting to read and the price is very low.",36,99
5.0,1067873213000,Flawless Publication for Lovers of the Great Outdoors,"Backpacker is an outstanding magazine for those who love to hike and also for those who enjoy paging through a magazine containing lots of enticing photographs of nature scenes. This magazine is, first and foremost, a publication for lovers of the outdoors and the sport of backpacking. But the pictures of mountains, lakes, streams, wildlife, etc., are enticing to anyone. They can quickly convert the non- outdoorsman type into a nature lover.<br />Besides the great pictures, Backpacker is also excellent for its product testing and for its advice and educational material. Backpacks, mountain bikes, tents, and so forth might seem like simple products, but you would be surprised at how many different varieties and options are available for this type of merchandise. Backpacker describes different items available for sale, complete with web site address and phone# so you can make a purchase, and it often conducts tests to see how the different products stack up. It also offers educational material on the sport of backpacking and general advice on such topics as food, exercise, proper nutrition, first aid, etc.<br />Backpacker averages between 90 and 120 pages in total length and it's published 9 times per year (three of the issues combine two months into one). It's one of the few special interest magazines I have read that has something to offer most anyone. Even if you don't like hiking, there is still a good chance you will enjoy thumbing through the pages of Backpacker, if nothing else, just to enjoy the great photography.<br />Overall, this is an outstanding outdoor publication. The articles, the personal stories, the advice, the photos, and the educational material all add up to a perfect magazine for anyone who loves to partake in outdoor activity or who just enjoys looking at the stunning photos. 5+ stars to Backpacker!",36,104
4.0,1486687089000,Roasted Banana Bars with Browned Butter Pecan Frosting,"I found a Cooking Light magazine from 2009 and tried their banana bars with browned butter pecan frosting. Can I say delicious (the bananas are roasted with brown sugar and butter first), but I think personally I'd about half the sugar. When they say light in this magazine they seem to mean reducing fat. So the recipe had 8.4g of fat but 35.1g of carbs . I think if they are going to say a recipe is healthier they should also reduce the sugar. So next time I'll remember how sweet the cake was and lower the amount of sugar to say 3/4 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup. Light to me at least seems to mean less fat AND sugar. I didn't play around with the recipe because I only had three bananas and couldn't afford to get it wrong on the first try. I'll try other recipes in this magazine if I find any in the future but I'll remember to pay attention to the sugar.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",95,158
4.0,1424046624000,Excellent Stories of Days Gone By,My mother-in-law has a subscription to this magazine and gives me her copies when she is done with them. The last one I read was from July/August 2011. This magazine has stories about hanging clothes on clotheslines and canning vegetables. Since I grew up overseas in Africa this magazine appeals to me since it talks about things from my childhood. I'm only 47 but it is like I lived 100 years ago. The advertisements in this magazine do seem geared for people in their 70s and beyond. What I love reading is the Wanted ads. A lot of people are looking for old friends or for items to make their lives more fun. So overall this is a pleasant magazine to read when you get a chance.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,95,161
5.0,1150570836000,Artistic Design with Unique Features,"Spa Parties and T-shirts that say ""Delish"" are very much a part of Rachael's magazine complete with pullout recipe cards and travel features. The recipe cards all have shopping lists on the back, so you can grab the cards and head to the grocery store. There is also a handy recipe index organized by categories at the end of the magazine.<br /><br />The Kids recipe section encourages young cooks to participate in family meals. This issue had a recipe for a delicious tuna salad with roasted red pepper and grape tomatoes. Just for Kids tips give ideas for how to juice a lemon and there are cute kid comments about the recipes.<br /><br />Everyday with Rachael Ray embraces life and does it with a realistic flair. In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms.<br /><br />What I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze.<br /><br />This is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael's recipes. The ""Ask Rachael"" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine. She also has decorating advice so now you know what to do with the shells you collected at the beach (or you could find them at Pier 1).<br /><br />What is the best feature in this magazine besides the recipes? ""What is in the refrigerator of your favorite Celeb?"" I'm always intrigued.<br /><br />If you collect cookbooks, there are many featured in this inspired magazine. The advertising doesn't seem to overtake the pages and is subtly blended in so it feels very natural and interesting.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",95,11
5.0,1135785836000,Blueberry Pudding & Food Festivals,"Saveur is a celebration of authentic cuisine with everything from Food Festivals to very easy-to-make recipes, like Blueberry Pudding. While there are a few book reviews for foodies to enjoy, the writing introduces cooks to international flavors and seasonal fare. Restaurants are also a feature as are gourmet cooking essentials.<br /><br />While reading you may discover a pastry shop or start to dream of making a recipe like Chicken Fried Steak. Yes, this very gourmet book has comfort food recipes as well as more complex recipes like the one for Olive Bread which actually only requires a minimum of bread making skills.<br /><br />After reading this magazine I'm normally in the mood to drizzle olive oil over just about anything I'm putting in the oven. The recipe for Stuffed Tomatoes and Summer Squash had me wishing it was October again and the recipe for Fig Jam reminded me of my childhood in Africa where we had a Fig Tree in the backyard.<br /><br />Saveur is filled with nostalgia, entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes. With Amazon's Gourmet food section, we can now find the ingredients to make many of the recipes in this magazine.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",95,157

For example, the April/May 2004 issue had articles on:<br /><br />Home Cooking - a contractor and his three sons design a home with the kitchen at the heart of the home.<br /><br />Cutting It Up - A downtown Los Angeles loft gets a makeover.<br /><br />Stainless Chef - Designer John Picard finds a sanctuary with a high-tech steam oven and a hand-carved tub.<br /><br />Victorian Revival - A San Franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations.<br /><br />Trend Diva - Jane Szita talks about nesting and nihilism.<br /><br />Other interesting articles include information on houses that become art, short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or CD changers which are most modern.<br /><br />Well, until I can afford a 9,500 buck oven, I'll keep reading and dreaming. The library in the April/May issue is to die for! Big windows and shelves galore.<br /><br />Dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did! Even some of the text is in color. The Marketplace section gives you a wealth of sources to encourage you to start on your own dream design, house or otherwise. The sourcing section also provides page by page information on sources.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",95,60

And five minutes later, you are still looking for ""that"" article. Well, in this magazine they have a great Contents page with a special: ""On the Cover"" section. So, if you want to read about Nicole Kidman she is on page 110! OK, that was in the November 2001 issue and it is quite a sad article. What ever happened to the fairy tale? I just don't know...<br /><br />Now, if you love reading about other people who are making the news, the People section always has something fun to read about. Fashion and beauty gives ideas on the latest nail color or makeup tips. The articles on relationships are interesting.<br /><br />This magazine also has sections for: Health & Well Being, Consumer Sense, The Better Way, Food & Home, Fiction, Departments and Columns. The TECH section is always of interest. There is a definite focus on women, as in: ""The Best Cell Phones for Women."" Plus, this is where you can find Heloise giving out the newest Household Tips.<br /><br />My favorite page is the looks, trends, and news page where they always give you ideas for holidays or feature beauty products like Pumpkin Pie body wash in November.

Didn't you get my fax?""<br /><br />Something about the pictures in this magazine always remind me of a bright sunny day. The open kitchens and lush gardens are just a treat to see.<br /><br />The recipe section really has a personality all of its own.

Now my Aunt is carrying on the family tradition of keeping a subscription going.<br /><br />A unique feature in this magazine is the Recipe Index. You can also find ideas for Travel and Recreation, Garden and Outdoor Living, Home and Design and of course Food and Entertaining. The monthly columns are quite unique. Like in the December 2001 issue, Peter Fish wrote an article about The voice of Christmas which is about Bing Crosby.<br /><br />In the middle of the magazine, you can find a postcard that says: Information worth sending for. They do all the work for you...you just have to circle the information number to receive information on everything from International Travel to products you see advertised.

The first copy I received turned into a cover to cover read.<br /><br />Four specific `things I learned' in my first copy included:<br /><br />1. Only in 2011 have arctic glaciers receded to the 1300AD, pre Little Ice Age extant based on carbon dating newly exposed flora. The LIA may be finally over, 160 later than previously believed. The cause of the LIA is hypothesized on 4 nearly simultaneous volcanic eruptions.<br /><br />2. The human eye's white sclera and small iris are unique in nature allowing the ability to discern and communicate `gaze'. It is hypothesized that this ability to discern visual direction permitted the domestication of dogs. H.nea did not domestic dogs in the same period. Dog domestication may have been a critical factor in H.sap's success.<br /><br />3. Civilization's development of `cities' has been pushed back 5,000 years based on Jordanian excavations to 20,000 years ago.<br /><br />4. The soap-bubble analog computer reveals a previously unknown form of crystal symmetry new to both mathematics and science.<br /><br />If I can glean 4 new specifics to think about between mag editions, I'm happy.<br /><br />Thank you previous Amazon reviewers!

It's consistent quirkiness and unpredictability is on display everywhere (in small print, upside down, etc) and there is hardly a white space in its margins. It's compressed high quality info. Its target audience is technology market ""early adopters"".  It's an eclectic mix of current technology, trivia, art, techno-society and speculation. It's consistently prescient in its speculation ... the management keeps a tidy score. There are success stories and smoking-black-hole failure stories that push the reader's critical thinking skills.<br /><br />I don't know how they make money selling subscriptions this cheap.

My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.<br /><br />During a cross country moving event 7 years ago, I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology, not a telemarketer for sure, called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months.

5.0,1302301939000,VERANDA Virtuosity!,"VERANDA reigns along with the other three most beautiful and stylish U.S. shelter magazines today: Architectural Digest, Elle Decor and House Beautiful. What I like about VERANDA is the photography and rooms dominate and the text takes a supporting role.  The magazine features many full-page and double-page spreads of gorgeous rooms with not a lot of text interrupting.  Design is one of the fields in which you can learn by just studying a room in detail to get a sense of the scale, proportion, balance of texture and light and shadow etc.<br /><br />You are training your eye in what the best designers find beautiful.  A full and double-page spread allows you to do that better than smaller, choppier photos. It's great to have more visual, less words in which the rooms triumph. More to see--less to read. There's enough text in VERANDA to get into the designers'/homeowners' minds. VERANDA'S lush heavy paper stock is a joy, too, and increases the aesthetic experience.  The photos of the rooms look spectacular on it.<br /><br />VERANDA features eclectic styles and locations.  This month, for example, the magazine showcases a townhouse in Georgetown, a Park Avenue apartment, a Parisian pied-a-terre, a Florida ocean-front home and a Normandy-inspired Atlanta home along with a Cotswold garden. There's a mix of styles from Provencal antiques to Art Deco to a soft, tailored modern. It's a monthly infusion of visual beauty and grace. (As an aside: I love buying my shelter magazines through Amazon as I've been able to get great subscription prices and track my subscriptions so I don't miss a single issue, which is helpful when you subscribe to lots of magazines.)<br /><br />Under new editor Dara Caponigro's vision, VERANDA magazine sings and soars.",346,354

Most of the recipes were kitchen friendly with ingredients and tools you would have in a decently stocked kitchen.  Something along the lines of smoked paprika might have been considered &#34;classy&#34; or even foreign.  Today, with Reader's Digest at the helm, it's a different magazine.  Gone are the days of no advertisements (subscriptions paid for the publishing and profit) and it is now filled with big glossy photos of food, kitchen and body related items that the publishers feel you cannot live without.  I, for one, can live without them.<br /><br />Having spend more than 20 years in the culinary business from the bottom of the chain to operator and now educator, I would occasionally use Taste of Home for a &#34;comfort food selection&#34;.  These particular recipes would be given to the newest of the new cooks to prepare and have ready for service.<br /><br />Taste of Home still has decent recipes.  It isn't the friendly magazine that it once was.  It's part of a conglomerate that feels numbers are more important the quality.  I'll read it, but I no longer subscribe.",400,254

They are indepth and take their time to figure out the workings of a recipe.<br /><br />All recipes are well thought out, well written -and let me tell you, as a professional I've seen poorly written recipes- and darned tasty recipes.

3.0,1393279578000,At least the new editor is better than the old one,"Currently (as of Feb. 2014), Susan Spencer is the editor. This is a great improvement over Elizabeth Mayhew, who took over as editor for Jane Chesnutt and served in that role from 2010 to 2012. Although I like the new editor much better than Mayhew, this magazine still isn't as compelling as it once was (pre-2010).<br /><br />There are some decorating articles which are always my favorite, as well as lots of recipes, a few health-related articles, at least one article on clothing / outfits, and usually a few life stories (human interest stories). Over all, this article is a quick-read - you can get through the entire magazine in one sitting in about half an hour. I think the target demographic for this magazine might be women ages 35 to 65 years old. For example, there is usually at least one article related to coping with senior parents.<br /><br />While this is not a bad magazine, you may be better served by subscribing to a magazine that more closely matches your specific interests and hobbies.",1417,219

It's still a pleasant read though, and still has good ideas. Plus, I usually find at least one product mentioned in each issue that I didn't know about before and that I want to locate at a hardware store and buy. So, in terms of making me aware of products that I didn't know existed, this magazine is helpful.<br /><br />My husband has already requested that I renew our subscription :).",1417,418

This stuff is not great for clipping out and saving because it is so thin. However, if this paper keeps the subscription price low, then by all means continue to use it!<br /><br />To summarize, I am one very content subscriber!",1417,223
4.0,1356108390000,"Love the content, hate the tiny font","I usually enjoy about three of the articles in this magazine, which makes it worth the price of the magazine to me. I find particular enjoyment in the house and organization articles.<br /><br />However, is it just me or is this magazine plainly hard to read on the subway? Its large size and heft make it a little bit of a drag on my shoulder to carry in my purse. Plus, its small font size makes me have to place my face a little too close for comfort to the page in order to read it. I wear contact lenses so I don't have ""bad eyes"". I think I have normal eyes, and yet, this font is uncomfortable to read because of its small font size.<br /><br />In summary, I enjoy this magazine a lot, but prefer House Beautiful for its easy-to-read font size and ease of carrying (not too heavy/bulky). True, I get less content with House Beautiful, but that magazine also costs less on Amazon, which makes up for it in my opinion.",1417,175
4.0,1351124407000,"A fun magazine, but going downhill","This is relatively light reading. Don't expect detailed plans for how to implement any of the ideas shown. However, I usually get at least a couple good ideas of out each issue. I prefer this magazine to Martha Stewart Living, which is more food-focused. Don't get me wrong - there are still plenty of food recipes in each issue of Country Living. However, it's a nice balance between articles on food, decor, DIY/crafts, flowers, and entertaining.<br /><br />UPDATE: I used to look forward to receiving my issues in the mail. However, the magazine seems to be going in a new direction. One part of that is focusing more on older items, such as expensive vintage items I could never afford to buy. Another part is focusing on rustic items with patina, but to me, the items just look rusty and neglected. Those gruff items are pricey too. I don't want to fill my home with a bunch of nonsense items. That includes the nature-inspired items such as taxidermy. I'm not sure what is going on with this magazine to be honest. It's still somewhat enjoyable to read, but I may not renew my subscription.",1417,137

I had heard good things about the Everyday with Rachael Ray magazine, so when I found this great price I decided to try it.

3.0,1511450429250,Entertaining but not read,I was fascinated by this magazine as a teenager 40 yrs ago and I expect will be same for technical or science oriented kids today.

Covers variety of topics about home, car, innovations in the world around us and generally interesting stuff about how things around us work.

4.0,1292461032000,The Car Magazine for the Racing Circuit Guy,"Bottom-line: Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.<br /><br />Like a lot of middle-aged men I am a car guy.  I eat and drink--more or less--the elixir of horsepower, torque, RPM's, painted wheels, ergonomic cockpits, and colored sheet metal.  I can recite long lists of carlines and their varying specifications.  At various times in the last five years I have subscribed to and devoured three of the nation's most popular car magazines: Motor Trend, Automobile, and Car & Driver.  But, I recently gave up my subscription to Automobile and received a $5.00 off coupon from Magazines.com via e-mail; I replaced it with ""Road & Track Magazine,"" published monthly by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.<br /><br />Like most car magazines, ""Road & Track Magazine"" is full of glossy, colorful, pictures and serious well written articles, car comparisons, and long-term road tests, but the magazine has little to distinguish itself from its brethren.  I used to read ""Road & Track Magazine"" back in my twenties, and while the magazine has moved itself smartly into the 21st century, the basic formula that made the magazine fun and informative back in the 1980's remains virtually unchanged.<br /><br />""Road & Track Magazine"" does an excellent job of covering the national (American) and International car scene. And the reaches far-a-field to bring readers the off-beat, the exotic and the really expensive, but fear not the Chevrolet Volt's, Suzuki Swift's and Toyota Corolla's of the world also find a place inside the glossy pages of ""Road & Track Magazine.""  And the magazine does this is in a format that is easy to follow and extremely inviting.<br /><br />For instance in the June 2010 issue ""Road & Track Magazine"" featured the previews/road tests of the following cars: Jaguar XJ, Audi R8 Spyder; Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 vs. Nissan GTR vs. Porsche 911 Turbo; plus a long-term test wrap-up of the Acura TL SH-AWD, as well as a features write-up on the Suzuki Swift, Mazda Demio, and Toyota iQ.  Add to these two very well written and equally as comprehensive competition articles: Electric Boogaloo -Tesla vs. Lotus, and Formula 1, Then & Now, and you have receipt for the most useful automobile magazine in the country.<br /><br />Because of its name ""Road & Track Magazine"" does seem to cover the racing circuit more than it fellows, which would be fine if I followed Formula 1, NASCAR, and notable figures from that world, but I don't so I tend to skip over those articles.<br /><br />Interspersed between these nuggets of auto knowledge are other articles that deal with esoteric but informative tidbits from the automotive arena.  For instance the same issue that brought us the above mentioned articles offered up an excellent 2-page article on the past, present and future of the spark plug!  Not exactly need to know information, but for anyone with a keen interest in the internal combustion engine--like me--this article hit the spot.<br /><br />When the final page is turned is ""Road & Track Magazine"" different enough from the other two car periodicals I read to renew my subscription?  In a word: no.  While I certainly enjoy reading the magazines various articles and columns there just isn't enough between the glossy covers to justify renewing the subscription.  I'm just not into the auto racing scene and ""Road & Track Magazine"" is big into Formula 1, NASCAR and other racing related themes.<br /><br />For raw, general automotive new ""Road & Track Magazine"" is not as good as Motor Trend, Automobile, or Car & Driver.  But with a subscription cost of only $9.97 (or less, over at Magazines.com) per year, you can afford to grab 12 issues and make up your own mind.",3683,37
4.0,1292459872000,The Discerning and Intellectual Cook's Magazine of Choice,"Bottom-Line: If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.<br /><br />The world of Men's magazines, or magazines that are marketed towards a certain portion of the male reading populace, is littered with twaddle that only seems to appeal to the baser instincts of the male gender.  You know the magazines; they need not be mentioned here.  Some are happily folding tent never to heard from again.  Truth be told there are very few magazines that appeal to the more intellectual side of a man (yes ladies we do have such a side).<br /><br />But recently as ""special gift"" for renewing my Bally's Total Fitness membership I received a 1 year subscription to ""Men's Journal Magazine"", ""a general interest, active lifestyle magazine with a focus on adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.""<br /><br />""Men's Journal Magazine"", is published monthly by Wenner Media, the same publishing house that brings us such notable sidewalk fare as Us Weekly and Rolling Stone.  The magazine will set you back $3.95 an issue at the local newsstand, but 1 year subscriptions can be had for $9.95.  Inside each approximately 120-page magazine you will not find half clothed women dripping with sexy come hither stares.  Nor will you find the next Hollywood ""it"" girl, or wannabe skinny model with a fake tan gracing the pages of this Men's magazine.  No, ""Men's Journal"" is serious business folks; vapid men with one track minds and adolescent libido's need not apply!<br /><br />""Men's Journal"" is a smartly written, thoughtfully designed magazine for the active intellectual male.  The magazine offer feature-length articles on a wide range of subjects based on the magazine's central theme: adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.<br /><br />However, like most magazines in America, ""Men's Journal"" depends heavily on advertising to generate revenue, but unlike fashion magazines that seem to be 90% advertising and 10% substance, ""Men's Journal"" only dedicates every other page to colorful spreads bent on selling us stuff we don't really need, or in some cases don't need but really, really want, but can't afford.  To its credit, most of the advertising is not dedicated to men's fashions, wore by young impeccably sculpted and groomed men, or automobiles that are impossibly expensive, but instead to the business of adventure and sports.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />When all is said and done I enjoy reading ""Men's Journal Magazine.""  Granted, given my current lifestyle (my days of adventures have been traded in for the American Dream and all that entails for now), the information the magazine imparts is only marginally useful to me.  The fitness articles are rater short and are mostly how-to's that while useful are just barely so.  Most of the equipment discussed in Men's Journal is for the magazines target audience with the appropriate disposable income; that's not me.<br /><br />Nonetheless, when my subscription runs out in another ten months I will probably renew.  Why?  Because ""Men's Journal"" represents my kind of man: thoughtful, intelligent, adventurous (hey, I used to ride submarines, hike mountains and scuba dive and I still want to go sky-diving), man who actually appreciates full-length feature articles or two written by grown-ups for grown-ups.<br /><br />If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.",3683,753
4.0,1292459498000,The Car Magazine for the Everyman,"Bottom-line: Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.<br /><br />Like most men in their twenties I was a car guy.  I ate and drank the elixir of horsepower, torque, RPM's, and colored sheet metal.  I could recite long lists of carlines and their varying specifications.  I subscribed to and devoured all of the (four) the nation's most popular car magazines of the time: ""Car & Driver,"" Motor Trend, Road & Track, and the beauty queen of them all, Automobile Magazine.  But as time and overseas assignments took my attention elsewhere, one-by-one my subscriptions lapsed and my car fetish all but died.<br /><br />But, now in the autumn of my life, I have rekindled my love of cars, especially expensive high performance mid-sized cars from well-known and well respected nameplates we all know: Cadillac, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Lincoln, Jaguar, and of course Mercedes-Benz.  So when I got a $5.00 off coupon from Magazines.com via e-mail, I plowed through the 230 or so men's magazines before finally deciding on ""Car & Driver Magazine"" published monthly by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S., Inc.<br /><br />Like most car magazines, ""Car & Driver"" is full of glossy, colorful, pictures and serious well written articles, car comparisons, and long-term road tests, but the magazine offers so much more.  Unlike the other automobile periodicals, ""Car & Driver"" serves up truly useful (practical) information for the everyman, or woman.  This subtle distinction elevates ""Car & Driver"" above the rest and makes it far and away the best car rag for my hard earned money.<br /><br />However, like other three American car magazines ""Car & Driver"" covers a broad swath of the American automobile scene, but it also does a fair job of delving into the international automobile scene as well.  And the reaches far-a-field to bring readers the off-beat, the exotic and the really expensive, but fear not the Chevrolet Aveo's of this world also find a place inside the glossy pages of ""Car & Driver"" magazine.  And the magazine does this is a format that is easy to follow and extremely inviting.<br /><br />For instance in the October 2008 issue ""Car & Driver"" featured the previews/road tests of the following cars: Acura ZDX, Alfa 8C Spider, 2011 BMW X1, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG, 2010 Ford Shelby Mustang GT500 Convertible, 2009 Pontiac G8 GXP, plus a comprehensive write-up on The Best Cars for $20,000.  Add to these two very well written and equally as comprehensive comparison article: Audi R8 V-10 vs. Ferrari 430 Scuderia, and you have receipt for the most useful automobile magazine this side of the pond.<br /><br />Another strong incentive to read ""Car & Driver"" is its decided lack of wall-to-wall advertisements.  Most of the magazine is dedicated to substance; the articles are what make ""Car & Driver"" such a joy to read.  The articles are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  And although the writers fill the paragraphs with lexicon of the automobile industry, the prose never talks down to the reader, or looses my interest along the way.<br /><br />Another way ""Car & Driver"" distinguishes itself from the rest, is its more than comprehensive write-up on each automobile within the magazine.  Even the shortest articles, or write-up's feature a detailed description of the car, its interior and exterior specifications, road test results, pricing, and possible competitors.  No other magazine that I have read thus far--Automobile, Motor Trend, or Road & Track--offers as much useful information.<br /><br />Interspersed between these nuggets of auto knowledge are other articles that deal with esoteric but informative tidbits from the automotive arena.  For instance the same issue that brought us the above mentioned articles offered up a 6-page article on a WWII era Jeep!  Not exactly need to know information, but human interest stories are always welcome in this world seemingly filled with nothing by death and mayhem.<br /><br />Even some of the photographs in ""Car & Driver Magazine"" have a story to tell in the guise of in-depth exterior and mechanical analysis.  In the final analysis there is no other car magazine I would rather subscribe to than ""Car & Driver Magazine.""  Within its 130 or so glossy pages I have found a home, a resting place from which I can gleam my needed automotive knowledge.  For me there is no other Car Mag!",3683,211
4.0,1292375869000,Little Nuggets of Information I Find Useful,"Bottom-line: Popular Science is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.<br /><br />I have always delved into the minutia of how things work.  This natural curiosity grew from, where I don't know where it comes from exactly.  Perhaps it part of the male brain, or perhaps just part of mine; I like to take things apart and see how they work.  It's not enough to know that if I pay my electric bill on time, when I flick on a light switch I will have light; I want to know how the electricity is generated and how it got to the switch.  That same curiosity led me to my current profession as an Information Technology professional.  What started out as a hobby, a need to know how computers worked, has turned into a second career for me.<br /><br />All of this explains why I subscribe to and read Popular Science Magazine [...], whose slogan is The Future Is Now.  As magazines go, Popular Science is a pretty thin rag, but that does not mean the monthly is not packed with all manner of useful and informative information.  it does mean that the magazine is not (over) burdened with page after page of annoying advertising.  There is of course advertising, a magazine could not survive without it, but is it not overly intrusive and overbearing.<br /><br />Regular sections in the magazine include:<br /><br />o Features: feature length articles;<br />o Megapixels<br />o What's New<br />o Headlines<br />o How 2.0<br />o FYI<br />o Other Stuff: includes Letters, and editor's note.<br /><br />My favorite section is What's New; I tend to read it first every month.  Each section is filled with six or seven pages of text and illustrations one the latest and greatest new products and prototypes from across the world in the science, general technology and astronomy fields. The latest issue featured a big bold article on the future of police equipment, called Cop Tech; Inside The Police R&R Lab. A flashy title to be sure, but is backed up with quality writing as well as pictures and or images of the equipment and gadgets discussed in the article.<br /><br />Other articles in this month's (February 2007) magazine include:<br /><br />o Protect Everything; the future of personal security.<br />o Journey From The Center of The Earth; Popsci Innovator<br />o It Came From The Lab; Uncommon Knowledge<br />o Fly The Friendly Seas; Concepts & Prototypes<br /><br />The articles for the most part are well written, concise, and comprehensive.  Aside from the feature articles, the most informative portion of the magazine are the one or two page explanation features wherein some present or future gadget is explained, usually accompanied by an illustration.  For example on page 27 of this month's issue under the Headlines section the magazine explains in great detail--complete with illustration--how the Department of Energy is building a greener coal plant, that will extract Hydrogen--called Syngas--from water and use it to produce electricity.  The coal is used in the process and the Carbon it creates as a by-product is pumped underground into a saline solution.  The item was short, but came away from it with a thorough understanding of a process I had heretofore never heard of.<br /><br />I have only one minor quibble with the magazine: almost one third of the back half of the monthly is given over to adverting.  Not the expensive glossy, glamorous kind, but the shady little, not so sure you can thrust what their advertising kind found is too many other wise respectable magazines.<br /><br />Subscriptions<br /><br />Popular Science Magazine is published by Time 4 Media. In addition to the English language edition, Popular Science is also published in China, Israel, Korea and Mexico. Book shelf sells for a cover price of $3.99 US, Canada $4.99, while a 12-month subscription will set you back $15.95 and a 24-month subscription checks in at 21.95. If you are doing the math--and you should--that's a 77% saving off the single copy price. You might be able to find a better deal at one of the on-line magazine subscription sites like Magazines.com, or e-Subscription.com.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Other than that one decidedly minor quibble, I have no qualms recommending Popular Science to anyone who asks.  The magazine is my new personal science and technology advisor designed to enrich my knowledge of science and technology spanning the globe.",3683,181
3.0,1292289260000,A Large Advertisement Magazine with Interview Thrown In Just Because,"Bottom-Line: I subscribe to ""Interview Magazine"" but I will not be renewing my subscription.<br /><br />I have been making a conscience effort of late to expand my horizons, to get out of (magazine reading) comfort zone.  To that end I have cast my reading net out from the usual news rag, and started reading a new diverse set of magazines, including Esquire, Ebony, Business Week, US, People, Popular Science, Jet, Car & Driver, Essence, Laptop Magazine, Travel & Leisure, Cooks, and ""Interview Magazine"", just to name a few.<br /><br />For a person like me who usually frequents the aforementioned news magazines, ""Interview Magazine"" is like a culture shock.  First off the magazine is large; larger in fact than any magazine you might find on the newsstand or in the local chain book store with the exception of Rolling Stone.  Second the magazine is printed on thick paper stock, which has a gritty feel to it; say good-bye to glossy and hello to matte and muted colors.<br /><br />""Interview Magazine"" features advertisements, wall to wall advertisements; the interviews with up-and-coming and established celebrities interspersed throughout the pages of the magazine seem almost coincidental.  I am currently reading the April 2007 issue, with a large inviting picture of Liv Tyler on the front cover.  To the magazines credit it does try and cover the full spectrum of entertainment from fashion to music, from art to the movies and places in between.<br /><br />Most of the interviews--especially those done on up-and-coming stars and starlet's--are mere snapshots of the persons personal and or professional life; there is little sink my proverbial intellectual, or even mildly interested teeth into.  There is just enough there to try and goad me into find out more.  The in-depth interviews are a lot more fulfilling; most of these are done by other celebrities; for instance in this issue Rose McGowan is interviewed by Quentin Tarantino, and Liza Minnelli interviewed musician Gerald Way.  Past issue have followed this same formula, with mostly good results, meaning I have enjoyed the interviews and images.<br /><br />But the one huge downside to ""Interview Magazine"" is its slavish devotion to advertising.  In fact the first 50 pages of this issue are devoted to wall-to-wall cutting edge, youth-inspired clothing and fragrance advertising.  The masthead of the magazine is stuck somewhere with this advertising soup, but the table of contents did not show up until one third of the magazine was leafed through--very annoying!  Not only that, but every celebrity image was accompanied by a solid paragraph on who made what they were wearing, who styled their hair, who did their make-up, and incredibly, what fragrance they happened to be wearing during the shoot!<br /><br />Is this an example of advertising run amok, or am I being far too sensitive and demanding in wanting ""Interview Magazine"" to at least be a magazine and not a run-on poster board for the chic and impossibly unfettered youth of America (New York City) and Europe is wearing?  But so many magazines follow this advertisement-on-every-page formula; is this the new norm, and should I get used to it?<br /><br />I could in ""Interview Magazine's"" case if most of the writing were not so rushed and devoid of substance.  This is something I alluded to above; sound-bites have their place, but not inside the covers of a magazine name ""Interview Magazine"", where I at least expect to learn something more about an artist than where they were discovered, their age, or how often they frequent Starbucks.  It's called substance and ""Interview Magazine"" just doesn't have enough to justify its larger than life existence.<br /><br />I subscribe to ""Interview Magazine"" but I will not be renewing my subscription; in this case my bid to broaden my horizons found a mostly vapid landscape full of wasted paper, muted colors, and questionable prose.",3683,84
4.0,1292210053000,The Intellectual Man's Magazine of Choice?,"Bottom-Line: When all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading ""Esquire Magazine;"" who knows the magazine just might make me a better man!<br /><br />The world of men's magazines is festooned with glossy covers adorned with half dressed woman and mostly vapid content geared toward the more Neanderthal and or juvenile among us.  In a world filled with Maxim and Stuff magazines, ""Esquire"" magazine stands out as a periodical with substance, style and intellect, but at the same time is not afraid to feature a beautiful woman on the cover and within it glossy folds.<br /><br />""Esquire Magazine,"" whose tag line is Man at His Best, was founded in 1933 and is published monthly by the venerable Hearst Corporation.  The magazine has a long history of featuring noted authors of their day, including Malcolm Muggeridge, William F. Buckley, and Truman Capote among other notables.<br /><br />However, ""Esquire Magazine"" is known and has been known as much for its artsy cover designs as its high-brow content and had given birth to a few notable art designer careers.  To this date the cover of ""Esquire,"" remains a work of art with big bold colors, and larger than life personas framed by flowing text.  The covers alone rival another venerable men's magazine--Playboy--in style and sex appeal.  The only difference is that ""Esquire"" gives equal deference to men on its covers, though they--thankfully--are not shown in various stages of undress.<br /><br />""Esquire Magazine""--a monthly publication, is a striking combination of the trivial and useful information, from its (mostly) useless monthly column The Guide to Sex to the interesting 10 Things You Don't Know about Women, written by a different female celeb, which I find somewhat useful.  The first third of the magazine is devoted to these little nuggets of information designed to help craft a better man.<br /><br />In addition to the monthly Features section, Esquire also includes a rather lengthy and engaged celebrity interview; this month it is Angelina Jolie, two months ago it was the delectable Halle Barry.  Some might find these sort of celeb-driven interview trite, given the massive print and video coverage already afforded far too many so-call celebrities, but there is something to be learned from the oft-candid gab-fests with the stars.<br /><br />But, ""Esquire Magazine"" because it is a men's magazine, does pay homage to barely dressed, well crafted (meaning air-brushed) women within it covers, just not so many as, say Maxim or Stuff, but they are well represented.  And ""Esquire Magazine"" in not above objectifying women as its yearly Sexist Woman Alive anointment clearly shows.  The reigning queen Scarlett Johansson is set to give up her crown soon to a new winner, so the magazine has started drooping clues as to who the next winner will be; it is up to us to figure out who before the moniker is bestowed upon another blonde-haired, blue eyed American beauty; women of color need not apply it seems.<br /><br />However, If the two latter magazines take the stance that the way to a man's mind it through his eyeballs and groin, ""Esquire Magazine"" appeals to a higher sensibility hinting that men might just learn a thing or two from the fairer sex, thus elevating the intellectual discourse between the genders.<br /><br />And great writing is still at the forefront of the magazines agenda.  If the first third of the rag is dedicated to the snippet, the later half is devoted to lengthy articles, with little or no commercial interruption (YES!).  Excerpts from novels written by both males and females find a home within ""Esquire Magazine"".  And authors, both known and unknown grace the pages.<br /><br />But there are investigative articles as well, which I less compelling but, but welcome nonetheless.  A recent article featured a man who is now in charge of security at a major nuclear power plant in the U.S. who used to work for Blackwater as a paid gun for hire.  The article portrays the man as something more than a macho ape with a gun for hire; he is given a decidedly human face and heart, which I found oddly engaging.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />When all is said and done I have to admit that I enjoy reading ""Esquire Magazine"".  When I first picked one up years ago I was convinced that there was nothing for me within its (somewhat) high brow pages, but I have come to enjoy the magazines style and substance, though I must admit that most of the advertising is not designed for someone of my limited financial station; yes I make a good living, but little of my current income is disposable enough to by a $500.00 wrist watch even if I wore them, which I don't.<br /><br />But if you are banned (for whatever reason) from reading the quintessential male magazine, Playboy, ""Esquire Magazine"" comes in close second, followed by GQ.  If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, Esquire Magazine might be for you.  Now that I have started my subscription ($10.00 for a year from Magazines.com), I doubt I will let it lapse, it is turning out to be just that good.

They'll sift thru the site and choose recipes many folks would like; and bring to the readers' attention unusual recipes they have missed on the site.<br /><br />Then they started adding ads.  No problem and no surprise.  How else could they continue?<br /><br />THEN...they started adding other stuff!  In my Feb-Mar 2018 issue, the first recipe didn't appear until pg. 36 (out of 104 pgs., mind you).  And what was this stuff?  Fitness, ads, lifestyle, ads, tablescapes, kitchens renovations, ads, utensils, baking with kids, ads, and choosing healthy snacks (plus ads).  FINALLY, we got a recipe!<br /><br />If I wanted all that &#34;stuff&#34;, I'd subscribe to a mag that does it well (such as MARTHA STEWART LIVING).  AR does not do this sort of thing well, at all.  (And, in fact, I do subscribe to MSL.  )<br /><br />I will NOT be re-subscribing to Allrecipes.  It has turned into something unlike its charter.  A very big disappointment.

TASTE OF HOME used to be &#34;no-advertising,&#34; too, but they had to add advertisements to survive.  They've avoided padding their content, however.  AR should take a lesson.

Avoid auto renewal issues with these simple steps...,"After reading the reviews and the inexpensive $8.95 price tag, I thought this magazine would make a great gift for my handy husband.  He wasn't impressed with the first two issues and complained of advertisements crowding the magazine.  He was excited to read a good article on beginning welding in his 3rd issue.  I took some time to leaf through the magazine before writing this review.  The advertisements are exhausting.  For example, in the first 10 pages of one issue, I counted 3 full page advertisements and 3 half page advertisements.  It's like that throughout the remainder of the magazine as well.  This is really unfortunate as it takes away from the readability of the magazine.  There is some useful information presented such as &quot;stuff we love&quot; which outlines favorite DIY tools, material, and gear.

5.0,1512075284148,"Absolutely fantastic, high end magazine for $5!  Avoid auto renewal issues with these simple steps...","It's crazy to get this high quality magazine for only $5!  Take advantage!  If you're worried about auto-renewal issues, see my tried and true fix below.  This is my second year of HGTV magazine, and it has yet to disappoint.  It's jam packed with home redecorating ideas specific to the season.  My absolute favorite part of this magazine is the &quot;fun decorating&quot; page in issue that shows expensive items and their cheaper alternative.  (For example - a high end rug with a similar looking rug at over half the cost.) There's great advice on choosing paint colors for different rooms and how-to lessons on the correct way to refinish and paint furniture.  I love the &quot;spot the difference&quot; advice as well - learning the differences between various furniture and home goods so you're on your A-game in any conversation.  Also included is a great recipe in each edition.  I've clipped many of these and they've turned out to be easy and delicious!  Pretty much anything you can think of that has to do with your home is included in this magazine.  If nothing else, it makes for a colorful and festive bathroom book that anyone can flip through and enjoy.  My 12-year old daughter loves it for their crafts, cooking, and how-to advice.  I love it as a cheap way to get ideas to spruce up my home.  There aren't too many advertisements or wasted space either.<br /><br />I haven't had any problems with unwanted auto-renewal of my magazines on Amazon as long as I follow these steps to turn it off:<br />1) Go to your account and look under Membership and Subscriptions.<br />2) Find &quot;Print Magazines.&quot;<br />3) Once selected, you will see all of your current magazine subscriptions and when they will be renewed at the lowest Amazon price.<br />4) Simply turn off the &quot;auto-renewal&quot; setting by selecting auto-renewal settings and &quot;turn off.&quot;<br /><br />I've been subscribed to all of my magazines from Amazon for over 2 years now and have never had a payment request from the magazine company or a continuation of magazines arriving when I said I didn't want them to.

5.0,1511905445734,"Great recipes, chef favorites, reader tips, and kitchen gadgets.  Easy to update auto-renewal in settings.","Great magazine, especially given the $5 price tag.  It's jam packed with goodness.  I like the Reader's Best tips - advice given to other cooks from various readers.  Usually there's a writeup about specific items with different stars posting their favorite recipes (for example:  All-Star Spreads was a page listing 5 famous chef's favorite condiments and accompanying recipes.).  It's not just about food, either.  There are beautiful pictures showing before/after kitchen remodels and must-have kitchen appliances and gadgets.  My 12-year old daughter loves the &#34;Name that Dish&#34; page that comes at the end of every issue.  It's a yummy recipe that readers get to &#34;name&#34; and prizes given out to the ones who win.  My favorite part, of course, is the abundance of recipes in every issue.  I've found a ton of new things to try...from soups to cocktails and everything in between.  Many of the recipes are basic enough that I have the ingredients at home.  Others are more gourmet and require a bit more prep and shopping.  There's something for everyone in this magazine - especially if you're a &#34;foodie&#34; like me!<br /><br />For those worried about automatic renewal at a higher price, the solution is simple.

There are always great articles about what is new and upcoming in techonology, new trends on the Internet.  Some magazines have a lot of filler and tend to be a vehicle for selling advertisements.<br /><br />What makes Wired extra special is that they don't pander to products that they do advertising for.  Unlike other computer related magazines they write about trends, and outstanding products.  This leaves them more room for good reporting and less veiled advertising.  They often feature articles written by famous people in techonology.<br /><br />I have operated a cooking website since 1995, so I am familar with the Internet, and how it works.  What I like about Wired magazine is that they constantly write about what's new and upcoming in trends for the online world, and they tend to be very on the mark with where the Internet is and where it is going.<br /><br />If you are interested in techonology, and what is going on online this is the magazine for you.  Wired magazine is fresh, and is free of pandering to the products they help advertise.  I like that this magazine is high on content and low in advertisements.  Always fresh content about new products in techonology, trends in the high tech world, and a good insight on the Internet make this magazine an excellent choice.",6330,80

Nor do they have pictures of real women in the magazine.<br /><br />I like this magazine for inspirational stories about women who got into shape.  Their health articles extend past the symptoms, and often have suggestions on prevention.  Their articles on nutrition are good, and once again realistic.

For me this means the first section of the paper is under appreciated, as its all about New York City, gossip and much more. The articles are of a wide varity of topics and often bring up points that may have had rolling around in your conscious but have never let them bubble up to the top. Fascinating articles can range from politics, famous lives of famous peoples, religious societies, and so much more.<br />This magazine is great if you are a reader. Articles are wordy, and worthwhile. This isn't something your going to be reading just the highlights through. I hardly find myself able to finish a magazine before the next one comes.

I respect that there is no advertising in this magazine, and they take their craft seriously. The back covers are extremely artistic, and of high quality. I have sometimes wished I could frame the back covers.  Articles in the magazine often cover a particular food product and which one with really is the best. Its kind of like Consumer Reports for cooking. I honestly dislike the price, and you can pick up all issues in their annual addition, which I now do.

Gourmet seems to have recipes that are a bit gourmand, that need ingredients that you will need to do a search for, while this isn't entirely bad, sometimes you want to make something that is in your cupboards.  I like that these recipes are everyday recipes that have been taken up a level or two.  Articles are informative, with discussing a particular food, ingredient, or technique.

I enjoy the restaurant reviews, its helpful knowing of a few good suggestions when traveling, or even locally.  I find the advertising in the magazine to be a bid auspicious as it seems to cater only to those high members of society that are in serious need of spa treatments and an occasional face lift.  Maybe its tough finding advertising, but I find that it takes away from articles about our local government and issues.<br />I do feel this is totally worth the subscription price, and you are bound to find 12 dollars of reading in a years time :)  This might even be a good gift idea from someone that is no longer in the area.",6330,53

The magazine seems to cover a wide age group, with information that is good for both young and old.  They do offer recipes, workout suggestions, and much more.  The magazine takes little time to read, and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy.

In addition to all of these things they often share several good recipes each month.  I have always been pleased with their choices.

1.0,1613945675135,A fashion magazine should stay off politics.,"This magazine, like most others, has to share its political opinion. Of course, they are arrogant enough to believe that everyone should have the same opinion as theirs. Fashion magazines should focus on that subject alone. If I want to read about politics I would read Time or the newspaper. I am so sick of every single media outlet ( News, newspapers, magazines, and even music) shoving a political view down the consumer's throat. This is why I don't watch much TV, read many magazines or newspapers. I don't care what political side you support or hate, when I pick up a fashion magazine I should see clothes, makeup, & similar topics. No wonder the magazine business is going bankrupt.",9821,224

5.0,1227901478000,Not As Good As It Used to Be -- Still the Best,"I agree that it's not as good as it used to be, but it's still the best. It seems that there has been an across-the-board change toward the 30-second sound bites. You only see some of that in Forbes, but it's annoying. If I want that, I can go online to any of the major news networks.<br /><br />Forbes still has the best financial and business analysis for the U.S. The Economist might edge it out on international issues, but that's not an apples-to-apples comparison. It beats Business Week and the other domestic rags.<br /><br />The only complaint is the number of multi-page ads in the middle of the story and it being hard to see where the ad ends and the story continues. That may be by design, but it's annoying.<br /><br />Another good thing about Forbes is that it's written well. It's like the Atlantic for the business world. I currently subscribe to both and have subscribed, at one time or another, to the other magazines that I've mentioned as well.",13161,259
5.0,1076075267000,Great for Many Grades,"This is great for many grades. Our son is in 4th grade and started getting this. It is one of only a few that he wants to keep getting (along with ""Sports Illustrated for Kids"" and ""Boy's Life""). The reading level is about his level, but it would be good from 2nd grade through 7th grade.<br />Like its parent magazine, the photos are professionally done and large. The content of the magazine is even more impressive. Nearly every page our son will come and tell us another ""did you know this"" fact.<br />Many topics are a two-page spread so that you can hold it open and see the whole topic at a glance -- very nice. There are also some jokes, mazes and other brief entertaining items as well.<br />The magazine is a slick glossy around 32 pages and very nice. If you are looking for an upgrade from ""Highlights"", this would be it.",13161,18

In many ways, it is a little of each of those and why I like it. Good news coverage, current, good coverage of entertainment and technology.

5.0,1026857810000,Wonderful Gift Idea for someone who loves Cooking!!!!!!!!!,"This Magazine is my #1 Favorite out of all 16 subscriptions that I had received within the past 4 years.<br />As the other reviews mentioned it goes into such detail that I often times carry it along as reading material for myself when I'm going out of town. I have bought this as gifts for at least 4 friends of mine in the last 2 years alone. I really enjoy the time the writers take in the Test Kitchen's explaining the ""why"" and the ""how"" the recipes work or doesn't for that matter. I find that this is one of those Magazine that is worth every penny no matter how much the cost. They review cookbooks and in their very own in depth fashion, go into detail in describing how they test the recipes in these cookbooks. And for someone like myself that buy at least 5 cookbooks per month this cuts down on the cost of buying books full of recipes that really aren't tested. I find it interesting when they ""test"" various products and appliances... I can't even begin to express what a value this subscription is all I can say is that every person I purchase this for has renewed their subscription on their own.<br />So what does that tell you huh?<br />BTW You can always purchase the Cookbook index that they put out at the end of every year it has every issue that came out.<br />Happy Reading",13830,703

This one is well worth the money, and I know it isn't as expenisive as some of the others that I subscribe to.<br />I also would recommend &quot;Country Living&quot; and &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot; in addition to this one.<br />Happy Reading",13830,169

Amazon[.com] offers a much better price but right now there are so many Magazines out there like this one that you almost can just subscribe to her web-site and get the same info without the cost.<br />The articles were okay.... there was so much advertisment in the issues I got that I felt like I wasn't getting the true body of what I wanted.

I always feel like I've actually walked in the shoes of the writer and the articles are so vivid that you can almost taste the exotic-ness &lt;---- is that word?) LOL of the flavors.

5.0,1026847435000,Buy the subscription from Amazon!!!!,"...I found that Gourmet dealt more on the international recipes than I really cared for.

As I mentioned in another review I did you can easily get all of these recipes on their website at Epicurous and save yourself some money, but If you like to be swept away to Dazzling places and enjoy the full page pictures of your entrees then get the magazine........ but get it from Amazon, you can't beat their price.<br />Happy Reading",13830,396

I also would recommend it as a gift idea for anyone that loves Cooking or is in the Food Industry as a Director of Catering and Sales for a Convention Center my mind (after 10 years) does become stuck on new and innovative menu ideas.... when this happens I can always trust ""Bon Appetit"" to have some wonderfully looking ideas for me to try.

5.0,1078850297000,A great technology and all-around magazine.,"Wired has some really great articles and columns in their Opinion section (I believe they're in thats section). They had a great feature with the above pictured issue, about the making of a human; and it looks like their newest issue (all about Google) will be great too (if the cover just wasnt so darn bright). I havent bought it just yet, cause I just subscribed and am waiting for it. Wired is just a really good technology magazine, and of course they talk about other things, but it all usually has to do with tech stuff. Well regardless, it's still a great read, and I think you will like it.",14257,80
1.0,1078849158000,More like half and half PC and BS.,"Maximum PC's slogan is Maximum PC. Minimum BS. Well I think they should make that, Half PC. Half BS. If you buy your subscription on here, you're not getting the CD, which is obviously, the whole essence of the mag. The CD is done just like PC Gamer, but it just has Maximum PC on there, instead of PC Gamer, and this also means, if your PCG CD's won't auto-load, neither will the MPC ones. Since I can't see what the price is for the subscription on here, I cant tell if you're paying the same amount on here for the no CD sub, as you would with the CD. CD sub. price is $29.95. You can obviously look at the top of the page, and see what the price is. The one good thing they have is the Head 2 Head thing they have in the beginning, where they pit two products against each other. This month it was Yahoo! Mail vs. Hotmail. So this really isnt a great magazine, nor a good PC magazine (no pun). If you want a real independent magazine, go with PC Magazine. (And for more on that, read my review...if it ever gets posted).",14257,72
2.0,1078596936000,About as thick as Vogue.,"Yes most issues are as thick as Vogue, which of course means like 50 pages of ads, before you get to the first page of text, but overall, I'm really impressed with their articles. They write about a variety of topics, and I thought it was great, how in the March (current) issue, the Editor In Chief, decided to use his column, to show the names of everyone who's died since the war in Iraq began, and where they were from, and what rank they were. It was really sad seeing these guys who were only 19, and they had their whole life ahead of them still. (Of course, these were all the people who had died as of press time for the issue). I believe the count was 472, and that has risen by almost 100, but it was still a very nice gesture. So what genre is Vanity Fair in exactly? Well, first off, dont let the name fool you and dont think just because when you first open it and you come to your first perfume sample, that it is only a magazine for women. Because further on in, they also have male models, so it's kind of for both genders. Some might say it's an Entertainment mag, but I hear it's just General Interest, and that's why it's not in the women's magazine section of my local grocery store, and it's just to the right of the Entertainment ones, so apparently, it's General Interest, and it means it's for anyone. You really shouldn't be ashamed to get it, like I first was. EDIT 3/13/04: After recieving the new issue today, I'm completely sure it more for women that anyone else.",14257,246

4.0,1249518469000,Style Watch + Lucky + InStyle = my style Rx...,"Though creative, I lack natural ability and patience to painlessly put together my outfits. Therefore, I rely on three magazines to keep ""frumpy"" at arm's length: People Style Watch, Lucky, and InStyle. What these three magazines have in common is their visual approach to fashion: you will not find there silly articles on global affairs written by teenage interns. Instead, you will be treated to lots of pictures of fashionable style setters not only on the red carpet, but, MOST IMPORTANTLY, in street clothing. I believe these to be much more meaningful to an average Earthling such as myself then the overstilized artsy fashion photos one finds in the likes of VOGUE...<br /><br />I also like the fact that the magazine identifies the brands. I may not be able to afford everything, but on many occasions I have been able to make prudent additions to my wardrobe based on the editors' recommendations, and/or acquire more affordable article based on the ""original"".<br /><br />Fours stars only, as I would like to see more fashions specifically for the 30's/40's set.",14580,938
2.0,1248205719000,How do you avoid the HO in HORSE?,"The above is an actual question posed by the insightful author of a Bazaar article (August edition).

It gets worse: Bazaar ""buys of the month"" are a $750 pair of shoes, a $3,235 bag, and a $425 necklace...Yes, $4,000 is indeed my monthly accesories budget...(not!)<br /><br />Over 50% of the magazine pages are advertisements. Bland ones... I buy fashion magazines for the pictures: I may not buy all the clothes, but at least I want to be informed what is current and can figure out how to emulate the looks. However, Bazaar seems to make ""impractical and over the top"" their mantra. Not to mention that UBER expensive is the only way they go...<br /><br />The only reason why I am not angry is the extremely low price I paid for the year's subscription... I hope at some point I will see something in the 12 issues worthy of the subscription price...Hence the two stars...But... I will NOT be renewing my subscription.

The articles behind the titles are something an intern might have scribbled on her ciggie break from a more serious assignement (such as a coffee run). As for the few ""fashion"" layouts: July magazine received in June, with fashions for the fall (which, in my climate, does not start until Nov/December)...<br /><br />Still, some of the photographs may eventually prove to be worth the five bucks I paid for a year's subscription...Oh, how sad...",14580,321
4.0,1244342896000,"Happy 15th anniversary, In-Style!","I get annoyed with fashion magazines that, in addition to fashion and beauty advice, try to sell you poorly written articles on global affairs. The result: one page you are reading about ten best eyelash curlers, next page you are pondering the tragic fate of a female South American assassin. A radiculous combination...<br /><br />Not so with In-Style. The magazine does not make pretentions about its purpose: to educate women on what to wear NOW, how to wear it and where to buy it. There is ample advice on best beauty and hair products. The articles are always fashion/entertainment industry related, nothing too heavy duty (for that I go on CNN.com and BBC.co.uk), and convey lots of useful information. To give you an example: with winter approaching, I know I must invest in a new coat and some other warmer garb. I want to make every penny count. In the September issue I was glad to discover the article: What to Know Before You Shop. I did learn some new tips and tricks! The multitude of pictures is also inspiring: I realized with only a couple of new accessories and a new way of combining items I already own, I could create at least three brand new and fashion forward outfits! Yey for me! ;o) I am also happy to report that the magazine promotes a wide range of price points: yes, there are some ""dream"" items, like the [...]+ necklace, but they are balanced by items below the [...] mark and everything in-between.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this magazine helps you as much as it helps me!

I do not have a natural talent/eye for fashion. Yet, with the help and inspiration I find in ""Lucky"", I feel I am able to sustain a reputation as a well dressed person (at the same time staving off that frumpy look that so many women tend to adopt with the onset of middle age...). Two thumbs up and many thanks to the editors!<br />(Four stars only, as I would like to see more fashions specifically for the 30's/40's set)",14580,93

Even though you can supposedly find out anything and everything on the internet, including on the CI website, I still refer back to these magazines for tips, hints and recipes.<br /><br />The recipes in the magazine are especially expanded upon in ways that I don't always find in the CI books or annuals. I also like the ratings of gadgets and explanations of ""what is it?"" as far as older or obscure kitchen items. The illustrations are clear and very helpful in teaching proper techniques like trussing poultry for example. Beginning cooks will appreciate the foolproof qualities and encyclopedic explanations of the recipes, and seasoned cooks will likely tweak tried and true recipes for even better results.<br /><br />I always know I can trust the recipes to come out right when working from my CI collection.

An inquiry this week was met with a reply that next month I should receive my first issue.<br /><br />As far as the magazine goes, from my past issues I find it the homes they feature have a great balance between modern, eclectic and chic design - definitely leans toward lux!

This is already the second place in the issue in just the first few pages that highlights women artisans and made in the USA hand crafted goods.

A little over two months ago I ordered several magazine subscriptions and so far my first issue of Elle Decor has still not arrived where several other subscription were received within 5-6 weeks.<br /><br />as far as the magazine goes, from my past ED issues I find it the homes they feature have a great balance between modern, eclectic and chic design - definitely leans toward lux!<br /><br />02/06/12 Update: My first issue, March 2012 has just arrived (12 weeks wait total).<br /><br />A couple of highlights from this issue:<br /><br />* Antique patterns and timeless fables inspire Idarica Gazzoni's fabrics and wallpaper<br />* Trend Alert - Paisley gets its groove back<br />* Great Ideas - Dazzling chandeliers add drama to a room<br /><br />and my personal favorite article in Design Solutions called ""A Good Buy"", featuring some terrific smaller space ideas for living and dining spaces.<br /><br />The magazine appears to have undergone some slight style changes this month; nice to see ""renovations"" here too to keep things fresh!",22782,250

They do give a nod to up-and-comers by including features like the one with model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.<br /><br />I don't mind the many ads since they keep the publishing costs low.<br /><br />A little talk of everything current - art, movies, books and of course the fashion....<br /><br />While it is mostly high end couture that is beyond my budget, it is beautifully photographed and the trends are a treat to admire - I think of this as sort of long distance window shopping.",22782,389

This is business today, with the competition of the internet, newspapers and magazines rely heavily on the sponsors. It's a fact of our lives now.<br />Second, not every magazine will have all the answers. If the colorful, paint project filled, the cool high-lows aren't for you, I'm sure that out of the hundreds of design books, etc., you will find something!<br /><br />As for me and my friends? We love to read it cover to cover! I enjoy the WOW! What color is That?? It's what helped me decide to go deep blue on our family room wall. I like the chandelier in the cage lights, and read a few articles about taking this and use part to make it work for you. That became sconces!  I have a rare eye thing, so need a dim room; again HGTV magazine talked about recessed lighting! These are all just a few examples of how this magazine has impacted our home and life!<br />I Love Color!! Bright, clear, fresh color, with clean white and pure black!

5.0,1143694780000,National Geographic of Cooking,"In Christmas of 2005 I decided I wanted the most interesting and best cooking magazines out there. But which ones to pick? After buying one here and there I found three that I absolutely love.<br /><br />Saveur was one. The recipes are nice though some I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole (ethnic ingredients that don't appeal to me). But the stories and the pictures... they aren't just amazing, they're astounding! Where National Geographic talks about certain things or places, Saveur takes you to different places and shows you what's there and how they eat.<br /><br />They showed me Ireland and I even made Colcannon (a mashed potato and cabbage dish) everyone loved it. I made a french dish last night that was amazing. It was a little time consuming but worth it!<br /><br />I do have admit I was a little disappointed with my first issue I received from them with my subscription. It looked like a dog ate it then ran through the water with it. It's readable but I wasn't happy. They also promise two exclusive magazines for new subscribers. I've never seen them. But I have been getting my magazines and they look good.<br /><br />I was thinking about it the other night, my three magazines I picked... one was articles and recipes about healthy eating (Eating Well), one was easier recipes with no articles (Everyday Food), and then Saveur. If I could only pick one to keep... it would be Saveur. It's really that good of a read.",23351,157
3.0,1135641137000,Not bad...,"... but not so good I would subscribe to this.<br /><br />This magazine is much like Gourmet. Same ads, though not as many, same layout. It's almost like another version of Gourmet.<br /><br />However, I enjoyed the articles more as well as the recipes than Gourmet. There were a few that I am intrigued enough to try. The recipes themselves were more fancy than say, Everyday Food.<br /><br />Then again, I like Everyday Food more because that's the type of food I eat.<br /><br />If you're looking for something a little more elegant without so many ads this isn't a bad one. I do think that Fine Cooking might be more your cup of tea. With fewer ads and more recipes.",23351,543
5.0,1135628848000,A good magazine,"This magazine is like Prevention, there are articles on eating better, different foods and their nutritional value, and so on. I found them all well done and informative. I especially enjoyed in the last issue a large article on faux foods and the differences between getting a loaf of long shelf life bread, the kind most of us eat, or an artisan loaf of whole wheat and the points as to why we should pick the ones with actual food value over convienence.<br /><br />Most cooking magazines have none to few articles on various topics. Eating Well truly means that - they're telling you about eating well. If you're looking for a magazine with some recipes and more articles that pertain solely to food and their health value then this is one you'll want to check out. I found it a nice change of pace.<br /><br />As stated in another review. There are very few ads which is amazing and very enjoyable.<br /><br />They do have the 'recipes that are different' as I like to call it. They had an appetizer of a dried apricot half topped with crumbled blue cheese, pistachios, honey and a little pepper. It sounds interesting and I would probably try it, but I'm pretty sure I won't make it. They did have some I will try out that looked delicious such as another appetizer of sliced beef wrapped around a dab of boursin and thin sliced peppers, sounds excellent.",23351,319
1.0,1135207580000,Would you like some recipes with your ads?,"Today I purchased my first and probably last issue of Gourmet. While there were plenty of recipes (some of which I won't use but they were still cool to look at) there were TONS of ads.<br /><br />It makes you wonder either a) how much the people who make this magazine get paid or b) for all the ads why this isn't free.<br /><br />I can see the need for a few ads so that we the consumers don't have to pay a fortune for a good magazine. But I took out 33 pages of ads and figured there were about 140 full page ads. That's over half of the magazine which is 260 pages. That's really sad.<br /><br />Recipe wise, some of them look interesting and very gourmet, but there are things you need to have that I can't get in the middle of the U.S.<br /><br />And about three of the six articles were interesting to read - when you could find them slipped inbetween their plethora of ads.<br /><br />Fine Cooking is still the best one out there.",23351,396
4.0,1009091168000,One of life's guilty pleasures,"Oh, why not just go ahead and subscribe?  Over the years I've let my subscription lapse several times, but I always renew it because I just end up buying the damn thing at the grocery check-out.  Nothing in this magazine is going to improve the quality of your life; it's pure escapism.  The Oscar coverage, the best/worst dressed, the sexiest man alive...who can resist?  It takes me about 30 minutes to read it cover to cover every Saturday, but it's always a pleasant 30 minutes.  Sometimes I get a little tired of the public relations-placed celebrity coverage (the &quot;50 most beautiful people&quot; being the worst offender).  While they generally stick to the fluff they do best, the editors can rise to the occasion - their fabulous 9/11 coverage did a great job of addressing both the individual losses and the emotional impact on the whole nation.",23443,368
2.0,1008538588000,"Mostly for people who eat out in NY, not home cooks.","After subscribing to and enjoying &quot;Gourmet&quot; for over a decade, I recently let my subscription run out.  Over a year ago the editorial staff of the magazine changed, and with it, the content of the magazine.  The &quot;Gourmet&quot; I knew and loved was always a treat to receive because it focused on exciting and complex recipes that were going to be fun and challenging to cook at home.  The recipes were very user friendly, and no matter how advanced, always designed to be prepared in a home kitchen.<br />The new &quot;Gourmet&quot; is much more of a travel magazine than a cook's magazine.  It particularly focuses on New York restaurants, and most of the recipes showcase famous dishes from various restaurants, not recipes that were designed for the home cook.  While the old &quot;Gourmet&quot; certainly had its fair share of restaurant and travel coverage, the focus was on different culinary traditions and exciting culinary innovations.  In other words, it was a more scholarly look at cooking.  The new magazine feels like a bunch of fluff pieces set up by New York PR agents.  Next time I'm planning a trip to New York, I'll probably pick up an issue to see what's new and hot, but this isn't the kind of information that's useful to me on a monthly basis.",23443,396
5.0,1006581453000,"Not the flashiest food magazine, but consistently delivers.","Of the three primary cooking magazines (Gourmet, Bon Appetit and Food and Wine), Bon Appetit is the one about how people cook on a daily basis.  There is some travel and restaurant coverage, but it is not the focus of the magazine like it is in Gourmet.  There are articles on wine and contemporary recipes combining exotic ingredients, but not to the same extent you find in Food and Wine.  Here, the food is the star, and it lives up to its top billing. For people who cook more often than on special occassions, this is the magazine for you.  The photography displays the food to advantage and the recipes are consistently well-written and produce delicious results.  While you will find complex and elaborate recipes that are fun to make when you have the time, there are also plenty of recipes and menus that you can incorporate into your daily cooking.  Bon Appetit may not be as flashy as its peers, but if you're looking for a magazine to cook with, this is the one.",23443,543
5.0,1006458068000,Best of its kind,"As far as fashion/women's interest magazines go, this is the best.  There are usually a few traditional fashion spreads - models in urban locales wearing weird clothes and jumping around a lot - but the main fashion offerings are lots of pictures of just the clothes.  This means that there is a lot less emphasis on unnaturally skinny body types.  My favorites spreads are the &quot;Splure v. Steal&quot; articles where the editors compare two nearly identical outfits - one from couture designers and the other from cheaper, more mainstream retailers.  They also do the same thing with makeup.  Whoever puts these together does a great job of showing how you can get the same high end look for a fraction of the price.  The art department uses a lot of briliant color and the fashion spreads usually revolve around a color theme.  The articles tend to focus on interviews with real people.  Lots of articles where a couple are interviewed separately about their sex life and then compare their answers.  There is also usually one article about a serious subject, usually a political topic that effects women.  Nothing in this magazine is going to particularly challenge your intellect, but for a light, fun read, you can't beat it.  The perfect magazine to take to the gym and read while you work out on the stairmaster.",23443,519

For the rest of us, skip it and purchase a better magazine. I canceled my subscription.",24138,240
1.0,1346991313000,FULL OF ADS,"To begin with, I am not much into fashion, so take that into consideration while reading my review. I grew up in the mid-west, where for most people considering we are surrounded by corn fields and our communities are filled with farmers, comfort is more important than fashion. You are more likely to see farm and home stores than fashion stores. Anyway, this was only $5 so I took a chance on ordering it along with several other magazines (which I have a surplus of and am currently behind on reading lol) and this is one of the only ones that even though it is only $5, I had to cancel even if they didn't refund me. I just did not want this coming to my house every month. It is a thick magazine which is good and bad, but one issue was like an encyclopedia. When I started flipping through the pages, MOST of it was ads for products and designers. Just women posing in silly clothes and makeup. The articles, to me, were boring, bland, and not relevant to my life or interests. I read one article where a woman struggled with her appearance because she was Jewish and had a big nose and whatever and it made me kinda sad that she couldn't accept herself for such a long time. Everyone is beautiful in different ways and magazines like ELLE present a culture of one kind of beauty which really isn't beautiful. It's fake and kind of scary. So I just did not want this magazine in my house. I am sticking with more down to earth magazines. I enjoy a range of health magazines, home and family magazines, and girly magazines that aren't quite so fashion centered. Again, this is my opinion so please don't criticize me. I understand location has a lot to do with how you view fashion and body image but I am perfectly happy with me!<br /><br />Update: I'm glad some people are finding my review helpful! I also forgot to mention that my mom (a woman in her 50's) exchanges magazines with me and this magazine has very small print which made the magazine hard for her to read. And I flipped through the last issue I received and most of the articles (at the end of the magazine since the first half of it is full of ads) were about feminism. I am not a feminist and that's as far as I'll go on that subject. You can formulate your own opinion of the articles. Just pointing it out to potential subscribers since I had no idea what to expect from this magazine. Another article in this magazine was defending photo shop and feeding false body images to women as artwork like it is no big deal! I was shocked because it contributes to eating disorders and low self esteem in many women, especially young women. A better name for this magazine would be SUPERFICIAL.",24138,320

The magazine has morphed into the classic trifecta of women's magazine articles: relationships, self-flagellation, and exposes/fear factor stories. Marie Claire ups the ante by having the hubris to declare social justice a topic (hence, this issues's three-page pictorial about rural Brazilian prostitutes). Don't forget aspirational articles about entitled multi-millionare businesswomen (look in their purses!), as well as a puzzling juxtaposition of articles about plastic surgery/eating disorders, etc. followed by an article on what 800-calorie diet is the next best thing, or the latest cosmetic surgery procedures that will change your life. Their nod to ""real women"" is a pictorial usually quizzing college students across the country ""What is your best feature?"" ...and you can hear and see how Jade from Ottumwa, Iowa, loves her freckles and perfect bicuspids. Fashion has taken a severe back seat, there are very few articles about the fashion industry or designers. The fashion pictorials are uninteresting and many are straight-from the runway shots haphazardly curated throughout the magazine. Slap a female celebrity on the cover, and you're good to go.

The whole magazine feels about as un-organic as something could be and seems to read and look like something from a focus group meeting. Let's see- an article about green living, a focus on a cute taqueria close to but not in the 'hood, the best small towns in the west (Just add Bozeman, MT, Jackson Hole, WY, Bend, OR, and a town by the redwoods and one in the desert 200 miles from Phoenix and blend well, stir, shake, re-use concept for 10 years). Then a few quick reader recipes for sushi breakfast bars. Don't forget an architectural piece on a five trillion dollar home in the East Bay with eco-friendly bamboo flooring, purposeful spaces, and mindful use of recycled materials. There is your year's subscription in a nutshell. Other magazines do the clutter-free life, contemporary fusion cuisine, and architecture and design better than ""Sunset"".

Heads rolled, and after a few surprises , it has now settled into horribly written articles, pious editorials, unappealing recipes and a virtual altar for foodies. It is not relevant or interesting except to a very narrowly focused group of food intelligentsia. If a magazine is not capable of surprising you, teaching you, or exposing you to the world we live in, what's the point? If someone reads Gourmet fifty years from now, they will have no idea of what kind of culture we live in. Fear and hatred of food, smart foods, packaged dinners, frozen food, unaffordable food...the list goes on. Gourmet is in a bubble of their own making.

3.0,1210207234000,Cooking Should Not Be This Boring,"I always wondered why I disliked the results of cooking with the ""best"" recipes proffered from this magazine, and then I understood when I saw their companion PBS TV show. The ""best"" is very subjective. Some of the finished products looked vile, textures were off, and an incredible amount of cooking time and pans are used in this navel-gazing approach to food. A problem that I noticed with many of the cookie and cake recipes were gummy, undercooked results. Apparently this is the style that they prefer, but textural results should be noted for the reader. I think it is an interesting concept, but reducing cooking to a rigid chart seems to take away some of the joy and spontaneity, especially when the promised results are far from perfect. I do enjoy reading their unvarnished tasing panel results, and the equipment testing is valuable, but these pluses are not worth the price of a subscription. I think the magazine could benefit by revamping their college-textbook approach. When reading recipes feels like cataloguing bills, something is amiss. Weirdly enough, I love editor Christopher Kimball's musings on the editor's page and I keep my back issues to re-read them. It takes chutzpah to do what he does.

Examples of topics in one issue:  Jewish power and peril, an architect, a sex club, September 11, Vanity Fair covers, and some common monthly features.  At least half of the magazine is fashion advertisements, and because of the amount of advertising, the magazine weighs a lot and is not useful for bringing anywhere.

5.0,1505352038003,Classic Magazine That Is High Quality Still,"Been getting this magazine for over 5 years and I really enjoy it.  The photography is excellent (something they have long been know for), their choice of article subjects covers science, the environment, and history, plus everything they cover is well-written and in-depth.  Getting the subscription is a much better price than off the newsstand so I would recommend saving the cash and subscribing.  With my subscription I also got access to the online Nat Geo and that has all the back issues, documentaries, and extra articles.  Very good deal for a very good product.",26178,98

Even if you do nothing but look at the pictures and read the captions you can't help but learn and be drawn into the article. There are a lot of pictures.<br /><br />The magazine is a larger format than a traditional magazine so it's easy to handle for older hands (at least that is what my parents say) and the pictures are so much easier to enjoy.<br /><br />The articles have a wide range of topics. One month you might be reading the cover article about the New York skyline and another month you might be reading about Egyptian discoveries. There might be articles about sunken ships, a famous painting or an interesting person in history.<br />While some of the articles don't appeal to me, most of them do.<br /><br />What this is not- is the most in depth history magazine available on the market. What this is is a National Geographic magazine but more about history instead of geography.",34058,500
5.0,1519420470484,Great Magazine.,"I've been trying improve my eating habits and so I subscribed to this magazine.<br />It is well written with nice pictures that only add to the text. The recipes for the most part are easy to read and require easy to find ingredients. There is rarely, if ever,  a recipe that requires some strange ingredient or some strange cooking method.<br /><br />I will agree with some that it seems particularly ad heavy. This seems to be the case for many magazines I get lately as they are trying to stay at a reasonable price and compete with the recipe sites on line. However, the opportunity to have yummy recipes that are healthy and easy to prepare in one place is a big plus of this magazine.<br /><br />I like it enough that I have given it as gifts to some of my friends for holidays.",34058,296
5.0,1518325698872,One of my favorite cooking magazines.,"I love this magazine. In fact, I enjoy it so much I have given it as a gift this year to several of my friends. This is a cookbook every month in the mail. What is not to love?<br /><br />THe pictures are bright and colorful and only add to the article or recipe.<br /><br />The recipes are generally family friendly. Most of the recipes, if not all of them, require very little in the way of difficult to find ingredients, special cooking equipment or strange methods of cooking. Occasionally it will cover a new fad or piece of equipment (Such as an electric pressure cooker) with a few recipes to try if you buy this new gadget.<br /><br />If you have ever googled a recipe and stumbled across the recipe on allrecipes.com then you know exactly what your getting when you get this magazine. Yummy deliciousness.",34058,117
5.0,1459296949000,Enjoyable and lovely. A tour of the South.,"This is a beatiful magazine.<br /><br />It is a magazine directed to those women who live in the south, wish they lived in the South or typically enjoy what the South has to offer.<br />The decorating style is very over the top much like you might see in Tea Time magazine or Southern Living or Victorian. It is very lush and fancy in many ways.<br /><br />One of the things I like is that it highlights different cities in the South. For example, the last magazine that I looked at had an article about South Charleston and another about good food that you can try in Louisiana that is outside of New Orleans. This seems typical of all of the Southern Lady magazines I have read.<br /><br />There are also articles about cooking with recipes, decorating, throwing parties, etc etc.<br /><br />I have enjoyed reading this magazine. It is not my style of decorating as I prefer a less cluttered look. However, I still get many ideas from this magazine. Enjoy.",34058,1281

It is classic, stylish and modern decorating.<br /><br />There are travel ideas and it is usually something the whole family can afford. They are usually a little bit off the beaten path and feature something quirky, fun or plain interesting.<br /><br />Well worth the money. Enjoy.",34058,87

3.0,1287420011000,Crisis in Identity,"Fortune magazine appears to be encountering a crisis in identity and focus. Between all the business magazines Fortune does not stand out from the crowd as a quality publication.

Recently National Geographic Adventure folded, I would not be surprised if this magazine follows adventure. This magazine is a buyer beware because it might fold. After subscribing to National Geographic, I was disappointed with the quality of National Geographic Traveler.<br /><br />The locations, and vacations reviews in this magazine are expensive and out of budget to all but the wealthiest.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 8 issues annually<br />- Expensive travel recommendations",39133,200
5.0,1264473805000,"New Yorker sets the standard for journalism, and magazines","You don't have to live in New York to enjoy the New Yorker. Most of the content in the New Yorker can be applied nationally. The feature articles in the magazine have a depth, research, and accuracy that can not be found in other magazines. I love reading the fiction, and viewing the witty comics. Like most New Yorkers this magazine leans slightly to the left.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Fact-checking<br />- Accuracy<br />- Fiction<br /><br />Cons<br />- A little pricey",39133,370

3.0,1257053666000,"Forbes delivers high quality articles, but its liberal bashing gets tiring","Forbes is a conservative business publication that delivers excellent reporting and feature articles. The content is concise, blunt, and to the point because Forbes recognizes the importance of time and clarity. The magazine is especially strong in providing advice to individuals, and businesses about upcoming changes in the tax code, and legislation that would impact the bottom line. However, I have found that the editorial content has become a venue for editors to make personal attacks towards Obama and the democratic party.<br /><br />Pros:<br />As a business magazine, Forbes does an excellent job at delivering succinct articles about business, economics, and stocks. In each issue, the magazine devotes a large section towards dispensing advice about money and investing. There is a depth and detail that can only be found in this magazine. Forbes assumes its readers are astute and smart, and is unwilling to dumb down its content to boost circulation numbers. In a recent article, Forbes provided detailed advice about retirement accounts, and their tax implications.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Forbes can improve its publication by editorializing less and focus more on business issues, and less bashing upon liberal politics. For example, Forbes can take the lead and recommend to businesses ways to reduce health care costs by writing about Safeway, which has been able to tame healthcare inflation. If the magazine authors wants to express their political beliefs, then they are working for the wrong magazine.",39133,259
5.0,1253842078000,Wonderful reporting and feature articles from around the world,"In an era of declining journalism, National Geographic shines above all else as a benchmark for quality, and photojournalism. They have recently won multiple ellie's the equivalent of the Pulizer prize in the magazine industry.<br /><br />Each issue includes one or two features articles from around the world. While the magazine contains advertisements, they have placed ads in the front and back of the magazine so that feature articles are not interrupted by an annoying gaudy ad, a practice often seen in other magazines. The quality of the photos are simply amazing; the magazine uses a high quality paper to print quality photos not seen in any other magazine out there.<br /><br />It is not fair that other reviewers, provide a lower rating for this magazine because it can be found cheaper elsewhere. National Geographic provides a lower introductory rate. However, once you get past the first year, subscribers need to pay the default rate of $34.",39133,98
5.0,1253841244000,Wonderful feature articles,"I love reading Wired magazine because of the quality in the articles it publishes. Just recently there was an article written where the author attempted to disappear and remain missing for 30 days without being found. Although he was close, the author was ultimately discovered close to the end of 30 days through some sophisticated techniques used by a team of readers. Which reveals the difficulty of remaining anonymous and disconnected from the world in this day and age.<br /><br />For those interested in gadgets, and technology, I recommended subscription to Wired, as it provides an interesting reach every month with its in-depth feature articles.",39133,80
4.0,1253824155000,The slow decline of a great magazine,"I started reading The Atlantic in 2004. Back then The Atlantic provided insightful and interesting articles covering Iraq and Afghanistan, and occasionally included some fiction.<br /><br />In the last five years, I have witnessed a slight decline in the quality of this magazine. No doubt this is due to the decline in advertising revenues of this magazine. The Atlantic has scaled down and axed the fiction section from its monthly publication. Fiction is now published annually. Recent covers have included tacky and cheesy headlines designed to capture attention and are more appropriate for a tabloid than The Atlantic. Examples have included<br /><br />- The Britney Show<br />- The Passion of Alec Baldwin<br />- If Kim Jong Il Used Facebook<br /><br />Despite it's recent shortcomings, I would recommend the Atlantic to anyone interested in reading about global affairs, finance, culture, and politics.",39133,70

5.0,1004224737000,"Oh, Martha!","Martha, Martha -- what would we do without her? No matter what you say about Martha Stewart and her perfect perfectness, she does come up with the goods. Living covers it all -- holidays, decorating, cooking, crafts, gardening and overall home organization. While some of the assumptions can be, well, absurd for the average person, ""just run out to your garden and pick some fresh chervil..."", the content is good and does teach  the reader a thing or two. Her arts and crafts ideas are fun and over time, have gotten even better. It is unlikely that any of us would (or could!) adopt all that she suggests we do, but taken in bits and pieces, Martha's advice is creative and helpful stuff.",52423,170
4.0,1004223906000,"Beautiful photography, Romantic Content","The focus of Saveur seems to be more on the experience and essence of food, rather than recipes themselves. The photography is gorgeous and the articles elevate the topics to Romantic levels. I am a true food lover, but sometimes the tone of these articles gets to be a bit much in that the writer will go on and on in hyperbole about crabbing in the Chesapeake Bay or the olives of Italy -- to the point where I think a little credibility has been lost. Having said that, the articles are well-researched and always do include a handful of worthwhile and inspiring recipes. I have had great success with their recipes.",52423,157
5.0,1004223313000,Fantastic Travel and Gardening Information,"Sunset really is a great source of information for Travel and Gardening. I have taken dozens of their recommendations on destinations in the West and have never been steered in the wrong direction. Sunset offers insight into not only where to stay and eat, but great hikes and off-the-beaten-track shops and cafes. Well-researched for sure. The gardening information is so thorough and right on that I adhere to it like gospel truth. It will tell you exactly what you need to do each month to keep your garden going, whether you live in southern California or Northern Washington. I wouldn't subscribe to Sunset for the recipes -- they are not that inventive nor are they very inspired. But, Sunset is second to none on travel and gardening topics.",52423,87
5.0,1004222831000,Consistently the Best Recipes,"I have been reading Bon Appetit for nearly 20 years and find it to be the foodie magazine with the best content. There are always at least a few recipes that I end up trying -- from the super simple cookie recipe to how to make the perfect roast to barbecuing for beginners. And, the non-recipe articles are good food for thought for cooking enthusiasts. (e.g. ""Garlic Through the Ages""...) Bon Appetit seems to be the foodie magazine most in tune with what busy people who also like to indulge in a day of cooking once in awhile want out of a magazine.",52423,543
5.0,1013476224000,A Keeper,"In my opinion, one of the best gauges for the quality of a magazine is the length of time it remains on your shelf after it has been delivered.  Old issues of Bon Appetit will stay with you for years.  The recipes are that good.<br />As others have noted, the pictures and feature writing aren't the best you'll see, but the recipes are both simple and memorable.  Each issue will put a couple (at least) of big guns in your culinary arsenal.",52644,543
4.0,1004392298000,A joy to read,"I remember first reading the New Yorker while a freshman in college.  It was more than a little intimidating to read a magazine that seemed to challenge the reader with so much great fiction and nonfiction.  This is, in short, one of the best literary magazines in print.<br /><br />Why four stars?  The cartoons are not funny.  I know this seems petty, but the magazine seems to congratulate itself on a regular basis on the witty cartoons featured throughout each issue.  They just try to darned hard to be witty and clever.  The result is something like a dry exercise in humor without the actual laugh.",52644,370
3.0,1004391500000,This husband is no fan,"This publication is fairly representative of a Martha Stewart universe that is, in my opinion, the heart of evil in America. Martha shares her thoughts on having the finest in hand crafted furniture, culinary delights and entertaining tips. She fails to point out that these labor intensive recipes, decorating tips and party plans are difficult if not impossible to acheive by the modern working woman without the benefit of paid labor. She holds out a standard less than realistic to most families and seems to strive to make women who don't reach her ideal feel deeply guilty.<br /><br />Why not one star? Well, my wife pointed out this recipe for chestnut stuffing in her last issue that was quite good......curse her.",52644,170

Then Wired is the place to go.<br /><br />Wired has set the standard for internet related publications and has even helped give voice to several important internet political organizations including the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Of course you can read Wired online, but there is just something about a real magazine with all the slick glossy ads.  Very user friendly.",52644,80

1.0,1199693491000,children's magazine,"I ordered the item exactly a month ago.  Amazon has always had a great product assortment, great prices and even better value.  As a merchandise distributor, however, many things seem out of your hands.  You ask me to review a product which first of all, is a gift, secondly, the intended recipient has not received. You do not allow me to proceed without reviewing so that the review will be incorrect. I knew that it would take from 4 to 6 weeks to deliver the product.  What is unacceptable is that in the 4 weeks since I ordered the intended recipient has not received any notification that this gift is arriving. This was meant as a Christmas gift. So, the child--7 years old--is not even anxious or with the expectation of getting a wonderful magazine.  This is not the way to deal with gifts of any kind particularly for a child.  I suggest that you create anticipation by mailing periodic notices with puzzles, readings, games whatever, to keep the child engaged and interested.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Thanks",60098,606
