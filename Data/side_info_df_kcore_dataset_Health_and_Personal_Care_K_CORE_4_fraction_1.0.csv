"GoodSense Premium Saline, Nasal Moisturizing Spray, Instantly Soothes Dry Nasal Passages and Provides Non-Medicated Relief for Dry Irritated Noses","['INGREDIENTS: Compare to Ocean ingredients.', 'USE: GoodSense Saline Nasal Spray is a moisturizer spray that instantly soothes dry nasal passages and provides non-medicated relief for dry, irritated noses.', 'CAUTION: Keep GoodSense Premium Saline out of reach of children. The use of this nasal moisturizing spray dispenser by more than one person may spread infection.', 'UNDERSTANDING ALLERGIES: An allergy is a sensitivity to a substance that is normally harmless. Flowers, trees, a family pet, or dust are examples of things that can cause an allergy.', 'FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS: Squeeze GoodSense Nasal Moisturizing Spray twice in each nostril as needed or as directed by a doctor. Hold bottle upright for a spray; Horizontally for stream; Upside down for a drop.']",[],,4.1,29,77,"Nasal sprays, like this, are great to have on hand, especially in the cold, dry air. It's easy to use and instantly moisturizes the nostrils. I am glad to report that while the listing says it is for a pack of 72, I only received one. There's no way I could use all 72 bottles before they expire! [SEP] I tend to get sinus headaches. When I take allergy and decongest medications to clear up my sinuses, they get dry, tender and this helps to moisturize that nose. I use a cpap at night, and that also tends to be drying, especially during the winter. I don't like using the water the humidify my sinuses, and this gives me a good start. [SEP] I usually use Ayer Gel Nadal Spray when I travel on planes.  It's the best way to fight getting sick from traveling.  Keeping your nostrils moist and breathing through your nose is the key to fighting airborne germs.  I used this nasal spray on my roundtrip flight to Canada.  This spray works well but I had to keep reapplying it.  The Ayer Gel spray seems to coat my nostrils better but this spray works well for daily usage.  I will continue using the thicker gel Nadal spray on planes but I well use this at work and home because it does moisturize my nasal passages when my nose doesn't completely dry out which happens on flights. [SEP] GoodSense Nasal Moisturizing Spray is simple and helpful  The spray head is easily inserted, has three spray modes-- up for spray, down for drops and horizontal for a stream. It does a good job relieving dryness and irritation but for me, it's short-lived relief. My apartment is a very dry environment in the winter and I have no choice but to put Neosporin in my nose at night to keep my nasal passages from eventually drying out and bleeding. Now this spray is a good SUPPLEMENT to what I'm doing. And I would guess my situation is pretty extreme, but GoodSense, nevertheless, is a handy adjunct to keep around. It does its job -- and it's possible that my situation may be a bit more extreme than what GoodSense was formulated for. It's easily portable to take with me, the top goes on tightly so nothing leaks,  and it is very sensibly priced. [SEP] Saline solution is the best natural treatment for sinus and allergy. I usually make it myself but having it in a ready-made bottle with the right balances it a super plus for me. Very non-evasive as compared to prescription and over the counter medicinal solutions. WORKS [SEP] I've used a lot of nasal saline spray and can't tell the difference between brands.  This is as good as any of the recognized name brands.  If your nasal passages are a bit inflamed it could sting a little, because it is salt.<br />I regularly recommend nasal saline sprays for people with sinus pain and tell them to use them as often as they want.<br />I received a single bottle of a product that normally comes in lots of 72 bottles.  I was not able to access the price,  but if you are buying it for personal use and go through that many, you might want to consider getting a neti pot. [SEP] I'm a daily user of Flonase/Fluticasone propionate to control my allergies. However, there are three circumstances when I stop using it because it dries out my nose: if I have a cold, I'm going on a long haul flight, or somehow have a bloody nose due to other environmental factors. This is where saline spray/drops come in handy to moisten the nasal cavities. I know others who use it for similar purposes and it's basically a non-medicated item (water, salt, and some preservatives) so safe for those who are worried about side effects or drug interactions.<br /><br />It is made by Perrigo (but branded GoodSense), which is one of the largest manufacturers of the generic over-the-counter drugs in the United States -- so Perrigo likely produces this same exact product for your local grocery or drugstore in their generic brand. This listing is for a 72 pack, which means you use a lot of the stuff or have multiple household members that do, but for most users, it's probably too much. Mine had an expiration date about 16 months away, but I'm not sure how critical expiration date is on salt water. Five stars for the product and its use. [SEP] The plains of northern central Montana are so dry in the winter! With frigid temps bringing constant heating and icy winds tearing at your nostrils many a nose bleed happens this time of year. While I don't suffer from the frequent nose bleeds my family and friends do, I'll get so dry it gives me headaches. This saline works wonders at slowing the misery down and works just as well as the name brand I was buying at the local big box store. [SEP] This is a 1 .5 ounce bottle of saline spray for your nose to help with dryness and irritation. It's very basic but it works. There are no drugs or chemicals to worry about, and it works well, similar to other similar nasal sprays.<br /><br />It's been really dry this time of year where I live and my nose has been especially dry. This spray has helped a lot, and I've been using it throughout the day and at night before I go to sleep. Good product, I can't tell the difference between this and the name brand. [SEP] This is Amazon's generic version of a Nasal Moisturizing Spray. It works as well as any other nasal spray I've used before. It moisturizes the nasal passages, making it much easier to breathe. During the cold winter months when the heat is running, the air in the house gets a little dry and I find myself waking up in the middle of the night, all stuffed up and congested. Thats why I like to keep a bottle of saline nasal spray on my nightstand. While this Good Sense brand works as well as any other generic or name brand I can't comment about the cost or if its worth it to buy this generic instead of a namebrand because at the time of my review, the price is not currently listed.",3,True

Scent went from soft and baby powder to almost kind of rank or weird.  I feel like this is the new Coke ... They changed something that wasn't broken.  I won't launder anything in it except bath towels and bathmats now.  Very disappointed as I thought it would give clothes the soft scent that it always gave my daughter's clothes..  I'm just going to stick with tide free and clear even tho I was hoping for a little soft scented aroma therapy on pillowcases and sheets. [SEP] I do not care for the packaging.<br /><br />At first, I thought the cut outs were neat. I like how there is a spot to store the cup, and the access area to the spout is tidy looking.<br /><br />Then it came time to pour product into the cup, and WHOA it comes pouring out. I really need to be on top of turning it off real quick lest I overflow my cup..again. So, in the future I will return to their regular bottles. If I had an empty I would pour this into that.<br /><br />The Dreft laundry detergent itself? LOVE IT. Smells SO GOOD... to me. Mmmmm<br /><br />I have been using Dreft products on and off since 2007. I do not have kids, but at some point I ended up with the stain remover spray, which is awesome stuff. Then I would buy the detergent once in awhile, especially for use with my cats and dogs bedding. I hadn't purchased any in a long time,  I think a lot of other gentle products came to market and I simply got away from it (not the stain remover though, still the best for me). Forward to this box of detergent. I really don't recall now what the detergent of the past smells like but I really like the way this smells. It is similar to a few others out there- floral, sweet. You may or may not like it. I like it. It works well with anything I have washed so far. If the scent has changed any, I understand why some would not like it-- sometimes we want what is familiar to use and what has worked.<br /><br />Really not sure why anyone would think this was fake? It is sold by Dreft, not a 3rd party. Go to their page and it is ALL Dreft items. Anyway.. the detergent works as expected. Smells good too! Box.. eh, I could do without that. Use it as a refill if you really want the box style and not have more bottles building up. [SEP] This smells different than their other dreft I've got in the past and I love the update. It smells so good and not too intense. The box reduces plastic waste and is recyclable, easier and more convenient to use than a pour plastic bottle. Just a warning to turn and open the spout slow because it will come out fast if not. I've been using this on our daughters clothes and cloth diapers and it cleans very well and makes everything smell great! [SEP] I think this Dreft Detergent is great. I love the smell and it really does make the clothes soft and smell great. I like the new box it has an easy to use spout. [SEP] Bought this from Granddaughter's Baby Shower Registry. This is what I used for all my children's laundry MANY years ago. So glad to see it's still around :-)  It's perfect for baby's delicate skin, is hypoallergenic. [SEP] Love the product. The scent seems different than before, much stronger. Bit I love it just the same!<br />Had to return and recieve new ones as the first two had spilled out everywhere! Just be aware this can happen.The new ones were packaged perfectly however, no spills. [SEP] We love this detergent! It’s perfect for our babies sensitive skin and leaves little to no scent. I love that I’m able to order it and have it delivered to the front door so I don’t have to leave the house. It came with some tape on the top so there was no spill! [SEP] Yes it's a little pricey, but it smells great.  I think it cleans well and I love that there is also stain spray and sticks as well as softener! [SEP] I was hoping this was the original formula, but it is not. I used this detergent with my last 2 kids so I know the smell of it, and this one is not the same. I loved the old smell, which last longer on the clothes after washing. This one fades away; I can barely smell it after the clothes come out of the washer. Also, the original formula is much more concentrated, therefore you only need to use a little bit. I used more with this one. As for packaging, it arrived well packaged in plastic so there was NO leak. [SEP] I thought the idea of using special detergent for my baby was ridiculous. I had some clothes I had to hand wash and decided to just use the samples of Dreft I got from Amazon in my registry gift box. Immediately I thought, “oh, this smells so good.” And then my husband came downstairs and said, “what’s that baby smell? It smells really good!” I read reviews and it seems the scent changed over the years. While I can’t speak to the old scent, the new one is a light powdery scent. It smells similar to the Johnson & Johnson original baby lotion. I’m excited to wash all my newborn’s clothes in this stuff!",3,True

Not sweet and cloying like some others. Also, keeps bugs away. Had an ant problem at one apartment, used this around any sweet drink, no more ants in my tea or soda. No more ants on my tables. Around the windows and doors, they stopped coming in. All the bugs stayed away. [SEP] I absolutely love,love,love this brand of oils! I have ordered four and I am never dissapointed! I put them in the diffuser and my house smells amazing! I like them so much, I ordered my mom some! I love the orange smell! It is energizing and wakes me up in the morning!

It is also very reasonably priced! [SEP] I absolutely love,love,love this high quality oil! I put it in my diffuser and the house smelled great! I love the fact it is certified organic,so I know my kids are not inhaling nasty chemicals or GMO's! I received this for a discount in exchange for an honest review. After I review this I am going to see what other scents they have available! I have tried a lot of oils and this is the best I have ever tried! I would give it 10 stars if I could! I highly recommend and I would definetly buy again! [SEP] I have sensitive skin and use this to spot treat dry areas. During colder months, I apply all over face and neck before bed and my skin looks amazing in the morning! [SEP] Initially I used this lemon oil to get sticky adhesive off some clothes and it worked great. I made some sugar lemon scrub and it smells wonderful. I ran out it and used a different brand. What a mistake. Fabulous Frannie’s lemon smelled stronger, better and I used less than the other brand. Going to purchase the largest bottle available. [SEP] Doesn't seem to be as good quality as the higher priced brands I've tried, but I guess you get what you pay for...........or don't.

Rinse Free Sponge Bath Wipes (30-pack) | Extra Large & Thick No Rinse Waterless Body Wipe Sponges - Disposable Shower Cleaning Wash Cloths for Kids Adults Surgery Elder Care Gym Travel & More (1 Pack),[],[],,4.2,231,471,"When you can't get in the shower and want to feel refreshed or just clean these are really good to have around. Thick enough that you won't easily drive your fingers through the material but thin enough to be usable. Ok scent. Useful cloths. [SEP] How this fits into your life depends on what you need. It still requires some water, and still requires toweling off. It basically replaces the need to have a separate low suds cleansing formula and wash rag or dry cloth. THIS IS Rinse free, but you do need water to start.  Just add a little water to the sheet of fabric, massage for light lather, wipe down body, then towel off. No need to rinse. Keep in mind that the more water that is used, the more the mess from run off.<br /><br />The sheet of fabric is like a soft piece of felt. Size of a large washcloth (9.5"" x 9.5""). Don't need much water! It definitely lathers. It isn't a sudsy soap, but that doesn't mean there isn't enough.  Now, if you are expecting loads of foamy bubbles, this does not provide that. It creates a light watery lather. This in no way determines effectiveness of cleaning. Mega lather does not equate better cleaning. I learned that 30 some years ago in home economics that excess lather is a marketing technique (usually through copious amounts of sulphates) to give people impression that more lather/bubbles/suds = better clean (shampoo, body soaps, toothpaste). But for those that dig the suds, I can get some light bubbles out of it. That being said, it is adequate enough. Not super refreshing, but I do feel clean. Tried it in hair with fair results.<br /><br />This could be cut in half and it would still have plenty of lather. Depending on your situation, this could be premoistened and placed in a ziplock baggie.<br /><br />No discernable aroma. Not sticky, at least not me. I wonder if amount of water used, or thoroughness of toweling off impacts that or not.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer wet body wipes. They never need water nor toweling off. I like those for on the go use (workday, after work out, bird bath at the sink). I would be more apt to use these in a bed bound situation, or no hot water situation, maybe camping.<br /><br />The term ""waterless"" needs to be taken out from the title headline. That is a traffic directing manipulation, and it helps no one especially if they buy something like this without further looking at the product pictures and description. [SEP] I didn’t expect much from these, and I didn’t get much. Thankfully, I didn’t get them as a bath/shower substitute so I have to admit, that I was able to get SOME use from them.<br /><br />There was a point when my hot water heater went out that I was taking a bath with baby wipes. And, yes, I did manage clean my entire body. No issues there, though I don’t recommend it for everyone.<br /><br />New hot water was installed by the maintenance team where I live. So, that ended my makeshift bath option.<br /><br />Seeing these, and remembering that, I decided to snag them.<br /><br />🧼 They are thick, about 4x thicker than the baby wipes we like (Huggies natural care)<br /><br />🧼 They do have some suds<br /><br />🧼 They are easily discarded<br /><br />Do they clean?<br /><br />Well, I decided to test them on the dirtiest part of my body – MY FEET. I wear my flip-flops a lot, and since the shoes are black – you can well imagine how dirty my feet could get. Add in stepping outside for bit here or there or driving without shoes (which, yes it is legal) – my feet can get nasty fast.<br /><br />Which, in that case – PERFECT test for these wipes.<br /><br />My feet are a size 7 – I say that so you can gauge how big my feet are in relation to how well these worked.<br /><br />After getting them wet – not a lot of suds. Okay …<br /><br />I wet my feet first and scrubbed them with this pad. It isn’t scratchy, but it isn’t soft either. The dirt came off and I splash rinsed before drying my feet. One “towel” did both feet, but no suds were left after. I threw the towel away and was satisfied.<br /><br />It didn’t dry my feet out the way other soaps do – that was good.<br /><br />Would I trust ONE for my entire “larger” body – NO. Not at all. I would definitely need at least one for my back, one for the back of my legs, at least three for my front region, and perhaps one for my arms.<br /><br />Total: at least six (6) wipes. As there are only 30 in this pack – not a great value at all. I did better with cheaper baby wipes. In addition, I’m not sold on the “no-rinse” deal.<br /><br />These are not something I’d get again, and I honestly don’t recommend them. [SEP] I was very pleased with these rinse-free bath cloths by Nurture. They are larger than I expected, thick and soft. With just a little bit of water and a couple squeezes, they produce a nice lather that for me, was enough to wipe my entire body. The lather isn’t so thick that you feel you need to rinse, and it dries comfortably without feeling sticky or stiff. These are handy for camping, for travel, for those who are ill or recovering from surgery, or for a gym bag. Very versatile, very easy to use. [SEP] I received one pack of ""Nurture Valley Rinse Free Bath Sponges"". There are 30 ""sponges"" in the pack.<br /><br />I was more curious about this item then anything. Overall, it's not a bad product but could use a little improvement.<br /><br />The ""sponges"" are actually more like sheets. They reminded me of sheets of felt. They really did.<br /><br />The sheets already have soap on them, you just add water. It doesn't take a lot of water to work them into a lather. I wadded the sheet up in my hand and added probably 2 ounces (maybe 3) of water and the ""sponge"" got very soapy.<br /><br />The problem is if you are planning to use these for a full body wash you will need to use more then 1. It really depends on your body size & how ""dirty"" you may be.<br /><br />The soap in / on them was non-irritating to my super sensitive skin. That was nice.",3,True
"Sleeping Masks for Men Women, Cyraneme Upgraded 3D Contoured Blindfold, Super Soft and Comfortable, Eye Shade Cover for Travel, Nap, Shift Work",[],[],,4.5,28,573,"This will fit large heads. I have a 23.75"" head, and this has plenty of stretch and adjustability. It can easily go larger than my head measurements.<br /><br />The soft foam cups are comfortable. The exact fit will vary. I find they block out all the light, and unless I am resting my head in such a way to push on them, there is very little light that will sneak through. I'm a side sleeper.<br /><br />The soft foam cups allow the eyes to breathe, lashes don't get smashed. Eye creams likely stay in place.<br /><br />Although stretchy and adjustable, it is hard for me to find that sweet spot where it isn't too snug that it creates creases come morning, nor too loose that it doesn't fall off, migrate away from my eyes. I found the snug fit worked better as it kept the mask from rotating in the night (and off my eyes), BUT I wake with indents. I can't have that.<br /><br />Other aspect that has troubled me is that sometimes it gets caught in my hair. The spot that has the adjustment hardware is prone to snagging my hair.<br /><br />SO, I go back to my old trust stand by which is a tube of material. It looks like a headband, and it continues to be my most favorite sleep mask of all time. If it rotates, it doesn't matter because it is a tube so I am always covered,  I have been using nightly since I got it 6 months ago.<br />www.amazon.com/dp/B07RJQGV61<br /><br />This one by Cyraneme is a close second, though. Comfort, quality, adjustability, and the fact that it can actually fit large heads are all positives in my opinion. The rotation and the indents (and hair snag) is variable. Depends on if I can find that sweet spot for fit. I definitely have tried other sleep masks that I never used ever again. This I will use. It is still at my bed side. [SEP] My eyes are extremely dry and I struggle at night. I use a very thick eye lotion -sounds weird, but it helps- and eye masks help to keep me from rubbing my eyes at night. I have found some eye masks are better than others.<br /><br />The masks I really like are the super soft masks that cover most of the top of my face. I have also found the masks that irritate my eyes the most are the super soft masks that cover most of the top of my face. They work really well, but for some reason, they aggravate my eyes a lot.<br /><br />This mask, first of all, blocks all the light. When I put it on it is completely dark. It is easy to adjust and it is comfortable. It is all black with no design, so it is a simple and appropriate grown up sleep mask.<br /><br />I hand washed it before I used it and hung it on the line to dry before I first used it and it dried within a couple hours. Simple. I wash my masks once or twice a week because my eyes are very sensitive.<br /><br />This mask is firm, but comfortable. It did not cut into my face and after a little adjustment was easy to sleep with. I did wake up with sleep mask face, but I always wake up with sleep mask face. This mask, I noticed, gives my eyes some breathing room, which is so nice because I put my drops in and then stick my mask on and having a mask pressing against wet eyes is never pleasant.<br /><br />I like this mask and for the price is one I could easily have a few of to rotate around while I wash them to protect my eyes while I sleep. [SEP] I usually prefer a silk sleeping mask because of its comfort, which is NOT what this sleeping mask is.  This is more of a very thin foam that bulges out slightly around your eyes so that it has minimal contact with your face while even letting you open your eyes.  This is the best one of those that I've used.  It is quite comfortable and blocks out all the light. [SEP] Blocks out light very well, and is adjustable on velcro. The eye pads on side facing the eyes have a space between your eyes and the mask, which for me creates comfort. You can open and close your eyes behind the mask for the most part, and your eye-lashes don't get squashed against the fabric. Material doesn't destroy after the washing machine, and the material is non-skin irritating (but it isn't silky either) and not rough. By far, my favorite eye mask out of may that I have tried. [SEP] Caution: I am going to gush about this sleeping mask!<br /><br />I have been in search of the perfect sleeping mask for 20 years. I’ve found ones that I liked using at the time I purchased them - but looking back, they were more decorative than functional. They were better than nothing, but there was a light of light creeping through. For quite a long time, silk outer, cotton-ish  flat sleep masks were all that seemed available.<br /><br />Masks then became available with newer, more elastic fabrics like this mask began to be produced. The masks also seemed to get bigger at that time, especially when compared to the flimsy decorative silk masks. I liked my first mask of the “new generation"" very much. It barely let any light in at all. But it also came with such a large band that even though it had a velcro adjuster for size, it was way too big. I added in a very small safety pin to tighten it up. Never quite got there. The mask was also a flat front - which these new thicker masks made quite warm. It had it’s good and bad points.<br /><br />Then I tried this mask and I knew that my search was over. That does sound dramatic, I know, but I love this mask! It functions literally like a blindfold, as advertised. It has much the same fabric and thickness of my previous mask, but the way that the eye covers are 3D contoured is EVERYTHING. I hadn’t realized just how miserable and warm I had been during my long search until I came across this mask that makes no contact with my eyes. It doesn’t cause any unwelcome warmth in the mask area. I use it all the time and can’t imagine using another mask. It has the same type of around the back of the head with velcro band, but this band and it’s velcro are thoughtfully sized.<br /><br />I’ve recommended this mask to all my friends who use masks and purchased others for my mother and my sister. The price point is quite reasonable and allowed me to send them as “thinking of you,” gifts. All that have tried it in my circle love as much as I do. I give it my highest recommendation. [SEP] as my title says their is no pressure, and what i mean by that is on your eyes some masks press in a uncomfortable way and add a unwanted pressure to your eyelids this one doesnt have that at all. its a nice soft but not like a silk soft material making it nice to wear. the ""nose section"" to me at least made little to no difference and honestly seems like more of a sales gimick then anything in my opinion, looking at the strap the change of strap design was semi nice for me to see it is adjustable now yes elastic is also but you have to cut elastic to a specific minimal and hope its a good one size fits all me personally i like to set it and forget it and this one does allow that unlike many others. on a huge upside i was after fiddling with this for a bit able to eventually get it to sit in a position that blocked id say 98% of the light the little bit it didnt was right on my nose area it wasnt enough to be distracting to me but for some it may be. [SEP] The materials is soft and thick. The eyes can't catch the light, doesn't hurt or make pressure in the eyes. Very comfortable to put it on, love it in velcro type, not in rubber that mostly hurt my ears. [SEP] This eye mask is very comfortable for me and fits me nicely even though I have a small head at 21 1/2 inches. It conforms to my face well so that no light is able to get through even though I sleep on my side which pushes on the side of the mask. I like how it has the cups that keep the mask off of my eyes and lashes, that makes it even more comfortable. [SEP] This mask is so comfortable. It feels like a no wire, memory foam bra for your eyes! The eye socket area is softly molded out so it doesn't press onto your eyes or lashes. But it still completely blocks out all light , even those areas underneath and around your nose. It has a comfy stretchy elastic band with velcro clasp to easily adjust for any size  head or hair. [SEP] Comfortable and full coverage. Use my mask every night.",3,True
3 Pcs Bath Sponge Shower Soothing Exfoliating Sponge Natural Fiber Foam Sponge Body Cleaning Scrubbing Sponge for Women Men Kids,[],[],,3.9,107,625,"Now, these are awesome sponges. I had to replace a sponge I had for a while and these have been awesome. I love the two different sides because you have the normal washing sponge part but then the top side is a rough exfoliating side and it works great for those rough areas and getting off all the dead skin that's built up from the winter. I am loving these and they are making my skin feel amazing. [SEP] Tried these for awhile. Sponge is a nice size, has a rope to hang from a hook. What makes them nice is the exfoliating size. It's not too harsh and works great. Definitely liking them! [SEP] Fell apart first time using. More for washing dishes. don't want your money [SEP] Great sponges, work and lather really well. There is a soft and exfoliating side. Super cute designs! Would make a great self care gift. [SEP] These sponges are made of—polyurethane, not actual sponge. The advertising copy promises actual sponge (though the colors might be a clue that they are not). But the packaging they arrived in clearly state that they are polyurethane--and all indications through inspection and use confirm it. That said, they are a nice size, so they fit well in your hand while you use them, and they lather and perform reasonably well. They hold shower gel well, and they are mild, so they exfoliate, but not to the point of scratching.<br /><br />But after a week of use, the more abrasive back is separating from the rest of the sponge. They are ready for the trash bin.<br /><br />With such a short life expectancy, these sponges are too expensive at any price (and to the seller: Please! Fix your advertising copy!). [SEP] Since moving from Europe to the US, I have had a hard time procuring bath sponges for my family. Such a basic item in Europe, seems to be a ""novelty"" in US. I have tried many of the brands/options on Amazon, most from Europe anyway, with very poor results. This set of three sponges is not bad, given the relative low price. Sure, the exfoliating layer is just a bit more firm than the sponge itself, but it is abrasive enough to provide some additional scrubbing power.  Sure, the scrubbing layer will start shrinking and separating from the sponge itself after a month or so of daily use, but it will take a while before making the sponge unusable. In my experience, most of the other sponges on the market do disintegrate or rip in pieces after a few months of use, but not this sponge. So far the sponge itself is holding up well,maybe because of the extra thickness of the material and density. The tight alveolar structure provides probably more strength, but makes the sponge less fluffy and foamy. I have absolutely no use for the attached string and I removed it as I opened the package. [SEP] These work really well! They’re a decent size and there’s a good amount of them. They pick up a lot of suds and seem really sturdy. [SEP] They are smaller than I thought and the exfoliating side pulls apart from the sponge only after a few uses.  Disappointing! [SEP] Love these sponges.  Firm and they don't fall apart like others I have purchased. [SEP] These are great sponges!! They are very absorbent and holds soap for a long time. I love the exfoliating feature of these sponges.  And the size is perfect, really large and doesn't slip out of my hands while using.  Really nice.",3,True
"Enyur Floor Cleaner - Multi-Surface Cleaner, 60 loads (1 pack, fresh scent)",[],[],,3.9,34,2097,"This type of cleaning format is outstanding for resource conservation. It comes in sheets that dissolve far more readily and quickly than the tablet format concentrates. The sheets are easy to cut (or tear) if you need a smaller amount for the task.<br /><br />While these sheets are positioned as a floor cleaner (and it works pretty well for that task) they can also be used as a general purpose spray cleaner. I use a sheet for a 32oz bottle, and the spray does a fine job for counters, sinks, and other general cleaning tasks. The scent is reasonably pleasant, but I would have preferred no scent as other sheets offer.<br /><br />There are some cons, however. First, the cost is higher than similar sheet-based concentrates, and the performance is no different than the lower cost options. Second, the packaging is not ideal for sheets. The sheets are somewhat delicate and must be kept totally dry in storage or they will dissolve. The sheets are packaged in a cardboard box in a single clump. Other manufacturers use a plastic box or, if a cardboard box is used, the sheets are divided up into smaller groups.<br /><br />Factoring in the cons puts my score at 3 stars. Although the sheet format is perfect for eliminating plastic waste and is easier to use than the tablet-based format, there are better sheet options available at a lower price. [SEP] This floor cleaner sheet is very easy to use. Just take out a sheet put into the cleaning bucket, add water, and it will dissolves by itself. I use it to clean my hardwood floor and it's very clean and I like it. [SEP] The product includes 60 sheets of a fast dissolving cleaner concentrate. You add the sheet to about a gallon of water to produce a cleaning product to wash various flooring.  It can be used to clean tiles, ceramics, sinks, bathtubs, etc. For sinks, bathtubs, counters, just tear the sheet proportionate to the size of your spray container (or make a gallon, using one sheet, and pour it into spray bottles).<br />When dissolved, the resulting cleaning fluid is effective. I like that they use plant derived components. “Plant formula, no harm to the skin, no damage to the surface of floor.” Being eco-friendly and pet/child friendly are pluses, too.<br />At a cost of $20.25 - $21.75, including the current 25% discount coupon, makes this a good value. Comparable products may cost $17 for 30 sheets (half the number provided in this product offering).<br />I feel the cleaning concentrate sheets, with mild scent, functions as described. They are sensibly priced, with good value. Accordingly, it earns a 4.25 - 4.5 star rating. [SEP] Cleaned floor and easy to use. Do not soap while filling wash container, makes water to soapy. Add after water container is filled, no suds, performs well. [SEP] After weeks using this in tile floor where grease, food and other stuff falls in to the floor I can say it cleans and leaves the area free of stain. is easy to apply and can be used in a regular mop bucket. it dissolves very fast and has a nice scent. [SEP] I like that it’s easy to use, not so cost-effective.  it doesn’t really clean and it leaves a residue on the floor and in order for you to have a gallon of water you have to use 2 to 3 sheets. [SEP] Disclaimer: I received this product courtesy of Amazon Vine's review program. This review is my own opinion. Beware: At first, I thought this was a whole floor cleaning system; it is just the soap wafers that you put into your own bucket and use your own mop. This is just a small box of soap wafers. Just wanted you to know, since I was confused by the advertising photos. I thought I was getting a whole mopping system along with these wafers.<br /><br />Directions: You put a little over a gallon of water in your bucket, depending on how much dirt you need to remove. Drop in a wafer to dissolve about a minute, and then clean your floor.<br /><br />Info:<br />-As advertised, the wafers are easy to carry around if you have a lot of areas you need to clean, instead of carrying around bottles of cleaner.<br />-Wafers means no danger of spilling your floor cleaning soap.<br />-The cleansing wafers are about the thickness of a few sheets of good paper, and feels almost sponge-like, so they are very lightweight<br />-Vegan<br />-Cleans your tile floors sufficiently<br /><br />Pros:<br />They are lightweight, thin, and easy to use.<br />I used one wafer to about 1.3 gallons of water, and it suds up nicely. The suds were still there when I was done.<br />Since it is not liquid, there are no spills from a bottle container.<br />-Pleasant and very light scent.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-I have really dirty floors. If you plan on doing heavy-duty cleaning, you might need something else.<br /><br />Recommendations for the company:<br />I wish these wafers came in a reclosable bag. The bag is open on one end, without a way to close the plastic bag after each use, to make sure to keep the product dry between uses. It may help keep the product more efficient between cleanings.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed using this product. I think it is a brilliant idea to put soap into a sheet, kind of like some of the dryer sheets that we use for drying laundry. I only gave it four stars because it did not really clean the difficult stains. I do recommend it for lighter stains and general tile floor cleaning. [SEP] I find this cleaner to be fairly average, which does not mean bad or deficient. It gets a star for being more environmentally friendly than others. I found for it to work better with grease type dirt, just like any other cleaners, you need to let it soak into the stain for a little while first, then mop it up. Give it a little time to soak in and then scrubbing won't be so hard. (The packaging does not tell you this, but just basically mop and go.) In the package it smells fresh and clean, but one sheet of it in a gallon doesn't really smell like much. This pack does yield quite a bit so it should last a while. I also tried it on my stove for grease spots and that worked too, but again, I had to let it sit for bit to make wiping easier. [SEP] These floor cleaner sheets dissolve quickly and have a nice faint scent. It works great on my vinyl plank flooring without leaving any residue or stickiness on the floor. The sheets are smaller than expected and make it easy for storing. It takes up less room than a bottle. [SEP] I've used sheets like this for the laundry, love them, and hoped that this would be just as ideal. The sheets come together wrapped in clear plastic, and that all in a box. Unfortunately, this isn't resealable but that doesn't really matter. I love the light-weight, little trash, and easy to store aspects of these. Just awesome.<br />The directions are on the back and understandable.<br />I use to sheets in an entire bucket of warm water. It takes a minute or so to dissolve completely. When stirred up (just to make sure all is evenly dispersed), there is a small amount of suds on the the top of the water...but not a lot. There are little, white flakes of soap, which seem to have a bit of trouble dissolving (hence the 4-stars), but honestly, this didn't cause any issues while mopping.<br />I use it on wood and tiled surfaces. Both were nicely cleaned with this solution and all spots and spills disappeared without a problem. There isn't really much of an odor, which is fine. And it didn't irritate my hands or skin, when I came in contact with it.<br />So yes, I am definitely going to keep an eye on this product for future purchases.",3,True

I like that they were so big because they covered a lot of my hands. I had been using disposable and they always broke, so it is nice to have something that stays nice. They seemed pretty durable and strong. I plan to use them again and again. I was pleased with quality. I would recommend them. [SEP] I have been using these for dishwashing and they are little big for me,  but they are workable!  I have used the other pair for bathroom cleaning and same thing.  They hold well enough.  They have long sleeves and seem to be really good quality.  Great cleaning and dishwashing gloves! [SEP] These gloves are fabulous. I recently had to use them when I needed to clean out an old trailer, and they were great from everything to moving to cleaning. They are built well and are very strong. Even in the worst of conditions they didn’t show signs of deterioration. I would highly recommend! [SEP] These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] These are decent quality PVC gloves for most household dishwashing and cleaning purposes.<br />Well designed gloves that fit true to size, easy to put on and remove, comfortable, thin, weaved cotton lining, longer cuffs, and textured surfaces for a good grip.  Have not torn or cracked after 3 weeks of daily use.  Non-latex for those who are allergic. [SEP] These are a notch up from your standard kitchen gloves. They feel durable, nice and are very soft inside.<br />My hands are a Medium male size, and these fit perfectly snug. Not too snug. They are not super thick like some ""3 mm thick household gloves"" you buy at some upscale kitchen stores , but they definitely feel much stronger made then the standard yellow gloves bought in the store.<br />I would say they will hold up to normal dishwashing etc for a month or maybe two.<br />The inside does have a nice soft layer which is a plus as well.<br /><br />Definitely will buy these again. [SEP] We have been using another brand of reusable gloves to clean for years and years… they were a staple until I discovered this. We like having gloves to protect our hands from the variety of harsh chemicals we use to clean… especially when we clean our toilets or drains. I wasn't sure initially if these were more the latex like gloves that my mother introduced me to years ago for dishes or if they were more a thicker, industrial type. This is more like the light house cleaning type. They are a good quality product… but a slightly better quality. Great for gardening, dishwashing, and cleaning. [SEP] I didn't think that I would mind using UNLINED gloves for wet chores (dishwashing, cleaning the bathroom, etc.) but after wearing a pair of these for a short while (10 minutes), I could not wait to get my hands out of them. The medium is a good fit for my smallish hands, but removing them meant I had to almost turn them inside-out!  They are flexible and long enough to keep my hands dry.  But the brand I've been buying on Amazon are less expensive (though they did JUST go up a few dollars), so I'll pass on purchasing these in the future.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I downgraded my review to TWO stars because the lined blue pair lasted a week before two fingertips got holes in them doing only dishes.  Of course  my hand was soaked quickly.  My husband put some ""gorilla glue"" on the holes so I'll see how long that makes them useable. [SEP] Fast shopping and work great [SEP] I'm really irritated as I write this. I opened the second pack in this two pack and the second one is unlined. They are not the same kind and the second one is useless. We need the lining to protect from hot water.",3,True
"Fowecelt 3D Dinosaur Happy Birthday Banner, Dinosaur Party Supplies Decorations, Bunting Flag Garland, Kids Adults Birthday Party Favors Supplies(Blue)",[],[],,3.7,21,10098,"This is a cute dinosaur banner in a light blue color.  I got it for a Zoom party and it is plenty big for that purpose - several feet long.  It is not, however, ""3-D"" unless you consider stacking 2 sheets of paper as a 3D effect.  You have to put this dino together yourself, on a string, so there's plenty of room for error, which is a bit annoying. [SEP] This was the perfect finishing touch for our dinosaur themed birthday party for my 5-year-old. He really loved it and zeroed in on it right away. It's very cute. We actually hung it on the side of the snack table and it looked great. One thing I would love to see them change in the future is to include a fully rounded cord to use to string these letters together as opposed to a ribbon, since the ribbon is prone to twisting which can make the letters stick out a little bit wonky. But otherwise this is really charming. [SEP] The banner came in time for my son’s birthday. While it is cute, you have to string it yourself, it doesn’t come string and I wasn’t happy about that. I stringed it but several sections got twisted though I tried to make sure it didn’t. I was a little frustrated at the end trying to fix the string that I just gave up and left it twisted in several areas as it was only going to be up for few hours and due to quarantine, it was only the household celebrating his birthday. I wish it came string like other birthday banners. [SEP] My kid is dino crazy, so this banner was perfect! We all got a kick out of how the letters look like bones in the dinos body. Yes, you do need to string this yourself, but they provide you with plenty matching ribbon to hang it and it takes just a few minutes. Lay out all the pieces on a table or on the floor so you can be sure you have the letters in the right order and do not get mixed up as you go. Pay special attention to the fact that you have letters of graduating size and there are two different sized A's, H's and Y's so before you string these, make sure you lay them out and have the right size in the right place or else it will look disjointed. The letters start small at his head, get big in the middle, and get smaller again towards the tail, refer to the picture on the package for help. Not a big deal, you just need to lay them out first, so do not wait until the last minute to tackle this! It is totally worth any extra effort on your part, he is super cute and will really tie your theme together. I love that I can shop for party supplies from my home. It saves me from running all over town trying to find the perfect thing and the decorative details make our at home Covid parties feel super special and fun.

I didn't expect it to work this well; I tried it because when I test a product I put it through all sorts of paces.<br /><br />What I found was that within about 5 minutes of application, the pain in my leg and backside had eased considerably.  It didn't go away entirely, that required the addition of some NSAIDs. But it did make the discomfort manageable, which is a blessing.  When I tried this as a sleep aid, it did nothing for me.  Results on a headache were mixed.  I will say that some advice I was given - always look for hemp products that are CO2 extracted - was good advice because I find such products to be across-the-boards more effective than any others.<br /><br />What can I take away from these experiments? Mostly what I take from most such experiments: We are all different, and products like this, which are created without set standards, will inevitably vary. So if this works for you, for some conditions, be glad, use it, you lucked out.  If it doesn't, hand it off to someone else who might have better luck, and try something else. [SEP] I like this quite a bit.  Its easy to use and smells good also.  I put it on my wrists and temple areas.  I like it.  Thank you. [SEP] I have used essential oils on and off for several years, and I love how easy to use this roll-on is.  The roller ball works well and rolls freely without being too loose.  The oil indeed smells like lavender, which is one of my favorite calming oils .  The bottle gives recommendations as to where to use the oil (wrist, upper chest or feet), so it’s a quick and easy reminder if I forget.  I haven’t had any issues with using the oil directly on my skin so it’s a very convenient way to dispense the oil blend. [SEP] I am a huge believer in essential oils.  I love lavendar and love that this comes in a rollar ball so I can take it with me while traveling.  This has been purse friendly as well with no issues of leaking which is another plus.  I like using this when I am feeling stressed and also when I am going to bed. [SEP] I knew this oil roll-on is infused with hemp oil, but I assumed the lavender would be the only scent.  This definitely has a hemp oil scent, which is just as dominant as the lavender.  Thus, the oil has more of an earthy scent.  As a roll-on, the oil dispenses well.  I do get some scent and oil leakage if the container is stored upside down or on its side.  I don't think hemp oil has many ""relaxing"" benefits, but as an oil it is moisturizing.

There are eight steamers in this package. Each tablet is the size of a hockey puck but half the size. The tablet needs to be  elevated in the shower so that the steam and water droplets hit it. The one I tried slowly dissolved and fizzed and leaked an electric pink color all over my tub that (thankfully) washed away with little effort.<br /><br />I have the nose of a bloodhound and I could barely detect any scent. I then decided to dissolve it in the bottom of my shower as if it were a bath bomb. I still barely detected a fragrance. Why anyone would use something like this is beyond me, especially when very little fragrance is present. I already wash my hair and soap up my body with very fragrant shampoo and bath soap, so there is no need for a steamer in my shower.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I spent several minutes dissolving the tablet in the shower after I finished washing and there was still very little scent.  These are not for me. However, I do feel they would be more effective as bath bombs because they fizz and one will be closer to the action to get more of the scent.<br /><br />At the current price of $11.99 for eight tablets, this comes to a  $1.50 per steamer. [SEP] These are very good smelling and lasted longer than expected. The colors are very bright and each tablet is individual wrapped in plastic. They do list the ingredients and are not all natural but they never claim to be. Check the ingredient list before purchasing if you have any skin sensitivities. They come in a nice box that is a great gift. [SEP] They smell good and are quite relaxing [SEP] Great gift. Nicely packaged. Smells wonderful! [SEP] They work better in the tub than it did in the shower. The smell wasn't that strong either. [SEP] I’ve never tried shower aromatherapy but had been wanting to try it! I was excited for these little discs to arrive. Unfortunately the scent fell flat for me. I really wanted an invigorating, clean and natural scent but what I received what a box of shower bombs that were really weak and  didn’t smell good at all. I really wanted to try these but I couldn’t get over the smell - they went straight into the trash bin [SEP] While these aren't the best shower steamers that I've tried, they also aren't the worst. For me, they fall somewhere in the middle. They differ significantly in the strength of their scents. For example, I can smell the peony decently well throughout my whole shower, but the lily had a really mild scent when I first got in the shower, and the scent was pretty much unnoticeable by the end of my shower.<br /><br />Shower steamers work best when you use hot water, and with it being summer, many people don't want to take a hot shower. If you want to use these in the summer or when you want a cooler shower, I would suggest putting this in the shower, turning the hot water up as high as it will go, and then letting it steam for about two or three minutes. When you get in the shower, it will be a bit warm, but the steamer will also be working. You can then turn the temperature down significantly and enjoy the scent of the steamers. The scent won't last as well as it would if you kept the shower warm throughout your shower, but you will still be able to enjoy at least some of the benefits of the shower steamers.<br /><br />For me, these shower steamers last about one and a half showers. When I have shower steamers that last for more than one shower, I generally pull them out and put them in a Ziploc bag to save for my next shower. These are a bit mushier than other shower steamers that I've been able to use for more than one shower, and they don't stay as well intact. If you can, I'd suggest just leaving the leftover bits in the corner of your shower until your next shower. [SEP] This is a really cute set and would be a nice gift or part of a decor setup. The scents aren't very strong but if you're just using them as a gift or decoration then it's a good buy. [SEP] These are poor quality with strange scents. The packaging is hard to open and the “grass” that the shower melts/ “bath bombs” are packaged in is a huge mess and gets everywhere. I wouldn’t buy these again. [SEP] I found these to be pretty underwhelming....some had some scent and some did not.  I wanted to try this as I have never tried steamers before.  But I think I will stick with bath bombs...they make more sense.  These do not as you can sort of smell them and since they don't come in contact with your skin, it's merely aromatherapy.

No Stevia. 6 Bars Ginger - Nutmeg + 6 Chocolate - Vanilla.",[],[],,3.6,48,73,"My family follows a low carb diet. These low carb snack bars are quite satisfying. I was full for a good couple of hours after eating one. They are surprisingly soft and chewable. I expected them to be hard and dry, but they aren't. I would rate the taste as in between a 3 and a 4. They're definitely palatable. I've had some bars that I've literally had to force myself to eat. I found it easy to eat these. You're not going to mistake them for candy or treats. These would be easy to keep in your bag or take on the go. [SEP] I dont know if I got a bad batch but I did not like these at all. Usually even if I don't completely enjoy something, and I know its healthy, I'll still eat but I dont think I could do it with these. All I taste is some coconut and the sweetener and it's just gross to me. I tried the ginger first and I didnt like it, so I was like ok the chocolate will probably be better.. nope.. both had minimal flavor and that sweetener diet-y aftertaste...<br /><br />I found it slightly odd that the packaging it came in didnt match the picture, and one of the bars wrappers weren't even sealed.<br /><br />The only thing these have going for it is the ingredients and overall quality is good...<br /><br />They are just not for me and my tastebuds and I would never get again. [SEP] My husband and I didn’t really care for the taste of these keto bars. They were very bitter tasting and they were also kind of dry. [SEP] I liked the taste of the chocolate bar quite a bit.  The ginger-nutmeg one was okay but not as flavorful to me even though I love both ginger and nutmeg.  Those bars seemed too sweet to me, perhaps too much monk fruit concentrate for my tastes?  There are no artificial sweeteners, which is a plus.  And the ingredients are stellar.  Lots of whole nuts and seeds mixed in with the other ingredients.  These are relatively small bars with only two grams of sugar but six grams of protein.  There are 13 grams of carbs but ten of those grams are fiber, leaving 3 grams of net carbs.<br /><br />You can get this information by reading the box but you can't get most of it by reading the product page because ingredients aren't listed and only some of the nutritional information is there.  The individual bars do not have nutritional or ingredient lists either.  That information is confined to labels on the larger box these bars come in.  I'm vacillating between e3 and 4 stars, but going with 4 because the ingredients, once you find the list, are really good. [SEP] I can't describe the taste but it is really bad.  I could tell before I opened it, it was no longer a bar.  I was a bunch of tiny pieces.  I don't recommend it. [SEP] These have pretty nice ingredients and the calorie count, as a snack, isn't bad at all.  I just didn't care for the chocolate flavor at all as it tasted like bakers chocolate very unappetizing.  Oddly, when you bit into one you just keep chewing.  Seriously one bit felt like I was chewing for very very very long time.  The vanilla isn't as bad, to me, in taste.  Overall, these are okay but I don't know if would choose these first again. [SEP] These are pretty good.  I really love them, but my husband does not.  They are more so nuts and seeds tasting.  They are not very sweet at all.  They are a smaller size, but great for on the go.  I would like a little more flavoring but I still really enjoyed them. [SEP] These bars are made out of seeds, bunch of different seeds compressed into s bar. Similar to granola bar it can get a little messy but not as messy as granola. They are not too chewy considering it’s all seeds. I first had nutmeg and I could definitely tell there is coconut before reading the label. They are sweet but they are not sweet, it’s just the tease. They make me anticipate for more sweetness but it’s only 2g so it’s really just the hint. They do have 13grams of carbs though. Description here says 3g of carbs but the bar label says 13g of carbs. I don’t know which one is wrong. I am not overly impressed but I won’t dismiss these either. I suppose if I was following strict diet and these bars would fit in my diet plan I would get them but otherwise no. [SEP] I like the keto bars a lot.  They have a very natural taste thanks to the quality ingredients - lots of seeds, nuts, and other such natural items.  The fact that they use monk fruit instead of erythritol or stevia gives them a much more natural tasting sweetness.  The texture is chewy and nutty and the flavors are really good.  Good healthy keto snack! [SEP] These are pretty good.  I really love them, but my husband does not.  They are more so nuts and seeds tasting.  They are not very sweet at all.  They are a smaller size, but great for on the go.  I would like a little more flavoring but I still really enjoyed them.",3,True
Dental Duty Teeth Whitening Kit With 14 Non-Slip Strips & Whitening Accelerator Light For Perfectly White Teeth Even Faster,[],[],,4.1,51,816,"I ordered the 'Dental Duty Teeth Whitening Kit With 14 Non-Slip Whitestrips & Whitening Accelerator Light' for review.  I have had the opportunity to review several other whitening kits recently and this one by far has given my wife the best results.  She has completed six 20-minute sessions and already has had significant results.  Her additional thoughts:<br />• Compared to whitening pens or other trays, these are much easier to use.  You simply open the strips, place the larger strip on your top teeth and the smaller strip on your bottom teeth.  Be sure to get all the way down to your gums and press the strip to adhere closely to your teeth.  Then insert the light into the mouth tray and turn it on.<br />• The light has an automatic shut off at 10 minutes.  Just turn it back on once or twice dependent on the time you want to continue whitening.  I would not recommend nor does the instructions recommend any longer than a half hour.<br />• You do need to open the battery compartment to remove the paper between the two batteries to use it.<br />• The photos show her before pic along with after the first use and then after 6 uses.  The pictures were taken in the same spot in the house at the same time of day without a flash.<br />• Because these are strips versus a gel, you do not have anything draining into your mouth while you are whitening.  Once you turn off the light and remove the tray there is some saliva mixed with white foam.  She did not gag as much as with the gels.<br />• It may be too early to tell but, at this point this product has not caused any additional sensitivity to her teeth.<br />• This kit is less expensive then many other less comparable whitening kits.<br />Overall, my wife is happy with the results she has seen already.  She is looking forward to finishing a complete week. Once she does I will update my review with new after pictures. [SEP] While it didn't miraculously make my teeth as white as snow, it did make them a bit lighter. The instructions it comes with leave much to be desired. They are very vague. It comes with whitening strips packets, the light machine and silicone teeth mold. First thing to do, you have to open the battery holder. There is a paper disk between two flat batteries to prevent them from running out since the button on the top is so sensitive, small accidental touch will turn it on.<br /><br />The strips come in two sizes - short and long. I tried both sizes on both sets of teeth and determined that longer goes on the top teeth and the short one goes on the lower teeth. It would have been nice to have it confirmed in the instructions. The whitening cycle times vary from 30-45 minutes with the requirement not to eat or drink one hour afterwards. The whitening light machine shuts off every 10 minutes on the dot, as if to remind not to leave it in too long. First time my teeth felt tingly and slightly cool, but then nothing out of ordinary happened. Since it has to stay put in there for a while, the saliva that collects behind the teeth has to go somewhere. I swallowed it. It was not overly unpleasant with slight traces of something. It's ok whitening kit, but it does not perform miracle. [SEP] I've tried whitening strips before and they haven't worked for me. This one is like the ones you see in the ads which usually costs around $100 but this one is less than half that price! After the first use my teeth were whiter and within 5 uses, about 3 to 4 shades whiter, removing most of my stains! Love this product! [SEP] this is extremely easy to use and works great to clean and brighten partial and dentures [SEP] I like that this whitening kit is powerful and gentle and safe.  I used it and it made my teeth a little bit brighter.  i like the light it felt like it did speed up the whitening process.  I like that the whitening takes less than 30 minutes.  the strip stuck to my teeth so easily with no hassle.  i like that it didnt get pushed around by saliva.",3,True
"Best Earth Naturals Urinary Tract Complete Support Made with Cranberry, Milk Thistle, Pomegranate, Turmeric, Bromelain and More",[],[],,4.3,31,520,"Meh. Who knows if these really do anything or not. There's no way to tell. My problem is with the fact that cranberry is way down in the middle of the ingredients and thus there's not much of it. I'll pass. [SEP] Start taking these before it gets to the point where you have to be put on antibiotics to cure the infection. Go with natural products when you can. Cranberries are great for getting the urine going and the milk thistle is good for your liver. [SEP] I got this to keep my medicine cabinet stocked, and right after I received it in the mail, I developed a bladder infection.  Before it became a full-blown bladder infection, I felt an urgency and discomfort and began taking this supplement.  Of course, it did not and could not cure my bladder infection, however, it DID noticeably reduce the intensity of my symptoms.  After seeing the doctor and receiving antibiotics to treat the bladder infection, I continue to take these urinary support pills - one a day - and they seem to work to help alleviate a lot of the urgency and aching/pain while urinating, while the antibiotics fight off the infection.<br /><br />Since they appear to actually work - and fairly well - I would also recommend them as a supplement to help urinary tract health.  Just be sure to follow the directions on the label, and if you are on other medications you may wish to check with your doctor before taking these to avoid any potential interactions.  I love it and would definitely purchase these in the future, and recommend them to others. [SEP] I've always been prone to UTI's so have been steadfast in my pursuit of OTC products that include cranberry and turmeric.  It also has Tart Cherry with I also find helpful  This Best Earth product has just that.  For me it only take a small dose but on a regular basis to keep my problem under control.  I find the price point a little spendy for me to use regularly but they do seem to do the job.

"Organic Beet Powder by Terra Kai Organics | JUCE Beet Superfood Powder Made With 100% Pure Organic Beets | All Natural Nitric Oxide Supplement | Gluten Free, Soy Free, Vegan, Non GMO (240g)",['Item Weight : 240.0 grams'],[],26.99,4.1,51,42,"I give this a solid 4-stars because it contains lots of good ingredients and tastes reasonably good.  I thought it seemed to help my digestive system, but haven't taken it long enough to know for sure.  The only problem that I found with this is that it doesn't mix up really well in a glass of water.  You have to stir it quite a bit and you still seem to have small pieces and residue that doesn't mix in well.  This is the first time I have really tried a ""superfood"".  I tried the green one (vegetable mostly), but am thinking of also trying the red (more fruit, I assume).  For less money, you can probably buy fruits and veggies that will give you the same nutrition, but this may be more concentrated and probably a decent partial substitute for not eating correctly.  The only bad ingredient that I could see is that it contains some sugar. [SEP] If you don't really like eating sliced beets, this powder is a good solution to get the nutrients by adding it to a smoothie drink with other items. This product mixes well in a blender. Beets are good for lowering blood pressure and many other benefits.  Healthy alternative to eating beets. [SEP] Terra Kai Juce Greens Daily Superfood tastes better than the other green superfoods drinks I’ve tried. This dark green powder tastes surprisingly good just shaken with water. It tastes sweet and fruity and a little grassy with a slight stevia aftertaste. The powder dissolves well, and the texture isn’t too gritty even just shaken. This organic blend sounds comprehensive with prebiotics, probiotics, fiber, vitamins, an antioxidant blend, detox blend, immune support, enzymes, organic greens, grass and more. This does contain green tea and coffee bean, so it may have caffeine (I don’t know).  I can’t judge the purity or nutrition of this supplement, but it sounds healthy, agrees with me and it’s easy to drink. I like it a lot. 4.5 stars. [SEP] Latest research suggests that daily multivitamin pills are a waste of money, and do no measurable good for otherwise healthy Americans that don't need special supplements for medical reasons. Oh. Dang. What I do now is take these powered mixes as a simple insurance policy, giving me a wider mix of supplements at one go from what has to be a healthier non-chemical source than old multivitamins. Has prebiotics and probiotics, antioxidants and fiber.<br /><br />The taste is mostly sweet green apple, with no weird aftertastes or gross burps. The fine powder mixes quickly and easily. Seen no adverse reactions. Really like that it's vegan and certified organic made from US plants, not cooked up in some Chinese garage. Does it work? Well, I'm pretty sure it doesn't do everything they claim, but it is good ingredients and is my tasty easy insurance policy, replacing old multivitamins. Hope this helps. [SEP] Remains watery, barely tolerable taste. Not a fan. [SEP] I'm not a fan of the flavor of beets. They taste like dirt.<br /><br />I am, however, a fan of the nutritional value of beets.<br /><br />That's where this organic beet powder comes in handy.<br /><br />I can add this to my smoothies and get all of the nutrition without any of the beet flavor.<br /><br />I love that this is organic and there is only one ingredient. Beets.<br /><br />I use this powder in smoothies but you could get more nutrition into the family by adding this powder to soups and sauces.  They'll never know it's good for them.  :)<br /><br />This is a great product. 5 stars for sure.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful. [SEP] This Organic Beet Powder by Terra Kai Organics has lots of healthy things going for it and it tastes good too.  I find myself looking for a reason to add this great power to smoothies and drinks.  I really like the health benefits of beet powders and actually like the taste. Made in the USA with USDA sustainable ingredients too!  With 60 servings per container, this is affordable nutrition and would definitely recommend it! [SEP] I got the Reds and the Greens and now the whole family is on it!! We feel great!!!! I can't thank you enough!!!  The flavor on both is excellent!!! I add it to my Zero gatorade, my kids put it in water and I often catch them licking their finger and putting it in the containers...so we all have our own now LOL!!! My husband drinks his and then tries to drink mine...YES ITS THAT GOOD! Also the price is better and theres nothing in this we're allergic to unlike the more expensive ones they sell on TV, that are inferior to this product.  ENJOY!!! [SEP] When I juice in the evening I use an electrolyte liquid and add the perscribed amount.  Usually a berry flavor on the liquid.  It has this delicious berry flavor with a chocolate after taste that is like getting dessert with my fruit / veggie juice.  I'll continue with this. [SEP] Review for Organic Beet Powder by Terra Kai Organics | JUCE Beet Superfood Powder Made With 100% Pure Organic Beets | All Natural Nitric Oxide Supplement | Gluten Free, Soy Free, Vegan, Non GMO (240g)<br /><br />Great tasting beet root powder. Beautiful vibrant color, fragrant smell, and it taste delicious. I opted to use naturally flavored water. It mixes well, taste great, and jump starts my morning.

"Nail Clippers Set, Ultra Sharp Fingernail and Toenail Clipper Cutters with Visibly Tin Case by HAWATOUR - Silver",[],[],,4.1,53,524,"Well, I was not happy with this one.<br /><br />A large clipper and small clipper come packaged in a yellow tin. Presentation is about all this set has.<br /><br />There is a nice emery-type file on the back of the clipper. But the reason I do not like them is that they are not sharp, and don't cut the nail. Maybe I received a bad set. If so, they have quality-control issues. But I tried trimming a spot on one of my fingernails. It just chewed on it, never actually cutting it. I had to get out my own clippers and cut that nail shorter than I wanted to just to get rid of the snaggy spot these clippers created.<br /><br />Sorry, I cannot recommend these at any price. [SEP] These look quite classy with the brushed finish as opposed to the chrome plating on most clippers. The little tin is a nice touch. I’m definitely going to use that for something else. [SEP] These nail clippers work as expected and are strong. They come in a tin case with a protective foam. [SEP] These clippers clip nail very quickly and efficiently with leaving any jagged edges.  I still have to smooth the edges down some but I do that with all my nail clippers, not just these.  These come in a nice tin to store them in. [SEP] Within a yellow case made of metal, there resides this duo of fingernail/toenail clippers. They feel very durable to the touch, and they’re quite practical while in usage. I’m able to cut the nails on my feet/hands for a presentable appearance, and I would recommend this nail clippers set for anyone wishing to do the same. [SEP] These clippers are decent. They get the job done. However, I don't see what they offer for their price compared to the cheap clippers I got from a dollar store more than a decade ago. [SEP] It does the job but it is noticeably duller and harder to use than my old/original nail cutter. [SEP] Reviewing fingernail and toenail clippers was not something I could really get into, or talk about, but these are actually the most exceptional clippers I've ever used. I'm inspired! Well, enough to say something about this product.<br /><br />First, it comes in a lovely yellow tin, about the size of an Altoids box, but much less cheap. The brand name HAWATOUR, is center placed. The tin itself is a giftie, with strong hinges and a foam insert with cut indentations for each clipper to sit. And the clippers are very attractive with a nice smooth texture, but not like those cheap generic ones you see and probably have owned. Even on the base of each clipper, the brand name appears, apparent yet unobtrusive, a yellow ID blended in.<br /><br />As for its integrity--I'm impressed. The file part, instead of the usual clumsy and useless band, is set like an insert, and is far more effective at filing--is, in fact, quite effective. The cutters are really sharp, and extend a bit further out than the generic ones. They cut precisely and quickly. Holding the clippers feels almost ergonomic; the weight and leverage was given though in the design, so that the clippers work effortlessly.<br /><br />These would make great stocking stuffers or one of those White Elephant party gifts. You will not be disappointed! [SEP] These clippers work great for me.  I especially appreciate the ridges on the handle that help keep my thumb from slipping when clipping.  The smaller one is a great pocket size and the other one will be going in my travel toiletries bag.  I could have done without the tin, since I doubt I'd ever store them in that, but it could be repurposed for other items as the foam liner is easily removed. [SEP] This set of clippers does a fantastic job cutting through thicker nails. The blades are sharp and they make nice, clean cuts. The clippers are sturdy and durable, and the set is made to last several years. They wash well with water and air dry great. The cutting mechanism moves smoothly without hitching and these are easy to use. The only small complaint I had was in regards to the corners on the handles. In some positions, they had a tendency to be a bit uncomfortable to hold. It didn't affect performance of the clippers and was a small issue. I just wish they would have been rounded slightly.",3,True

This order comes with 5 pounds of each, packaged in plastic bags with resealable zip tops and a plastic scoop in each bag for measuring.<br />The products are good, seem comparable to what I usually buy at the grocery store. My only issue is the plastic. What I usually buy comes in cardboard boxes. Since I make a lot of detergent at one time, the boxes are emptied and discarded. For me, having a resealable bag isn’t necessary. It’s also not necessary I get a plastic scoop in each bag. I use measuring cups; don’t need a scoop. I’m trying to make an effort to cut down on the amount of plastic I bring into the house, so would prefer to see this packaged in cardboard.<br />Otherwise, I’m very happy with the quality of the product. [SEP] Liked the earth friendly packaging and wooden spoon. I made homemade dishwasher tabs with this as an ingredient. It worked great:) [SEP] This duo is really convenient & versatile. A monthly trip to town is usually an all day affair for me. My truck ends up loaded to the brim with little room for the passengers. Being as rural as I am, ordering online & very often from amazon is so very convenient & time saving.<br /><br />I make my own soap, including bar soap. Washing soda & borax are part of the diy dish/laundry soap process. I also dye my own angora rabbit wool & feathers using plant based dyes, including indigo. Washing soda is part of the indigo dying method I use. Borax is a great laundry booster esp. with those little Eco friendly washing sheets. I find most of those brands need a good booster to really get my Eco farm families clothes properly clean. Borax is also great for getting rid of ants (if you choose to do this & have pets, you need to take precautions - please research it first so you don't accidentally harm your pets - short answer is to make sure your pets don't have access to the borax). [SEP] I think this has just made my laundry routine pretty expensive. The seller did just fine, but I will be shopping for a cheaper alternative.  Washing soda is for real. What a difference! [SEP] I’ve bought this to use as a laundry booster and it works very well. Especially for hand washing my delicates they turn out soft and particularly clean. A little goes a long way and the scoop is super cute which makes the chore of laundry a little more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend. [SEP] We live in the country with a septic system, so we don’t put harsh chemical laundry detergents down the drain. I have a couple of “green” detergents I like and I augment them with borax and washing soda.<br /><br />I like this combination pack  –  5 lbs. each of borax and soda.<br /><br />It’s working for us. [SEP] I am used to using a well known brand for my washing soda/borax and this by far works so much better than my pricey one.<br />I love that this doesn’t clump eventhough the humidity kicks in. It’s very easy to use and helps with my washing!<br />If you have a very active family this is such a nice addition coz it helps with cleaning and keeping it fresh scent.<br />Will definitely buy more! [SEP] I did a mold test and found out I probably have some mold in my HVAC system and so before moving I washed all my laundry with my regular detergent that also added some of this to help get any possible mold spores or particles out of my belongings.

They're no especially large but they dissolve quickly with a satisfying amount of fizz.  They'd make a perfect gift but I kept them for myself.  I honestly couldn't tell one scent from another with these but none of them had an offensive strong odour.

They smell heavenly and come in a super cute, fancy packaging. Definitely recommended."" [SEP] Nicely packaged bath bombs, arrived in great condition. Smell great.

They smell wonderful just in the box. There are several different scents, but they blend together while all together. This is nice since I place my bath bombs in a little basket on my bathroom countertop. They are also very pretty, so they display nicely. The scent isn’t overwhelming though. When in the water, the scent is subtle, which is my preference.<br /><br />They are on the small at just a little over 2 ounces, but they aren’t a weak bath bomb.

Herb Essential Moringa Powder (Wild Grown) - 100 g,[],[],,4.7,26,308,"Moringa is so nutritionally dense that it's referred to as the ""miracle tree"". This powder is easy to stir into drinks, drink as tea, or add to smoothies. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] I like to take moringa for the overall benefits. It is considered a superfood vegetable, is high in antioxidants, and essential amino acids. I usually do powder but sometimes it's more convenient to take a capsule. This one is good to mix in with my smoothies. It mixes best in a bottle with a lid to shake. Goes well with juice and you could barely taste much difference, maybe just a little greener tasting. I like that this one is organic, wild grown, and free of other ingredients/fillers. Price is very reasonable too (just under $8) [SEP] I’ve had Moringa tea before.<br />It’s been in the leaf form and in a sachet with an herbal tea.<br />It tasted great and I wanted to reproduce at home.<br />This Moring - as it’s listed - is in a powder form. It’s a very fine powder.<br />I was hoping to be able to add it to my tea and just stir it in.<br />I was able to get some Moringa powder to dissolve into my tea - but not all.<br />This powder is fresh and adds an earthy taste when used.<br />The bag has 100gms. It’s recommended to use 5gms a day.  I figured out that there is about 5gms in 1 tsp. I wish this contained a scoop in the bag so I wouldn’t have needed to figure it out on my own.<br />This Moringa powder would taste good and mix well in a smoothie. I think it would taste  good especially in a green smoothie - the Moringa would compliment the taste of spinach and/or kale.<br />I received this powder 12/2019, it was manufactured 10/2019 and it doesn’t expire until 09/2021.<br />Be careful when closing the resealable bag - the powder is very thin and can get in the zip closure making it difficult to make a full seal. [SEP] Moringa powder is known for it's anti-oxidant properties, is an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal, also may help with cardiovascular problems and improve brain health.  I put some in a smoothie and couldn't taste it.  This Moringa powder seems to be very good quality and finely ground. [SEP] I am committed to moringa as important supplement for good health and I like this powdered version. I do like to pump up my fruit smoothies and this blends in well. It turns it green, of course, but I don't mind that. I add vanilla whey protein powder and some honey, so any taste this might add is negligible. It appears to be very fresh and green, instead of dried, and that gives me confidence that what I'm getting is of high quality. I'm very pleased with this product and intend to continue using it. Recommended! [SEP] This moringa is a good quality, authentic and packaged well. It's a bit pricey for the quantity, but if you aren't sure you'll like it, it's a good try out size package. I love it, I put it in my smoothies and feel as though it really increases the nutrient value and the over-all health effects of the smoothie. It's flavorful, not too bitter but I add a little stevia to my smoothies anyway because I put lemon and salt in there too, so that can be awful without some sweat.  If you stir it right into warm tea or something, it doesn't blend easily but in a blender, in s smoothie it's mixed in easily. You can put it in tea or capsules. I love moringa. Great sustained energy. [SEP] I love natural things for health over any doctors ( Unless it’s something Serious! Haha!) and Moringa Powder is a Superfood for healthy benefits and it’s really affordable. It’s high in Antioxidants like Vitamins, Minerals and Amino Acids. It’s said to help lower Cholesterol, fight Free Radicals, helps with Diabetes and much more.<br />  Everyone needs green leafy Veggie’s in their diets and this is a great way to help with that. I highly recommend you all give it a try. It’s easy to just take a scoop of it and add it to a cool drink; just experiment, have Fun and get healthier! [SEP] Nicely packaged, which I think preserves the freshness of the powder. I like the aspect that it's 'wild grown' organic, and cruelty-free. The certifications are assuring. I've ingested moringa powders from different brands,  in capsule form and pure powder. This package seemed a bit more bitter, which was definitely noticeable. I used it alone, and then I added it to a mixture that included maca, spinach, beet and kale powders. The bitterness was less apparent, obviously. Of course it's impossible to assess the efficacy after a few days, even after weeks...So, I won't even try to offer any speculations.<br />I think that the taste will not be a factor after daily use, which was the case of other powders that I ingest. I will continue to use this product, and the aspects of certifications, being organic and 'wild grown' will encourage me to purchase this brand.<br />So, in all fairness, I'd currently rate it at 3 - 3.5 stars. [SEP] I'd heard about Moringa years ago from a friend of mine but didn't want to be roped into the sell-this-on-Facebook scheme that was brewing there. S I was excited when I saw this on Amazon and could try it... without having to hawk it online!<br /><br />This powder is superfine and mixes fairly well. I put it in water with some lemon juice to off-set the spinach-y flavor of the powder. There's maybe a little residue left, but I tend to shake it before I take a drink so it doesn't get wasted. I don't feel like I get a big boost of energy from it, but it does make me feel more alert and focused. I was really hoping it would boost my hair growth, because mine is not great, but I suppose that might take a longer usage period than a few weeks!<br /><br />Overall, the flavor can be a bit off-putting, but it does provide great health benefits which I definitely like! A worthwhile supplement! [SEP] Known as the ""drumstick tree,"" ""miracle tree,"" and ""tree of life"" in its native India and Nepal, Moringa has as many aliases as it does scientifically backed benefits. It's nutrient-packed, It's a super source of plant-based protein, It can help your __ life,  It can balance hormones, It protects the liver, It fights free radicals, It fights inflammation,  It balances blood sugar, It improves digestion, It supports brain health. All these benefits in a few grams of this super food. Just put it in water or add it to your smoothie!!!",3,True

These provide the best comfort of anything I’ve tried so far, and they stay on easily. Great product! [SEP] At first I thought these were not going to work on the metatarsalgia I have on one foot.  I used one on each foot to make sure I was balanced.  I tried them out under my socks walking around my house.  Way too slippery-like.  My feet were squishing and my steps felt unsure - I was like uh-oh.  But then I decided to give them a real try walking around anyway so stuck my socked feet in sneakers and away I went.<br /><br />At first you think your feet are sliding around - but actually my feet were not moving at all within my shoe - but the ball area was definitely very squishy.  That area feels like it is moving but it really isn't.  It is a weird feeling to get used to - but after you do you realize your feet are secure.<br /><br />The best part - I had NO pain on the affected foot!  WOW!  I walk a lot, though.  Usually at least 4 miles every day - so I will see how these last.  A few pair come in the package - so that is helpful.  So long as I get a bit of use out of each pair - we should be good to go.  Plus it isn't a constant condition of mine - but when it acts up it REALLY hurts.  So far these really help!  If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.  Thanks! : ) [SEP] so i instantly felt a difference when i put these on. my feet feels amazing when walking now [SEP] I really like the idea of this product, but it just doesn't work. When I tried this with booties, sneakers, heels, flats and with no shoes here is what I experienced - when wearing booties/boots - my foot would slide around with this gel cushion. I had my socks over my foot and this product, so it shouldn't have moved as much, but it did. Have you ever tried walking with your feet kind of moving back and forth or side to side in any of your shoes? Yea, me neither. So this was an uncomfortable experience. This happened in booties, heals, healed booties, wedges. When wearing sneaker, tennis shoes, flats - these gel pads moved a lot less as there is less friction and pressure on the toe area, BUT it did not work well with all flats (pointy, almond toe, or that have petite noses instead of elongated noses). Did it help relieve pressure and pain? Kind of? It is very jelly, so it creates an extra cushion barrier between the toes and that part of the foot and the shoes you are wearing. If you are on your feet a lot or all day this isn't the best product to help minimize impact, paint and pressure. This also causes your footsies to presperate and sweat because the product is gel-like and the feet inside already a closed shoe are not extra contained with something that doesn't allow a lot of breathability. Yes there are those holes in the product for that breathability, but it just doesn't quite work the way I was hoping it would. [SEP] Now this product is worth it protects both sides of your feet it makes life a lot easier [SEP] Very useful when wearing flip flops for ball of foot,stays snug and doesn’t move around!! [SEP] Best product for relieving neuroma pain [SEP] I am on my feet for 12 hr at work. These pads provided extra cushion, felt super soft and very comfortable at work. I have pain in the ball of my feet and I finally have some relief. The pads are thin so they can be worn with any shoe comfortably. [SEP] This pad is thicker and connects to all of your toes to space them out and hold it in place.  It lasts much longer than the thin pads I tried.  It will later tear at the edge.  I am happy with the life and comfort.  This might last two weeks. [SEP] The product came fast and was as expected. There are 3 pair that comes in the pack. They fit very well and were comfortable to wear. The product does not come with instructions inside the box nor does the box itself have instructions on it on how to properly put them on making sure they are in the right place under your foot.  I do like them as they helped me discover why I was having foot pain in the metatarsal area. I believe I have been shifting my body weight forward leaving less pressure on the heel of the foot. These help me to realize that I need to shift my weight to keep pressure off the front of my feet. I do not wear them long and have not tried them on with shoes. I have only worn them while barefoot around the house on hardwood floor. they are comfortable yet I do feel pressure under the metatarsal area it does not make it hurt worse in the front of my foot but I can feel the pressure on the heels of my feet which make them tired if I am standing for a long time such as cooking and washing/cleaning the kitchen. Since wearing them they has been some improvement with the pain under the metatarsal area. I can also now feel where the pain starts from and travels down to the  front of my feet. It is more my left foot than my right. Although I have only worn them part time they definitely helped me with my standing posture as far as shifting my weight in the right direction. I moved them in different locations under my foot trying to be sure they are in the right spot based on internet searches that provided visual illustrations. It would be helpful if the packaging came with instructions on how to properly placed them on your feet. However the product fit well and they did not roll up or become out of place while wearing them. I have had the foot pads for less then 30 days",3,True

Tried it a few times and gives you a nice jolt to kickstart your day, help you through the grind or pump you up for an excercise. I use mine before and during my bike rides. Also with caffeine to give you that buzz. Nice! [SEP] This is one of the better initial tasting post-workouts I have tried. Yes, there is that BCAA aftertaste that happens with nearly every supplement. However, in this one it is not as pronounced. I otherwise really enjoy the flavor of this After Party.<br /><br />Without this it is more like a hangover, so it's a great play on words with the product name. This does keep things going and has kept me from crashing or otherwise being sore. Unlike many other post-workouts, this one has caffeine in it as well. That is a nice thing to have to keep things flowing for another half hour or so after finishing a workout.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this based on the ingredients alone, and would further recommend it on the fact that it works. I'll give a five star recommendation to anyone who can figure out the after taste plus give me the ingredients and impact of a great intra or post workout supplement. [SEP] Remember Pixy Stix? Then you pretty much know how this stuff tastes. It's sweet and tart. Your mouth should pucker at least a little bit. That being said, I don't particularly like that feeling anymore. I would prefer something more on the ""true"" lemonade side of flavor. However, it's not totally problematic, and the energy kick is exactly as advertised. Well worth the buy if you still have your childhood sweet tooth. [SEP] For the price you can beat it but I'm going back to my brand because it is lacking on the caffeine but you can't beat it for the price if you're not addicted to caffeine buy this  buy this!!!!! [SEP] A couple of things I like about this.  No niacin flush, not so much caffeine that will make you run up a wall.  Tastes pretty good, and doesn't have that funky taste most pre workout drinks have. [SEP] I tried a pre-workout from this brand awhile back and really loved it.  I was excited to try the BCAA as I use one everyday even on my off days.  They are great for recovery.<br /><br />This tastes great and mixes really easily.  I always use a pre-workout before my workouts, so I wish they would have left out the added caffeine.  It is a smaller dosage, but not something I personally love in my BCAA.  I drink these during my workouts.  I will definitely use this on days when I use less pre-workout or on my off days when I need a little extra boost.<br /><br />I really like them though and hope to try more flavors. [SEP] This legit seems to work, the flavor is strong but tasty. We bought this 10 times at $16. Last batch had some moisture get in and it crystallized a bit but no worries, still works great. Husband's fav. [SEP] Admittedly, I did not get this with the specific intention of using it after working out, but as a way to help hydrate from hangovers lol we've used pedialyte in the past and it's pretty effective so we figured something like this could work well with the added benefit of caffeine. My husband tried it first and said the flavor was horrible and good luck to me when I tried it. Maybe he gave me low expectations or something but I actually really liked the flavor lol I thought it tasted like a melted otterpop! I think he'll end up powering through it but for me it was much more enjoyable. [SEP] Not many workout drinks taste good.

Comes with 3 attachments and a brush. A nice bag for travel and it’s lightweight. You can adjust the wind speed and the temperature. I really like how my hair looks after I use this and it dries my hair faster than my old one. What I hate is the buttons to change the temp and the wind speed are right where I hold on to it,  so as I’m using it I accidentally reset it.  I’m constantly changing it back to where I want it. Another problem is my hair keeps getting sucked into the back and it hurts.  I kinda miss the button that blasts cold air that was on my old dryer. [SEP] This is the best hair dryer! It gets really hot if you need it like I do. My hair is very thick, coarse and coily. The attachments of my old dryer popped off all of the time. I didn't think the comb attachment was going to be useful since the teeth are so short, but the way it's angled, it worked surprisingly effectively! It puts out A LOT of air, but it's very lightweight. It is comfortable so my hand didn't fatigue like I was used to. I did accidently turn off the unit a few times when first using it because of where the on button is located, but I adjusted. Love the carrying bag and the brush is REALLY nice too!

Prices fluctuate, there are coupons, everyone has different budgets, preferences, and so on. You decide if it is worth it. This is actual silk and there is a price tag that goes with it.

This is for those that want actual silk (RIP silkworms).  That being said, I have used a wide variety of eye masks of different materials and styles. Here is my take on this:<br /><br />It feels light and lush. Very soft and silky. I am privvy to the look, feel, performance of various textiles including various silk levels. This is 25 momm and feels like it. I dont question that at all.<br /><br />Silk is nice for any skin, but is particularly gentle on delicate skin or skin easily irritated. It is breathable, and it doesnt dehydrate already dry skin. I notice that my skin is less parched when I use silk versus low end polyester. That is material that is smashed up against my skin for 8 hours each night. I would prefer to not have material that is rough and drags against my skin. Same can be said for pillow cases and my hair. Though I do keep other styles at my bedside, I always come back to silk.  I happened to be in need of another real silk mask because I accidentally washed and dried my trusty silk mask and it shrunk significantly (note to self: hand wash, air dry.).<br /><br />The fit is good for me. Generous size which is nice for my wide face and big nose. Plenty of elastic and the adjustment option allows it to be as loose or snug as I desire. I find that it blocks light from every angle. I normally dont mind a little light to seep through so long as I dont notice while my eyes are closed. But this blocks it all out for me. I had to lift an edge to see if the tv was still on (my hubs will watch tv in bed with sound off/captions on). I couldnt tell. Come morning, I pushed the mask up a little so as not to accidentally sleep all day.<br /><br />Not hot. Some masks really trap heat. This is breathable. Again, function of the material used. Of course any material can block light. So it comes down to your needs and preferences.<br /><br />Nicely packaged<br /><br />At time of review, this was $35 with 30% coupon. While I dont rate on price (except for in the rate features section, which I give 3 stars), I will comment that $35 is the ceiling for nearly all 22-25 momme silk eye masks. If you can get it in the 20 something range, then that is reasonable. [SEP] A soft sleeping mask. Feels very nice while wearing. Not tight or constricted feeling while wearing. [SEP] This came in such cute packaging and felt so luxurious being wrapped in this paper. The silk is so soft and smooth on my skin. I love that the strap is adjustable! The color is spot on to the product picture, but my camera makes it look more olive-y than dark apple green.<br /><br />This is my first time using a silk sleep mask, and I ordered this to protect my eyes while I’m sleeping because I’m a side sleeper and my partner doesn’t like satin pillowcases. I slept so well, and was actually able to sleep in due to not being woken up by the morning light!<br /><br />It’s definitely worth the price- the quality is amazing, and it looks so expensive. I want one in every color (: [SEP] First, I think this would make an excellent gift for anyone on your list who sleeps. Research shows that even small amounts of light in a room while sleeping can trick your brain into unhealthy sleep patterns and restless nights. And with every electronic gizmo in the world these days emitting some kind of light, a ""dark room"" can end up being not that dark (I am talking to you Alexa-with-a-display). For that reason I sleep with an eye mask to make sure that all my peepers see is... nothing.<br /><br />As a gift the presentation of this silk eye mask is nice. It definitely comes through as a luxury gift in a fancy box.<br /><br />But I can't imagine spending $35 on this for myself. It's no softer than the polyester eye mask it is replacing.<br /><br />I did notice that my head size resulted in needing to extend the adjustable strap almost to its limit. I don't think my head is that large, really, so this may not fit a very large person.<br /><br />If you have money you don't need, I think you'll find this eye mask is an excellent way to lighten some of that load. [SEP] I've tried out a variety of sleep masks, and while I have yet to find the perfect one, this is one of the nicer ones that I've tried. It is thicker than any of the other sleep masks that I've tried, and it does sit pretty well on my face. With some of the thinner ones, they cave in a bit, sitting too close to my eyes. That's not an issue with this one. I do like that the added thickness makes this a softer mask to wear. I wouldn't say that I found it necessarily more comfortable, but it was a nice added touch.<br /><br />The big thing for me with this one is that while it is thicker than the other sleep masks that I've tried, it doesn't block out light any better than most of the eye masks that I've tried. Because of that, I can't justify the $44 price tag when most of the sleep masks I've gotten are in the $10 or less range and are nearly as good as this one in my opinion. [SEP] My bedroom is very bright in the morning and I love to wake up to that, so when I want to go back to sleep I put something over my eyes. I was excited about getting this (free, through the Vine program). Figured it would be perfect. Not for me, unfortunately. Too bad, as it would make a lovely (though perhaps naughty seeming) gift. It comes in a lovely box and it feels heavenly on. So soft!<br /><br />However, the size and shape of it are really off, at least for me. For reference, I have a small and rather narrow face. That’s why it is surprising that it’s a bit too narrow for me. Also, the notch for the nose is very shallow and because of that light gets in from the bottom. It simply does not fit my face properly. It’s good enough, but if you want solid darkness it is doubtful you will get it. Perhaps it will fit someone who has a flatter nose? I don’t know. But because of this I can not recommend this otherwise lovely product.",3,True

The first scent I smelled when using this is Cherry, which is not my favorite.<br />I like Almond better, but the scent does not last long.<br /><br />This is not a greasy lotion. It goes into my skin ,my legs and hands have been very dry, and my other lotions<br />Where not helping much.<br />But this Mountain Falls seems to help to soften my hands, and the do look better in a short time.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of some of the ingredients in this,  so I was surprised my hands do not look so old After using this a few<br />times a day.<br /><br />Came nicely packaged and no leaks, but The trouble I had with this bottle was getting the pump to come up ,so<br />I could use this..not deducting for that. [SEP] This has a very nice cherry almond scent.  As soon as i opened the box, I instantly recognized the scent.  It didn't spill or anything and i'm not quite sure why the box smelled but it's nice.  I really like this brand.  This is not my first lotion from them.  This lotion absorbs instantly.  My one pet peeve is putting lotion on and having greasy hands.  I can't stand it and over the years have thrown out expensive lotions because of it.  This absorbs into my skin instantly.  I'm currently wearing a brace on my  knee and from all day wearing it, my skin is extremely dry when I take it off and I put this on and no more dry skin.  The pump is nice and works well.  If you put this on right after a shower, you will smell the cherry during the day especially if you sweat or get overheated.  I really like this scent and of course really like this lotion.  It reminds me very much of Aveeno.  For a long time, Aveeno was my lotion of choice.  It didn't make my hands greasy and absorbs and it is a nice product but this one is just like it and for less.  I really think this is a great lotion.  If you don't like greasy hands or skin and like Aveeno, try this one [SEP] I'm fond of this lotion. It's definitely a good alternative to Jergans for dry skin. I usually use lotion on my feet, especially in winter, and I'm getting comparable results to standard Jergens. I also really like the scent of this lotion -- it's pleasant, but a little stronger than I like. [SEP] This lotion smells exactly like the old classic Jergen’s.  I had a flashback to my fifth grade teacher who slathered the stuff on by the gallon.  The consistency is similar, too.  It leaves hands nice and soft, and provides a bit of a moisture barrier if you’re washing your hands frequently.  Very nice.<br /><br />I keep this on the kitchen sink, and am really enjoying both the lotion and the nostalgia. [SEP] Smells yummy, absorbs quickly, and doesn't feel greasy or heavy. Plus the bottle is nicer than many standard lotion bottles. Definitely a fan! [SEP] Wonderful strongly-scented lotion - beautiful!  A real cherry-almond scent...and the cost is 1/2 or less of the name brand.  Great value! [SEP] As soon as I removed the top from the bottle of Mountain Falls Lotion, Classic Scent, I realized where it got that name.  The scent takes me back to when I was a kid and everyone used the lotion brand that Mountain Falls uses in their website page comparison, Jergens.  The aroma is pretty strong in the bottle, but once I smoothed the cream on my arms and legs, the scent dissipated quite a bit.  The lotion absorbs well so there's not feeling of greasiness or stickiness.  This is a very pleasant, very economical choice. [SEP] This creamy body lotion is delightful and softens the skin. Its aroma is more than pleasant. [SEP] This is a good lotion that absorbs well and leaves skin feeling soft. The fragrance is similar to Jergens original; a cherry-almond scent. I think this is a bit stronger smelling than the Jergens, though. I deducted a star simply because the fragrance is overpowering to me.  Other than that, the performance of the lotion is good. [SEP] I usually use Lubriderm (though I sometimes use cheap no-brands as well) so I'll be comparing this to those brands. The first thing you notice about this is that the cherry scent is really quite potent when you first apply it. To me, this was the greatest weak point as it smells not of the flesh of cherries, but of a pit which is going off a bit. The almond scent isn't present at all. However, the scent doesn't linger after application and you really only smell it when you first rub it in.<br /><br />I used this as an all-over body lotion after showering given that it's economical and in a large bottle so I used it on my legs, arms, neck, and hands. I did find that it did a solid job keeping my legs from getting flaky, dry skin on them (which I'm prone to) as well as my arms. It didn't go the distance on my hands, but I do wash them a lot and wear rubber gloves about a dozen times a day (stripping them on and off dries out the skin). I don't think this is potent for hands, but it's certainly decent for more average use.<br /><br />As someone else said, it's hard to get the top to pop up when you first open it (very hard). I guess this is supposed to help it not leak during shipping, but the truth is that mine leaked a little into the bag it was in anyway (I don't know how). The lotion goes on smoothly and isn't greasy. It absorbs well. For me, I found this to be a good “all around” type of lotion.<br /><br />Pros: absorbs well and not greasy, economical, moisturizes well over the long run<br />Cons: cherry smell is off-putting, hard to open pump",3,True

I could tell a difference when I took it off after wearing it all day. But I don't know how often I should wear it and for how long I should be wearing it at a time and when I can expect results. I answered a lot of questions about, what are you wearing, but I think I could wear this under a blazer and be able to wear it to work all day long.

[SEP] I was really hoping this brace would help with my bad posture, but apparently it was made for real small people, I wear a XL shirt and there was no way the Velcro straps were going to hook up.<br />  So I had to buy some Velcro extensions so the straps would hook up...but even then it felt awkward to wear, they even give you some extra padding to help, but its still very uncomfortable to wear for more than 15 minutes at a time, which doesn't do me any good at all.<br />  all I can report is that one size does not fit all and this one is not very comfortably either. [SEP] I have noticed that as I have spent more time in a sedate and idle desk chair (IT consultant)  job that I am starting to hunch over so I got this to try and reverse that problem.  Obviously, I could do exercises and similar to address the problem but see the first sentence as to why that is not going to work. I have started wearing this when sitting at said desk job and at first I could only do so for an hour or so, over time I have been increasing that so I hope that indicates progress butI cannot be sure.  While I am not sure this is a long term improvement regardless I am hopeful.<br /><br />**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review. [SEP] Definitely does the job. Not the most comfortable under the arms [SEP] I really really like this brace. The fabric is lightweight and breathable & easily washable. Easy to put on and adjust. It’s improved my posture and back pain (I work in an office and am at a desk most the day). I highly recommend it! [SEP] I got this to wear throughout the day to supplement some PT I’m having for some shoulder/scapula issues.<br />Except it’s impossible to get on & reach behind to grab the straps. There’s no instructions as to best steps: put it on low, like a shirt with sleeves? Over your head? Either way, the straps pull out & leave me with no length to grab as the pictures show.<br /><br />For reference, I’m 5’8”, 140 lbs. with a decent degree of coordination!<br />I’m also very leery of a company claiming “FDA Approved” that has an info sheet with common word misspellings & improper grammar. And part of the black print on top of a black picture, so unreadable.<br />Total bust.<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this review & I hope that it’s Helpful!) [SEP] Well constructed. Helps with shoulder issues after tendon/nerve damage after removal of cancerous tumors. [SEP] I'm a bit big to try this out and have decent posture anyway, so I had my friend put it on today.  I ordered it with her in mind as she'd been complaining of shoulder pain.  She'd had rotator cuff surgery not too long ago, and the pain was back.  She had problems sleeping on her side with the pain.  I mentioned this to her and she said her doctor has told her about similar devices that helped maintain posture.  I've ordered and used compression straps for my forearms to alleviate and allow healing for tennis elbow, so I know how a little support helps.  Anyway, she tried it on and said she immediately felt two inches taller.  The support was there and it helped with the pain immediately.  The device came with two pads, but didn't have any explanation for them.  I thought they might be shoulder pads, but later read on the product page they were for the arm pits.  They wrap around and velcro the strap there so it doesn't make that area tender.<br /><br />I think the best thing about this she thought besides the support and pain relieve was how light it is.  She is still working and on her feet all day inspecting electronic components for a local firm with government contracts for critical plane parts.  With this she can wear under her clothes and maintain good posture all day working while her muscles heal.  Thus avoid the bad things of taking NSAID painkillers and other things that become chronic problems instead of solutions.  Going on her experience, I recommend this device, it's inexpensive and does it's job well. [SEP] On the pics and videos it’s seems to be smaller than it really is.

Priced fair too [SEP] I love flavored waters or waters with vitamins, so I’m always excited to try a new kind. This one fell a little short for me on flavor - I liked the lemon flavor but the drink tasted a little too much like sweetener, which I personally don’t love.

There is no way I can justify that price with all the benefits it lists. I just don't see it being accurate.

I'm not really sure how else to explain it, but it lacks the refreshing or tangy notes you would expect for a citrus flavored drink. It's also a weak flavor, so not much comes through enough to realize identify it. In a blind taste test, I would not have guessed orange.

The things I like: It’s lightweight, can use wet or dry, comes with a type C charging port and cable, has a storage bag and cleaning brush and it doesn’t pull on hair like many electric shavers do. The things I don’t like: The big size and sideways facing shaver head is awkward and bulky, the lubricating strip is dry, so I need to use my own lubricant on my skin and the blades don’t give a close shave. This all adds up to a very average electric shaver, but not getting a close shave and being very awkward for me to use are two big negatives, so this shaver gets 2 STARS. [SEP] This seems like a revolution or complete reinvention of electric razors for women.  (Of course, it is telling my age to say that my first one was used in the 1960s, but boy, razors have come a long way.) This one can be used as soon as it arrives, before you even finish charging it, because the charger cord is long enough to permit flexibility of use while charging.  It comes with a type C power cable, but you will need your own type C charger (which I fortunately already have several of). The shaving head easily follows the curves of my legs. The body of the charger is longer, sleeker, and much advanced ergonomically-speaking than the short square-shaped ones of my past. There is a cleaning brush and a carrying case.  I am totally satisfied. [SEP] It's noticeably worse at removing hairs than other shavers my wife has used, and that kind of puts it in the ""not often used"" bin. Requires multiple passes and even then leaves stubble.<br /><br />It's easy to charge, relatively waterproof, feels good to hold in hand, and looks nice. But all of that is worth little if the performance is bad here. The aloe strip was also very mediocre. [SEP] So I’ve used this on my legs, it cuts long hairs but not all the way.. afterwards the hairs were too short to feel smooth (spiky) and too long to be cut. Didn’t really like the aftermath of using it. [SEP] This razor works great on my underarms and my legs. This is good because that is what I wanted it for.  It works okay on my facial hair but sometimes it leaves stubble. The charge lasts a long time. I charged it using my computer it was fully charged in about 45 minutes.  The razor is easy to grip which is good because I have arthritis in my hand. It's pretty good. [SEP] This Phorra electric razor came well packaged in a box with the instruction manual, a small cleaning brush, an usb charging cable, razor cover and a storage bag.<br /><br />I was excited to get this razor as it can be used wet or dry. I also have sensitive skin so I was ecstatic that it was equipped with aloe strips as well. The ergonomic handle made it easy to hold and use. It also arrived fully charged so I was able to test it out right out of the box.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was so disappointed that it didn’t effectively remove all the fine hairs from my legs or armpits while showering. I just had visible patches of  hair & stubbles remaining even after going over those areas numerous times.<br /><br />However, I had better results while my skin was dry. The razor did painlessly remove the finely sparse hairs from my arms though. But again, it did leave some hair stubbles as it’s unable to get a close shave with this electric razor.<br /><br />Having said that, it just didn’t work as expected so I can’t recommend this razor. [SEP] I like this shaver. Although it takes a few passes with this shaver, when using it on my legs, I found that it does provide a pretty close shave - I admit that I don't expect one of these electric shavers to provide as close a shave as a razor - but this was pretty close.  I found it comfortable to hold and very quiet. It does come charged and ready for use.<br /><br />There's no indication of the battery life, though it states that a full charge will last an hour.<br /><br />I'm not sure why they included two aloe lubricating strips, which you typically find on many razors. They can't be refilled so after they are empty (which the instructions say they typically last 2 months), you can't refill them (though they recommend using shower gel or moisturizing soap). I didn't find that they provided much if any lubrication.<br /><br />Overall, a decent ladies shaver. [SEP] I ordered this electric razor for my wife. The initial impression is that it is a sturdy, well made product. It feels good in the hand and is easy to hold when wet. My wife, however, had the following blistering things to say:<br /><br />- It takes multiple passes just to cut some of the hair. The razor leaves so much stubble that it is necessary to shave with a regular razor anyway. So why bother with this product? She tried using shaving cream and soap and never got an acceptable result.<br /><br />- The shave head is at an awkward angle. It works well for some situations, but for others it is very problematic. Even the product listing has the model ""holding"" the photo-shopped-in razor in an odd way.<br /><br />This product is a dud. [SEP] I ordered this to save time and water in the shower using a razor. Unfortunately, it did not work at all. I tried it on my leg with minimal stubble and after going over them a few times, the hair was still there.<br /><br />I removed the blade to see if any hair was inside and there was not any visible. When I tried to replace the blade, the plastic cracked as shown in the picture.<br /><br />The only positives about this product are<br />-it charged quickly<br />-the aloe strip did soften my leg<br />-the handle is comfortable to grip<br /><br />I would not recommend. [SEP] Has no progress been made in powered razors since I was a teen? I liked the idea that this could be used wet or dry, and I've gotten so used to hand razors that I figured that perhaps powered razors have turned a corner. But, no. This one still acts like ones from the 1980s. It didn't remove all the hair as advertised. I had to keep going over some of the more unobtrusive or smaller hairs. Finally, I just got my razor and took care of it.<br /><br />This, to me, is like those generic ones girls take to summer camp; it works ok, not great, nothing to write home about. I was not impressed, and will probably get rid of it soon, and just keep using my razor.",3,True

The remote on the tripod triggers the camera shutter by sending a signal to change the volume of your phone. That means to use the remote, you have to have a camera app that lets you take a picture by pressing the volume button on your phone.

(And don't forget that you can trigger the shutter on many camera apps by saying ""cheese,"" ""smile,"" etc.)<br /><br />The remote runs on a coin battery, CR1632. The box says it's replaceable.<br /><br />It was crazy easy to pair the remote with my phone. I turned on the remote by holding the button down for a bit, turned on Bluetooth on my phone, scanned for devices and tapped ""SelfieCom"" when it came up. Done! (To turn off the remote you hold the button down until it stops blinking.)<br /><br />The hardest part of setup is actually getting the phone into the clamp and adjusting it. It's hard to line it up so you can access all the buttons and not cover any cameras or anything. I wanted to use the back camera for pictures for a review, but I accidentally closed the clamp on the power button, couldn't get it off again for many seconds, and rebooted my phone. Review deleted :( My fault but man, really? It's like a snapping turtle.<br /><br />You can put the phone into the clamp face up or face down, but if you want to angle the back camera down toward the ground (like if you want to take a back-camera photo showing an item from above), you have to put the phone in the clamp backwards so that the clamp covers part of the the screen. You can't tip the phone both forward and backward. It only tips forward because it's designed for selfies. (Like you can adjust it up and down to get pics of any part of your body, but you can't flip it over to get pics view of someone in front of you.) It's hard to explain. But if you're looking at this as a cheap phone tripod for your back camera, it's not ideal. It's for selfies as it says.<br /><br />The tripod head can't be twisted on the telescoping pole, so if you've placed the phone on the tripod unevenly to keep the clamp from pushing buttons or covering your viewfinder, the unbalanced phone will make the tripod tip over, and you can't twist the clamp on the pole so that the phone overhangs one of the legs and the weight will be balanced. Some phones will hang out over the spot between two legs where there's nothing to hold them up. That means you have to hold the phone up, so there's little benefit in having a tripod.<br /><br />It is nice that the clamp is really narrow so when you put the phone in backwards, the clamp only covers a very small amount of the screen. (But it would be better if you could flip the phone cameras to point downward on both sides.) I used a different phone stand with a wide clamp and it prevented me from using my fingerprint scanner. This one works fine with my fingerprint scanner. (And btw it seems like a good stand for a phone that's repurposed as a security camera, because you wouldn't have to keep taking it out of the clamp like you do with wider clamps.)<br /><br />It is fussy to get the phone in the clamp as I mentioned, and you have to put the phone in the clamp different ways to get different camera angles and avoid pressing buttons, so it's really a hassle if you put the phone in wrong or need to get a different angle or something, and you have to take the phone out and put it back in. The clamp is spring-loaded and there's no good handle to grab on to open it up or ease it onto the phone. It just snaps on. Plus it seems delicate so it's stressful pulling on it, thinking you might break it.<br /><br />I don't think it will last that long, especially the moving parts, and I'm concerned about trying to replace the battery.<br /><br />I wish this were fully adjustable and had a little grip/handle to hold to open and close the clamp.  But if you need an affordable tripod that doesn't have to be too durable or adjustable, this could be an option. It was really helpful for taking pictures once I got it set up. [SEP] Yeah, yeah, yeah... selfie stick... stick your phone on it and take a picture of yourself.  What's to get excited about?  The answer is... a lot!<br /><br />First off, there are no wires to connect, it interacts with your phone via Bluetooth.  Just place the phone in the holder, pair it up (and it pairs up very easily) and you're off to the races, or the photo lab.  No clumsy fumbling around with connections.<br /><br />But two factors make this a cut above the rest... at least in my experience.  First, there is the tripod feature.  That's awfully nice to have, especially if you don't want to have to hold the darn thing all the way through a kids gymnastic performance.  And then there is the remote control.  Just slid out the Bluetooth control button, stay with in range and you can trigger your phone camera to your heart's content.  Group selfies?  No Problem.  A shot of you looking wistfully across the vast landscape?  Easy!<br /><br />This is cool technology! [SEP] This is amazing. So easy to use. Light weight. Works so awesome with my large phone. Love it!",3,True

I have taken other brand names of the same formulation and so far, my disease has not gotten worse in the five or six years since being diagnosed. If you are diabetic, this is imperative to keep from getting diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and cataracts. [SEP] My father has macular degeneration. This vitamin doesn't seem to help that much, but then this supplement is meant as a preventive measure and is less effective once you have a deteriorating condition. Given that most of us are on our computer screens or cell phones for more than 10 hours a day, I notice that I have more floaters when I don't take this vitamin. It's easy to swallow and best taken with food. Over the long term I don't know how effective it is, but taking lutein for your eyes certainly can't hurt. And I'm glad it works on my floaters! [SEP] We were taking just the Lutein for our eyes and found this which has more beneficial ingreds for our ""older"" eyes :)  The Lutein helps a lot but didn't know that Vit A, Zinc, Taurine, etc, were helpful also.  Just switched and as always with vitamins & stuff..you always hope for true results! [SEP] The label shown on the amazon page (as of 5/6/19) is double the dose that is on the actual bottle. It would take two pills to achieve the dose listed as one capsule on the amazon page scan of the label.<br /><br />Otherwise, the formula is all right. It does have ingredients that will likely benefit eye health (like zinc, taurine, and lutein). The formula isn't balanced the way I would like. I would prefer more lutein, and less beta-carotene.<br /><br />Also, be sure to take this formula with some fat or food, or else the lutein won't absorb, since it's fat soluble. [SEP] It's basically impossible for me to tell if this is really having a beneficial impact on my eyesight, but it is loaded with good ingredients and I haven't had any problems associated with taking it, so I see no reason not to roll the dice :). [SEP] I hit bifocal age at my last eye exam so it is definitely time to think about my eyesight more.  Though since I need corrective lenses at an early age, maybe the wake up call should have happened earlier.  I know there are supplements that you can take to help slow down vision issues.  Though you just kind of have to hope they are doing what they say.  I am almost done with this bottle, taking daily, and I cannot say it helped, but I also have not noticed my eyesight getting worse either, so I guess that is a good thing.  The capsule itself it a bit bigger than others I have taken, but still easy to swallow.

I realize there are others that do the same but I don't seem to get the same bang for the buck with this one. Maybe it's because I take these already but ultimately these feel less helpful than normal. Would not buy again. [SEP] These capsules contain a combination of herbal extracts and nutrients to help maintain eye health. These are free of unnecessary additives and they include ingredients that complement one another fairly well. The only thing that surprises me is that they don't include Zeaxanthin, a flower extract commonly found in vision supplements. This supplement has seemed fine for me, no adverse effects and easy to use. I would recommend limiting your screen time with LED devices to reduce eye stress and get the most benefit from this type of supplement.

First time taking the immunity Zzzs pack with zinc & melatonin and by 30 minutes I was feeling drowsy’ felt asleep with tranquilization. Must have vicks box in moments like these.. [SEP] A nearly perfect gift basket. It really comes packaged well (a fellow reviewer took a perfect shot) and shows a lot of thought and care went into this. Its comparable to some gift baskets I've received from small businesses. It even comes with coupons! A great way to try everything, or just to have everything in stock.<br /><br />And unlike the ""From the Manufacturer"" info states, it did come shipped to me inside another amazon cardboard box. So I don't think they're shipping these out ""as-is"". [SEP] What a great idea!  The Vicks Care Package comes with items that most people need when they are sick.  The items are packaged in a ""gift box"" which is a nice, cardboard box with the Vicks logo on the top.  Everything is packaged well with paper shredded cushioning to keep everything secure during shipping.  I know that I would love to receive this from someone the next time I get sick.  Even if you don't use everything included, the thought alone is enough to boost your immune system!  My parents live five hours away from me, which means that when they get sick it's not that easy to just jump in the car and take care of them.  So the next time one of them gets sick I definitely plan on sending them their very own Vicks Care Package. [SEP] this VICKS set comes with everything you need when you get sick, and at a great affordable price [SEP] I, nor did my daughter, have a cold when this product arrived at our home, but this is a trusted product that has proven in the past to help relieve cold symptoms. It contains all you'll need to help alleviate the symptoms. The Vaporub is one of the biggest helpers to me when I have a cough/cold. My daughter thinks the Nyquil helps her the most. This is an nice gift pack for a cold sufferer to let them know you care. [SEP] First, let me start off by letting you know that I am part of the Amazon Vine Program so Amazon did send this product out to me for review. This is a very nice care package from Vick's that can help with colds and sleeping. I've use everything in this box in the past and it was nice getting it in one package. I think the value of this package is also great. This is the perfect gift for someone you know that may catch colds a lot of just to have at home just in case. [SEP] Leave it to Vicks to come up with the perfect care package for someone suffering from a cold and/or insomnia (which often accompanies cold and flu symptoms).  Everything comes in a box with the Vicks name emblazoned on the top and cushioned with paper shreds.<br /><br />This items contains five separate products as follows:  Dayquil Severe LiquiCaps & Nyquil Severe Liquid Berry Flavor for Cold & Flu relief, Vicks Vaporub, Honey Lemon Vapocool drops for sore throat, and Immunity ZZZs pills for help falling asleep.  A $2 coupon for future purchases is also included in the box, which is a nice gesture. This package solves the perennial problem of rushing to the store to buy cold products when you become ill, only to get home and discover that you inadvertently forgot something like cough drops.  It's all in here - no need to worry. This makes the perfect gift, although I will admit that I plan to keep this all to myself. [SEP] I've used Vicks products for many years, and have always found them to be helpful. This kit includes just about everything one would need when suffering from the flu, a cold, or the occasional cough or sore throat. Even though I use it sparingly, I find that the Nyquil is very helpful when my allergies act up, and I need relief at night.<br /><br />While I don't need most of these items at the moment, I'm confident that they will be very helpful when I do need them. [SEP] At the moment I'm not sick so I haven't taken any of the items in this kit. However I'm 68 years old and I have been sick a few times during my 68 years and Vicks has always been a trusted brand in my parents'  and my households.  This kit includes everything a person would need to fight off the flu or a common cold.  The item isn't actually listed yet on Amazon so I don't know what the sale price is going to be and can't comment on the value of the product but I know I'm glad I've got it in reserve. [SEP] This is a great kit. It comes with all the basic essentials you'd need to feel better. There's even a coupon included. Vicks is a good brand I have never had any issues with. I would willingly give these items to any member of my family, though some items are more appropriate for 10 and over.",3,True
"Baby Nasal Aspirator, Separate Nasal Aspirator for Children, 9-Speed Adjustable and Dual Mode Silicone Nose Cleaner for Children and Infants",[],[],,3.4,19,8626,"[[VIDEOID:39f14b430821839143f568053b9003d9]] This nasal aspirator arrived properly packaged and sealed and is pretty impressive! Suction power is VERY GOOD! Even works on adults! I tested it just to see if it would clean out my nose and it actually did lol😜 assembly is super duper easy as well! I really like the digital display too! Makes it look fancy!!! Highly recommend! [SEP] Having a daughter with allergies, I opted to give this product a try. I am pleasantly surprised at how well the product works. I like that it is user friendly and easy to assemble. I use it in my daughter who is 6, but you could also use them for children that are younger. The suction works well and isn't too strong or too weak. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:88dc5713684072ee5911652fb8930c14]] Even all the way up it can't clear my daughters nose. The sound woke her up and she sleeps through nebulizer treatments. The touch buttons are finicky, hard to turn on and once on it switches modes rather than powering off. I am going to give the benefit of the doubt and say I received a bad unit. I will update once replacement is here. However as it stands I would not pay almost 60$ for this. I had hoped this would be the end of the bulb syringe but yet this does nothing.<br /><br />Update<br />Replacement has been received and it's hardly any better. I truly wanted this to work. Though this unit is quiter it too has the same button issues as well as lack of suction. The unit full blast will start to clear her nose but I have to finish with a bulb syringe. Disappointed in this. Going to have to look elsewhere really looking for an easier way to clear her nose short of using the manual suck it out yourself and this just didn't do the job.<br />The product package could be improved I have a feeling that poor protection is part of this units problems. Video provided is of products package I can actually use the unit through it's box. (excuse my nails I was just gardening got the package and was excited) [SEP] Quickly pulls out more mucus than manual aspirators. This works great and is super easy to operate from start to finish. (Minus holding baby down because let's be honest, no one including babies enjoy things up their nose) It’s much less expensive than the big brand name ones and equally as effective.<br />Pinch the tube ever so slightly to get more suction power.<br /><br />Overall Value: For the very fair pricing and effectiveness of this nasal aspirator, I consider this to be a excellent purchase and would recommend this product. [SEP] Barely had any suction power, does not get the mucus at all and then after one use it stopped working, it just makes a buzzing noise. WASTE OF MONEY!! DO NOT BUY [SEP] This aspirator is not too large in size and is convenient to use. I had a hard time figuring out how to make this work well at first, but after reading the manufacturer's use suggestions on amazon, I discovered that it works much better when using a saline nasal spray first.  Although it does make a sound when using, it's not very loud unless you use it on the higher settings. I like that you can charge it, and it doesn't need to be plugged in to use.",3,True

Most of the time I've had to make due with a diluted product because santalum album is dreadfully expensive most of the time.<br /><br />This sandalwood oil has a nice warmth to it and you can diffuse it alone or with some vanilla essential oil for a very relaxing fragrance.<br /><br />This arrives in a nice box with a solid lid on it so it doesn't spill and it also has a dropper which I immediately installed for ease of use.<br /><br />I feel lucky to have found this as I use sandalwood quite a bit in my diffuser to help me relax in the evenings.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review [SEP] This is a pretty nice Vanilla fragrance oil. It is a fragrance oil or blend, not an essential oil. There's no such thing as vanilla essential oil. In the world of vanilla, there are vanilla absolutes, vanilla extract, vanilla flavoring, and vanilla fragrance oils or blends. The price is also an indicator that this is not a vanilla absolute, which costs many times the cost of this bottle.<br />This Vanilla fragrance oil smells like a Vanilla with a sugary hint. It is a rather nice smelling fragrance oil and works pretty much like essential oil, as far as diffusing, DIY air fresheners, wax melts, and candles. I would not use this to make any kind of lip balms or anything to actually go on the skin, like lotions, since this is made with chemicals.<br />Otherwise, it smells very nice and I would recommend it as a great fragrance oil. [SEP] This vanilla essential oil smells so good. It came in a 100 ml bottle, which will last a long time. The vanilla scent is just as it should be...vanilla and not perfume. I am very happy with this oil and plan on ordering from this company, again!! [SEP] This is the Boswellia Serrata variety of Frankincense. I regularly use the Boswellia carteri variety but have had a quality Boswellia serrata many years ago. This doesn't smell like I remember it, though it does smell pleasant. I also have a small bottle of Boswellia serrata from another brand that does smell like I remember. I don't know; this just smells sweet and like a perfume. I'm willing to accept that there might be some frankincense essential oil in this, but I feel doubtful about the claim that's all that in it (especially at $16 for nearly 4 fl. oz., now that I noticed the low pricing). I guess I'll use it as an air fragrance or like they suggest in soaps or bath bombs. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:837ed82f58e6aa8381af0ddfc97e2777]] This bottle has me smiling from ear to ear!! Smells sooo good! Arrived properly packaged and sealed no leaks!!! Bottle is HUGE!! Excellent value for what you get! As soon as it arrived i put a couple of drops in my diffuser and wow! Very good quality oil that doesnt weigh the mist down in diffusers! Mist is STRONG and scented like a true chamomile flower! I am going to stick to this brand! Highly recommend! [SEP] This is wonderful quality essential oil. I love much much you get here. I am very pleased with this and would purchase again. [SEP] I use it in a carrier oil for dry skin [SEP] This is an excellent brand. I was blown away by how pure and natural it seems. If it’s not organic, it’s close to it. I don’t know enough about oils to know if they are or aren’t except by using. I know labels aren’t regulated like I thought they were. But I’ve been using them the past few years and done a ton of research online. This fits the bill. I will definitely be purchasing from them in the future. Very nice aroma without any perfumes or additives. If you’ve never tried clary sage, you will love it. It compliments so many other oils. It has a sort of peppery hint to it. It’s fast becoming a favorite. [SEP] This is a really large bottle and considering the size it's around 3 times the size of a typical bottle of essential oils. So when it says 100mL they were not lying. Real sandalwood is typically really expensive and the price of this has me a bit skeptical. However, compared to my other bottles, this smells near identical. It projects really well in a diffuser and I've been using it in a reed diffuser. [SEP] The smell is way off from Vanilla. Also it irritates  the skin.",3,True
"GLYTCH Gaming Energy Supplement Powder | Gamer and Esports Drink Mix for Increased Focus, Stamina, Memory, and Processing Speed | Sugar Free with Vitamins (Cherry Bomb Flavor - 40 Servings)",[],[],,3.9,28,624,"Let me just start from the beginning. First, the packaging for this is super cute and totally is what drew me to this energy supplement. The packaging draws you in and the name itself totally makes you want to see what this is. Then you read Cherry Bomb and I was totally intrigued and it sounds like it would be an awesome flavor. This stuff ticked all my boxes on looks and drawing me in.<br />However, when I opened it and smelled what was in this, nope, nope, oh heck to the nope nope. I have to be completely honest, I can't even tell you what it smelled like because it's not something I've ever smelled. Yeah, tells you exactly what it is huh. I know, it's driving me crazy too because it's this strong striking scent that you think you know but then when you think about it, you really have no idea. Then I tried it. Worst mistake ever. It's like battery acid meets stomach bile, except I'd rather drink that. The worst part is while I was very hesitant to even try this after smelling it, I was like I've tried things that smelled horrible, tried it, and honestly it was awesome. However, me being dumb and super thirsty I ended up downing half a bottle before wanting to rip my tongue out. It's messed up because it started out totally fine until you stop drinking and then the smell turns into the taste. My tongue is still mad at me, and I don't blame it. I still have remnants of the smell and then it reminds me of the taste and I spit up a bit. Yeah, it's gross. It's more than gross, seriously don't buy this stuff. And being someone that drinks zero sugar drinks and sugar-free stuff, it's not this being sugar-free.<br />On another note, I wish everything came with the little scoops that Glytch uses. It's a scoop and funnel in one and is totally genius. So at least I got a super awesome scoop out of this horrid stuff. [SEP] Cute packaging and I like the scooper because it makes it really easy to fill my water bottles. This cherry flavor is really off. It has a weird aftertaste that's sort of plasticky.<br />I drink caffeine powder mixes daily and this wasn't what I expected. It didn't smell weird to me like another person commented but the flavor isn't good at all.  The other flavors might be better. [SEP] I enjoy using the powder. I use twice as much water as recommended because the cherry flavor is really strong but I've enjoyed it every time. It's great being sugar-free as well. Packaging is good, the scoop works great, no complaints. Cheaper than an energy drink. I'd recommend. [SEP] It has a good flavor and it’s easy to mix. It helps me stay focused and energized when gaming [SEP] I figured it’d possibly be a bit too sweet for me, but I enjoy it. It gives me a good pickup too. I actually got it for the ingredients that not only give a super kick of energy with the multiple ingredients in it for that, but because it may have some of the best ingredients, in an energy powder, for the Eyes and Brain I’ve tried and in very respectable amounts.<br />  The lid had a long broken side of it laying in the bottom of the bubble-bag it was shipped in, but it was fortunately sealed well still and the entire top is still able to seal well when I close it. I’d definitely come’ [SEP] Really enjoy this energy powder, it tastes really good and it seems to give me a boost. It's nice to have an alternative to the regular canned energy drinks, and you get a lot more out of this for the price. Definitely a great choice! [SEP] The flavor is decent, light, not as strong as other Powdered energy drinks such as GFUEL.<br /><br />My one issue with Glytch and the deal breaker for me is that the powder will stain EVERYTHING, I've never experienced anything quite this bad, red stains everywhere, it turned my white shaker cup red. Personally, this isn't something I want in my body, so I ended up tossing it after around 6 servings. [SEP] I got this mostly because it’s a quirky product and I fit the demographic they’re aiming to reach (albeit the advertising was very cheesy in reflecting said demographic), so I figured it may be fun to test out. I enjoy the cute packaging and the flavor isn’t that bad - a bit better than most artificial cherry flavors I’ve tried. It gave me a bit of a pick me up, but perhaps not as much of one had I drank a Monster or the like, which is clearly what this product is likely targeting (or otherwise other allegedly “gamer fuel” type beverages like energy drinks and soda pops).<br /><br />While I wouldn’t say it quite hits the mark, and the price is still fairly steep for what amounts to a supplement powder, if the goal is to be an alternative to energy drinks or soda pop, it honestly isn’t that bad. If you have some mineral water or carbonated water you can mix it in, that’ll probably be even better for getting that fix.",3,True
"Jigsaw Health Pickleball Cocktail Packets, 60 servings",[],[],,4.4,145,1673,"This sports drink tastes like salty Tang. It mixes easily with water. No clumping and no residue on the bottom. Each small packet provides s punch of potassium and electrolytes. The orange flavor is good and in cold water it is refreshing. The packets are small enough to tuck in a pocket or pack. They open easily. It is sugar free and I like the monk fruit-stevia blend used to sweeten it. I have been using these while exercising the dogs. It is summet, hot and humid. These do rehydrate and I feel good after taking. [SEP] I have the exact same Jigsaw Health Pickleball electrolyte powder but in a plastic can and use it a lot.  So, when I saw these individual packets available for review I instantly selected them.  I really like this electrolyte mix.  I play a lot of competitive tennis - singles and double - underneath the hot sun in the Deep Humid South.  I sweat like a sailor and need instant electrolyte replacement.  I have tried and reviewed a LOT of electrolytes - some I like a lot like this one and others that I save for when it's cold outside and I don't sweat much.  This Pickleball electrolyte is my first choice because it contains more potassium, sodium and magnesium than any of the others that I have.  These packets make it easy to take some along in my tennis bag and mix up a bottle when I feel I need it.  This electrolyte mix is some of the best I've ever had the opportunity to try and review and I can't find anything negative to say about it.  It mixes easily in water and has a nice orange flavor. [SEP] Bought this electrolyte mix to use during a hike in Maine called the 100 mile wilderness. This is the last 100 miles of the AT. The recommended usage is 1 Packet per 16 oz of water but since the mix sweetness and flavor are very strong I ended up using one packet per 64 oz of water (2 Liters). This worked well because the continuous non-stop effort necessary to lug a 41lb pack up and down mountains for 8-10 hours per day requires constant intake of electrolytes. You can't just drink 16 ounces before starting and be good to go all day. You can sweat almost a liter of water per hour when its over 70 degrees and your exertion is high. Along with that sweat goes your electrolytes.<br />Sodium (0.9 gram/liter)<br />Potassium (0.2 g/l)<br />Calcium (0.015 g/l)<br />Magnesium (0.0013 g/l)<br /><br />I have depleted my electrolytes many times during training and on a long hike. It's not fun when your muscles no longer relax or begin to contract all by themselves. It can become very dangerous in fact.<br /><br />During my 100 mile hike on the AT this mix when combined with a tad bit more sodium from Himalayan Sea Salt worked well. I felt muscle fatigue but no cramping the whole time. The reason I added sodium is because this mix doesn't have enough. 90mg per packet of Sodium is just too little of an amount and this would make you rely on salty snacks to replenish what you lose in sweat. Despite that I chose this mix based on a ketogenic diet youtube influencer review. Despite the fact that Glucose can help you absorb electrolytes better I wanted to try this no sugar alternative.<br /><br />My take is this:<br />Next time I will use a mix with real sugar in it rather than something with an alternative sweetener. The stevia / monk fruit combo in this mix was good but a bit too sweet for me and may have attributed to some digestive issues  along with the high potassium content when used in a stronger concentration.<br /><br />The last day on my hike was over 20 miles and it was non stop go go go. I decided to mix one packet per 32oz (1 Liter) for a stronger electrolyte compound as I was losing lots of water through sweat. After ingesting two liters over a 4 hours period, each with a full packet, my digestive system went full steam ahead and this was not good. The rest of my night was all about the bathroom! [SEP] Pickleball Cocktail offers me hydration and taste great.  I feel so much better compared to store bought brands. [SEP] I’ve been using this daily for a month.<br />It’s made a huge difference for my dehydration and muscle cramps after pickleball. [SEP] It tastes like salty orange kool-aid and I like it. I also feel hydrated and energized after drinking this. I find that I'm not sleepy in the afternoon like I usually am. I also feel more productive. [SEP] I am a personal trainer, group ex instructor, and spin instructor. I also love to lift... I taught back-to-back spin classes one early morning (with a plan to lift after) and saw this is the perfect opportunity to test this electrolyte powder. As stated on the packaging, I poured it into 16oz of cold water and just swished it around until the water was a consistent orange color. The flavor is very refreshing! It tastes sweet with a little bit of citrus kick to it. I love how there are no artificial colors of fake sweeteners (Ace K or sucralose). No stevia after taste either. It also doesn't taste ""chemically or fake."" And no sugar with clean ingredients!!!<br /><br />I was surprised at how good of a lift I got (leg day) after two early morning spin classes (with not too much food in me). Some of it may be mental, but maybe the electrolytes helped! The packets made it super easy for in the go like this. I have a few more in my gym bag as well. Excellent price for 60 servings (especially considered they are pre-wrapped). [SEP] Hydration is so important and the average person doesn’t get it. The healthiest people end up seriously ill and it’s often caused by something as simple as being dehydrated. This deal is great and it comes with 60 Sachets of Orange-Flavored Hydration that tastes great and does the job well.<br />  I love these things and would definitely recommend this stuff in any form they have but, these Sachets are so convenient.<br />  Enjoy and Stay Healthy Everyone!😁 [SEP] I like the flavor of this.  To be honest I usually use one packet in a 50 ounce water container that I keep chilled in the fridge.  It comes out lightly flavored that way and then I just pour as I go.  Although when I first had it I added the pouch, as instructed, to less water - 12 ounces, I believe.  That way it packs too much flavor to me.  It isn't bad at all that way - nice and orangey - pretty ascorbic acidy - but I still liked it.  But generally I like water-type drinks with less flavor.  So I usually mix it in a 24 ounce water bottle or the larger bottle in the fridge - just depends what mood I am in.<br /><br />Like I said you definitely taste the ascorbic acid - some people may know what I am talking about.  Personally I like that flavor.  It reminds me sort of like a Gatorade in that regard - so that makes me feel even more hydrated (mentally, I suppose).  : )<br /><br />I have never played Pickleball and am surprised that a bunch of drink products are geared towards fans of the game - but good for them.  Regardless if you like pickleball, play pickleball, have never heard of it - this is still a very solid drink for sports or while laying on the couch!  If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.  Thanks! : ) [SEP] So I dont play pickleball. But this particular mix caught my eye as being all the things I'm looking for in a workout electrolyte mix. It helps me keep going and recover during my workouts! Its fabulously refreshing! I've tried a lot of different kinds and I have to say I LOVE the flavor!! It only vaguely seems salty because of the combination of other flavors. It tastes a little like tang. I look forward to mixing up this drink for my workouts! I highly recommend this product!",3,True

Make sure you have a drink nearby.  To me, it tastes like Birthday Cake flavored chalk. [SEP] Not worth the money, I open the package and it was slimy, wet/bubbly  and the bars are so thin<br /><br />* For some reason I cannot leave a picture of it [SEP] Not sure whose birthday cake this tastes like, but it doesn't taste like any birthday cake I've ever had.  Definitely a bitter, oily taste and texture with little return on any sweetness.  There are definitely better-tasting keto-friendly bars out there.  Avoid. [SEP] This really was gross. Took two small bites and couldn’t put myself through another bite. They are so greasy, don’t taste like Birthday cake at all in any way!! Have edible glitter in the ingredients list but didn’t notice any glitter / sparkle so not sure why that’s even an ingredient in the bar. I’d give anything to be able to return them and get my money back. Such a waste of money. [SEP] I feel really terrible giving such a low rating, but I have to be honest :-( Not only will I not buy this product again, I can't eat the ones I already bought. If you don't care about texture, this is a great product for a keto diet. To me it was a waste of money because the only time I ate a whole one (without spitting it out) was after unintetionally starving on a hike. The texture is soft, oily, and grainy all at the same time. I'm not texture sensitive, I eat a wide variety of foods and textures (including putting chia seeds in my drinking water). I unfortunately couldn't with this bar. I'm sorry. Two stars for clean ingredients. UPDATE: Seeing as these bars are expensive, I didn't want to throw away the other ones that I had. I put them in the coldest part of the fridge, and took them out only when I was ready to eat immediately. If left out at room temperature- even in an air conditioned house- they get a horrible texture. I've since eaten all the bars I had and I've ordered double the stock I initially had. Why? Because I've overcome the texture problem, they fill me up, I've lost weight, and I'm yet to find cleaner keto bars than this. I'm especially excited about losing weight! I still can't give full stars because you can't keep then in your bag for emergencies like other health bars, and because of the high price. [SEP] Grossest keto bar we have ever bought looks bad too [SEP] I ordered these PK Bars with such high hopes. When they arrived the carton was fine but there were greasy spots all over it. After opening, I see that most of the bars are squished looking and totally greasy. Ugh. I went ahead and tasted one and spit it out. I heard from Jess from Keto Rewind on YouTube that she and her mom tried baking them bc her mom didn’t like them as is. I still don’t like them and I will NOT be reordering any of these bars. Very expensive garbage. I also don’t understand why some people give favorable reviews. It’s almost like there are two different products. [SEP] These bars were horrible.  Like worse then the backside of a oily camel horrible.  Really can't say enough about how bad they are.  My kids hated them, the dog wouldn't eat them.  Don't fall for the nice graphics on the label.  I am reluctant to even put them in the compost for fear that the dirt will reject them...

Capsules are nice, but this is much better. It goes down easy and works quicker in this form. If you've tried other, natural supplements that haven't worked for you, try this. I've been pleasantly surprised at how effective Kava is. [SEP] I heard of the relaxing effects of Kava from a friend, and was curious to try it for myself on nights before bed when mind and body are still buzzing from a long day.<br />The directions on the bottle state to take two squeezes of the bulb or 1/4 of a Teaspoon. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste. I was picking up hints of berries, which leaves me to question what the full ingredients are for sweetener. It does list vegetable glycerin which may be responsible for the pleasant taste. As far as consistency, it's slightly thicker than water.<br />It took about 30 minutes for the effects of this medicinal tree root concoction to do its magic. I soon felt a total relaxed feeling. I practice holistic and healthy living and can see this being a wonderful addition, along with my CBD and essential oils, to my natural first aid kit. There is no doubt this Kava works, however I think it's important to mention that after doing some more indepth research on Kava and the effects on the body, I discovered it's not the greatest for the liver. That being said, neither is alcohol and I already gave that up! Lol. I will use this only when needed and I would advise the same for anyone looking for a little added help to chill out.

[SEP] I was afraid this would be difficult to work with, but it's flavorless and dissolves well.  It doesn't come with it's own scoop, which is a big downfall in my book.  I have to commandeer scoops from my protein powder containers.  I'm not sure that I've actually seen a difference in my skin since beginning to use it though.  The container is fairly small for the higher price tag on it. [SEP] This is very similar to every other collagen powder I have tried, but it does have a hard time mixing in. [SEP] I'm always open to finding a great quality collagen powder that's free of any strong smells or tastes which can be a deal breaker. There are so many collagen products on the market and some have lost their magic lately. This collagen mixes easily in warm or cold liquid. In warm liquid there is not off putting scent or flavor. I usually make a fruit smoothie every day as a vector of the collagen and other powdered supplements that I like to include in my diet. Mushroom powders, herbs, stevia, beet powder etc. I like the plain collagen since I am sensitive to many flavors and colors added to some powders. I've recently learned that it's easy to add collagen to my bullet coffees and I've been adding it to my tea on days that I skip coffee and smoothies.  I have noticed an improvement in my skin and over all health when using a great collagen product. It's too soon to know what this collagen will do but I should see results within a short time. I know that the powder doesn't make me feel nauseous or allergy symptoms so that's great. No obvious flavor or unappealing scent. So far so good. This is a large container, 3 times the size of the current collagen supplement I've used for 2 years but has been very bad smelling and tasting lately so I can't use it any longer. I'm hoping this product continues to be great quality and delivers on the benefits of a great quality collagen powder. I'll update when I have some feedback on my skin and health, but the powder is definitely palatable. [SEP] I used this protein in my daily breakfast smoothies and it does not have a taste nor oder, and it blends in my blender very smoothly. I haven't been using it long enough to see any of its effects but I do love how well it works in my smoothies and how I can use it in any smoothie because it does not have any taste so it doesn't effect what Im making that morning. [SEP] So far I'm impressed with this powdered form of Collagen. Personally I already take collagen in a pill supplement form and have been relatively happy with it, however when offered this supplement that also has an extra boost of protein and other amino acids compared with what I already take and it was FLAVORLESS I was willing to try it. I have been putting it in my coffee (and sometimes in my coffee WITH my powdered fiber supplement as well) and it doesn't taste like anything. I did see mention that it discolored black coffee for some (and it does do that) but since I use half&half in my coffee it just seems to add to the already ""solid"" coffee staying power when I drink it, it almost feels like a meal. I don't like the serving size though and since I already take a collagen supplement I have only been doing half the dosage recommended which will still deliver for example 10.5g of protein. The large container with the big dosage will only last 30 days if used as recommended. As I use it will last twice that. Up to you. But it is indeed flavorless! I will definitely continue to use it. [SEP] This is an unflavored supplement.  When mixed with a flavored item this doesn’t change the original drink at all.  I have mixed this with a small hand blender, a blender bottle, and just added it to a drink by shaking a bottle.<br /><br />When using a hand blender ( mini hand blender) this mixed smoothly and the only reason I could tell it was in the shake was that I watched myself add it.<br /><br />When using a hand held bottle blender again this mixed nicely, added no powder flavor at all.  Again, this was mixed with a breakfast / protein powder and changed nothing in taste or texture.<br /><br />When just adding this BY itself to a bottle drink and shaking.  I added a single serving (1 scoop) of this to a mini bottle of a Zero sugar sports drink that adds electrolytes then shook like mad.  For this, it did add a bit of oddness to drink.  It wasn’t bad just tastefully different.<br /><br />So if you read this far basically this is cool to mix into a larger amount of pre-flavored anything.  NOT the mini bottles (was not something anyone wants to taste). But overall, this is flavorless when used as intended. [SEP] I have been using this collagen protein powder for the last 3-4 years, though not this brand because it was not available.  This is a product that absolutely lives up to its claims! After a few months of using this  you will notice a lot of little hairs growing out around your hairline and this is happening all over your head,  it just isn't noticeable for a while. It really does grow hair (revives old follicles??)  and makes your fingernails super hard. I'm not sure how long it was before I noticed that my nails were harder, but it was very obvious when I had to trim them.  When I have read reviews in the past for products like this one, there were claims that, if you have white or gray hair, it will begin growing out dark again.  It happened to me! My hair was pure white/silver (I am 60) and it began getting dark brown, it is now pretty dark in the back and salt and pepper all over. I posted photos of this on Amazon for the brand that I was using at the time and I will try to find them and post them here.  My only problem is that I really liked my white hair! Lol.  I must say, though,  my hair is a lot thicker and shinier after using the collagen and when I stopped using it for a few months (I ran out and put off re-ordering), I began to see a lot more hairs in my hairbrush,  a real bummer.  Just imagine what your body must be missing in the way of nutrients if it has such a drastic effect on your hair! I have read that nutritional deficiencies show up in the hair first and I believe it's true. You won't be disappointed in this product,  I highly recommend it!",3,True

Vegan protein powders can be pretty rough taste and texture wise but he really liked this one. It dissolved well and the only downside would be the price. [SEP] I love that this product is all natural with no artificial sweeteners that so many other protein powders have.  I also love all of the great benefits listed in the ingredients.  I really wanted to like the flavor, but it is just a bit too 'earthy' for my taste.  I tried it in my coffee and it blended ok, but didn't taste right.  Maybe blended with milk and fruit it would be more palatable.  Overall, a great option for a plant based protein powder if you don't mind the flavor. [SEP] What a terrible bitter taste. Not chocolate at all. Gritty and doesn't dissolve well. Not a pleasant protein powder to drink. It doesn't make me gag, and it is filling, so it gets 2 stars, but I would never ever choose this powder to purchase. [SEP] I picked this item as it came packed with a nice amount of protein, 21 grams. Also noted to come witch three protein plant sources, vegan friendly and Gluten Free. I also like to buy my supplements which are from the US. This is a chocolate flavor but it definitely is light on the chocolate flavor than what I am used to. As Cocoa powder is one of the ingredients in this, I just add more of that separately to give it a more rich chocolate flavor. Mixes pretty easy and dissolves in milk or water. All in all taste is decent, high quality plant protein is what I was after. The nutritional facts on the back are pretty limited though. Just gives total fat, doesn’t break it down into Saturated or Trans Fat. NO cholesterol reading. Does break down other facts nicely though. I have uploaded a picture to reference. [SEP] This powder is actually a lot better than I was expecting which is good to always go in with low expectations seeing how the marketplace is but the ingredients are awesome and it mixed up really well was delicious made me feel great and I'm a fan",3,True

[SEP] Sooo...chance are if you are looking at these you have an elderly or disabled female. Unlike men, there are far fewer options so it is nice to encounter this at an affordable price. The container itself is good and the idea is good but the actual execution is far less straightforward. It's not easy to use and is far more prone to additional accidents than the male counter part. Plan on taking time to get things correct and use an underlayment for additional protection just in case. Additionally, the tubing requires far more attention. Ultimately better than nothing but not problem free. [SEP] A pretty good female urinal.  I got this for long car rides, stuck in traffic, like when were stuck in traffic for a festival.  Ya know, when the car ride is endless, there is no bathroom in sight, and its impossible to pull over and urinate in public.  This urnal is perfect in my opinion for that purpose.",3,True

Strong and powerful, my hair dries super quick. It has varying speeds and heat levels which allows me to dry and style my hair at the same time. It also fits well in my hand, is relatively light weight, and I can maneuver from the front to back of my head easily. I love this red color as well and it matches my decor perfectly. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new, quality hair dryer at a reasonable price. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:64f556223f7fbc7bd5cf7d55b2557181]] This JINRI hairdryer is super lightweight and easy to hold. It has 1875 watts with 2 speeds and 3 temperatures. It also has a cool shot button that is a game changer. To seal in your style, simply dry your hair as normal and press the cool button to seal your style!  It works great!  This hairdryer has a 6 ft power cord which is so helpful and has a hanging loop if you have a hook you use for storing your hair dryer. This also has a removable end cap that allows you to target heat to a specific area of your hair - such as to give it volume or curl.<br /><br />See my picture for details and my video for a demonstration of the product. Overall, I really like this hair dryer and I highly recommend it! [SEP] Great dryer.  It’s lightweight and fairly quiet.  It heats up quickly and has several  setting for heat and power. It’s easy to hold and easy to flip the buttons. [SEP] Thus is lightweight and easy to hold. Downside is drying.  The drying power sucks to put it nicely.  I have a Revlon 1875 watt ot doesn't compare. I will keep as emergency back up but for blowing out my curls. This is no. [SEP] This hair dryer works well and has a couple of different settings to allow you to dry your hair. It didn’t get overly hot, was easy to hold for an extended amount of time, and didn’t make my hair crazy frizzy. Overall it’s a good dryer for the price. [SEP] I love all the settings you get with this hand held blow dryer.  Drying time was quick and my hair was soft and dry.  I did a blowout, and it came out better than using my old dryer.  I was able to have a control heat setting my blowout come out straighter and I didn't really have to use my flat iron.  The down side about this dryer is its heavy.  The handle is made well you can have a good drip on it but its still heavy. [SEP] I couldn’t believe how lightweight this blow dryer is. It is easy to hold and and dries my hair in less time than my old blow dryer. Shaving a couple of minutes off my morning routine is big for some who needs to blow dry their hair every day. I would recommend this product. [SEP] Its made of an excellent quality plastic. As powerful as a salon dryer or a professional dryer. I am very happy with the  overall quality and results. Gives option of HOT and COLD air and has three different power levels. Excellent product, barring that its a little heavier, but I attribute it to the quality of the material used to make it. Overall as excellent product and very reasonably priced. [SEP] Works great! Gets hot and helps to dry hair in a faster amount of time. Lightweight and looks super expensive. [SEP] This is a very stylish professional looking hair dryer! In fact my sister asked me if I actually spent a large amount of money on it because it looked so expensive! She was shocked to find out how much it was! I have very long hair and thick hair that takes forever to dry, the first time I used this I was in shock. It literally took half the time it usually takes to dry my hair! The best part after that is my hair was not as frizzy after blowing it out!

It blocked out the sound from the engine and a crying baby! I like these better than the kind you squish and push in your ear. The comfort is better and they remove so easily with the tab for removal. The carrying  case is nice to keep them secure and from being lost. [SEP] I think the use of noise cancelling is a little lost in translation but otherwise these were great and came in really handy.  When I travel and am in a secured place it's nice to be able to block out all the noise and get some good rest.  These did an excellent job.  I also used them when going to the shooting range and they worked great there also.  Having the different sizes meant I had an extra pair to give to someone that didn't have proper ear protection at the range. The hard carrying case is great to have as well or I would've lost them a long time ago.<br /><br />To be noise cancelling they would have to produce a counter noise, so the use of that term is incorrect but they do block out a good amount of sound.  I was very happy with them and had no problems with them at all. [SEP] Could not get either size to stay in ear. Go with high quality foam instead. Threw these away immediately. [SEP] Too large for my ears.  I waited too long to return.  They may work for some people but didn’t for me.  You can tell they are made of good quality materials, just too big for my ears. [SEP] My husband uses a CPAP machine and it can get loud. I use the ear plugs for sleeping. They keep out 99% of the noise which is great. They are comfortable except sometimes when I am sleeping on my side they can build pressure in my ear because of hitting my pillow. [SEP] The best design feature of these ear plugs is the tab so that they fit smoothly into the cartilage portion of our ears and make the plugs easy to remove. It's a clever marketing ploy to use the phrase ""noise cancelling"" as a generic term, not meaning the device generates counter-waves to scientifically cancel the incoming sound waves. They are passive plugs -- obstruct sound waves from entering the ear canal. There is no active noise cancellation. [SEP] A++++ I love it thanks .

I thought this would feel good on my neck, but it kinda just feels like it’s sharply jabbing into my neck. Maybe I need to do it more. Easy to use and well made. Need to give it more time to see if it makes a difference. [SEP] Usually I am disappointed with the various exercise / therapy devices on the market. However, this actually works for me.<br /><br />I woke up several months ago with neck pain. After trying everything I could think of, I went to a chiropractor. His adjustments were helping me and he gave me the exact same exercise that this helps one perform. He had me roll up a towel, lay on the floor, and then put it under my upper back so that my neck was hanging back.<br /><br />Now I do not have to spend time rolling up a towel. Also, this is harder which is better for alignment. There are three adjustment levels based on the blocks used. I use it on the lowest setting, which is with the two bottom blocks removed. It works great but does take some getting used to. This is a perfect daily exercise for my neck. I just lay on the floor while the back of my neck/head hangs over this. I am able to do this for 5 minutes. Eventually, I'll work up to 10 minutes.<br /><br />In summary, this works for me. I love the adjustment levels available and the ease with which this can be used.<br /><br />UPDATE - After trying [[ASIN:B09KQ3R1J1 this]] device, I actually like that better than this one. This is not as comfortable as the new device I am trying; therefore, I lowered this one star. [SEP] I use it on the very first rung. I don't use the two extra pads and it's just fine for me. This is similar to a lot of things that you see on the market and there are a lot of ways to Help your neck , back and your spine. I find this is lightweight easy to use. And less expensive than a lot of the so called pharmaceutical type neck rest. I think this is very good to use in a meditative state for 10 minutes or so. I recommend my friend. Keep pain free till the end. Thank you. God bless you. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  OZ [SEP] Time in front of the computer and general wear and tear so sometimes I have a real problem with my neck. Unfortunately it affects my shoulders, back, arms and hands too so I'm always looking for something to ease the tightness. This works well and is easy to use. It's adjustable so I have options and stores in a small space. It's a regular 'guest' in my suitcase when I travel and I don't leave home without it anymore. [SEP] First of all I’m a chiropractor that specializes in corrective care and this is my new absolute favorite traction device. First of all it’s adjustable so you’ll be able to customize the perfect fit for yourself. And as far as the design goes… It’s comfortable and snug. I noticed immediate relief in tension and increased range of motion. Bravo ChiroLux. [SEP] I’ve been using this for a little over a month and it seems to work really well. [SEP] This is my second neck ""traction device""  the other is a different with a heating pad and acupressure points for the back.<br /><br />I will warn you that this pillow at first is not for the faint of heart.  It goes right to work and can be painful for someone with severe ""straight neck""<br /><br />I had already started my therapy with softer angle so this was easy for me on the first try but still I could feel my vertebrae loosening and my shoulders falling back into the floor mat.  I timed 5 minutes and I was fine but it would probably needs to be shorter for people who haven't used these kinds of devices.<br /><br />Pictured is how I used this.  Knees  elevated on a wedge to keep my back flat on the floor and using a yoga mat for comfort. I could feel a different from the first use, better posture, less neck pressure but this is a process.  I am planning on using it at least 3 times a week for 5 minutes at a time and gradually increase to 10 minutes over time.<br /><br />I don't recommend using the item on a bed.  It sinks into the mattress from the weight and could be detrimental to the rest of the spine. [SEP] I have degenerative arthritis in my neck and spine and my husband has a number of still point inducers and traction devices that I have tried over the years and none of them have really worked. I use a heating pad and do physical therapy exercises four or five times a day. My neck flexibility depends on the weather and how good I am about doing my exercises. As my PT says ""you get out of it what you put into it"". I know, I know.<br /><br />When I first saw ChiroLux Curv my immediate thought was that it was just another traction/still point device. I thought that I would try it and it would work just okay. They all work just okay. ChiroLux Curv is different. ChiroLux Curv is really different.<br /><br />First ChiroLux Curv is firm. Most of the still point devices I have used (especially the ones my husband prefers) are foam or softer moldable rubber. They have quite a bit of give. The ChiroLux Curv is hard(er). It has very little give. When I put my full weight on it I can feel it and it is not entirely comfortable. It feels like I am doing the exercises my PT has me do, but I am doing them at level 25 instead of level 5.<br /><br />Second, ChiroLux Curv is adjustable. There are levels that can be removed so if there is too much traction or pressure, simply take out a level (the levels just pop on and off) and the ChiroLux Curv is instantly shorter making the traction less powerful.<br /><br />Last, there is no smell. I was really expecting there to be some sort of smell (you know the one, right?), but there is absolutely zero odor.<br /><br />The directions are simple: place the block under your neck with the curve going toward your feet. Adjust the ChiroLux Curv so the bump is in the middle of your neck and relax your head. I find relief almost instantly and it lasts for hours. [SEP] This neck wedge helps me after a long day. It stretches out my neck and removes some of the tightness. It’s super easy to use and it doesn’t take much space while storing. I like this product. [SEP] Using this type of tools this days should be required by medical because having a bad posture in a few year you will look and feel horrible. I play a lot of videos games and work in a computer in night and this helps me with my neck and top part of the back pain. I just use it around 15 minutes everyday and makes me feel better. it has different level of height and make sure use the one that is more comfortable for you. the first few days it bother a bit but you will get use to it in a few days. believe me this will help you a lot.",3,True

The dosage per day is two pills. They don't have a horrible smell, BUT...<br />These are SO BIG!!  I have trouble swallowing pills at all, and the big ones are a struggle, if they even go down.<br /><br />I looked at the ingredients list. Everything is good, but honestly, I'd buy this supplement IF they just put the bottom half of the list in them. The top half can be had in so many multi vitamins that already exist. No need to duplicate those, when it is the bottom of the list I'd be interested in the most. The subsequent pill could then be smaller as well.<br /><br />Overall, not bad, but not worth it for a one-month supply that mostly duplicates a decent multivitamin. [SEP] I love the fact that this supplement has so much packed into each pill. It has loads of vitamins, minerals, collagen, extracts, keratin and so many other good things that help your hair grow and stay healthy. Not to mention, it's also just as good for your skin and nails.<br />I have Hashimoto's, and my hair was falling out so badly. Taking good supplements for the hair has helped my hair grow back and not fall out as much anymore. I do have a hard time taking large doses of biotin at one time but finding a supplement that is loaded with so many good ingredients at such high doses, such as this one, I only have to take one per night.<br />As long as I continue to take great supplements like these, my hair stays in good condition. I definitely recommend this packed full of goodness supplement to anyone who is suffering from hair loss or issues with their skin or nails. 5 stars ✨ [SEP] The Youthology supplements are easy to swallow and easy on my stomach.  They a filled with vitamins that claim to help with hair, nails, and aging.  While all the above is why I choose this item it's very difficult to review.  For one there is no miracle over night product so judging whether or not it's working is always difficult.  So basically as long as I can stomach the supplement I will hope it works. [SEP] This is pretty good formula with 5 important ingredients that most people need to maintain great hair, skin and nails: Biotin, Keratin, MSM and Hyaluronic Acid and Collagen. Although the Biotin level is quite high which may cause a problem for some people overtime. I was surprised that it did not contain Vitamin A or or some kind of Retinol. I would think that would be included to help the skin. But this formula does contain a good mixture of other helpful ingredients like Fo-Ti and Alpha Lipoic Acid along with some I do not recognize like Nori Yaki and Wakame. I do appreciate that it is made with no GMO ingredients. I would like this formula better if it had a higher dose of calcium and if it did not have the substances listed in the “Other ingredients” section as I do not believe they are good for anyone. Also sometimes a pharmaceutical glaze on tablets like these does not allow the tablet to dissolve so the ingredients can be absorbed in the digestive tract so I crack it open with my teeth before swallowing it.<br />It’s difficult to measure results with a product like this. However, since I have been taking it my nails have been getting a little stronger, not breaking as easily. I do not notice anything yet with my hair and skin. The tablets do have distinct smell that you have to get past before you can get it down as well. Overall I think this formula could be of benefit to have regularly in your diet if you can get past all of the other non-beneficial things in it. [SEP] Well, these read like a multi vitamin, the ingredient list is impressive. My wife has some nail and hand issues due to wearing gloves at work, so we are searching for some relief for her. Topical products are fine for symptoms, but real skin repair must be done from the inside. These are on the higher cost spectrum, at a dollar a day for treatment, but if you can find something that works, the price is always worth it. We will give it some time and see how it works for her, but it feels like a good choice ! [SEP] Unfortunately these didnt do much for me. I have very flimsy and frail nails and split ends where my hair falls out really easily. Not much has improved other than my nails seem to be growing faster, but not stronger as I need them to. Pretty let down, they also have a bit of a funny taste that makes me want to gag. [SEP] I wouldn't say that it makes my nails strong, but it makes them grow prey quickly. I keep my hair a similar length, so I can't say whether or not out helps with growth. It has a good amount of biotin in it. [SEP] So far I’ve been taking them for three weeks and I can already notice a difference in my skin and nails! I am a very picky person when it comes to things like this but I don’t have a negative thing to say about this product at all!",3,True

Quality ingredients a must have! [SEP] The added increase in energy and alertness is better and more steady than coffee. [SEP] So far so good ... only the second day but my system is pretty sensitive and , thank Goodness, i can usually notice taking darn near anything immediately , almost. 🙂 ha .<br />We shall see... [SEP] I’ve been taking ginseng in many forms for decades. It is slow acting and unnoticeable at first, but eventually you will start to notice an improvement in your health in subtle ways.<br /><br />This product, in capsule form, is easy to swallow, so that makes achieving the benefits easier to obtain.<br />That said, there is many forms of ginseng from whole root to powders, teas, gels and drops. Take your pick. Pills seem easy enough for me and these are affordable. Some ginseng, like ginseng extract, can be pricey, but boy is it good.<br /><br />One word of caution. Only take the pills for three weeks, daily. Then stop for a couple weeks. That is from a couple articles I read online, not from any negative effects I’ve experienced, but it seems like good advice.<br /><br />I like this ginseng and would buy it again.<br /><br />Recommended.",3,True
"Fractionated Coconut Oil, 100% Pure & Natural Body Oil for Massage & Aromatherapy, Carrier Oil for Essential Oils, Non-Greasy Hair & Skin Care Moisturizer by Shiny Leaf 16 fl. oz.",[],[],,4.6,254,1786,"Fractionated Coconut Oil is good for making homemade soaps and beauty products but it's less potent for hair and body care use - I find the formula thinner but the trade off is that it isn't as greasy and you can still use it for moisturizing your hair and skin without that greasy coconut oil feeling (which stains too!). I have both kinds of oil - the real unprocessed kind for massaging into my hair, hands and nails, and this kind, which is versatile but lacks the smell of coconut but is good as a ""carrier"" oil. Both have their uses and this product is of decent quality - I would just go by price because I don't see any discernible difference between this one and other similarly priced brands of fractionated oil. [SEP] Coconut oil is often a solid at room temperature (except during the hot months) so I was glad to see this oil available for review.  Our house is kind of cold and it has remained a nice, clear and easy to use liquid.  It's easy to pump out and apply.  I can't say it's the best moisturizer I've ever used because coconut oil is naturally a little dehydrating.  I still like it though and have been using this oil everyday after showering.  It does not smell like coconuts at all and has no scent that I can detect. [SEP] I use coconut oil a lot and I like it that this does not solidify.  I use it on my hair and skin all the time; it really perks up gray hair making it shine. [SEP] As the description says, this is nothing but 100% fractionated coconut oil.  It's fast absorbing and comes with an optional pump. I love this. Great on it's own or to use with essential oils. [SEP] I'm late into Fractionated Coconut Oil which is  known to be a powerful moisturizer that will leave our skin looking soft and smooth without clogging pores and leaving oily skin. Fractionated Coconut Oil is also a perfect facial moisturizer for sensitive skin. I ordered this one for my face and skins, and they leave my skins super soft & moisturized. I also dabbed a few drops into my Oil Diffuser, or into my bath tub for my bath time Indulgence.<br /><br />💝💕❤️👍HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍❤️💕💕💝 [SEP] Smells amazing. Great for skin! Also great carrier oil for essential oil. [SEP] I love this oil!  I use lotion and a squirt of this Fractionated Coconut Oil.  It soaks into your skin easily and it doesn’t leave a greasy film over your skin.  It soaks in quickly and helps hydrate your skin especially in hot summer months (but I use it year around!)!  It would be great for massages too!  I will not be without this oil again!  LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! [SEP] I started using this oil for my dry scalp after someone at work told me he used coconut oil on his scalp. A little goes a long way, I don't smell any aroma. It will leave your hair a little shiny, I like the look myself.<br />It keeps my scalp from itching and flaking; I use it most every morning and the bottle lasts 2-3 months.<br />The only problem I have had is the bottle dispenser leaks/drips a little, so I keep a paper towel under it; some bottles leak more than others-really not a big deal to me.<br />I recommend this product if you have dry, itchy scalp or you're looking for a product to make your hair more manageable and healthier looking. [SEP] I love this oil! It soaks into your skin easily and it doesn’t leave a greasy film over your skin, and my skin is so soft. [SEP] Using as a massage oil before bath, relaxes the entire body, cools and moisturizes for the day. Excellent stress reliever as well. I initially thought it is just a coconut oil, but this one does smell differently (rather less smell than the standard virgin coconut oil because of the processing involved in making it fractioned? don't know).  In any case, it does help me much better than the standard virgin coconut oil.<br />Definitely worth buying/using..particularly for dry skin types..",3,True

I didn't even try to get the socks on his feet.  They look nice but are too small for my husband [SEP] I was hesitant to buy these because there are so few reviews.

They list the compression as only 8-15mmHG, but that is the perfect amount to be able to get them on without a huge struggle AND provide the support needed.

[SEP] These socks feel nice and are comfortable to wear, except for a thin band at the top that makes it feel like i have a small rubber band around my leg.  My legs are very sensitive in that area, so it may be fine for others.  They seem to be of good quality, but I had to return them.

The bristled head is very small and stiff, but it does the job. Considering you're paying $16 for eight heads compared to name brand heads that will cost you upwards of $45 for a four-pack, it's hard to complain. If you are looking for an affordable solution to an expensive toothbrush head upkeep, you've found it! [SEP] They work perfect for half the cost of name brand! [SEP] I have a Sonicare diamond toothbrush and these replacement brush heads fit perfectly. Much more affordable than Sonicare brand. Great value! [SEP] I have a Sonic Care toothbrush that actually uses the smart brush heads, and they are super expensive to replace. I decided to try non-smart brush head replacements and was unsure if these would fit since these are not listed as a replacement for my model. However these worked perfectly. They obviously do not have the smart features. (which tell me when to change the brush and such) It comes out to just over $2 per replacement head and will last me  a couple of years. I can do without the smart features for such a good price. I really like the toothbrush heads. They came each in their own separate package and have the plastic caps. Love the plastic caps for keeping hairspray and residue in the bathroom off my toothbrush. They seem to be quite decent quality. I like the curved in design of the brush. These get my teeth just as clean as the name brand replacements at a fraction of the cost. I would recommend these replacement brushes. [SEP] So many reasons to like these and two few to not. Honestly I have no reason not to like them.<br />There are other replacement brush heads that can be bought for a few dollars less. These have a fairly soft bristle, any firmer and it would gets into medium which I avoid as it is traumatic to the gingival ( and most people don’t use their power toothbrushes correctly).<br />ASYH brand does have to metal insert bringing more stability and longevity to both the heads and its power source.<br />There are no distinctive features on these so a permanent marker named head is recommended. [SEP] i like the price......beats the heck out of paying double or more for the OEM brush [SEP] Not always easy to find the smaller head size. I've adjusted to cleaning inside rows of teeth with larger discounted brush heads. But nice to find these available and discounted.<br /><br />These clean well and brush access is good. Happy with these. [SEP] Good value compared to original brands, cannnot tell difference. Will purchase again [SEP] You can not beat the amount of brush heads you get in this pack for the price.

That’s stupid. As foe how it works, haven’t needed to use it yet. [SEP] We went right to it and tried screws etc trying to make it work.  One screw for circumfrence would go into the holder but it was way to long to fit on the glasses and we tried every one possible..

It's easier on my shoulder or leg but I wish it was curved in shape for where I need it. I'll definitely use this but am still in search of..... [SEP] Seems easy to use.  red light therapy was recommended to me by a friend because I have back pain.  Trying this out to see how it works<br /><br />The design seems simple and I think it’s simple to operate.  Time will tell how fast the pain is reduced but I’m willing to give it a shot and see<br /><br />Overall I think it’s nice and pretty easy to use [SEP] Wish they had something like this years ago when our dog had spine problems.  Spent a lot of money taking her in for red light therapy sessions back then.<br />I saw this therapy belt and had to get it.  I know what red light therapy does and how much it helps the body repair itself or increase circulation.<br />This therapy belt is so easy to use.  Comes with velcro strips so I can have it on my belly, around my shoulder, or on my back.  Longer velcro strip for larger areas.  Smaller strip for going around elbows, knees or ankles.<br />I like that it has an automatic 20 minute shut down timer.  This way I know I'm getting the maximum benefit from this therapy belt but not over doing it.  It is comfortable to have on so it's easy to forget I do have it on and running.<br />I'm doing this twice a day as recommended.  I want to see if this will help with my lower back pain.  I know it'll take some time for me to notice any changes in my pain level.<br />This is so great to have!  And to be able to use it on my dogs too.  What a bonus that is.<br />I've seen, first hand, how much red light therapy can help both humans and dogs.  And I'm excited to keep trying this and to always have it on hand to use after surgeries too for faster healing. [SEP] Review for: USUIE Red Light Therapy Belt, 660nm & 880nm, Near Infrared Light Therapy Device for Body,<br /><br />I have been using a smaller red light therapy pad for my shoulders and it has made a difference. This larger pad allows me to treat my back. Because I do not need to be plugged into an outlet, I can be on the move while using this device. That is a huge plus for me. The elastic strap keeps the pad where I need it and I can put the power bank, not provided, into my pocket or use the pocket that is included.<br /><br />The results from this device don’t happen overnight but at least for me, they do happen. This pad has several options and as you hit the mode button, the light with change from red, blue, green or white. These colors correspond with the different modes. I use mostly the green setting.<br /><br />The entire kit arrives nicely packed into a gift box, making this a presentable kit if you are giving as a gift. [SEP] I had many sessions of red light therapy done  in the past, along with other natural treatments and was hooked. I think this is a good one and being able to strap it in place, to at least attempt to keep it in place, with the Velcro straps that come with it is nice.  It seems to be made well and I’m definitely glad I’m using it. [SEP] This pad is smaller than maybe some other ones but the size makes it much more versatile in where you can use it on your body.  It is neat that it has a detachable pouch for a battery if you want to go that route.  You can plug directly into the wall but you have to use a USB plug slot.  Or you can attach the battery pack and attach the little cord (there is a little baby USB cord too) to a power bank and then you have a portable belt. It also comes with two belts too – a wide belt and a thinner one.  So, this thing will fit almost anyone – and almost anywhere.  Use one belt – or use both for a lot of length.  It is completely flexible as well.<br /><br />There are two buttons.  On is power on/off.  The other changes the setting.  The button on the belt changes color with each setting – Blue, White, Green, and Red.  To me, the settings mean this blue is heat only, white is a red light, green is a lighter red light, and red is a very bright red light (I never look at the light – but peeked at the glow emitted on my body).  Now according to the actual instructions, it says the red color is red light, the blue color is near infrared, the white color is red light & near infrared, and the green color is red light & near infrared & 73 hz pulse.  If there is a frequency, I am unable to hear or feel it<br />So, it must be working deep inside.<br /><br />Either way it feels pretty good – all settings feel warm on the body and some I feel more than others – almost like an odd feeling – maybe a tingling or the ever so slightest stinging – but not really.  So, I guess it depends on how sensitive you are to the red light for how you will feel.  It does seem to help me overall with my pain.  I guess that means the light is working but other than that I don’t really have a sensitivity that I know of anyway.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks!

Second, does not provide the service what I need third, description stated there are different colors but it does not provide different colors which is weird! And that conceive the buyer!<br />Forth there is no Ultrasound as it was mentioned.<br />Fifth, This belt must be connected to USB otherwise you can’t use it.

It has some pretty good ingredients from what I see, if you are someone who is concerned about that. [SEP] This is a good product, I wish they sold it just one at a time though, it’s a lot of product in one bottle alone. Most of the lube products I’ve used were in tube bottles, I like that this is more of a squirt bottle. Plus the design is really nice.

I very happy with this lubricant and would definitely continue to use this product. We use condoms and there was no negative effect or issues. [SEP] This, almost unscented lub, is great quality. Water-based that includes a few good extra ingredients like aloe vera and green tree.

Kind of woody, with a powder and incense base note.<br />It seems to be one of those things that you really like it or you don't.<br />It's a wonderful addition to homemade soaps, especially for gentlemen. [SEP] I've used and studied essential oils for many years. I make and sell soap and bath and body products using them. I also diffuse them daily. I've used real sandalwood and it's dupe, Amyris essential oil, which is known as West Indian Sandalwood.<br />Real Sandalwood essential oil is extremely expensive. Most inexpensive Sandalwood that is sold on the market is actually Amyris (Balsamifera) Essential Oil, better known as West Indian Sandalwood, which smells very similar, but costs much less.<br />This Sandalwood does not smell like Sandalwood, nor does it smell like Amyris. It reminds me more of a middle eastern fragrance oil that is light in nature, and very perfume-like. There are no sweet notes of benzoin or vanilla that dry down to blend with the soft, warm notes that are woodsy and a bit smokey. In fact, this oil is not reminiscent of Sandalwood at all, to my nose. It has more of a feminine perfume like scent.<br />I would definitely search for true Sandalwood, which is extremely expensive, or the much more affordable, Amyris Essential Oil. You will get a very warm pleasant smelling oil, instead of one that is very perfumy. I would not recommend this. [SEP] This sandalwood oil smells wonderful, I love it. It is not overpoweringly strong but it is strong enough to be smelled across the room.<br /><br /> It also comes in a large leak proof glass bottle with a dropper included. [SEP] I am a certified aromatherapist and I really enjoy exposing these companies that are selling fraudulent essential oils.  First of all the price should give it away, Sandalwood is endangered now and in many countries you are strictly limited on harvest, hence why it's so pricey.<br />The smell is hideous to me, it also failed the oil blot test I use to check essential oils from unknown brands.  The danger in using these oils is that because they are not sandalwood, you can't possible get the therapeutic benefits you would expect.  Many companies and now taking cheaper essential oils and combining them to smell like something else, others are just using chemicals, I don't know which category this falls into, but it is NOT sandalwood essential oil...walk away. [SEP] This is a wonderful scent for the diffuser.  Not a scent that I have smelled in recent years. It was very common when I was young. This bring back memories of times gone by.  Nice to have the larger bottle to add to different things like creams or cleaners. Love it in the diffuser.  High quality essential oil.

The shape of the mask fits around my face fairly well. There’s no nose wire though, so air tends to escape in that area and make my glasses fog up. The straps that go around my ears are adjustable and comfortable, though a couple have come off in the laundry. I tied a knot in the strap where I would have put the adjuster, and it seems to work well enough. [SEP] I was mostly happy with this two pack of masks with the solar system print.  They are a good roomy size to fit my plus sized face and the straps are long enough to adjust with the slide adjusters.  The fabric is thick enough to give protection and they have a filter pocket and included filters.  I only had issue with the sewing on one of the two masks.  It was not sewn as well around the bottom front of the mask.  That is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  The price seems reasonable for two masks, too. [SEP] Per my wife: I really, really like these beautiful Galaxy pattern face masks. They provide fantastic coverage of my face from the bridge of my nose down to the end of my chin, without leaving any gaps. They leave a bit more room inside the masks for my nose than all my other masks do, which means there is a little pocket of extra breathing room that I absolutely love. I am a deep breather, and when a mask presses right up against my nostrils whenever I inhale, it makes it hard to breath without feeling like I'm being smothered. These masks come in a pack of two identical masks. Each mask has two filters. The masks are 4-ply masks, not counting the filter, and with that many layers of protection already, I didn't feel like I actually needed the filter for normal everyday use. It's nice to know the option is there, though, and I will keep them in case I need them at some future time. The ear loops are adjustable, and without adjustment they were long enough that they would easily accommodate a face much larger than mine. The elastic of the ear loops was strong but comfortable. The stitches on the mask were tiny and precise, and the material felt quite durable. I have been hesitant to order 4 play masks because the first few that I tried were too hard to breath through, but that is absolutely not the case with these galaxy masks. If I have to wear a mask, I might as well jazz it up a bit, and these galaxy masks are protective, pretty, and fun to wear all in the same package [SEP] I love these masks - I have 4 now! - this one probably my favorite.  Prints are as pictured, colorful, very well made.  Cotton inside, matte finish outside, either cotton or cotton blend.  Very soft.  Fit is different for everyone, but these fit me quite well; they are shaped.<br /><br />I am double masking right now because of variants and until more vaccinated, including myself, so they are more decorative for me.  However, the masks have substance, 4 layers I believe, and with filter, I think would provide good protection.  And you get 2 masks.  Quick delivery. [SEP] Horrible product , quality is the worst the pictures are not real to the product. I would not recommend this....",3,True

They fit well on the head and are secure on the unit. The best thing is when these get dirty I have a replacement while the other is being washed. [SEP] These are well-made mop heads. The microfiber center had zero loose or puckered threads, and the density of the microfiber was nicely dense for good pick-up performance. The fringe around the edge is stitched on well, and also did not have any loose or pulled threads. They fit and work well with many platform mops provided that the mop has Velcro on the underside of the platform to grip the pad.<br /><br />These work very well when dry mopping. The microfiber picks up and holds an impressive amount of dust, pet hair and other similar gunk. The fringe around the edge makes it easy to clean right up to the baseboard or, if used in the kitchen, at the cabinet toe kick area. It also helps ensure that the mop doesn't mar any chair legs or furniture if it gets bumped while mopping.<br /><br />The performance is not as good as a wet mop due to the fringe. That's not a problem specific to these pads, but occurs with any pad that has an outer fringe. It's certainly useable and effective as a wet mop, but a non-fringe mop head usually performs better.<br /><br />The set comes incased in a sealed plastic pouch which keeps them nice and clean during transit, and can also be used to keep them clean in storage.<br /><br />A very good mop head - five stars. [SEP] GREAT to have extra replacement heads.  Then you can hold off on throwing a load into your washer longer.  Plus, I have hardwood and tile floors and as such use two different cleaners.  I reserve some JUST for the wood cleaner and some JUST for the tile cleaner – and I still have plenty to go around.  I LOVE the mop, by the way – so of course, I LOVE the mop heads.  They attach and detach easily – yet stay firmly in place while in use.  They seem to last just fine as well.  I am sure I am set for a very long time now.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] We have 3 different brand mops at home we've collected over the years thinking we've either misplaced or lost them when we moved. Collectively, these mop replacements fit all the three different brands with no problem. They have a lot of velcro-like material on the back and stick-on very well without coming undone while you're mopping away. These wash very easily and nothing happens to them after drying on medium. [SEP] These spray mop pads work great!  The microfiber cleans well and also picks up water well, making them perfect for spray mopping my entire house. They’re convenient and wash up easily in the washer and dryer, and with the multi-pack, you always have a clean one on hand while others are being washed.",3,True
"Body Vigor Joint Ready, Glucosamine Sulfate, MSM, Turmeric, Ginger, and Boswellia, Joint Health Supplement, 90 Tablets",[],[],,4.4,25,1514,"My joints are slightly better with this supplement. [SEP] So I got them because of my knees.  I never had an injury or sugary or an operation or anything, just some joint pain. I liked the idea of all the ingredients/supplements it had in it.  But especially liked the herbs Ginger, Turmeric and Boswellia Serrate extract.  I have read many reports that say these natural compounds that can help to support a healthy inflammatory response. I am not sure what the other ingredients do like  chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine sulfate, and MSM. But I was not bothered by them either.  I do not know if taking this supplement will actually grow and strengthen my tendons as claimed, but I suppose to be fair it just says it ""helps with"".  I have a hard time remembering to take 3 pills a day, but to help feel better it is worth it. [SEP] This supplement has ingredients that are known to help joint health - Chondrointin, Glucosamine Sulfate, MSM, and I was glad to see turmeric added.  I'm a big fan of turmeric and use it mostly for maintaining my joint health by making what is called, ""Golden Paste"" - extremely good for health.  I think this is a good supplement but it will take time and patience before noticing any improvement.  If you want fast improvement Google golden paste, make it and take it as directed. [SEP] I have been a very active person since high school, and took up regularly running and working out when I was in my early 20s in the early 2000s. Since then, I have consistently run and lifted. Right now, I pretty much use the Stairmaster 4-5 times a week (burning about 700-1000 calories each time) and lifting 3 times a week. In the summer months, I run 50-75 miles a month.<br /><br />I'm not saying this to brag, but to mention that I put my body through a lot, and at 41 I have no major (or minor) joint issue. I attribute this to a variety of things, including taking glucosamine and other supplements since my early 20s.<br /><br />This formula is high in glucosamine sulfate (the sulfate form is more expensive but superior to glucosamine HCL) and also includes quite a few other major anti-inflammatory herbs and chemicals. It has standardized boswellia and turmeric, which will help with inflammation issues. I take both of these regularly.<br /><br />The price is kind of high, but there are a lot of expensive ingredients in here. [SEP] Well, it was a long shot, but I was hoping that this would make a difference in my arthritic shoulder.  It didn't, or at least not much of one, but as I say it was a long shot.  It seems to be doing as well as my usual Glucosamine + Chondroitin + turmeric regimen. [SEP] This is an important supplement if you have arthritis. This helps to decrease the pain. [SEP] This supplement apparently has most of the essential ingredients for joint health and reducing pain and swelling; but I decided not to use it because apparently one of the side effect of glucosamine is hair loss. I don't believe it's a common side effect of glucosamine, but seeing as hair loss has been a real problem for me the past few years, I've decided to try something else. If you don't have a problem with hair loss, I'd consider trying this because it has apparently been effective for a lot of people and because if it does have that side effect on you, it's reversible. This appears to be a good quality supplement, it even contains niacin, which is an excellent vitamin for joint and circulation improvement. If you experience joint pain and swelling, I wouldn't discount trying it. [SEP] Overall, I like this supplement.  I feel like it helped the stiffness in both my hands and back after only a couple of doses.  Placebo effect?  Cant prove it either way but I'm happy not to have joint pain.<br /><br />What I dont like is you take 3 pills a day.  Seems excessive - I wish they had made the pills a bit bigger and 2 was the correct dosage. [SEP] These are 3 big pills. They might have caused my manganese to test high on a recent nutrient panel, I'm not sure why so much of that, but I won't be buying again partly due to the amount here. I asked my chiropractor about these for my knee rehab and he liked the ingredients but wants at least double the chondroitin. I'm shopping again. [SEP] I ordered these Body Vigor Joint supplements after they were recommended to me by a friend. I got these supplements to see if they would help my mom’s painful knee and hip joints. She says she likes these supplements were made with good quality chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine sulfate and MSM with addition of ginger, turmeric and boswellia Serrate extract, as these ingredients are supposed to be good for the joints. My mom has been taking them for the last several days and she says that she has not felt any difference since then but she hopes the supplements will help her in the long run, as she thinks that the ingredients contain lots of natural compounds that may be helpful in slowing down her joints cartilage breakdowns. Overall she continues to take the supplements and she hopes that they would make it a lot easier for her to do things and move around soon. My mom likes that these supplements come in a nice big pack of 90 tablets and she says that they aren’t even bad for the price point.

It is soft and it does have secure Velcro (at least for now.)  I like the color and it is not completely unflattering when she wears it.  But I find it a little lacking in quality of materials and details.  The Velcro looks visually uncomfortable and I'm not a big fan of the way the elastic bunches the fabric, nor is the fabric particularly plush.<br /><br />She sees lots of potential as a swimming and bath wrap and would probably give it five stars and I would give it three so I split the difference.  Personally I would just like something that exudes a little more quality, but I will not doubt the utility.  Particularly, the Velcro does hold very strongly and you can feel secure in that it will not suddenly release like a normal towel.  Price is not bad, but I would pay more for more. [SEP] Actually works & long enough to cover my curvy figure too! Stays put, lightweight so I don’t get too hot either. Love it & will give as gifts too! [SEP] I have several microfiber towels as they are easy to fit into bags when packing for a trip. There have been several camping trips where these have been a lifesaver in terms of not taking up a lot of precious space in backpacks. This towel, however, is much thinner and not as absorbent as the other, admittedly more expensive, ones that I’ve purchased.  It feels cheaper and not as soft and velvety as others.  The Velcro works fine and the length is good.  I would not recommend this for a larger person or a person with a wide chest as I don’t think it would be comfortable—too tight. [SEP] Run smaller than ad photo but works. [SEP] I have a few of these towel wraps and find them very convenient.  I usually use them when I'm getting ready instead of wearing a robe.  They're reasonably absorbent, they stay in place, and are less bulky than a robe.  Laundering is easy and inexpensive and they provide decent coverage. [SEP] Wonderful product! I ordered this last week and received within 1-2 working days. I actually got much more than I expecting from this casual Microfiber shower wrap. The comfortable stuff, quality fabric, smooth touch, great water absorbent, and relaxing feel is what I need for a cool shower after a hectic day in office. [SEP] With the fastening at the front, this wrap is uncomfortable. It's difficult to line up the velcro so perfectly that you don't get scratched.<br /><br />But with the wrap at the back, it's fine. Works very well for what I wanted. It's soft and seems to be a nice quality. [SEP] For the price point, it's better than I expected.  Fits great, sturdy enough for the price I paid, and doesn't feel ""cheap"" to me.  I'm happy and would not hesitate to buy this for others. [SEP] Perfect weight and good quality! [SEP] I really wanted to like this but I just can't. It has several features that just don't work for me. Although it fits OK, the elastic is heavy and the velcro closure is very stiff. Overall it is quite uncomfortable to wear. The velcro, if not closed very carefully, catches on the wrap and already there are fabric pulls where it has snagged the wrap. It is also a very thin fabric, and affords no warmth when you get out of the shower. Also I don't find it particularly absorbent. It would work I guess, as a &#34;modesty&#34; cover-up if you were in a public place - like the gym showers, but other than that I can't say much about it that's positive.

"Evolution Advance Nutrition Unflavored Keto Multi-Purpose Protein Powder, Ideal for Cooking – Low Carb, Fat and Calories – 1.65 Pound/ 750Grams (30 Servings)",[],[],,4.1,41,11652,"This is an interesting protein powder as it is marketed as multi-purpose. That's pretty cool. It's a big container and there's a lot in there. While the powder does settle, as normal, there's still quite a bit.<br /><br />You can use this for baking, adding to a shake (like a lot of people do), or in my place, adding it to my coffee. i've been on Keto for 2 years and I use protein powder, butter, and coconut (or MCT) oil in my coffee. No sweeteners. For a multipurpose protein powder, it actually wasn't half bad as far as dissolving. It's a little chunky, but that's normal. I steam it (almond milk) so that takes care of the chunks. I did notice an additional creamy texture. The powder itself doesn't really have any flavor; it's just bonus protein.<br /><br />The next thing to try is making Keto chicken strips with almond flour and this protein powder. I never thought of using the powder like this but why not? Plus, I have a growing teenage son who is devouring his own body weight in protein every day (well, maybe not that much, but a lot).<br /><br />Anyway, again, you get quite a bit in here and it's quality. The multi-purpose setup is cool. I don't do baked goods anymore so I haven't tried that use out but I'm sure other reviewers have. [SEP] Excellent product [SEP] What I mean by that is that if you’re just looking for protein to simply have protein, then I would consider this too pricey and I’d just get one of many other competitors and save a few dollars. On the other hand, if you’re looking for a protein for specific needs for health issues or for cooking, I’d probably recommend this above any I’ve ever had; and that’s many. This is safe for those with diabetes, it’s Keto Certified, Gluten-Free, low in Lactose for those dealing with stomach issues and it’s grass fed without any hormones. It’s also Non-GMO and GMP Certified and made in an FDA Registered Facility.<br />  It mixes with essentially anything, due to it being unflavored, which is pretty nice. I would highly recommend this for everyone, especially if you’re in the market for something so specific; I think this is as good as it gets for its specialties.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁 [SEP] We have been using the Vanilla one which we really like and wanted to try a flavorless one for cooking. The appearance is slightly different than the vanilla one, this seems to be thicker. It’s hard to say if 100% flavorless, you can detect some difference with certain plain foods but in most cases it works for us. I’ll keep buying it unless I find and try another brand less expensive. [SEP] Great [SEP] Excelente! Mi hija es muy picky y no se da cuenta que yo le coloco la proteína en la comida, su sabor no se siente... Perfecto para los niños picky para comer [SEP] Excelente para cocinar!! [SEP] This protein powder has a consistency similar to almond flour. It dissolves quickly and completely, does not lump up at all. I mixed it with water and it’s practically flavorless. I mean, I can “taste” little something but it’s like a different tastes of water. I am adding to cookies and most of our food because my boy doesn’t want meat or beans so this is a good protein addition to his diet without fighting at a dining table. I am very happy with this product. I received this free of charge for the review but will definitely continue to buy. If this is offered on Amazon subscribe and save I will definitely add to my subscriptions. 👍 [SEP] It’s great I love it [SEP] The product is of a good quality, however don't try to make a smoothie or drink it on its own, the texture is heavy and the consistency for a drink is not the best.

I have found that all reusable masks are not created equal. I was spending a lot of time pulling the masks out of my mouth and these brackets alleviated that problem. I wasn't constantly putting on more lip balm to keep my lips moisturized, the mask stayed out of my mouth and breathing was much easier. The silicone makes for easy washing and they dry quickly. [SEP] I decided to try the ""DmHirmg Upgraded Silicone Bracket"" since I need to use a mask for at least 8 hours daily.<br /><br />If you use the thicker cloth masks they do make it a little bit easier to breath since they provide you some extra space between the mask and your face. Since they provide you with more space to breath the masks don't get as wet from your own breathing. The silicone material is very soft but I still find it to be a little uncomfortable after the first couple of hours.<br /><br />I guess if you just use it for a quick trip to the store or something like that they are useful but not if you need to have a mask on for a long period of time. [SEP] These came and they felt like they were made for children.  It was too small for my adult face and I usually shop for eye glasses in the kiddie section.  I would recommend these for kids, not for fully grown adults, because of the sizing. [SEP] This is just an OK product.  Pro: You do not feel like you're going to inhale your face mask while wearing this bracket.  Con: This product works great if you don't talk. As a glasses wearer, It does not fit well over top of my nose like shown in the picture, but will stay in place if you do not talk.  While talking, this bracket moves A LOT! It slid completely off of my nose and down around my mouth area; it still makes it easier to breathe wearing this product than breathing without it, however it's very uncomfortable when it covers only your mouth and chin.  I find myself adjusting my face mask more with this product, than without.  These brackets will probably work best for children around the age of 12 instead of an adult. [SEP] I am so disappointed. First of all they smell, which given time may dissipate but my concerns are the health issues from inhaling the silicon or whatever smell. Secondly, it doesn’t stay in place and made my face look distorted. I am searching for positive things to say but honestly, buying these would be just a waste of money in my opinion. [SEP] I was intrigued and interested in this upgraded mask bracket. Indeed, I feel it is an improvement over the previous generation bracket. It seems a bit larger and is constructed of softer silicone. This softer material, seemingly more malleable, conforms to the face better. Also, the shape is more triangular, which accommodates the positioning around the nose and mouth.<br />The larger holes compensates for the more numerous, smaller openings found in prior masks. So, I felt it was actually a bit easier to breathe with this bracket under a mask.<br />Is it perfect? No. But I think it's practically impossible to design a bracket that would work for everyone. It can't be one size fits all. Luckily, these just barely fit my facial features. I would have liked it to be slightly larger, but it still seems effective at the current sizing.<br />I don't wear glasses, so I can't comment on resistance to fogging. I'm giving one to my sister, she wears glasses, and will get her opinions on fit and whether it effectively deals with the fogging issues. I will amend this review/rating upon receipt of that evaluation.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br />My initial impressions are positive. Thus, I feel the brackets deserve a 4 star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] We have reusable cloth masks and the problem with them is that they are partially inhaled into our mouths when talking while wearing the masks.  These DmHirmg Silicone Brackets are designed to address this problem by creating a space between the mouth and nose and the mask.  They achieve this goal.  Also, they do stay in place while in use.  My wife thinks this product is terrific.  I, on the other hand, have a problem with them because I have difficulty breathing, specifically inhaling, when talking while using this product.  I might not have this problem if the holes in the brackets were larger, which would allow more air to pass through.  I therefore am probably not going to get much use from this product, although my wife does use it and likes it.  In view of our split decision on this product, 5 stars by my wife and 2 stars for me, I give it 3.5 stars. [SEP] I love these. They are so soft on my face. I’ve felt the other plastic ones and they tear up my face. This is really good for long day wear [SEP] These don't work very well with cloth masks. I suppose they might work better with the paper ones. I didn't find them useful to me. At $9, they are overpriced for 3 small pieces of silicone rubber. [SEP] Due to the shortage of N95 respirators and we are relying on blue surgical masks more lately.  I'm not a fan.  They seem too close to my mouth and tend to muffle my voice.  This silicone bracket seemed like a good idea to me.<br /><br />For me, they work well enough, but my wife has a smaller nose and more of an Asian face.  For her, the bracket will just not stay in place.  I still use them, but she has quickly given up.  We're still looking for a better solution.",3,True

I have had better tasting types of hydration packets or powders (See: Nuun). I think that while the salt count is fairly low compared to other brands, the saltiness stands out more with this brand. Overall it does what it needs to do and I feel equally as good after my runs as I do with other brands. I think, based on price alone, I would purchase again since this brand appears to be slightly cheaper than other brands for the quantity offered. overall i would give a 7.5 out of 10. [SEP] Bought berry and orange. Both are so needlessly sweet. I reduce the amount to 1/2-1/3, and still taste the sweetness more than berry/orange flavors. Got tired of it. [SEP] I just finished my 3rd ride with the Junp I purchased through Amazon and I'm pretty convinced this is the best hydration powder I've tried.<br /><br />I road cycle and MTB in Southern California, and it always seems like the most draining days are when the temps start to heat up in the spring, and the body has to adjust.  I got the Junp Wild Berry just as SoCal got its first heat wave, and it really did the trick.  After the rides I didn't find myself lunging for a can of coconut water like I was expecting, and later in the day I didn't have the slightly jittery feeling due to depletion of electrolytes and salts.  No shade on the other products I’ve tried, but I usually find myself needing a little 'boost' after rides when using them.<br /><br />A surprising bonus point was that the Junp didn't seem to clog my water bottle valves like some of the other hydration mixes I've used.  Maybe it's the no sugar, but whatever the reason, it's a relief to not have to super-scrub out a bottle when you just want to shower and relax! [SEP] Second time purchased, i love the taste and made my day, helping me to stay hydrated all day, i will buy it again [SEP] I just received my first order of JUNP and I'm so excited to have found it!  My uncle, who works in the medical field, recommended it to me.<br /><br />  After being a long-time Liquid IV user, I  was looking for something less expensive but just as good.  I'm really pleased to see that JUNP contains even more variety and quantity of necessary electrolytes than the Liquid IV product.  I also like the ""texture"" of the JUNP in my water better.  JUMP is less sweet, but just as delicious, and I love that it comes in a small canister that is easy to store...it doesn't crowd my pantry.<br /><br />We go through a LOT of electrolyte mix around here with 2 high school athletes!  My husband and I are also in our 40s and have to be more conscious of our nutrition, and the JUNP will help us with natural hydration and energy so we can avoid caffeinated sodas. [SEP] I've tried all flavors and lemonade is best. Peach is probably the worst. Does a great job of keeping you hydrated. [SEP] Taste is okay but it doesn't mix at all like to the point that you drink immediately after stirring and it's still grainy.

The problem I had was it is NOT as well built as people said on here. The actual sides are each ok and seem to be solid..however the hinge is cheap and doesn't line up the 'cups' so it's just very annoying and seems like it'll fall apart easily.<br /><br />Sending Back!!! [SEP] Good Case! [SEP] This case is falling apart after a month and a half. It's coming apart where the inner liner meets the outer shell. It could be glued together but not easily. The vendor said it could be returned to Amazon, but the return period is closed. This product is totally unacceptable. I would not buy again and would not recommend to anyone. Edit after 6 mos. The product continues to deteriorate. Glue wouldn't even help now. Photo attached. NOT RECOMMENDED. [SEP] nice case.. bought a total of 5 cases 2 for myself and others as gifts to relatives. [SEP] Great system for keeping my glasses safe!<br /><br />I do not wear my glasses continuously, so it's important for me to have a sturdy case to carry along. The medium size was just right for my light wire frames, as they fold down pretty compactly. The pouch that's included keeps the glasses from jostling around, though the inside of the case is soft and cushioned as well.<br /><br />It does snap shut tightly and requires a firm grip to open the case because it is so secure. The outside of the case has a smooth, leathery feel to it, with a simple, classic look.<br /><br />Now, to find a larger size for my big, chunky sunglasses! [SEP] I would definitely recommend this product...to men. As a woman, I found it to be rather large and heavy. It's a basic case but it's incredibly sturdy. Without a doubt, your glasses (or sunglasses more probably) will be protected. I mean, it even comes with a pouch! [SEP] I have been using other brands of clamshell cases for my reading glasses, but this is the first time I got a pouch protector and a lens cleaning pad with it for the same price as the old cases. They have a nice smooth, glossy black finish, which is a nice change from the flat black that I am used to. Without having actually put these to use yet, I am giving the product a 5-stasr rating, but if they disappoint me I may have to come back and change it. [SEP] This is really well built, nice solid construction- and in nice sleek leather material.  These were purchased to fit my Mykita distance glasses.  Can't comment on durability yet, will update in a few months.  But- with the sturdy feel to it, it seems like it'd last awhile. [SEP] This is a nice case for your glasses. I carry mine in my purse so I don't need the included pouch for the glasses or the case itself. Instead, I have a pair of sunglasses in my car that I decided to put the sunglasses in the pouch to keep them clean and from getting scratched. One case with pouch and 2 problems solved.

It's easy to use and definitely gets the nasal passages open for baby. I recommend it [SEP] Having two kids we have tried few similar items I can say that this one is much gentler on kids than frida.<br />It is easy to use and works fast and easy to clean. [SEP] I was very honored that I found that item. On my first child, I was not sure what should i do with her nose. She is crying I was so nervous. But my 2nd child I found that item. It is a lifesaver. It works quickly you need only a few seconds to sock your baby nose. I will highly recommend [SEP] Because of the design, it’s less intimidating to the kiddos as compared to the Braun we have. Works like it but the suction on this one is more mild. [SEP] These work great. Make great gifts for expecting/new parents. It's the thing you didn't know you needed until you have it. Plays music and had lights to grab babies attention.

It's the thing you didn't know you needed until you have it. Plays music and had lights to grab babies attention. Suction is adjustable. Easy to clean after. Holds a great charge. [SEP] Update:<br />Our baby girl is sick with a cold and this little gadget has been a lifesaver. While a manual nasal aspirator still offers better suction, our little girl tolerates this WAY better than the NoseFrida and actually smiles and laughs when we use it. The highest setting can get the most stubborn snot out but does take some poking around. No worries as the snot tip (wide, rounded tip) is soft and doesn’t bother her. The music and lights keep her engaged at not swinging her head from side to side.<br /><br />All great things as far as an update goes BUT… the instructions say to boil the parts to sanitize them, including the snot collection cup, but the plastic pieces did NOT survive boiling water. I’m hoping the seller can send out replacement parts. So DO NOT BOIL THE PLASTIC PARTS despite what the instructions say.<br /><br />Before our son learned how to blow his nose, we used the Nose Frida exclusively to remove snot and boogies. For our new baby, I thought I’d give this cute little device a try. First off, it’s adorable! The lights and music are great for distracting little ones who aren’t too keen on having the snot sucked out of the faces. There are several songs you can cycle through to find your little one’s favorite. You can also cycle through the suction strength to find one that’s effective for you. Unfortunately, even on the highest setting, the suction was still lacking, when compared to the manual Nose Frida. This can still work well for those who aren’t fans of the manual booger sucker, and definitely a better option than the ones the hospitals used, but it does fall short for us. I’ll keep it for the times when baby isn’t cooperative with the Nose Frida as the lights and music make it much more appealing than the blue tube. [SEP] This took forever to charge initially, but once charged this thing provides just the right amount of suction to get nasty stuff out but not cause discomfort. It’s also super cute.

It will hydrate your body and also restore minerals that you have lost from exercising. Your body will thank you for the coconut water based recovery drink. It has the BCAA's to help with glucose uptake in your muscles. It has taurine to up your workout game. Collagen peptides are in to help rebuild muscle. And then you have the other vitamins, minerals and salts to rehydrate your body and get you going again. [SEP] I play a lot of competitive tennis.  I had a grueling match last weekend and was fatigued when it was over and I was finally back home.  I drank about 1/4 a bottle of the Vital Performance Recovery Drink and put the rest in the refrigerator.  It's a week later and the bottle is still there, untouched.  I felt better after drinking the amount I drank, but it doesn't taste very good.  I think I will take the remainder bottle with me to my next match and drink it during the match and see if it helps me keep my energy level up.  I like the idea of recovery drinks, but I need something more palatable. [SEP] After riding my bike, I will drink an entire bottle to replenish electrolytes. It tastes good, especially when chilled. I highly recommend this product [SEP] I’m not knocking this product in the least because of the price; it’s simply what one pays for the convenience of a fantastic mix in a Recovery drink. I can do get all of this in a multitude of different supplements and I’d be saving quite a bit of coin but, if I’m busy and simply need the Proteins and everything else to avoid losing the muscle I’ve worked so hard on, then one if these sitting cold and ready in the Refrigerator may be a priceless item on a busy day such as that. I think these are made well and they have 18 grams of Protein, 20 grams of Collagen, 8g of Eaa, 5g of BCAA’s and lots of other essentials for a nice recovery.<br />  I would definitely recommend!<br />  Happy Health Everyone!😁 [SEP] As far as flavors go this is not something I want in my mouth because you can taste the salt going back into your body.  For results, this is one of the best recovery drinks I have ever used, I feel great after chugging it down.  If you are super active/ sick and sweating a ton then this is the drink for you.  But again, the flavor of this is not something anyone will drink unless they need it.  Price point seem high, but you can really split this into two uses if only doing a standard workout. [SEP] I use a BCAA during every workout and was super excited for these.  The bottles are large and would be great to drink during and after your workout.  However; I could not stand the flavor or aftertaste.  Also, do not smell this before you drink it as it smells horrible.  I was hoping to get past the smell while drinking it, but it turned me off from wanting to put this to my lips.  The flavor just needs improvement for me personally.<br /><br />I am giving this three stars though as it is a great concept.  My friend gave these to her husband and he enjoyed them.  I think this is going to be a personal taste preference if you like it or not. [SEP] Disclaimer: I don't work out hard or lift or HITT or anything of the like. I walk and hike a lot. When I get back I'm always really thirsty. I like to include collagen in my coffee so I wanted to try it these vital protein brand drinks. I really like their powder collagen so why not try something different. The taste is ok, it's definitely blackberry with a strong lime flavor. It almost has a weird fake sugar after taste. I don't like the addition of ""natural flavors"" in anything...that's a red flag to me. What exactly is this natural flavor? Otherwise the ingredient list is pretty good. All the vitamins are great...b6, zinc, magnesium etc. I'll finish off this pack of 12 but I don't think I'd get these again. I'll stick with collagen in my coffee which is more affordable and tastes better. [SEP] With proper workout is best on market [SEP] The taste is pretty rough with this stuff.  The only time it's really palatable is when I'm deep in a work out and super thirsty.  Outside of that, it's pretty bad stuff.  I can't really say if it boosts my workout recovery at all, but it was certainly worth trying.  The taste alone is really what kills it for me though.  If this were better, I feel like I'd probably try to get it more often.  As it stands, I think regular water will work just fine.

There is definitely no after taste.<br /><br />If you’re healthy or have a few issues, you might not see much difference.<br /><br />I use them as a supplement to stay well and healthy which is crucial with the winter months coming up. [SEP] This is a great gummy to use to help prevent colds.  They also help with shorting the duration of a cold and reducing the symptoms.  I have used Vitamin C and Zinc for years and I get very few colds and the ones I get are minor and don't last for very long.  These are easy to chew up and taste good.  No side effect issues.  Really good to take daily during cold season to hopefully avoid the cold completely. [SEP] A nice change from all those orange flavored vitamin C gummies. I kept thinking these were blueberry flavored but they are supposed to be grape.  I think it could pass for either because the flavor isn't very strong.<br />I love that these are vegan and the cute little gummy bear shapes. You are supposed to take 2 a day.  I've been taking these everyday along with my regular multivitamins. There's only 20mg of vitamin C in each serving but it's an extra boost on the amount I'm already taking, plus there's zinc (3mg) and echinacea (10mg). [SEP] Taste good and provides a daily dose of vitamin c. I am happy with this product [SEP] First of all, yum! These taste like candy sugared gummy bears. If you gave these things out of Halloween you'd be the hit on the block. also I really love that there are zinc in here. I'm always surprised at how often vitamin c especially for kids doesn't include zinc and that's something that we especially want so I'm really glad to see it in here. It's also really nice when the kids remind me that it's time to take their vitamins because these taste so good. [SEP] These are not the worse gummies I've ever had. But there's really nothing special to them. The flavor is just okay. They do have a slight sugary layer on the outside which some may like, and some may not. They aren't too dense or sticky which is good. Maybe if you prefer little flavor these would be good for you. [SEP] wasn't my favorite. They have the necessary vitamins, but the vitamin taste was overwhelming. I usually choose gummies because they don't have the vitamin taste I hate.  These are effective, just that hint of funny taste but thats a personal preference. [SEP] I prefer taking my vitamins in gummy form than pills. These vitamins are cute gummy bears covered in sugar. All the ingredient are vegan and non-GMO using natural ingredients. Like the color of the gummy I believe is from purple carrot juice concentrate. It’s supposed to have natural fruit flavor without any additives. I prefer to take sweeter tasting gummy vitamins but I thought it had good flavor, with a slightly sweet flavor but not as sour as other citrus Vitamin C.

I keep it on my desk and chew it to get rid of coffee breath. Ha. [SEP] Okay the flavor on this one is intense.  It’s strong enough that I find I don’t want to chew it very long.  To me that’s much better than the usual weak flavor, but is something to consider if you don’t like a strong flavor.  The flavor sticks around awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is recyclable (I use them for storing small craft items in). [SEP] They come in an over sized pillow cube.  Soft, chewy & refreshing.  Has the hard candy shell that is easy to chew.  I chewed 2 at a time & was able to blow bubbles.  Nice minty flavor.  Comes in a plastic container with a large flip top lid that you can reuse for any number of things after the gum is all gone.  Is what I have always come to expect from Trident.  I really like it! [SEP] I used to chew gum all the time, but backed off because a lot of the gums out there were just too overbearing in flavor and my mouth couldn't handle it. It would irritate me for some reason. I decided to give these a try since I've always been a fan of Trident, and I'm actually glad I did. The little cubes are perfect size to just pop one in on the go to freshen your breath. The spearmint flavor was not over powering, but not weak either. After about 3 hours of chewing, the gum wasn't hard and flavorless, and it also wasn't too soft and separating like some will do after chewing too long. It was still fresh and had good flavor. As a bonus, it didn't irritate my mouth either! I would totally buy these on the regular now. [SEP] Flavor is good.  Doesn't last super long however. [SEP] Great flavor and stays soft. My new fave. [SEP] Trident Vibes Spearmint Rush Sugar Free Gum, comes in a 40 count resealable plastic jar.<br />You get a burst of spearmint flavor that really pops in your mouth  with this deliciously refreshing gum from Trident.<br />It is juicy and sweet with a candy-like appeal since it has a crisp outer shell that gives way to a smooth, effortless chewing gum. [SEP] The spearmint flavor of this mint gum is a pleasant taste that lasts a long time. Flavor was still good after an hour of use. It was cool and it left my mouth feeling clean after eating.<br /><br />The texture of the gum remained soft after an hour. It hadn't become hard and didn't make my jaws ache. The gum cubes are a good size for chewing one cube at a time. The pieces are just a little larger than square shaped soft after dinner mints. There were some flavor crystals, but they dissolved quick and were not hard and grainy after initial chews.<br /><br />The container is quite large, so it would not be ideal for carrying around. The lid is an easy to pull open and closed flap that could pop open in a loose purse or tote. [SEP] I do not chew gum often, but sometimes, I Iike some, to cleanse my palate or freshen my breath.  I love spearmint and this has a very nice, true spearmint taste.  It is sugar-free, but spearmint has a naturally sweet taste. This leaves no artificial aftertaste. The gum is soft enough and the flavor lasts a long time.<br /><br />It comes in a plastic cylinder that would fit in a car’s cup holder. It is also large enough to re-use for whatever purpose you choose (e.g. storing sewing pins or paper clips.). Enjoy!",3,True

During this Covid19 we try to take our vitamins and stay hydrated.  This is a very nice item to have around.  My wife and I are actually both drinking one now.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the salty taste.  I know, I know it has salt for electrolytes but my other main one we drink doesn't have this salty taste.  I just chugged half the bottle and then refilled it with cold water.  I like it better when it is diluted.  Next time I will just use 1/2 of one tube in my bottle of water.<br /><br />I do appreciate the vitamins and will continue to use this. [SEP] These drink packets are perfect for rehydrating after a long bike ride. They are very compact and light, which is nice for being out and about. The drink has nice flavor and isn't overly fruity or sugary. [SEP] Tastes great! [SEP] I compared this with elderberry Emergen-C (EC).  The ingredients are similar as far as sugar 5g, Vit. D3 125% and 50mg elderberry.  This one has 25mg zinc(227%) compared with 10mg with EC; Vitamin C is low at 270mg, 1000mg EC. I like more VIt. C.  This one does have turmeric root extract 140mg which scores with me.  Salt is the 4th ingredient with 23% of daily sodium, 29% chloride.  That's a lot for me.  I definitely taste it.<br /><br />You absolutely need to mix this in 16ou of water.  It doesn't fizz.  Stir it.  Mild citrus taste.  Overall, not my cup of sport's drink or immunity drink.  I think if you're out sweating hard, like a lineman in a football game, or prefer more NaCl than this will work for you.  The ingredients and packaging otherwise look good. [SEP] I’ve purchased the fruit punch version in the past and loved it. Given the pandemic, thought immune support would be appropriate. It’s very hydrating and the flavor is awesome. I especially like that there are no dyes in their products and no oily aftertaste like some of the other sports drinks. I immediately bought more. Shipping is very fast, too. You won’t be disappointed! [SEP] I have tried the lemonade, orange and fruit punch. All good flavors, though the drink is a little salty with 500+ mg sodium. Reminds me of the early Gatorade formula from the 1970's. Its not bad, you actually stop noticing after the first couple sips. There are other brands out there with 1000 mg sodium which is way too much. We bought a box of Kinder when I got sick a few weeks ago, then as the rest of the family caught it, I bought a few more boxes. My wife loved these and was drinking 3 a day when she was sick. Use a quality shaker. Great to keep you hydrated and vitamins/minerals when sick with a cold or flu. Highly recommend. [SEP] Smells like a REAL and fresh orange. Cool!  The directions say to add one packet to 16 ounces water.  It is sort of too salty without being a mouthful of saltyness – almost like my tastebuds reacted to it – like an undertone of saltyness.  It doesn’t taste like old school sports drink or anything – that stuff was pretty gross.<br /><br />This drink is pleasant enough but I would prefer it with less salt.  I suppose these are great to have on a REALLY hot day or if you are sick.  Again – luckily it doesn’t taste like pure salt or anything but your tastebuds can detect it – and makes my mouth feel a bit dry.  I added more water and found it MUCH better at 24 ounces taste wise.  The flavor is super light then but the salty aftertaste is much lighter that way too – and it doesn’t leave my mouth dry.  It is clearly marked Vegan – which I LOVE and the company helps to supply water to those in need – GREAT!<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] Like the individual packets. Tastes great too [SEP] These mostly taste like watered down orange juice so there's no strange aftertaste.

It has helped keep my acne at bay since the fabric stays off my chin. It also helps by preventing the mask from messing up my lipstick. It is comfortable and makes it easier to breathe in the mask by keeping fabric from my face. The pieces that go behind your head to prevent the earloops from hurting is also good but its a bit tricky to put on. You have to put the mask on your head first and then apply the piece. It fits well with the multiple parts for adjusting it to a great fit. [SEP] I love the soft silicone and flexibility of these brackets! They make wearing a mask much more comfortable and help prevent my glasses from fogging up! I also like that this comes with enough brackets for the whole family! I ordered another bracket from this seller that I did not like but these are so so much better. These brackets did not fit over my fiancé's nose (which is admittedly on the larger side). The extenders are kinda flimsy and I think they'll snap but it is nice to have the options to work around hair and accessories or just give my ears a break plus they come in cute colors to match outfits or fabric masks. 9.5/10 would recommend for anyone struggling with their masks! [SEP] Best thing ever made for making breathing easier while wearing a mask. No more sucking my mask in. [SEP] I don't know if it is the shape of my face/mouth/nose or if I was simply not wearing it correctly. I had trouble with this thing staying on my face even with the mask. I even tried to make the face mask a little tighter so the bracket would stay on but that just ended up making the bracket even more uncomfortable. The mask strap extenders were decent. A bit of a hassle to get the mask on with the extender though. Also I am not sure that the mask works like it should if you have the bracket on.

I'm using this along with a mask silicone extender that pulls the mask ear loops tighter.<br /><br />Wow! They do make wearing the face mask more comfortable - no fabric tickling my nose, mask kept off my nose so breathing is easier. The bracket, in combination with the mask extender, keeps the mask snugly against my face.<br /><br />After trying other brands of face mask brackets, I realized that they vary in fit. I've tried brackets from other brands that were too big for my nose and face. So, definitely, try several until you find one that's a good fit. [SEP] These do what there supposed to do. They keep my mask positioned where it needs to be. The also help with wearing a mask for a long time. [SEP] These DmHirmg Strap Extenders, All-in-One Kit with Strap Extender and Facemasks Brackets  are, unfortunately, not comfortable for me. The brackets will not stay under my facemask so that it stays where I want it. This bracket almost stays under the facemask, but the bracket slides around my face as I talk, yawn or make any facial expression. I find this not workable for my volunteer work. I wanted them to work out, they just didn't. [SEP] Quality of product was good. But the straps did not work well on my head shape. Sad because I really wanted them to work!

Having a running log of your weight is a great tool for gaining insight into your habits and their effects on you.  When you add in the food tracking, step counts, and sleep data, the resulting trends you can find is definitely interesting and can be used to drive effective change.<br /><br />Example, when I don't sleep well for an extended period (usually because I stay up late and need to be up earlier than normal), I see my weight rise that week.

Activated Probiotic – Etana Beauty – 30 Day Supply – 8 Billion CFU Probiotic + Prebiotic FOS & Acacia Fiber + Freeze–Dried Supernatant Culture,[],[],,4.1,42,777,"We have a big variety of probiotics that we rotate and use daily.  This one has a very impressive label.  Now, I have no way to test any of these claims, so I just have to believe them.  This one gives more capsules for less money than many others, all-the-while giving lots of CFU's.<br /><br />Not long before the Covid19 outbreak, I had to take another round of antibiotics.  Since this wipes out all of the good bacteria in my intestines, I stocked up on several different pre + probiotics.  My thoughts are that different brands may have different types of good bacteria.<br /><br />After about two weeks of some serious probiotic dosages, which was also in the middle of the Covid19 outbreak, I got sick.  I had a fever, cough, and shortness of breath.  It really started to worry me.  It only lasted two days and was gone.  I have no proof but I am going to say that my pre and probiotics kept me from getting much sicker and also shortened the duration of my illness. [SEP] Active Ingredients: Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. Shermanii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Bifidobacterium lactis, FOS and acacia fiber.<br /><br />Other Ingredients: Proprietary probiotic blend, proprietary prebiotic blend, proprietary postbiotic blend, rice fiber, NGProbiome Advanced Probiotic Technology (capsule, prebiotic blend, postbiotic blend), pectin, cellulose.<br /><br />PROS OF THIS PRODUCT<br /><br />1. This product contains 8 billion CFUs per a 2-capsule serving. CFU stands for colony forming units. It is a scientific term of measurement of viable probiotic cells. As a general rule, 1 billion CFUs is the minimum dose a probiotic supplement should contain because the recommended daily dose for both children and adults is between 1-10 billion CFUs. The manufacturer’s recommended dose of 2 capsules per day (making 60 capsules a one-month supply) for this supplement is well within that recommended range for a daily dose. In fact, you could easily get by with taking only 1 of these capsules per day, which would make this product last for two months.<br /><br />2. This product contains a combination of four different probiotic strains. (See below for information on these probiotics.)<br /><br />3. This product contains the well known and well studied prebiotics, FOS and acacia fiber, which feed the healthy bacteria included in this supplement.<br /><br />4. This product is described as having NGProbiome® delivery technology. It is billed as being a type of enteric coating (see Kapoor and Long below on the importance of enteric coating) which is acid resistant and pH sensitive. This is crucial, because otherwise stomach acid would simply wipe out all the expensive, healthy bacteria in this product.<br /><br />5. This product is vegan.<br /><br />6. According to the website for this company, Etana Beauty is located in Orange, California. Their extremely bare-bones website states that they primarily deal in cosmetics, and yet there are only two products listed for sale on their site, this one and a combo supplement of D3 + K2. There is no information on the company itself other than their address, phone number and email. While they are on Facebook and YouTube, the company is not listed with the Better Business Bureau or Dun & Bradstreet. There is no way to know for sure where and how their products are manufactured just looking at their website. However, I did find one useful clue in the description of this product—the “NGProbiome® delivery technology” for the enteric coating of these capsules—that ultimately led me to the actual manufacturer of this product. The company that created this “technology” is Natura-Genics Labs (NGL). NGL is listed with Dun & Bradstreet, but it is not listed with the Better Business Bureau. NGL specialize in probiotics. It is located in Chino, California and advertises itself as a source for any small, nutraceutical company, such as Etana Beauty, to purchase probiotics from NGL. This involves NGL putting that company’s name on the product label. NGL has scientists on staff and appears to manufacture all its probiotics at their facility in California. They are a member of the Natural Products Association, and they are certified CCOF (California Certified Organic Farmers), GMP, USDA organic, Kosher, and non-GMO. The company websites states it has been in business for two decades. It is listed as a government contractor on the USA Opps website, under the categories of Medicinal and Botanical Manufacturing, Pharmaceutical Preparation Manufacturing, and Miscellaneous Food Manufacturing.<br /><br />CONS OF THIS PRODUCT<br /><br />1. Natura-Genics, Inc. was sued in July, 2016, by the Environmental Research Center, as Green Wealth, Inc. dba Natura-Genics, pursuant to alleged violation of California’s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 AKA Proposition 65, for non-permissible amounts of lead in all of their products. Like many other food and supplement products manufactured in California, they were required to put a warning label on all their products. It wasn’t clear from the court filing exactly how much lead the products supposedly contain or what the source of the lead might be.<br /><br />AN ALTERNATIVE TO EXPENSIVE PROBIOTICS LIKE THIS ONE<br /><br />Hundreds of scientific studies (see: Tomova, Glick-Bauer, and Salonen below) have revealed that the most powerful way one can enhance the beneficial bacteria in the colon is not by taking a supplement such as this one. It is to avoid animal products and become a vegan, or at the very least a vegetarian. Animal products, especially red meat, have a well documented toxic effect on the colon, in particular, increasing the risk of colon cancer. (See Aykan and Vulcan below.) In addition, non-organic meat products are laced with antibiotics, which act to kill off the beneficial flora in the colon. (See Martin below.) In contrast, a diet filled with an abundance of high-fiber fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes has an extremely healthy impact on the colon.<br /><br />The purpose of taking probiotics is to, hopefully, promote the healthy functioning of beneficial bacteria within the colon, which are collectively called the “microbiome” or “microbiota” or “microflora.” The microflora in the colon have a primary task of fermentation, which is the enzymatic decomposition and utilization of carbohydrates, particularly dietary fiber. (See Williams below.) During the process of fermenting fiber, these microflora release short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, and also bacteriocins. (See Silva below.) SCFA serve multiple important functions: (a) They are a major source of energy for colon cells. (b) Along with the above mentioned bacteriocins, they provide an antibacterial function, which stabilizes the normal, healthy microflora population in the colon by preventing the implantation of pathogens in the walls of the colon. (c) They play a key role in the regulation of the neuro-immuno-endocrine system. Research has indicated that the nervous system, immune system, and endocrine system are anatomically and functionally interconnected. What affects one system also affects the other two when their homeostasis (a healthy state of stability and proper function) is disturbed by inflammation, stress, or infection. When the microflora in the colon are operating at peak efficiency, producing adequate SCFA, then the healthy functioning of the nervous system, immune system, and endocrine system is enhanced. But in the reverse, if the microflora in the colon are not efficiently producing SCFA, then those three crucial systems in the body are negatively impacted.<br /><br />EXPLANATION OF PROBIOTICS INCLUDED IN THIS SUPPLEMENT<br /><br />Propionibacterium freudenreichii: This bacterium is typically used in the production of cheese, in particular Swiss cheese. It is commonly found in dairy products and has also been extracted from soil. There has been some recent scientific research into its use in probiotics.<br /><br />Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. Acidophilus). This beneficial bacteria creates lactic acid by breaking down carbohydrates, particularly the lactose in milk. Lactobacilli grow well in milk and foods made from milk. This bacteria serves much the same function as the enzyme lactase.<br /><br />Lactobacillus paracasei (L. paracasei): During the past decade, research has indicated that L. paracasei is a bacterium that has probiotic properties, mainly due to the fact that it is a normal constituent of the human gut microbiota. Researchers have found it useful in treating ulcerative colitis, leaky gut, inflammation, and dementia.<br /><br />Bifidobacterium lactis (B. lactis). Bifidobacterium lactis and Bifidobacterium animalis used to be scientifically designated as two distinct species. Presently, however, both are considered to be B. animalis. Currently, probiotic companies have not caught up with this development and are still listing this bacterium as B. lactis on their product labels.<br /><br />RESEARCH<br /><br />Ahmed, Z., et al.

[SEP] This is a good probiotic formula that contains probiotics (good bacteria), prebiotics (food for the good bacteria), and post-biotics (products produced by good bacteria). This makes this formula kind of unique, in that the inclusion of post-biotics is a new thing. To some degree, this may be a novelty, but there is some research that shows that for people who really can't tolerate probiotics, post-biotics may have benefits.<br /><br />This is a solid formula in this regard, although the number of units (4 billion per pill) is a little low compared to other formulas, some of which go into the 10-50 billion. However, this range of CFUs is about right for the price. [SEP] These probiotics are easy to swallow with no aftertaste. They have decreased my tummy troubles so I am happy with them. They haven't caused tummy ache gas or bloating (as some others have).They make me feel healthier, which is exactly what they are meant to do. [SEP] I have taken probiotics for awhile now because they seems to help me have regular bowel movements. I am also a very gassy person and taking these helps with better gut health and seems to cut back on how gassy I get. I like these as they seem very high quality made. This probiotic has a lower count than others I have taken but I haven't noticed a difference in my bowel movements. when I don't take probiotics my bowel movements are anywhere from once a week to once every two weeks, with probiotics its daily. [SEP] I’ve liked this product a lot. My husband and I have both used it, and felt like it gave us great results. I will say, for the first 10 days or so, I noticed a slight queasiness shortly after I took one. This surprised me, as I’d already been taking a probiotic prior to this one. I think the difference could be in the “pre”, as my previous one was lacking. After those initial ten days, I haven’t had any issues. The pills themselves are very easy to swallow, and the taste is practically nonexistent. I would buy again. [SEP] I have been taking probiotics for years and have tried different strains. While researching have learned its best to switch after a couple of bottles and then go back to the other - in other words, rotate. I began using probiotics with 3 billion and then 10 billion, now I take 20-50 billion. These 8 Billion CFU are a good starter dose for starting probiotics, but may not be a high enough dose to help chronic problems. This particular blend of probiotics and prebiotics did the trick to keep my digestive system working. They can have 4 stars because I didn't necessarily find anything wrong with them, and they didn't do anything detrimental to my health.  I did not notice my beauty increasing, either.  I'm pretty sure any increases you see in beauty are not from probiotics. :-) Or, maybe I'm just topped off in the beauty department..... [SEP] To help with weight loss [SEP] This product is effective. I take this in combination with the Activated Charcoal and my stomach stays calm, my bowels move more consistently without all the strain and I tend to grave less garbage..

Note that it will not store more than a couple of  ""horse-sized"" pills and may not be able to store any depending on the size of the capsule. The cell covers do not fully stay open when removing or inserting the pills, so be prepared for it to stay only partially open.<br /><br />Also note that there is a right way and wrong way to insert the case into its holder. The side with the finger nubs on the case is the correct face-up position to insert the pill case with the lids facing up. It does not go in correctly if the case is flipped.<br /><br />The current price of $8.99 is competitively priced as it comes to $4 per case. [SEP] Very little space. Cute concept but not for my needs [SEP] Up until this point, I've been using an altoid tin to take my pills during work, which I had to also remember to replenish each day.

My pills/supplements are 18 pills in the morning and 12 at night.  I typically split them up into one box each week for medicine and one for supplements.<br /><br />Thus, this set of two pillboxes is good for me for 3 days of meds, exactly what I need for my travel as I never like a business trip to be longer than that.  I use one box for my meds and one for supplements so breaking my pills into AM and PM in each box, that's 3 days of meds.<br /><br />Each box contains six compartments.  The pillbox in place securely to the exterior plastic case, ensuring that the latches inside will not open.  The top of the pillbox comes off so it is easy to ""load"" pills into each box.  Each compartment locks solidly in place.  Both outside containers are white, with one clear pillbox and one black.<br /><br />I have zero concern about the boxes opening when they are in my backpack for travel, which is ALWAYS an issue for my regular weekly pillboxes. [SEP] Slim and easy to carry! Great product. Good quality! [SEP] Easy to use and clean, really lightweight case. Great for on-the go supplements or vitamins! I use them for daily vitamins, pre/probiotics, amino acids, and a special fat/carb blocker for those treat meals.

My hands are sensitive to heat and get all tingly but with these gloves, I don't notice that. These aren't like the thin normal gloves you get at the store, these are really cushy inside and they feel pretty sturdy. I recommend these! [SEP] My gloves just arrived and they are not lined as advertised.  Very disappointed [SEP] These are comfortable. Fits medium hand okay. Use only for household scrubbing type tasks (e.g., cleaning toilet), so can't speak to issues that others expressed about being too slippery when washing dishes. A little pricey. [SEP] Super easy to clean with. Love the colors. [SEP] These work great. One thing I really like about them for cleaning is that they withstand high water temps. So, you can use warm water while cleaning. [SEP] This was advertised saying your hands don’t sweat in them. That is not true. They are as hot as any other rubber glove. They are decent gloves for the price though. They are long, so great for doing yard work. [SEP] I am sensitive to latex and needed some longer gloves for dishwashing, cleaning my pond filter, and anything where my hands need extra protection. These fit great, have an excellent grip, don't smell, and are very durable. I've done projects thinking a tear might happen--nope! (Ex: unscrewing a tight hose connection.) Good value and lovely colors! [SEP] I was looking for lined gloves.  These feel soft and insolating.  My hands sweat like unlined gloves have cuts in them when they don't.

These are thick and substantial, so I don't worry if they'll rip easily.<br /><br />The flocking inside definitely helps with comfort, but be aware it makes them thicker than similar gloves.

I have had my fair share of red eye situations...it is painful.<br /><br />In my experience when I have had this happen, it was my own innocence that got me there. This product has a great instruction manual and covers almost everything. What they dont say is if you over fill past the line, the poroxide with bubble out of the top pin hole all over your case. Think of a volcano erupting. The lava running out the top.and down the sides. The same happens if the case is too full.<br /><br />So when you unscrew the case you have essentially coated those fingers in poroxide. And if your like me, those same fingers are used to insert your contacts. So you sre basically putting poroxide onto your contact and into your eye.<br /><br />Make sure to discard the solution in the case as soon as you have removed your contacts. Do not reuse.<br /><br />The product is great and it allows me to wear my acuvue lenses for 2 weeks comfortably. They feel like a fresh pair after every cleaning. I will only use.thid solution for sanitizing my contact lenses. [SEP] This product is fine so long as it's used properly. Obviously this is my fault for not being extra careful. Mixed up my regular solution with this bottle and lord well you can see what happened. Yes it says on the label not to put in eye like that but the packages I think needs to change as it looks to much like normal solution. After research I've seen this has happened to others as well. I just wanted to warn people about being extra extra careful. [SEP] I was pleased at first but now I am not.  NO matter how long I leave my contacts in, my eyes burn from this solution..  Even after I rinsed my lenses with saline solution they still burned my eyes.  SO I stopped using this and went back to Bausch and Lomb Bio True lens solution! [SEP] I use it daily. I have used it for over 10 years now [SEP] My optician recommended this brand for my hybrid contact lenses. I have used it for about 5 years without any problem. I did once try to Hydroglide option but was unable to use it. It left a sticky residue on my lenses and actually decreased my wearing time. But we are all different, so I would suggest that you confer with your practitioner before choosing any particular brand or formula. [SEP] Good [SEP] I've had contacts for 20+ years and always took good care of them (at annual visits the doctor would always comment that he couldn't believe my 2 week soft contacts were over 4 weeks old they were so clean and looked great under the scope. So when my new doctor recommended this due to my eyes battling dry eye and irritation from long dusty/dirty work days I figured I'd try it but wasn't expecting much.<br /><br />I am a vet and my eyes are bombarded with hair, fuzz, dust, nail dust from the dremel, and all kinds of things and my contacts are in from 6 am to after 10 at night. Most days I have to take out and rinse one at least once. Some days they just feel like something is stuck on them alllllll day.  This treatment does seem to freshen them a bit, nothing miraculous since I keep mine very clean but I use it weekly or as a last resort if one contact is really bugging me to see if it's salvageable or ready to toss. The peroxide is strong if you have a cut, rash, ezcema, or something and you get some on your hand it will burn. I rinse like crazy before I put them back in my eyes. This one expires in under a year so I don't know if I'll use it up with mostly weekly uses. [SEP] Perfect size for travel! [SEP] I have the month disposable contacts but I am meticulous about cleaning them.  I feel by using this at least once a week along with regular multipurpose solutions in my storage case I can at the very least double the time I wear my lens before disposal.  There is no material difference between regular lenses and those that are disposable, it's just the kind of care you give them.",3,True

He said there is a direct correlation to seasonal depression disorder and Vit D intake.  These taste great and are easy to chew and swallow.  They work well and we actually feel the difference after just a week.  3 Pack should last us all winter long. [SEP] The product description says these gummies contain D3, calcium, vitamin K and zinc.The bottle only says that the gummies contain (a relatively small amount of ) Vitamin D3. 200 IU is a fraction of the daily dose of Vitamin D3 I would take.<br /><br />These gummies are tasty and easy to chew and swallow. What is not easy to swallow is the discrepancy between the product listing and the bottle. [SEP] Review for: 3 Packs) Vitamin D3 5000 IU Gummies for Adults - Support Immune,Healthy Bones,Joint Pain, Muscle Function, Teeth<br /><br />When I receive vitamin orders there are a number of things that I check on the label. These bottles fail almost everything that I normally look for.<br /><br />The company has failed to put the name of the distributor or manufacturer and their address on the bottle so I have no idea where this product is sourced from or made.<br /><br />I checked to see that the label matched what the product page states about the dosage. The page states that the dosage is 5000IU but the bottles label says 200IU.<br /><br />Rather than go into more detail on the discrepancies, it is quicker to simply point out what items from the label match the product page. The gummies are strawberry flavored.<br /><br />At this time I can not recommend these gummies. [SEP] loved the value [SEP] Soft chewable gummies is the perfect way to take Vitamin D3 for anyone who has trouble swallowing pills.  Hubby has such a hard time even with very small pills so I wanted to see if he would use these.  He will and the cherry flavor is even acceptable to him. At around $.09 a pill (need 2 a day), the cost is reasonable. There are 3 bottles per package. [SEP] These vitamin D gummies are easy to chew, they taste great, and they keep my levels high enough. For some reason my body doesn't maintain vitamin D levels on its own even though I live in the south and get a lot of sunlight. The last time I had it tested, my level was 1 and should have been above 13 to be considered ""low,"" so I was ""critically low."" After repeated tests over the course of 2 years, my doctor said I would need to supplement forever. I started off with RX vitamin D and then weaned to daily supplements. My levels are better and I am not so exhausted all the time. I was retested last week and have maintained my levels using these gummies and as a bonus, I don't have to swallow a horse pill! [SEP] I'm happy with these gummies for a few reasons.  First, the taste is very good and fruity.  If they taste good, I'll eat them.  Second, I got 3 nice sized bottles for a great price.  If they're cheap, I'll buy them again.  Thirdly, they are fresh and I know they'll last for a while on my shelf.  Since I got 3 bottles, that's also important to have a good shelf life.  I'm very happy with this purchase and I know you'll like them as much as I do. [SEP] These are great! They are delicious and easy to chew, great supplements to have during these winter months when we all don't get enough sunlight. No complaints here! [SEP] When my wife and I saw these gummies available for review on VINE, we were happy to do so. We've been including D3 in our daily supplements for quite a while mainly in the winter months. Until now, we've been buying a brand that we swallow as capsules. We like the idea of gummies, so we thought we'd try these. And we now think we're going to switch to this product going forward.<br /><br />We have had gummies that are relatively hard or that stick to your teeth. These are nice and soft and fruity tasting.<br /><br />We need to stress: We're not doctors or nutritionists, but we have included this in our supplements and, if you do as well, this is 5-star form of D3. [SEP] These are a HARD pass for us, they are advertised as ""LUCKCHAN Vitamin D3 gummies are the first gummies that combine calcium, K2, zinc, and echinacea"" however the ingredients listed on the bottle only say D3. These are currently priced at $22 for 3 bottles, $7.33 per bottle. These could be free and I would still highly recommend not eating these.",3,True
"Dose & Co Collagen Protein Powder (Chocolate Fudge) 14.8oz (420g) – Non-GMO, Gluten Free, Sugar Free Collagen Peptides Supplement – 20g of Whey Protein",[],[],,4.4,224,1556,"Have bounced around a decent amount of collagen powders and we have our favorites.  THIS one just does NOT have a good rich flavor. It is kind of bitter actually.<br /><br />Our favorite in the chocolate category is: ""KetoLogic Grass-fed Keto Collagen Powder"" ... that one is like drinking hot chocolate.  THIS one is just bleh.  My husband said it was just ""alright"" ... so edible but nothing special.  Was so jazzed to try another chocolate collagen powder sweetened with monkfruit.  We have been on a clean keto for 2.5 years and love collagen powder in our coffee.  THIS powder, I would not repurchase.  We will go back to Ketologic when we want a chocolatey kick. [SEP] Unlike the plastic tubs, this canister looks good on the counter. Yes, that matters to me. Of course, what matters most is what's inside.<br />In addition to type 1 and 3 collagen, there is whey and instant whole milk powder, which helps boost the protein to a nice 20 g.<br />The chocolate tastes high quality, but then it's ruined by too much monk fruit extract as a sweetener. At least for me. I know a lot of people will appreciate the sweetness because this is a product you can mix in just water. As an aside, personally I'd rather not have the oft used stevia either. If they insist on it being sweet, a bit of organic sugar would make it taste more natural, and I wouldn't mind the extra calories.<br /> It makes a very nice hot cocoa type of beverage. Even in water, it tastes creamy.<br />Another thing I like is that there is no plastic scoop hiding under the powder. Thumbs up for friendlier packaging.<br />Something else to like is the bottom of the canister which has both the date of manufacturer as well as expiration date. That kind of transparency is greatly appreciated. It instills trust. [SEP] Excellent coffee chocolate creamer! Collagen has been a definite skin enhancer and joint lubricator for me for years.<br /><br />Delightful. Much better than expected. [SEP] second time purchasing this, i got the chocolate flavored w protein and love it! i use it with my coffees & smoothies & adds a great hint of chocolate taste, not like some proteins that have an off taste. also definitely seen an improvement on my nail growth! [SEP] There are so many collagen powders available to put in the coffee. I measure my success by a couple of areas: flavor and how well it settles into my coffee. Many of the collagen powders I have tried clump at the bottom and don't stir in effectively. Then some that do blend in well don't have the best flavor. Yes, I have had some vanilla and other flavors that I really like, but this one takes the cake...or is it the fudge?<br /><br />This collagen has a really good chocolate flavor. It doesn't dissolve perfectly, but it doesn't clump in the bottom of my coffee as so many other collagens have in the past. I get a little bit of the powder in my last sip, but it's acceptable given the great flavor. I think that the addition of protein (whey and milk) is great and at 20g per serving, you're getting quite a boost there. So that is a definite bonus for me.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of my favorite collagens to date. I find that I like a lot of them I have tried more recently, so I will keep this review updated if anything changes. [SEP] This is my favorite collagen powder I've had. It tastes great, ships quickly, and is packaged nicely. It's the only collagen powder I get. I've tried lots of different brands to find a chocolate flavor that doesn't taste like chalk in my morning smoothies. This one is fantastic! [SEP] I love the cardboard container the flavor💯 is great I'm just ordered for the 2nd time plan to contune using [SEP] Serving - 2 heaped tablespoons = Container 12 servings.<br />This is a good tasting chocolate collagen with added milk protein concentrate.<br />Types 1 & 3 bovine (bovine = cow? hide) are the collagen peptides.<br />Serving = 10 grams collagen = 10,000 mg.<br /><br />Additionally added = vit D - calcium - iron - potassium.<br />And although it's not mentioned, inherent in peptide is several amino acids.<br /><br />The company is 100% plastic free = which I applaud greatly !<br />But the cardboard lid can be tedious to deal with.<br />And because they're plastic free they don't include a scoop.<br />So one will have to wing it with they're own tablespoon which is fine for me.<br /><br />Good product but seems pretty pricey for only 12 servings.<br />4 stars [SEP] This is a decent option for chocolate collagen. It tastes pretty good! It isn't a super intense or overwhelming flavor so it would work well if you were combining with other ingredients to make a smoothie.<br /><br />It has a higher cost price point so I knocked one star off for that. There are definitely similar and more affordable options than this one but I did like this! [SEP] I'm a longtime user of protein powders, and I've tried a wide range of collagen and whey powders over the years.  This is a strange product, as it is similar to the sports performance/recovery options out there, but upon closer inspection and after trying it this looks more like a somewhat cynical cash grab in the name of wellness and Kardashians.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- The flavor is mild, lightly chocolate-y, and only lightly sweetened.  Emphasis on mild.<br />- Decent nutrition.  20g of protein per serving, 10g of which is collagen, with no added sugars.<br />- No plastic is nice.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- I wouldn't describe the flavor as fudge in any way.  It tastes more like swiss miss cut with powdered milk.<br />- Strangely expensive given the generic commodity ingredients.  It's not organic, or grass fed or really anything to justify the price. $3 per serving for 20g of protein and a sprinkle of cocoa powder is not a good deal in my book.",3,True

They are a good way to get vitamins and minerals in when your diet may be otherwise lacking. The taste isn't the best but I wasn't expecting it to be, it tastes like it should. [SEP] I drink Ensure very regularly because I have chronic pain and some days it is just too difficult to eat, so I drink to get my nutrients. I wanted to try this as an alternative and there are both positives and negatives compared to Ensure.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* It is significantly more watery. Ensure is very thick and very hard to swallow. This is essentially like milk, which makes it go down easy<br />* It tastes less sweet. Ensure is very sweet compared to this.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Ensure tastes better, though the flavors are very similar. Perhaps because this is more watery and has less sugar, it dilutes the taste which makes it taste slightly worse than Ensure.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure no one likes drinking these nutrient drinks. I try to gulp them down in one go. So for me, this is easier than ensure just due to the thickness. But if you sip on it, then maybe Ensure may be up your ally if you prefer a sweeter, tasier alternative. [SEP] These Nutrisure Shakes are Vitamin and Protein packed. Plus they taste really delicious. [SEP] Refrigerated, this drink is very palatable.  I usually don't like vanilla but is has a pleasing taste unlike some that have a metallic taste.  The packaging and bottle size were commensurate with the advertising. [SEP] Excellent source of protein & vitamins The vanilla flavor tastes so good and doesn't leave a chalky taste in your mouth. Its thickness fills you up, but it's not too thick or watered down. It's what a protein drink should taste like. I really enjoy these and would love to try other flavors. Great product! Will definitely continue to get the 6 pack. [SEP] I got to try out the Basic Care Nutrisure Original Nutrition Shake vanilla flavor. This is made by Amazon Basic Care one of the Amazon brand of products. My son and I think they are fairly tasty. They taste as good as any other protein drink I have tried, even better than some. They taste very similar to Ensure vanilla protein shakes. They have 9 grams of protein and 26 vitamins and minerals per bottle. The only negatives I have worth noting are; the vitamins provide 25% of the RDA across the board; there is 15 grams of sugar per bottle; and there is 6 grams of fat. To me they taste good and maybe the sugar content has a lot to do with that too. I did check out Ensure vanilla and it too contains an awful lot of sugar coming in at 22 grams of sugar. If these are to be a cheaper alternative to Ensure, then why can I buy Ensure on the Subscribe and Save program and not these? After all these are an Amazon brand product. Maybe once these are available as a Subscribe and Save item, there will be more of a cost savings over the other guy.<br /><br />I give the Basic Care Nutrisure Original Nutrition Shake ⭐⭐⭐. If you compare them to Ensure and they are to be a cheaper alternative, then they should be cheaper and be available as a S&S product!<br />I hope this proves helpful. Thanks for Reading - ✌😉 [SEP] Just like leading brands, such as ensure. Very smooth vanilla taste. I bought this bc Walmart was out of equate brand. It would be better if Amazon offered it in a 12 pk.  I'm using this for my weight loss regimen. In 4 days I lost 10lbs. using the slim fast shakes with this. The key is changing your diet & exercise. This is worth the buy! [SEP] I know they say they're not meal replacements, but they still do a good job in providing enough energy to get me through a morning without a real breakfast. They also taste great, aren't at all chalky, and don't have that strong fake sugar taste that a lot of shakes like these can have. Overall I'm happy with them. [SEP] This ready-to-drink Nutrisure protein shake (vanilla flavor) comes in 6 compact plastic bottles that have an outer seal on the cap. Each bottle is 8-fl. oz.<br /><br />This shake has a rich, smooth, sweet, delicious vanilla taste. It doesn't have a gritty taste (it helps that I shake each bottle vigorously prior to drinking it).<br /><br />The consistency of this shake is like that of whole milk (whereas, I typically drink low-fat milk, which has a thinner consistency).<br /><br />Instructions on the bottle label advises, ""...shake well...serve cold...""<br />I agree. I drank one at room temperature, and while it still tasted sweet, it was not as refreshing as the others that I drank after it had been refrigerated.<br /><br />I like how nutritious a serving size of 1 bottle is:<br />-- 26 vitamins & minerals (including Vitamins A, K, B12, E)<br />-- 9g protein<br /><br />One minor issue: I found it a bit difficult to open the outer seal. I used a knife to lift up the plastic seal, and then I could unwrap it. It's not a big deal to me.<br /><br />Expiration date is on the cap of each bottle. Mine expires Dec 2, 2020.<br /><br />Finally, this protein shake should not be consumed by those who have galactosemia, as per writing on the label.<br /><br />When I don't have time to eat as healthy as I'd like (typically, at lunch at work), I look for drinks that give me a more complete, balanced nutrition.

One of my new favorite items I have purchased. It’s made of fantastic quality and doesn’t have a brand name cluttering the main piece, which is a plus for me. But the best part is the massaging vibration; it’s nice that you can use it with and without the vibration. The rolling quartz attachment feels so good and relaxing on the skin.<br /><br />Tip: place it in a cup of ice as I did in my picture to give your skin a cooling massage in the morning. Ice is excellent to put on your face as it helps with anti-aging and helps blood flow to your face. It prevents wrinkles and relieves puffiness from a night with not much sleep or when you wake up feeling puffy. Usually, I will use an ice cube or a spoon put in a cup of ice, but this wand makes it so much better because it rolls and vibrates and is way less messy than an ice cube. Rose quartz can be in water, so you don’t have to worry about that. Not sure if the metal on this will fade or rust from the water, but that’s a risk I’m willing to take.<br /><br />The second attachment t with the double rollers feels great on the neck and shoulders as a massage tool. This is a beautiful set to gift someone if you’re looking for gift ideas. [SEP] My wife purchase many of these products as a gift. Her friends loved them and it’s easy to use and easy to clean. You can always travel with it. My wife says it’s for puffiness and you have to use it a couple of weeks to see a difference. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:81963d800ef9db490e4eb10c120ddd4c]] I got this vibrating quartz roller for when migraines  hit because I’ve come to realize I get relief when I do a tapping/vibrating motion on the pressure points. This vibrating roller will be a lifesaver! I tested out the vibration and I like the intensity of it. What’s great is there is 3 different interchangeable heads so I can try all of them to see what works best for relief. At the end of the day, this will also be great as what it actually is made for - to drain out toxins from the face so that it glows! It came with a velvet pouch for storage. I know this set does not have the most fancy packaging but I got this for myself so it is not a big deal. Most people just throw out the packaging anyway, which is why they’ve included a drawstring velvet pouch for storage. Overall, I really like this set and would recommend it. It requires 1 AA battery so have one prepared before your package arrives (you won’t want to wait to test it out!). Also, my tip is to make sure you wipe it down and sanitizer prior to use as you can never be too careful these days. [SEP] I am surprised that I like this set so much.  For years I have seen these things and poo poo'd them as a weird fad.  I even already have a pricey ultrasonic face machine - so why would I need these?  SO GLAD I got this set, though.<br /><br />I literally use these EVERY DAY now!  The handle is easy to hold (unlike my ultrasonic face machine).  It is easy to turn on and off and so far the battery I put in lasts and lasts and lasts.  I thought that the handle would vibrate more then the head - but I am glad that I was wrong.  The vibration is definitely more confined to the head and hence your hands do not feel weird using it.<br /><br />The eye head is nice - I thought it would be too big - but works and fits well around my eyes.  The jade roller one is nice too - I especially like it when it is cool.  Then it is like a nice ahhhhh after a long day.  But the roller ball head is da bomb!  That thing really makes you feel like you are having a facial as your skin sort of gets squeezed between the ball heads.  In the directions they call it ""kneading"" and I guess that is what it really feels like.  I am not one to be gentle with my skin - personally, I believe you need to move it around and get the blood flowing to keep youthful.  That has always worked for me - and that is why I think this set does such a great job on my face.  I recommend.  In fact going to get some as gifts for family and friends - who will probably also poo poo it - until they actually try it.<br /><br />If you thought my review was helpful - why not click the ""Helpful"" button. Thanks! : ) [SEP] I've only used it a couple of times but so far so good. It's pretty well built, vibration works well.<br />I use it to apply moisturizer which I found this helps absorption. Hopefully it doesn't stop working randomly like others reported. It comes with a nice velvety bag to hold everything. The double roller is supposed to help with double chins I think, but we'll see. Anyways, it is serving its purpose so no qualms here. [SEP] My wife wanted this face roller because of the different attachments. She has a regular jade roller already but she wanted an upgrade. My wife likes this roller overall but there were a few things she mentioned. She didn’t like using the vibration and sometimes the attachments would unloosen because they don’t have a lock. You just screw them onto the holder and it can unloosen.<br /><br />At first I really didn’t know this was a beauty product so I wanted to see why you would use this thing on your face. Honestly, I am completely sold. I actually this roller more than my wife does and I am even thinking of getting one for myself... I grind my teeth and clench my jaws when I sleep and I had no idea that I had so many knots and tight muscles on my face until I started using this thing. I use foam rollers fairly regularly when I work out and this thing is basically a foam roller for your face! It seriously helps to loosen tension and just after a few weeks of using this my jaw doesn’t click as much when opening and closing my mouth.<br /><br />This came in a nice box and feels like quality. The only thing that felt cheap about this is the on and off marker for the vibration. It’s just a sticker that started peeling off (you can see it starting to peel in the picture I put up). I prefer to take the sticker off so I don’t mind it but I thought I’d mention it since I might bother some people. [SEP] I like this roller because it seems to be tightening my skin and you can use it on other areas of your body. It is small and easy to use as a part of your nightly routine with a facial serum. The attachments help to massage all areas around the chin line and nose. The massager seems to be a great additions to help tone your skin verses just the jade roller alone. The roller was well packaged with a black velvet carrying case which was a nice addition. You do need to have an AA battery which is not included.  I think it is a useful tool to add to your beauty routine to firm and tone your face and keep a youthful glow. [SEP] Fells great on the skin [SEP] This roller is a great addition to add a little bit of luxury to your skin care routine. I love the three different options for the interchangeable heads. Will be curious to see how it lasts longevity wise, but even if the vibrating mechanism stops working it will still be a useful tool! [SEP] This facial massage roller includes a pair of attachments suitable for the massage function as well as a manual roller tip. The stones used are genuine rose quartz. This works as well as other electric facial massage roller devices I have used and it comes in a box that would make it ideal for giving as a gift.",3,True
"Bath Bombs,Handmade Birthday Gift Set ,Natural Spa Bath Bubble with Organic Essential Oil, Surprise Skin Christmas Gift for Girls 6 Pcs",[],[],,3.8,36,1542,"This is a nice set for a kiddo. I say that because it smelled sweet and fruity more than flowers and wow did it color the water. LIKE ALOT.<br /><br />Great skin softening too. [SEP] First of all, I love the presentation of these. This would be a perfect gift just as is. The scents are all pretty nice, and I appreciate that they aren’t overly scented once dissolved in the bath. My bath water ended up quite vibrant, but I didn’t experience any tub staining. I’m looking forward to using the rest of these. [SEP] There are six of these bath bombs in the set. They are more on the small to medium size. They are well packaged and have paper wrapped around each one. I like that they are individually marked with their scent. They are also sealed with plastic so they will not get damaged or wet before their time. The color is really very and are variegated. They provide color in the tub and a fairly light aroma. They are average bath bombs. They certainly do enough to fill the tub with a little bit of foam and color. Overall this is a very average set. The set is nice but doesn’t fill a bathroom with yummy smells like others I have used. It’s more mild. [SEP] Gave these to my daughter for her new job. They are so nice to yes in the bath after a long day at work. She loves these. [SEP] These are very generously sized bath bombs. They come individually wrapped which is nice in case you want to gift them individually. If you're planning to keep them for yourself they work well even in larger tubs to fizz up the water and add plenty of color. These also have really nice scents although it's a little hard to really distinguish one scent from another. The swirling colors through the bath bomb do make the water a really pretty marble effect initially and then of course as the water blends more together you get more of one tone but it's quite pretty while these are dissolving. [SEP] This 6 pack of bath bombs are excellent. Super moisturizing, great scents, and really great for relaxation. They break down fully in the tub, don't leave any residue on the side walls of the bath, and are overall a great buy. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:870fa8382acbb2688495a9dbdf80d816]] Overall I think this bath bomb set is cute. The current price ($9.99) is a great deal for getting 6 bath bombs.<br /><br />The bath bombs are a bit on the small side compared with products from Lush or other handmade options.<br /><br />Each of the bath bombs smells really nice. They fizz up nicely. I have a small bathtub so I think the smaller size worked well, but if you have a large tub, I could see one bomb not being enough.<br /><br />I felt like it made my skin feel softer and more moisturized after using one.<br /><br />I tested out the green tea bathbomb. It made my bathwater a pretty vibrant shade of green, but it did not leave any color behind on the tub, or my white bath pillow, or my white towels when I got out so that was great!<br /><br />One small thing to note is that they wrapping is plasticy, and then when you take off the white wrapper there is another plastic layer beneath that. So have a pair of scissors handy when you are about to use one. The packaging and the plastic 'grass' it was nested in inside were sort of cheap feeling. But overall I still think this is a great set for a great price. 4/5 stars [SEP] These are so fun! The relaxing scent and moisturizing it gives off are wonderful! Also the cute colors it turns your bath! We went through these so fast. Even the men in my fam got use! [SEP] I absolutely loved the smell of this one. I've tried a lot of their bath bombs and this one is my most favorite so far! It's an incredibly sweet, but soft smell, which I really enjoyed. The color scheme was also beautiful, as always. Would really recommend if you like sweet-smelling bath bombs. [SEP] Love the different colors in these bath bombs. Makes me feel so relaxed when bathing. They fizz up really nicely and feel velvet soft and smooth in the water. Comes in giftable packaging!",3,True
"Lady Shaver and Trimmer for Women-Electric Cordless Bikini Trimmer Electric Painless Lady Shavers Rechargeable Wet & Dry Hair Removal Epilator for Face and Body,Arms,Legs Blue…",[],[],,3.4,31,2379,"Received this for my wife.<br /><br />She's been using it for about a month now and reports that its a good trimmer.  She regularly uses it for legs and armpits and that ""other"" area.  Good for leg/armpits all year round as well as winter maintenance in the ""other"" area.<br /><br />She does say that you if you have dark/thick hair you still need to wax if you're going to the beach/pool - but light/fair hair will probably not need to.<br /><br />My electric shaver was out of power and I used it on my face - thankfully it worked.  I see it as revenge, since I know she's been using my electric shaver without my permission... [SEP] This is a great shaver for woman.  Easy to use and waterproof for use in the shower.  Holds a charge well and recharges in just a couple hours.  Very easy to clean and no nicks or cuts.  Gives a very close shave, and no razor burn or bumps. Great for legs and armpits and any other areas you may need to shave. [SEP] This appears to be a good lady shaver and trimmer.  She has used it for about a week and has been happy with the results.  Easy to use.  Includes the USB charging cord.  This set even includes a small bag to store everything. [SEP] The regular shaving head is not the smoothest but it does a decent job. The foil shaver head really does remove stubborn stubble and leaves a smooth surface. The bag that comes with the unit isn’t sewn that well but the material is nice. A bottle of oil is included, but the cap is not secure and will leak. [SEP] This shaver does a nice job of removing hair. It comes with the needed accessories, including another head. The directions give a general description on how to use the different parts of the shaver. They do not mention the other head and how to change it out. I feel that is something that should have been included in the instructions. [SEP] This little cordless electric shaver works well on legs and underarms.  The double edge razor works best for initial shave pass and then the foil head can be used for remaining short stubble as necessary.  Both heads worked smoothly with no signs of nicks, abrasion, or irritation.  The heads can be exposed to water and shave cream, but we prefer to keep the body of the shaver as dry as possible (despite the claimed IPX7 waterproof rating).  If used in the shower, I would dry the body off quickly when I was done.<br /><br />In terms of charging, it holds the charge plenty long for a shave and charges fully in under 2 hours.  It uses a USB charging cable (included) -- and I wish it came with a wall charger, but no such luck (you have to provide your own USB power source).<br /><br />The storage/carry bag is a convenient way to keep the kit together.<br /><br />It is not clear what the guide combs are used for -- looks like beard grooming attachments used by men.  They seem kind of useless for a women's razor (perhaps to loan to her husband if he forgot his razor on a trip?).  Weird.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nifty women's electric shaver that is effective and convenient. [SEP] I am not a fan of this shaver. I believe you can get a better shave for far less price and hassle of having to charge it. This isn't effective and let me down with what I had hoped it would do. [SEP] This comes in a cute look and color. I like the variety of attachments and the bag it comes with to put everything in. What I didn’t like was the shaver. The angle has to be just right to get a close have. Any other angle and it doesn’t get a close cut or it pulls the hair. Gave me razor burn after each use. I’ve been trying to find a good dry shaver and this is not it. [SEP] Very nice ladies shaver and epilator system comes with a nice caring bag. Colorless you can use wet or dry this is a very nice shave it shaves very well it is also reasonably priced I would definitely recommend [SEP] I was a little disappointed when I thought this unit didn't come with a cleaning brush as shown.  I looked and looked in all the bags and no brush or oil.  It's on the underneath side!  I am glad I checked before throwing the container away!  This is a nice small shaver.  Perfect for travel and everyday use.  It does a good job of getting all the hairs cut.  I have always found manual hand shavers to give a closer shave than electric.  It's true with this rechargeable shaver as well.  But it's so much more convenient to use.  This one uses a USB rechargeable cord.  Charges in an hour and last about one and a half hours.  You can use it on your face, bikini area, legs, and underarms.  There's two different shaving heads.  The combs are useless.  It comes with a bag which is great for travel.  Nice shaver.",3,True

I have also purchased ""Ting"" to put on my feet and other areas.  Fungi spores can live for a long time so this product is good for shoes, I think.  I say I think because it's not like I have done a scientific study or anything like that.

Easy to spray, no lingering odor. [SEP] It is pricey compared to other older eating sprays, but that's because it is what you'd expect for that higher price. I really appreciate that quality. [SEP] So this product definitely works for eliminating the odor in your shoes. HOWEVER, it doesn't prevent your shoes from getting stinky again after a long day. For that I've actually had much better success with a powder product called Gran's Remedy. It works. But while just using the powder, your shoes might have a little bit of a smell by themselves after a time, so if you really just want to kill the smell of your shoes while at home or something, this spray will definitely do that. I think it is pretty nuclear though, so try not to be downwind of it. [SEP] This stuff is quite strong, be sure to spray in a well ventilated area as it gives off a strong orange smell.",3,True

The very first time I used it, I could hear my neck crack-a-lackin. I have such bad neck issues that I get bad headaches and dizziness. I am hoping this solves both issues. Otherwise, I will need to go to the doctor on the dizziness issue. [SEP] I had high hopes for this after reading some reviews, but I was not able to lay on this comfortably to get any pain relief. With significant neck and shoulder issues, I had hoped to re-train my muscles to align back up properly, but it just didn't happen. That being said, traction was never helpful through my many visits to physical therapy, so perhaps this just isn't the right tool I need in my own recovery journey.<br /><br />It is well made and my mom likes it, though. [SEP] This neck roll stretcher thingy is actually pretty comfortable.  I mean it is definitely something that is pressing into the base of where my head meets my neck but other than that it really wasn’t painful at all.  It is just kind of like a pressure right there.  I felt very relaxed, though, and I actually felt like I could breath easier too - like I was in a good position or my sinuses opened up or something.  I only did it for a few minutes this first time as I wanted to ease into it.<br />It is foam so it is soft - but it is a firm foam - so it is also rigid.  But again - it did not hurt me.

Thanks! : ) [SEP] I have suffered with neck and upper back pain for about 10 years now ever since I was in a car accident. Unfortunately my life will always consist of modalities to keep me out of pain – the other option being surgery, which I do not want. I have four herniated discs in my neck and my chiropractor has told me time and time again that I need to correct my reverse curve by using something like this.  Well, IT WORKS!  You do have to be patient and use it routinely but I do think it helps stretch and elongate the muscles that are tight. I don’t have time to hang on an inversion table every day but I do have time to prop this under my head before I go to bed. Highly recommend! [SEP] Great for traction! This little foam thing helps with neck pain for sure. It's simple and easy to use. I'm not sure about the little massage points but the traction itself definitely works. It's affordable and easy to use! I would recommend this. [SEP] I was super excited to try this baby out!!  I love when u go for a massage and the masseuse lifts my neck up and out like a turtle.  I thought that this pillow would give me that feeling for less than $30 whenever I wanted it, but I was wrong.  this for me was very uncomfortable wherever I put it... the floor, the bed, the couch.  sometimes I felt like the blood was rushing to my head like I was hanging upside down.  its a no for me.  I had my boyfriend try it as well to see if it was me or how I was using it... he was underwhelmed as well.  I hope this was helpful. [SEP] I use it everyday! Traction feels great [SEP] Yarkor Cervical Traction Device is as described on the product page but, although it is memory foam, it is much harder than I expected. It weighs 11.2 ounces and while it has some give if one presses a finger on it, it doesn’t seem to have any give against one’s neck.<br /><br />While the traction position does work, it does not relieve my neck pain and the hard material is very uncomfortable for me and doesn’t seem to improve with each use.<br /><br />I really had high hopes that this would be the solution that I needed and that I would be able to obtain some relief from neck pain but, unfortunately, for some reason my neck felt worse after using it.  This may work for some but, for me, using a softer device, even a rolled towel, is a better choice. [SEP] I have issues with my C4,C5, and C6.

Ceramic Hair Dryer Fast Drying,[],[],,3.7,51,7347,"I really like this ionic hair dryer for quickly blow drying my hair. It's really lightweight which helps as it takes a while to fully dry my thick, wavy hair. I like that it comes with a diffuser attachment as I use it quite alot. I do feel like it has cut down on the drying time vs my older standard blow dryer. Not sure I'm noticing less frizz or anything super special, but I do prefer it to my other one. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:3c7f3f1d5fde35bb98555c8703900a2c]] This is a beautifully designed hair dryer. The layout of the buttons are a little different from your usual hair dryers. For speed and heat, you can adjust it on the back of the ""head"" portion. For on/off and a shot of cool air, it will be where the handle is. The way I dry my hair is I go back and forth with both the heat and speed depending on how dry my hair is getting, so if I'm using the dryer I would have to briefly stop, bring it down to my eye level view, press the buttons, and continue. Although this does a great job of drying my hair, it just isn't as smooth for me in that sense. My fingers can't reach those buttons when I'm holding on to the handle.<br /><br />I also found the sound to be quite loud. I'm not saying it is any louder than other hair dyers but probably about the same. It says 60 decibel and I don't know what my other hair dryers are on the noise level but it doesn't feel like it is any less loud.<br /><br />I really like the magnetic nozzles that just snap onto the head. You can also turn it around if you want the wind to go a certain direction on your hair. I like the variety of nozzles they provided, which you usually don't get with other cheaper hair dryers.<br /><br />What makes this hair dyer special is the negative ions/lava nutrients but I didn't notice much, if any, difference on my hair. I have long hair, quite dry and sometimes frizzy from damage of hair dyes, so I don't think any special technology will do much to fit it. If you have good condition hair, perhaps you'll get a more noticeable difference. Mine is too tangled up on a daily basis to notice.<br /><br />Make sure to remove all the sticker that was protecting the machine prior to use. There was one I forgot to take off, which seemed to be blocking the air so the machine was making an extra loud muffled noise. Make sure to check the entire machine to ensure you removed the packaging, which can be dangerous especially when the machine/wind starts getting hot.<br /><br />Overall this is a beautiful hair dryer with a cool, modern design. I do like it but it isn't the hands down favorite one for me. If you don't mind about the layout of the buttons perhaps this will be an excellent choice for you. [SEP] This ultra sleek ceramic hair dryer is attractively crafted to be both amazing in appearance and functionality! It doesn’t just blow my damp hair dry, it’s also designed to truly pamper my golden strains.<br /><br />Its brushless motor takes true power to the next level, and the lava ceramic heater controls air flow to nurture my hair when others only causes damage. It graciously gives me the options of multiple cool and heating settings, so it always stay three steps ahead of my beauty needs.<br /><br />Plus, its negative ion technology is unmatchable, spoiling my fussy locks with the love of millions of negative ions, and leaving my hair silky and dreamy looking. I use this amazing blow dryer on my hair… and my kids hair… and even my hubby’s precious shoulder length locks.<br /><br />And the four rotational attachments are modernly magnetic, so whether drying strains of hair, or styling my own look for a day of gorgeousness - this amazing blow dryer gives me flawless results! [SEP] This is a high performing hair dryer. It blows out plenty of air. It has three speeds of air and three heat temperatures, plus cool air only. The heat gets pretty hot. So, watch you don't get it too hot for your hair or scalp. There are two attachments that you can use - the concentrated funnel and the diffuser. They attach magnetically and hold well with no worry of falling off. The concentrated funnel attachment also has two end pieces - one a comb (smoother) and one a super concentrated (styling). The only problem with these addition pieces is they are very difficult to get out of the end of the attachment. They need an indentation to grab hold of.<br />The packaging is very nice. I appreciate that it states there is low radiation. The cord seems really heavy duty. It is 8 foot long and has a GFCI plug on it.<br />This dries my hair well and leaves my hair with no or few tangles. This hair dryer is well worth it. [SEP] This hair dryer came in very nice packaging that would make a nice gift. The hair dryer seems well made and is high quality. I've been impressed with its drying power and performance. Easy to use, looks good, works good. [SEP] Lightweight, with excellent design. Great drying power with intelligent control system. Great for traveling or home use. Was exactly as advertised. [SEP] First of all, the packaging is impressive. The outside of the box looks sleek and sophisticated. When you open up the box, everything is presented nicely. I say all of this, because I do feel like packaging and presentation are important. A company isn't going to waste time and money to put a cheap product into a really nice box. Plus, it would make an excellent gift.<br />Now, getting to the hair dryer. This is not like any other hair dryer I've ever used before.  It's very light and compact, making it easy for my permanently injured shoulder to use. It will also be small enough to easily pack for vacation. The air was powerful, although it didn't heat up as much as my current hair dryer. I'm not going to count off for this though, because it's honestly probably better for my hair. It's also pretty quiet compared to most I've used. I do not like that the air inlet is on the handle instead of the back of the dryer; I have to be conscious of where I'm holding it.<br /><br />So to sum it all up..<br /><br />Pros<br />Nice presentation<br />Light weight<br />Quiet<br />Powerful<br />Compact<br /><br />Cons<br />Hottest heat setting isn't very hot<br />The air inlet is on the handle [SEP] My daughter loves it [SEP] In addition to everything else,  it's quiet!

About a year ago I gave up the battle with balding and just started shaving my head. Since then I have been on the hunt for the easiest way to do this regularly on my own.  This type of buzzer has been the best solution.  This particular one I would say is pretty much in the middle in the range of best to worst head shavers I have used so far.  I have tried 5 different ones for context.<br /><br />Pros-<br />I like the 6 shaving heads.  It covers a good surface area.<br /><br />The battery stays charged for a good bit.  I am able to shave my head two days in a row before I need to charge it.<br /><br />It also charges up quickly.<br /><br />It doesn't pull and this is actually something that I have noticed in general with these types of buzzers.  If I use this same type on my face it typically will cause irritation but on my head, this doesn't.<br /><br />Its water resistance is pretty good.  I will detach the buzzer head and run it through the sink halfway through shaving and I can immediately pop it back on to finish without drying it.<br /><br />Cons-<br />It's hard to clean the little buzzers.  I can get most of the hair out but it takes a bit of effort.<br /><br />It's not the most durable buzzer, some of the plastic covers have popped off.  This is common with all the buzzers like this that I have used though.<br /><br />I really don't find a ton of use with the attachments.  They don't work all that well.<br /><br />Overall I am a fan.  I would definitely get another one of these if/when this one does need to be replaced. If I get a few months out of one of these buzzers then I feel they are worthwhile.  So far this one seems like it will easily hold up that long at least.  The price point on this is reasonable too. [SEP] This simple electric head shaver does an excellent job at grooming my bald head style! It’s cordless, rechargeable and its design looks just plain fashionable! It feels quite comfortable and secure in my hand, and boy do I look dapper after each close shave. This is how I stay fantastically groomed! [SEP] they say for best results use with shaving cream or some type of moisturizer, but I don't. I use it dry on a freshly washed head (usually after I shower). I absolutely LOVE this shaver!!!! It shaves close enough to get the job done. Its no straight razor by any stretch, but it works well enough to do what I want. Im clean shaven and the ONE thing that annoys me is when people can see that hairline on the back of my head thats screaming ""HES BALDING!!!"" I want that look GONE. This makes the entire back of my head shiny and smooth. So I look like the stud that I am hahaha. I highly recommend this razor! [SEP] Disclaimer *I only use this product to shave my head*<br /><br />This shaver is a 6 bladed electric shaver with various attachments for all sorts of body hair grooming. I personally only use it to shave my head bald a few times a week. That said I have a few comments. The blades are effective if used with a little pressure. I found that I have to go over the same areas a couple times if I use any type of shaving cream, but if I just use it by itself I don't have to go over any areas but the shave is not as close. One feature I absolutely love about this product is the battery life. It has an LED display for the battery life which starts at 100. I have used this shaver 8 times over the last few weeks, and each shave takes about 10% of the battery. For about 10 minutes or less per shave that is amazing. I haven't charged it in nearly a month. It has no difficulty shaving stubble from one day or that has been growing for about 4-5 days. Anything after that and you are shaving for a while (going over the same areas) I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an affordable shaver that they can use in the shower quickly and whose battery lasts for a while. Of the 3 shavers I have rotated between over the last few years, this one is definitely my favorite. I've only had the shaver for 1 month so I will update here if I find that changing the blade in the future, once it gets worn out, is a hassle.<br /><br />Overall 9.5/10 [SEP] Does not pull hair, it cuts very easy at least for thinner hairs, thicker hair is a lil different as it takes a lil more to go over and over with, but it eventually cuts it. It has 6 heads comes with a carrying bag to store it. 8/10 recommend! [SEP] I got this for my husband to use. He likes to shave his head bald, and he felt like it worked very well for that. It is ergonomic and easy to use, and it also comes with six different attachments. His only complaint is that the battery runs out quickly. [SEP] La piezas son facil de limpiar y es un producto de muy buena calidad. Me gusta porque el costo es adecuado para el producto ya que tienen excelente calidad. [SEP] I’ve been using a rotary razor for about a year now. The one I currently have is a name brand with three rotary heads. This one is quite the monster. As you could see from the pictures it’s a nice kit. However holding it in my hand I can tell immediately that it’s cheaply made and it feels more like a toy razor.<br /><br />The hinges on the rotary heads feel like they’re going to break if I push them slightly too hard. The most redeeming quality of this razor is that it gave me an incredibly close shave. I was shocked how close and clean it turned out. It was even better than my namebrand razor. That was probably the only redeeming value. However, it was quite difficult to clean. Each razor head has to be opened individually and then the center needs to be twisted and popped off. This is a bit more than I want to do each morning and I’m sure that blade in the center He’s going to end up in the upside down with the other Demogorgons as it gets lost in my drain.  I found it difficult to keep all of the blades open at the same time While trying to rinse it it clean. It did come charged at 98% which was a nice benefit.<br /><br />I don’t have any expectation that is a last any length of time before I break it but while it’s working and in one piece I’ll continue to use it.  It also looks like you have to replace the entire head at once when the blades get dull. I would think that is expensive as you should replace these every six months at least depending on the thickness of your hair and beard.

I'm testing it as a shaver for the face.<br /><br />Like many of you who are reading this, I've used rotary blade cordless shavers for decades--mostly Norelco. These always feature three floating heads. I've always thought there must be something magical about three heads because that's what everyone presents :-)<br /><br />Well, here we have six heads. Six heads must be better than three, right? I have to say that I wasn't convinced. I figured there must be a reason that the big names don't use a larger number of heads. And after trying this shaver, I think I know the answer.<br /><br />The answer isn't the quality of the shave. In fact, I was impressed at how well this shaver cleared the stubble on my face at the end of the day. It was comfortable and managed to navigate the nooks and crannies of my face and neck as well as my trusty Norelco. But--and this is huge--the ergonomics of the shaving heads leave something to desire. First off, there's very little reservoir under the cutting heads for shaved hair (see photos). This means you'll need/want to wash the head (it's water immersible) after each shave. Second, the middle head of the five doesn't pop up. To remove it, you have to twist it off. It's a bit of a pain--and there's even less room under this head for hair than any of the others.<br /><br />The third issue I have with the cutting heads--and this is huge--is that there's no obvious way to replace them without simply replacing the entire shaving head assembly. This can get costly--especially since my experience with these types of shavers is that the heads start to get dull reasonably quickly.<br /><br />In the kit you get:<br /><br />** Six head cordless shaver with LCD readout of charge remaining and reminders to clean heads and when power is low.<br />** IPX5 water-resistant<br />** Can be put in soft lockout mode by holding power button--good for travel<br />** Nose hair trimmer attachment<br />** Hair clipper attachment<br />** Two face cleaning attachments<br />** Protective packing guard for the shaver assembly<br />** Charging cable (requires USB-A power source)<br /><br />The non-shaver attachments are a mixed bag. On the plus side, the nose hair trimmer works very well. This is in contrast with the nose hair trimmers that come with clippers, which are worthless. The nose hair clipper here works as well as the dedicated nose hair clippers I've used.On the minus side, the hair clipper is mediocre--it operates at a low speed and struggles with any amount of hair. It's not very useful. The face cleaner attachments are probably OK, but I can't imagine using them.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd consider this a decent little kit useful for shaving your face and for nose hair removal. The remaining attachments are, in my opinion, not very useful. While it does a good job of shaving out of the box, I worry that the shaving heads will get dull over time, and there's no clear replacement path.<br /><br />Pros:<br />** 6 head shaver does a good job on the face<br />** Nose hair clipper works well<br />** Li-Ion battery: 700mAh,  2 hours charge for 90 minutes run time<br />** IPX5 water-resistant<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Hair trimmer doesn't work well<br />** Face cleaning attachments not very significant<br />** Shaver doesn't provide much room for hair and will need to be cleaned after each shave<br />** Middle head of shaver attachment difficult to remove for cleaning<br />** Sixth (central) head in shaver assembly does not float like outer heads<br />** Charge port on shaver is not USB-C<br /><br />Note that this same shaver is under various names on Amazon. Shop around for price.<br /><br />The same manufacturer that makes this kit also makes shavers with 5 and 7 heads. (And the attachments, including the shaver heads, for the two models are interchangeable). I did not find that adding a sixth head (as here) added much value in terms of how quickly or well the shaver was able to shave my face. And, since the motor in the 5,6,7 head models appears to be similar, a sixth head means a bit less power to each of the heads.",3,True
Jakuva 10 PCS Nail Buffer Sanding Block Polisher Buffing File 60/100 Grit 4 Way Polish Buffer Buffing Block Nail Files Art Pedicure Manicure File(Black Orange),[],[],,3.5,30,1521,"As someone who does their own nails ... these are COARSE buffers for regular, gel, or acrylic nails.<br /><br />However, I really got them for my rough feet. I live in the desert and most of the time I wear flip-flops out. That results in rough, dry, scaly feet. Not even scrubs work. So, I choose a coarse grit buffer and/or file.<br /><br />That does the job! These are also way easier to hold than a file. And, I get into most of the places.<br /><br />Pretty happy with them. Packaging could be better for storage though. [SEP] These little nail buffers are not just for doing nails! They are great for all sorts of projects & hobbies. They are just like the larger foam sanding blocks that you can get at Lowes or Home Depot, but much smaller (3.75"" x 1"") . So you can have very granular control. However, be warned, they are pretty abrasive. 60 grit on one side & 100 on the other. So NOT for fine sanding. Overall, a great deal for this large pack of sanding blocks. [SEP] This a great little pack of sanding blocks.  I also use this to sand cardstock for card making.  But do love them to buff and smooth nails before adding polish. [SEP] For coarse sanding blocks or nail buffers these are OK. There is nothing about them to stand out, but they do the job fine on acrylic or gel nails. They do lack a side that has a fine grit for natural nails.<br /><br />I use these as cleaning tools and the coarse texture works well to remove lime or hard water marks on porcelain. They can also be used as sanding blocks. With small woodworking projects that need just a bit of touch up, these do the trick. I have even used these in my gardening. Some of the larger seeds need to be clippped or sanded before they can germinate and these work ok for that project. [SEP] Most of us don't know what 100 grit and 60 grit equates to, but when you handle these nail blocks you quickly figure out that both of them are COARSE grits. For many people they will be TOO coarse and will leave nails rough and scraped-looking.  They may work better for tough nails like on the toes, or for tough fake nails, but for buffing and gentle shaping of fingernails, a less aggressive file or block would be preferable.<br /><br />I may end up using these in my workshop! [SEP] This 10 pack of nail buffer blocks is perfect for anyone that wants to do an at home manicure. I use mine specifically for dip manicures at home and get several manicures out of each one. I like that there are different grits on each side, which makes it nice for smoothing out rough areas. They are cost effective and a nice value pack. [SEP] You can use this to sand down artificial nails, or file natural nails. You can use this to get gel polish off natural nails, but I do wish they had a smaller grit because it left terrible scratches in my nails when I attempted to remove just the tiniest little bit of bottom coat that was still on my nail. Like this is 100/60/100, they could have put 3 different sizes making one even smaller for direct contact with the nail bed.<br /><br />I'll still use it to file, and I suppose if I have a thick layer/coat on my nail. Once I get down close to my natural nails I'll have to switch out to another file. [SEP] Priming the edges is a must as they are all sharp. I’ve been using these and wondering why they feel a bit bulky but then I put it side by side to one of my other buffing blocks and you can see this one really has more bulk to it. It’s not the usual square sized buffing block which is also why it’s better for longer nails. I don’t use this for the natural nail, way to much grit for that. I’m able to clean it with a brush after use on my own long nails, then use again several times. Flip over, then use it again and again. So for this set will and has lasted me a long time. [SEP] I am used to a four way buffing block, so these caught me a bit off guard. They are made of a thick foam with an abrasive surface. If used with too much pressure, these will stand a great deal off your nail bed and you could nick your cuticles. Be careful and use this gently. For increasing surface area with acrylics, these work great. If you're looking for a buffer that will shine your nail, look elsewhere. [SEP] These buffers are really hard and can cut your clients. The buffers can not be use in a certain way because of how like hard they are so you can bend the buffer or anything like that",3,True

I’d try and cut them but by time I got one in my fingers they’d freak out and I couldn’t do it safely or the scissors wouldn’t cut through. My husband opened these new clippers and called me over. Within 5 minutes we had every single mat off my dog. I didn’t use any of the attachments for this. The only time was spent locating the mat, once found these clippers removed them effortlessly! We couldn’t believe it. We even were able to get the ones in his feet by using the corner of blade. These cut so well you don’t even have to use your opposite hand for leverage like others I’ve tried. I then used the attachment and trimmed his hair. I am so excited to have these clippers and look forward to doing the next pup. [SEP] These clippers are great for pets who are a bit skiddish and sensitive to noise. Easy to use, adjustable for different lengths, and stay charged for a really long time. Overall great set of clippers! [SEP] I use these clippers on my moms mini Australian Shephard. I am a novice at clipping dogs, but always a first for everything. These cut well for the small areas i trim on him. I'm not shaving poodles though. I would use these on small dogs or if you are just trimming certain areas of a large dog. If I had to shave a large dog, I would probably go with something more heavy duty.

It does need to be oiled fairly frequently, which is probably normal, and there is definitely a learning curve which is also normal. I wasn't ever able to get the comb attachments to work very well, but adjusting the blade height itself worked fine for us. The scissors are very sharp, and the clipper works better than expected.

I recommend this product. [SEP] My wife wanted a back scrubber so I found this and she loves it! It's great for whenever you're in the shower and have a back itch too lol [SEP] The length is somewhere between 31 1/2 inches to 31 3/4 inches. It's not a bad length, but is a bit on the shorter side. The handles are very easy to grip, and don't slip when in the bath or shower. The different areas for scrubbing work very well and are easy to rinse out after bathing.

I would recommend if one doesn't necessarily need the longest back scrubber. [SEP] Easy to clean, and large enough to fit most bodies/arm lengths.  Great for helping to scrub the back without being too harsh.  A helpful product for seniors, too, who may have difficulty reaching their arms around during a bath.

"2 in 1 High Potency Formula 90mcg Vitamin K2 (MK7) and 5000 IU Vitamin D3 Supplement for Bone and Heart Health. Non-GMO Formula, Easy to Swallow Vitamin D & K Complex, 120 Capsules I 4-month supply",[],[],13.95,4.5,108,1596,"For the supplement explorer, the D3-K2 combo has been perfect. Both are vital. Both are micro-volume/dose. Excellent design.<br /><br />The D3 blood test came on the scene as a routine blood panel. I knew that skin produces like 100K times more D3 than science imagined that the body needed. I grew up in Miami enjoying more sun skin time than anyone had the right to absorb. I was shocked! Shocked I tell you ... to discover that I was short D3. How could this possibly be?<br /><br />Whatever, I'm happily in the 'normative range' thanks to supplementation. The implications of K2 are still a bit new, but trust me ... you likely need it. [SEP] I take D3 and K2 every day.  I hate taking pills.  So, having both vitamins combined into 1 pill is such a bonus for me.<br />Pills are small enough for me to swallow with ease.<br />Nice size bottle that will last me for awhile. [SEP] It's a good thing adding basic multivitamins to our daily routine, but sometimes we oldsters require a bit more of a boost for different problems.  Being older, my body requires extra help when it comes to protecting my immune system, and supporting the health of my bones, teeth, and muscles.  This Puregen Labs K2+D3 Supplement is ""all that"" in a bottle.  It's a powerful combination of the 2 vitamins mixed together and put in small easy to swallow capsules.  There's the fabulous ""Sunshine"" vitamin D3 (125mcg), and the supportive vitamin K2 (90mcg) that complement one another.  The D3 enhances our body's calcium absorption, and the K2 transports calcium through the bones - a perfect pair!  The K2 also lowers the risk of heart disease and stroke.  Just 1 capsule a day - 120 servings in the bottle.. [SEP] This is higher dose of D3 and a lower dose of the K2 than other brands. You need to know what your body requires . I already take 5000iu of the D3 , so I’ll have to pause my other D3 supplement as I don’t need extra. Honestly, I prefer to see 120 mcg of the K2 in a formula as that is 100% of the suggested dose. But this formula is high potency in D3 only and that will be perfect for some people . It’s important to find the ingredients that compliment your lifestyle. Some studies indicate that coconut oil or olive oil might help with absorption of these vitamins. The science says that these two are amazing when taken together and will steer the calcium in your blood into the teeth and bones and away from the heart where it can do damage. Definitely add one to your regimen. But read and decide what is the best for you . I will stop taking a separate D3 as soon as my supply runs out . [SEP] I have been taking D3 for years. I take a handful of supplements each day and out of all the supplements I've added to my daily regime over the years, D3 had the biggest positive impact.  At least for me personally.<br /><br />I recently also began taking Vitamin K. Well, this was two bottles taking up space in my supplement's cabinet and it was two pills to take each day. Leading a simpler life is usually a series of small simplification steps and taking a single supplement that does the job of what was previously two different supplements is just one small thing that makes life a little simpler.<br /><br />As for these capsules.  Easy to swallow, no funny taste or smell. Just all around a good supplement. [SEP] I got this supplement because my blood work showed a vitamin D deficiency. Makes it hard to review though. One pill gets me the amount I need, which is nice in my book. I hate when you get a supplement and have to swallow three pills to get the amount you need. Nice tiny pill too.<br />Will have to update in September when get my next blood work done to tell if worked for levels. [SEP] Muy buen producto lo recomiendo [SEP] I read about k2 and am already taking d3 so I'm going to see how it works together.  It will be awhile before there is any results but it came in quickly was relatively inexpensive and I'll order another bottle to make sure I get full benefits.  The capsules are easy to swallow and not very big.  trin [SEP] My wife was diagnosed with osteoporosis earlier this year, and has been looking for ways to improve her bone density. Everything she has read indicates that vitamin D3 and vitamin K2 are the most important supplements to take to improve calcium absorption. Having both vitamins in a single capsule reduces the number of capsules/pills she needs to take each day, and this bottle is a convenient 4 month supply, rather than the 30 day supply in most bottles. They are easy to swallow and we have not noticed any side effects. It is impossible to tell how much impact they are having on her bone density, but this is a good addition to her daily supplements. [SEP] Does this supplement work? I have no idea. Are the ingredients of good quality? No idea. That’s sort of the problem with supplements. They all make these claims, but it’s largely impossible to tell if they actually do anything beyond give you expensive pee. Obviously, I hope this works and provides me with some sort of useful benefit, but it may be the case that the benefits, if any, are subtle or that they take weeks or even months of use to start making a difference. All that I can really say about this is that I  have not experienced any negative effects from taking this. 4k UI is generally considered the safe upper limit for D3, so 5k plus whatever you’re getting from food and sunlight is higher than that, but I don’t think it’s likely to cause a problem, but do your own research on that.<br /><br />Further, regarding supplements in general, you should always pay attention to the dosage. First of all, you can’t be certain, unless you’ve come across 3rd party testing, that the dosage on the bottle is what you’re actually getting. It’s possible that the dosage could be higher or lower. This goes for all supplements. So, be careful and pay attention to any changes in how you’re feeling. Further, before you take any supplement, do some research. Just because something is being sold with a specific dosage doesn’t mean that dosage is safe, or at least safe for everyone.

My back is so happy...thank you! [SEP] Quite an advantage when sitting for a prolonged period on hard surfaces.. Not really &#34;soft&#34; but adds a lot of comfort as your weight seems more distributed and hence the &#34;No-Pressure&#34;.  It is very portable and works on many surfaces. My wife sits on it when on a soft sofa and has significantly less lumbar pain. . I have been using 2 different types of the horse-shoe shaped chair cushions (with the sacral cutouts) for about 1 year  and find these to be amazing when sitting for long periods on a wooden chair.. but they are more rigid and do not quite distribute pressure like the purple... To be honest... I put the purple pad on the chair.... then the anatomically shaped butt cushion and together they are the ideal solution. Most comfortable sitting arrangement I have found ever. [SEP] Ordered this for my Mom who lives all day in a nursing home. So far this seems to be working great for her when so many cushions before haven't. [SEP] Got to use my friends, and love it, sadly my order arrived empty box. Didn't realize how big this version is though so it was better lol [SEP] I'm a small guy at 165lbs, so it took some breaking in for this cushion to finally give my hamstrings some relief...but now, I can't drive without it. If you're a truck driver and you're looking for a cushion, this is the one you want to get as all others WON'T cover the dimensions of the factory truck seat. [SEP] Couldn’t sit in at office chair all day without it. So comfortable, I could sit on it 24/7! [SEP] This cushion is great and is made out of the same great material developed by Purple for their Purple Bed. I recommend their cushion as much as I recommend their bed.<br /><br />This cushion measures 18&#34;x16&#34;. It is perfect for smaller chairs in the kitchen or smaller computer chairs. I personally am using mine in my car (Dodge Durango) for comfort. I find that is is quite comfortable but I wish it was a little bit bigger. I would recommend if you are using this for a bigger computer chair or vehicle seat, get the cushion that is the next size up which would be The Ultimate Purple Cushion.<br /><br />Dimensions are 18&#34;x16&#34;x2&#34; inside of the included washable cover.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Really comfortable for 4-8 hours of sitting<br />*Doesn't smell<br />*Included cover<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Kind of small, made more for smaller chairs (-1/2 a star)<br /><br />Additional Considerations:<br />Take a look at the purple bed and the other cushions they are great. They also have a new kickstarter out for their purple pillow which I expect will also be great.<br /><br />Overall: 4.5/5 stars (&#62;=.5 rounds up, &#60;.5 rounds down) =&#62; 5 stars<br /><br />If you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Poor body mechanics can cause back pain, breakdown of joints etc. This cushion was just what I needed to help me obtain good posture and prevent a sore booty.

Cordless Electric Hair Straightener Curling Flat Iron with Floating Ceramic Plates & Adjustable Temp Portable for Travelling with USB Charging Cable,[],[],,3.4,62,4946,"Won’t but again … teeth on flat iron  get caught in my hair . I had clip them off this wire cutters [SEP] Light yet sturdy and works well. [SEP] Worst product I’ve bought in a long time!!!! Literally NO heat! It’s super tiny. This wouldn’t straighten a noodle!!!! Do NOT waste your money or time!! [SEP] im giving this TINY CORDLESS doll hair straightener 4 stars b/c it is going to reside in the center console of my car.  when I get stuck in the rain, this little baby is gonna hit up the front my my head.  my bangs are always the 1st to kink up.  so, this is the 1st straighter ive ever seen that has teeth on the sides of the plates.  they work as combs that catch and pull the hair.  its a little weird at 1st, but it helps to do the job.  this has 3 settings 320, 365, and 392 degrees.  it has a usb charger, but no wall plug provided.  this machine doesnt give u a super smooth look like my Dyson($400), but it does make ur hair straight, and in a pinch it will definitely help u out of a jam.  I hope this was helpful. [SEP] This flat straightener is great travel size.<br />color is very pretty.  You can use it with or without the cord which makes it ideal for travel. It seems to work ok as a straightener, but if you have thick hair or long hair like me it takes forever to straighten or curl. Since it's a USB connection it has less power than a regular straightener and you also need to have the adaptable power supply. [SEP] This is a cute little flat iron that can straighten and curl your hair. It was smaller than expected but larger than my other mini flat iron. The best part of this one is that it is cordless. I've always found cords on hot styling tools quite annoying, even if they swivel, the cord always somehow gets tangled and in the way. This cordless flat iron charges by a micro USB cable which is included. It doesn't have a lock to keep the plates closed but it did come with a silicone ring that slides on around it to keep it closed. The only thing I wish it had was a safety lock so the power switch didn't turn on accidentally. It's a slide switch so if you were traveling with this, there is a very good possibility that the switch would slide to the on position if it was put in a bag or purse. The outside of the straightener doesn't get terribly hot to the touch even at the highest temperature setting but that is still a safety hazard. I don't use this to straighten my hair since I have naturally straight hair already but I use it to curl my hair which works well. My curls were still there when I woke up. My hair never got stuck when using it. There is a comb on the straightener which helps keep your hair smooth. This would be great if it came in a full size version. I knocked one star only because of the potential safety hazard with the power switch. I like the portability of this and it being cordless. [SEP] So I've tried to write this review at least 3 times and Amazon keeps rejecting it...the only reason I can come up with is that I refer to the hair that hangs in front of my forehead as the reason I purchased this product and maybe they have a problem with that word? Either way, I have that particular hairstyle that falls straight across your forehead, and so often I'll find myself out and about and it rains, or it's windy, and of course that hair gets all crazy and it's impossible to fix without a blow dryer or a straightener. This product totally fixes all my hair problems. It's small enough to keep in my car (dollar bill for size comparison), so anytime I need to I can just fix my hair and feel so much more confident about my day. The little ""teeth"" also really help tame crazy hair. It's also the perfect size for traveling. I kid you not, this was one of the essential items I packed in my Disney backpack (because Splash Mountain is terrible for that hairstyle I have!). It heats up quickly, does a GREAT job for as little as it is, and is really portable. I highly recommend it!!! [SEP] This flat iron is very easy to travel with. It is easy to use and produces a curl even in short hair.<br />When I took it out of town recently, I did have to place painter's tape over the power switch to keep it switched off in my bag. I feel like a case would go a long way in preventing accidents. [SEP] smooths but does not straighten [SEP] That’s all I’ve got for a review. It won’t hold a charge long enough for me to go out and use it!",3,True

My wife travels to Alaska for work and she can have a difficult time sleeping during the summer when it does not get dark.  Plus, purple is her favorite color.  She took them recently on a trip and these were her thoughts:<br />• The mask will block out the light if you get it adjusted on your face correctly.  However, when I had full coverage, the elastic band was folded uncomfortably behind my ears.  When I would move it for better comfort, the light would shine through.<br />• They are well padded and comfortable on the face.<br />• The stitching is well done.  The adjustable band is reinforced to keep it secured and lessen the change of it tearing off.<br />• It is contoured so it does not sit flat on her eyes.  She does not wake up with mangled eyelashes.<br />• The elastic band has Velcro to adjust its length for a better fit.<br />Overall, this is a well-made sleep mask for the price.  My wife will use it when she needs to, but not on a regular basis at night of how the band fits too close to her ear. [SEP] This eye mask is very comfortable, and unlike my previous mask, it genuinely blocks all of the light out. My other one is made of contoured foam like this one, but the inner padded design around the nose area is what makes the difference: that is what prevents light from peaking in from the middle of the mask. Great design, reasonable price. [SEP] I have tried so many sleep masks over the years, and this is in my top ten.  It's comfortable and easy to wear.  The strap is adjustable and it isn't bulky under my head when I'm sleeping on my back.  It washed well in a lingerie bag and hung up to air dry.  The material and foam are both soft against the skin.  I have long lashes and masks usually rub against them and drive me nuts, but this stands far enough away from my eyes that it doesn't bother me.  These work really well for blocking out all light.  A+++ [SEP] This is my second sleep mask and I've been surprised at how much better I sleep with one.  I guess I never knew the extent to which ambient light was disturbing my sleep.  The velcro strap makes this mask easy to size, the fabric is very soft and the biggest improvement over my other mask is the enhanced eye cups. By extending out the eye cups the mask doesn't press against my eyes or leave any marks, and it does a better job of keeping out light, especially at the bridge of the nose.  At the price it's a great value too.  Highly recommended! [SEP] It may not be manly to admit, but I wear a sleep mask. I am pretty sensitive to light, and when I wear a mask, I sleep a lot better than if I don't wear one, especially in the morning hours. Research shows darkness is extremely helpful in promoting sleep and overall health (one study found sleeping with a street light outside raised cancer rates).<br /><br />This mask is pretty standard. It's comfortable and covers most of my field of vision. It does the job pretty well for an amazing price when compared to some of the others I have purchased in the past.<br /><br />So, if you want a nice mask that is comfortable and inexpensive, this is definitely a great option. [SEP] This sleep mask is very comfortable to wear.  The “eye” sections are contoured enough so that it does not touch my eyelashes at all, and so it does not mess up my mascara.  The contour of it also makes it fit right to my face, so it does not let in any light.  The elastic strap has a section of Velcro in the back so it is adjustable to fit different head sizes.  The instructions say to adjust the “nose flap” for comfort.  I don’t see any nose “flap” at all, so I think they mean to adjust the position of the mask on the bridge of your nose so that it sits comfortably (and it IS comfortable).  The strap is securely sewn to the mask, so this looks like it will last a while.  The material is similar to a padded bra or the cup built into some ladies’ swim suits (so it will hold its shape).  The inside of the sleep mask is black and the outside is dark purple.  This is a nice mask and I do recommend it.  If my review was helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking “helpful”.  Thanks. [SEP] I have never worn a sleeping mask, before, so this is a new experience for me.  I thought it might help with my insomnia.  Still waiting to see if it has an effect on that over time.  For now, I can say it does an excellent job of blocking out all light.  The molded cups keep the mask well away from my lashes, so no discomfort in that regard.  The strap is adjustable, so finding your perfect fit is pretty easy to do.  It’s purple, so that’s awesome.  The price is quite reasonable, I think, so most can afford to try it out without it taking a big bite out of the budget.  I am happy to recommend this mask. [SEP] My daughter and I do a lot of overnight Girl Scout events where at least some lights are left on, so a sleep mask comes in very handy.  I tried this sleep mask at our most recent overnight this past weekend.  The mask is made out of a silky material that is padded for comfort.  The mask has a shape that fits around your nose and over your eyes instead of touching them.  It was very effective at blocking out light and comfortable to wear.  The elastic band can be adjusted with velcro and is softer on the side that is against your face.  I wear my hair in a bun when I sleep, and I did find that the velcro easily caught on my hair and pulled it.  It was fine once the mask was on, but not pleasant getting to that point.  The pictures in the listing specifically say that the velcro is non-stick to hair, so I’m taking away a star for that issue.  Otherwise the sleep mask works great! [SEP] We have all tried to wear this and it just doesn't close out the light for any of us.  The mask itself is dark but the entire mask is somewhat firmly formed, so that it doesn't have any soft edge to effectively seal around the face.  Also, when I tried to sleep in it, it just wouldn't stay in place at all.  Just not a good design.. [SEP] I like this eye mask. It really helps block out the light. The 3D aspect of it is nice; this way you don't have that pressure on your eyes (especially when opening them up). I have used it with my CPAP and I really didn't have much of an issue using both of them at the same time.  I felt that this one had more coverage than another eye mask that I tried. I'm thinking of using it when I try to start meditating to help me focus more.",3,True

[SEP] The front of the bottle says it has oil from wild Pollock and the back says it contains Tilapia, which is generally an unhealthy farm-raised fish that should be avoided. If the tilapia is only used to make the gelatin, the label should mention that. Oil from fish at the low end of the food chain would be better since those fish are less contaminated. Anchovies and sardines would be better. This fish oil does not have independent quality verifications listed, which is important for fish oil. This lacks IFOS certification or certification from LabDoor. If this is a natural triglyceride form of the oil, that means it is more likely to have contaminants. If this is synthetic triglyceride form, they should mention that. Other products that use AlaskOmega oil are IFOS certified, so there is a chance that this oil would pass those same tests, but the company should advertise that more.<br /><br />They added lemon flavor to the oil inside the capsules, which is unusual. It might be done to mask the taste of low-quality fish oil from people that open the capsules to evaluate freshness.<br /><br />The bottle is nice. The current price is $64 for 90 servings, or $0.71/serving. Doctor’s Best is selling very similar AlaskOmega Ethyl Ester oil for $0.43/serving. SmarterVitamins is also selling a nearly identical AlaskOmega product for less money. [SEP] It’s amazing this fish oil is traceable back to the fishery it came from.  My doctor said taking 1000 mg daily should be enough for me. This is my first experience using this product and so far my impression from reading about the company is they are extremely sensitive to recycled plastics and saving the environment. I didn't have any side effects after taking this fish oil. Digestion is most always an issue today with foods as many are just that, indigestible. I like this product’s ingredients are and they appear to be one of the highest quality fish oils on the market. I started one before eating. I may up the dose by one in the evening and if any changes occur will update later.  So far nothing to complain about and the product deserves 5 stars. [SEP] My house believes in boosting the immune system with healthy additives like Fish Oil.  I would recommend.  Me and my roomies take it every day. [SEP] Great product! I take one daily. [SEP] This product seems to be of okay quality. I am wanting to give it more time to see the full result. I am not sure that I have seen any result from this product. However, there is no fishy after taste, upset stomach, or nausea when taking this product. I wanted to note that I did find something floating in one of the capsules (it is a little hard to see in the photo) which was a little concerning but I am going to give this company the benefit of the doubt. I like that they are conscious of the environment. [SEP] This is a great product.  I worry about an after taste when taking fish oil.  This product doesn't have any after taste at all.  Its easy on your stomach.  Highly recommend! [SEP] Good cheaper high dose omegas. Seems to be quality sourced. [SEP] I am absolutely in love with True Grace products. And this one is no exception. I generally don’t feel great with ANY fish oils, and I still don’t know why. They usually upset my stomach, at least a little. So I keep buying them and keep shelving them because I hate feeling bloated and yucky. This one hasn’t bothered me yet, so YAY! They don’t have a gross odor or taste either, which is nice. Fishy, yes. Back-alley of a fish market, no. So far, I am just delighted that I can finally hopefully benefit from these wonderful oils!

When I actually get a few minutes to myself, I’ve been really enjoying this foot massager! It has variable speeds and pressure as well as heat that really help my feet feel relaxed. I feel like it’s a little rough on my heels, and I wish I could turn that part off once it gets uncomfortable, but the disc that massages the arches and the balls of the feet feels good. The part that goes over your feet inflates to squeeze your feet kind of like a blood pressure cuff, and pushes your feet down onto the massager so you get a deep massage on the bottoms of your feet. It comes in a nice box, and would be a great gift. [SEP] The foot bath is nicely designed. Only issue I have is that I like the temperature at 90 degrees. Even when I set the temperature to 90 degrees, it heats up to more than 100 degrees (see photo). There may be an issue with the thermostat. [SEP] For me, the compression with the massage is the cats pajamas. OMG, it is wonderful! The bottom massager is more pointy than smooth which for me, is the only sometimes negative aspect to this depending on how sensitive my feet are at the time. My husband who has Plantar Fasciitis loves the pointy bits.<br /><br />The bottom rollers are big enough to cover the entire foot, including my husband's size 10 feet. Not all foot massagers are designed this way. Around the same time I ordered this, I also ordered a soft & plush foot rest style massager. It has massage rollers that are smaller, so it doesn't cover the entire foot but the rollers are smooth. No compression, but you can slide your feet into a little plush cave that is removable. That massager is about $100 less than this massager.<br /><br />If I had to pick between the two, I'd pick this massager by Sharper Image. It is the best massager I've ever owned & I've owned quite a few over the years thanks to my husbands Plantar Fasciitis. This doesn't mean I don't love the other massager. I love them both. The other is more cozy time relaxing, this on the other hand while very relaxing, also offers much more therapeutic benefits. Even though massager means business, I will still fall into a light doze while using it.<br /><br />This also has a heat function. It doesn't get very warm, but it is still nice; never too hot.<br /><br />As advertised, you can flip this over for a vibrating foot rest. Personally, I really enjoy the versatility.<br /><br />If you want something that looks nice, need some serious foot TLC, & can afford it, I see no reason why you wouldn't consider getting this. If you do want it & it's out of your price range (oh how I know that feeling I'm a full time Eco farmer), put it in your carts save for later & wait & hopefully a deal rolls around or you accumulate enough points on your amazon visa to get it free.<br /><br />If this sounds like more massage action than you really need or want, you may want to check out the other foot massager I mentioned. Remember though, it doesn't cover the entire foot bed. I adjust my feet when I use it to get the rollers where I want them. Link: smile.amazon.com/dp/B09P4P3DB6<br /><br />Made in China. [SEP] This is big enough for anyone of us to use as a heat soak with salts. I personally haven't found the bubble feature in any foot spa to be useful, and this isn't any different. Good for cooling off the water more quickly, if you need it. It heats the water pretty quickly, and the drain spout is handy.<br /><br />Don't fill it over the line! As long as you keep it below the fill line, it works great. If you go over the line, it won't heat the water. [SEP] My favorite part of this foot massager is the heat option. The heat with the massage feels amazing. Before this machine, I had another one that is similar, but didn't have the heat option so this was a huge upgrade in my eyes. [SEP] Totally love it had foot problems for over 25 years from a broken heal in a weeks used it was totally amazing on the use of my foot no pain and moved better than it did before a broke it  I would recommend it ever body with feet problems [SEP] This sharper image acupressure foot massager is a well built shiatsu massager. However one of its main features fell really short for me. Overall this foot massager does help reduce sore feet, but I feel like there are better ones on the market.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to set up, you just need to plug in the ac power adapter and plug that into an outlet and it’s ready to go.<br />The function buttons are located in the perfect spot and are pretty self explanatory.<br />Heat function takes a minute to heat up but once it’s at its max, you can really feel the heat.<br />The massager has 2 pinpoint speeds, a moderate and an intense one. Both speeds feel really good.<br />This massager works great for those with bigger size feet. I usually wear a Men’s 9 and the pinpoints were in the perfect spots for me.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The air cushion feature of this massager is useless. I’d compare the “compress” feeling it provides your feet to what you’d feel on your arm when getting your blood pressure tested, but not as strong.<br />This massager is not great for those with smaller feet. My mom is usually a Women’s 6.5 and her toes barely go past the other end of the air cushion sleeve.<br />Overall the air cushion sleeve fabric did not feel really comfortable to me<br />I wish there was an option to adjust the length of the pinpoints so that the massager could work for all feet sizes. [SEP] Love this so much I bought 3. Fits a large man foot up to size 13. Works tired feet!! Love love live [SEP] When I come home, I put my feet in this foot massager, and it feels so good!  There are 3 setting for the air compression and the rollers which is helpful because I cannot go much over 2nd setting without it hurting but that's ok with me and it only has 1 setting for heat and that works perfectly too.  You can set the timer for it to run for 15, 20 or 30 minutes. I highly recommend this!",3,True

THIS brand seemed pretty close.  Same ""Sensoril Ashwagandha"" just more, same l-theanine, a little more B6, plus the addition of GABA and magnesium.<br /><br />I find this blend helps with anxiety that started for me with peri-menopause.  The kind of irrational anxiety that you KNOW is just anxiety ... the sudden dwelling on all things bad & stressful, the sense of impending doom ... THIS blend helps a LOT with that.  I also find it useful as my brains leans toward overstimulation ... I probably would have been labeled ""autistic"" as a 70s child had it been a thing.  My brain does not shift gears well.  It is not good at surprises.  Although I cope and try to be rational when hubs asks me to do something suddenly, my brain just won't let me sometimes.  I call it my ""gears jamming"" ... THIS supplement helps that.  It backs my brain down of the ledge and makes me think reasonably again.<br /><br />Overall ... super pleased with these.  They are just what I was looking for. [SEP] All of the ingredients in this combination are well thought out and researched, and patented, potent forms of them are included. There is no magnesium stearate, etc. in the capsules. I find that this combination helps keep me focused and yet less stressed. Sometimes i take in the evening but it's equally good in the morning. The cost is relatively high for 2 capsule/day use but during a particularly stressful period it is worth it. I find taking 1/day works for me, but my body weight is not much over 100#. [SEP] These caps are billed for stress relief, and I use them to help me get a good night’s rest. I like Ashwaganda, the main ingredient. These also contain Vitamin B6, magnesium, GABA and L-Theanine.<br /><br />You get 60 caps for your $40. [SEP] Obviously it takes time before you can really get the full effects of a supplement. I can’t comment on long term use yet. However, I have had great success with ashwaganda in the past and am excited to see how this works with the combo of other supplements long term. I work in a highly stressful work environment and sometimes it can be very difficult to relax.<br /><br />So far so good! Will update with long term use if it’s anything less than 5 stars! [SEP] This supplement has  a good combination of stress-reducing ingredients and works very well for me. There is sufficient research on all these ingredients, and there is good evidence that, individually, each can reduce anxiety, stress, or promote relaxation. Sometimes I take them in the evening instead of a sleep supplement to help calm my mind, but I also take them during the day when my day is particularly stressful. I've taken them before large, in-person presentations, and I felt so much more relaxed and composed (I get very anxious before presentations) . These capsules are pricey, but for me, the benefits I get from this supplement is worth the cost. [SEP] As always, I'm hesitant to try pills on Amazon but like most of you.....I read the reviews.....and gave it a shot.<br />These really work to unwind you and set in a relaxing feeling at bedtime.....<br />I have insomnia most nights and have to take Melatonin.....<br />These pills helped to relax me....and worked well in conjunction with my Melatonin.<br />Must try if you need to relax before bed.

Took off a star because I don’t know if this is a reputable company for something I will be consuming. Also, Costco is known to have some of the highest quality Organic EVOO, so I usually just buy that. [SEP] Decent tasting olive oil that's good for cooking or using for salad dressing or however you like. [SEP] I have been using this for grilling and salads and it tastes great. I am not too crazy about the plastic bottle though, so I used it to top off a glass bottle that I had previously used and will continue to add to that one. It has a very smooth taste and many, many uses! [SEP] This olive oil has a good flavor and works well for cooking.  The solid white bottle protects the oil from the light and the fact that the bottle is plastic is a plus if it falls as one doesn't need to worry about the bottle shattering.<br />This has been used in several ways - frying, cooking, and baking and each time no negative comments were expressed about the flavor or texture of the finished product.<br /><br />I received this product through Amazon's Vine Program with no expectations but that I offer my honest opinion - all thoughts expressed are my own. [SEP] I am not olive oil expert. I use olive oil to cook with and to make salad dressings and marinades. I also don't like olives and their taste, so a very olivy flavor would not score high on my taste buds. That is how I approached this product. It is very neutral in flavor, which for me is a plus, if you like big olive flavor, this is not for you. It seems to be well-produced. I say ""seems"" as there is much controversy in the olive oil industry, and claims made are hard to substantiate. So for me, this would be a good choice. BUT! The bottle. White plastic #2, and you cannot pour without dripping.... So annoying... I know I can decant the contents into a separate bottle. I want less plastic in my life and it is easy to find neutral olive oils in glass that pour easily at this price point or lower. So..... [SEP] We tried the GreenIVe 'extra virgin olive oil' for dipping, and for cooking some shrimp and mushrooms, and compared to our warehouse brand (or even not comparing it to that), this oil was flavorless.  Really, it added moisture to the bread, but no flavor.  The oil is light, and looks lighter than our other oil.  I really was hoping for some 'wow', this is great flavor, but this just doesn't have any.  We cannot recommend this one. [SEP] ===<br />Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the manufacturer and always write from my true experience. But please note that I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.<br />===<br />Review begins:<br /><br />And let me explain why I say this.<br />\<br />1. It is a lighter color and taste than any other EVOO I have bought in the past. The taste is light and fruity, but it is not, in my opinion, what an Extra Virgin Olive Oil (or EVOO) should be like. I have used it on salad, to dip bread in, and in sauces and it just does not impress me, not for the price.<br /><br />2. It is packaged in plastic. HDPE #2, but still plastic. What is the sense of having sustainable olives used to make this, and then package it in something that will end up in a landfill for 10,000 years? HDPE #2 is recyclable, but on average, only 35% of it gets recycled in the USA. I decanted mine to a green glass bottle with a pourer.<br /><br />#3 You really should consider decanting this to another bottle. If you pour it out of this bottle, it has a tendency to slop.<br /><br />#4. This really seems more like a pure olive oil, or this was a 2nd pressing, not a 1st pressing. Granted, this was sourced from Italy and then bottled in the USA and it may have lost something in the shipping, but I honestly do not think this was 1st pressing. For one, it does not indicate that and two, it seems too light to be 1st Pressing EVOO.<br /><br />#5 For the amount and quality, the price seems  too high. This is 16 ounces or 1 fluid pint.<br /><br />So all in all, while I still give it 4 stars, I will be glad when it is finished up, and we go back to what we have been using. Sorry guys, but this is NOT a top Extra Virgin Olive Oil, in my opinion.<br /><br />End of Review<br />===<br />Thank you for taking a minute out of your busy life to read my review.

I receive no monetary compensation for my reviews, but try to help potential buyers make an informed choice. [SEP] I liked this product. It’s nothing special but seems to be good enough for my home cooking. I’ll admit that I’m no expert in olive oil tasting, but I thought it tasted fine, nothing weird about it.<br /><br />The bottle is strange, I’ll admit that, but it’s not an issue for me because I transfer my olive oil into other jars with spouts that I have. Therefore, I can’t really comment on how it is to use the oil straight out of the bottle. [SEP] I will admit that when I received the package I wasn't expecting a plastic bottle but I transfer all my oils into different glass bottles so not a big deal for me. I cook with many oils and this one was no different than the other olive oils I use. It was still a good oil for baking or frying and no bad taste. [SEP] Useful olive oil of what appears to be high quality.  (I am not expert.)<br /><br />Comes in a light proof  plastic bottle which should help it last.  (Keep it someplace dark and cool anyway.)<br /><br />We use olive oil almost exclusively and this works well for all the uses: Oven frying, baking, ""Lubing"" up baked potatos before cooking and so on.

This has been purse friendly as well with no issues of leaking which is another plus. I like using this when I am feeling stressed and also when I am going to bed.

I was able to wipe it clean, screw the top on, and there was still plenty of oil left.<br /><br /> I LOVED the smell when I opened the package. I LOVED it for the first hour I wore it, and then I started to notice a distinctly fishy after-smell. I can only assume it is the hemp's natural smell? I don't know as I have no other hemp oil experience. But it REALLY overpowered the great-smelling essential oils.<br /><br />I have a big nose that smells better than most dogs, so I suppose many people might not notice. For me, it just doesn't work. [SEP] Very strong scent<br /><br />The container came and had leaked out quite a bit. Even though it was packaged very well, almost 1/2 of the oil leaked out. It was double wrapped in bubble wrap!<br /><br />While cleaning the bottle, we noticed it has a very strong scent. I wasn’t able to identify the smell,  it my daughter says it is lavender.<br /><br />I was able to use the towel that was soaked with the oil and spread it on my feet. They were very sore and tired from a full day’s activities.  About a half hour later, I realized my feet didn’t hurt anymore.<br /><br />The bottle itself is very narrow and has a small roller. It works easily and rolls on a small amount, just what you need. Just think the manufacturer needs to add some type of protective tape around the top of the bottle when shipping.

If you’re used to a straightening iron, this might take some getting used to but it works as well. [SEP] To bad I waited to long to return it. It just didn’t do like it says.

[SEP] Bone marrow is a very good source of nutrition that most people no longer get, me included.  I didn't even know about the health benefits of bone marrow until a few short months ago.  When I saw this supplement available for review I wanted to try it.  I think it's very good, and very high quality.  I just can't deal with taking 4 capsule of it each day.  I will have to bust them open and pour the contents into soups or something.  I have other forms of bone marrow supplements that I like better such as a thick gravy kind that is already seasoned and all I have to do is spoon it into a casserole, meatloaf, soup, etc.... and stir it in before cooking it.

All are good forms and if you have no trouble swallowing pills or capsules I think this would be a great choice. [SEP] I don't know what the problem is. I use their collagen and beef live products almost daily. However when I took this, not only did I have stomach discomfort, my energy level tanked. Something in it does not agree with me.

[SEP] PROS: Appears to be as described & doesn't upset my stomach when taken with meals. Quantity was correct & it says it's free of some common major allergens. It's freeze dried to keep nutrients in tact & is sourced from grass fed livestock!<br /><br />CONS: Says 4 is daily dose which means if I am taking it with meals to prevent stomach upset I am only getting 3 a day unless I eat a snack with one pill. It is also a Bovine gelatin capsule which in rare circumstances can be an allergen for some.<br /><br />Overall this is a good product thus far. I will update if things change. Please see pics with my review for reference. I did receive this product for free but that has in no way influenced my review.

"SHINSIAVIEW Milk Plus Collagen Cream 1.05 Oz (30g) l Lithgt and Portable Spout Pouch Style for Anytime(include Travel, Camping) (5 Pack)",[],[],,4.6,10,662,"These pouches are awesome to travel with. A pouch lasts a week! Not the end all be all lotion but pretty hydrating. Smells nice and absorbs into skin quickly. The top cap secures on tight so you can toss this in your bag without fear of leaking. Cool concept. I’m happy to have these. [SEP] Love the packaging for travel. Since a little goes a long way, you will probably get more from this pouch than you think.<br /><br />Easy to dispense. Doesn’t irritate my dry / sensitive skin. Has a slight scent that fades quickly + didn’t trigger any migraines (always a win from something with fragrance).<br /><br />The lotion itself is nice. Easy to blend into the skin. Makes my skin feel pretty nice. The best part though, is definitely the packaging. Besides being travel / storage space friendly, you don’t have to put your fingers into a jar and so you’re not contaminating the rest of the lotion every time you use it. [SEP] It’s easy to use and it gets my skin super moisturized. I like that it doesn’t bother my sensitive skin [SEP] These portable pouches are excellent for travel, airlines, camping, or even sticking down into your purse. The collagen cream is a great formula overall, makes your skin feel amazing, and best of all, no need to lug around large jars or bottles of product. Great for minimizing packing! [SEP] This is a very light moisturizer, which is great for my oily face.  Now, that I'm in menopause (early at age 50), my face is ""sticky"" and has rosacea.  This is one of the only moisturizers I can use that doesn't make the sticky feeling worse.  It's not hugely moisturizing though either.  But I'm hoping that the collagen helps with the wrinkles and elasticity anyway.<br />A little goes a LONG way.  They give you several of these pouches and they are great for traveling.  One pouch is so far lasted me about 3 months and I still have a lot left!<br />Very little to no smell.<br />Pretty happy with the product.",3,True
"18Pcs Bath Bomb Gift Set with Natural Essential Oils, Perfect for Moisturize Skin & Bubble Bath, Bath Bombs for Women ,Best Choice for Valentine's Day, Christmas, Mother's Day and Birthday Girls Kids",[],[],,3.9,29,2880,"Not worth the money very small idk how this got good reviews [SEP] Wife and kids loved these.  While each bath bomb is shrink-wrapped, the rest of the packaging is environmentally friendly.  Nice scents although most seem to be more like Lavender.  The box doesn't seem to have the color coded key to which scents are which, so you might want to print that out. [SEP] I have found these to be so great to have around at the end of a stressful day. Time to put 1 of these bath bombs into a warm tub of water and let my troubles float away. Various fragrances are offered but they are all equally soothing when placed in the warm tub. High quality item and would make a great gift. [SEP] Honestly these bath bombs are alright nothing really stands out for them. I felt like the scent from the get-go and not long lasting at all. The color was pretty minimal when I threw it into my bath as well. I feel like this is a nicer kit for someone whos not looking for something too strong or special that will wow them like a lush bath bomb.<br /><br />I gotta say even though you get 18 pieces they are really small compared to your average bath bomb so if you might need two or it might not even be anything life changing. [SEP] These are super cute! They are HIGHLY SCENTED. You can smell them through the box when you remove the plastic. Great little gifts to treat yourself or someone you like through the week [SEP] great scents [SEP] I spent several nights trying out these bath bombs.  There are two of each scent and they are on the smaller side in comparison to many other bath bombs on the market today, so I ended up using two bath bombs for each bath in my somewhat larger tub.  On the plus side, they are long-lasting and take awhile to completely dissolve, meaning that the scent and oils keep getting added into the water as you're in the bath.  The scents are very light though - it was pretty faint the first time I tried them, and then I couldn't smell the next scent the next two times unless I literally held the bomb right up under my nose.  It's too bad, as what I could smell was very nice.  The other thing that puzzled me was that there was no description of the scents included on or in the box itself, so there's no way to tell which bombs you are using.  I had to go and look at the picture in the listing to figure out the scents.<br /><br />Overall, if you like very light floral scents and have a smaller tub, these will probably work.  If you have a larger tub and prefer a stronger scent, these may not work. [SEP] I use a bath bomb almost every day, so I’ve used many different brands. There are certain things I look for in the bath bombs I really like, though I don’t consider myself a bath bomb snob. There are just certain things I want from my bath bomb as an adult. For me, YULONG Lab’s 18 Pcs Bath Bomb Gift Set with Natural Essential Oils rates as an average bath bomb. I feel they are best for kids or just daily bath treatment for an adult who isn’t wanting that luxurious bath time.<br /><br />These bath bombs are small in size. Now, that doesn’t mean they are necessarily not a good bath bomb. I’ve used small sized bath bombs that were actually quite nice. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case with these. I have a large tub, so I will probably end up using two at a time, which it means I’m only going to get nine bath uses from the set.<br /><br />The areas where I was disappointed with this set were fragrance and water color. There just wasn’t much fragrance to them, even in the box before they went into the water. I don’t like an overwhelming scent, but I do like more than I got with these. The second area was the water color. One bath bomb barely colored the water.<br /><br />The packaging and the bath bombs themselves are pretty. They also fizzed...well they actually gave more bubbles than fizz. They actually did pretty good with the bubbles. They also made my skin nice and soft. They also didn’t stain the tub and cleaned up easily.<br /><br />Overall, I’d have to say that these are average bath bombs. They have come down on the price (currently $19.99) which is more reflective of the type/quality of bath bombs. If you are looking for a luxury bath bomb, these aren’t the ones for you. But as a basic bath bomb, they hit the mark. There is certainly a place for this type of bath bomb. I would possibly gift these in certain situations. [SEP] Bath bombs are very nice and smells good. The only issue is bombs stain the tub. Overall quality is good!",3,True
Kenn & Kitt Hip and Joint Supplement for Dogs | Dog Hip and Joint Supplement with MSM + Glucosamine for Dogs | Natural Dog Arthritis and Dog Joint Supplement with + Omega 3 for Dogs | 60 Soft Chews,[],[],,4.6,37,8156,"My older dogs like these. Feels like a treat & not just another supplement. It has 500 mg of Glucosamine & 400 mg of MSM.

Unravel is a nonprofit organization working to spread knowledge about the grim realities of pediatric cancer and the devastating impact from the lack of funding. All monies raised by and for Unravel will go directly to the fight against pediatric cancer. [SEP] Super fast shipping! My dog loves the flavor. She has been eating them up and she seems to be doing well with them. [SEP] I like this hip and joint supplement. My 5-year-old dog, who can be fussy, also liked this supplement. If you have a senior dog (or a dog with dental issues), these supplements are semi-soft, making them easy to chew. These are small pills - less than 1/2 inch in diameter. This supplement is made in the USA with globally sourced ingredients (so who knows where the ingredients come from). This supplement has the same amount of glucosamine HCl and MSM (per 2 pills) as some of the more expensive supplements.<br /><br />If you have a medium-sized dog (weighing between 40 - 79 pounds), you’ll need 3 of these pills daily, so one package of this supplement will last only 20 days. At the current price of $19.99, that can get expensive.<br /><br />I received these pills in September 2021 and they had a “Best By” date of May 2024. [SEP] The ingredients are great especially with Glucosamine and Omega 3. My dog liked this. But she has diarrhea after that. I have tried several times. She is could not get used to it. You may give it a try. It may work for your dogs. [SEP] I have 2 beagles and both love these, but it’s my one boy with hip dysplasia and a “popping “ knee I got these for. He takes another supplement along with this one but I did see a noticeable difference I. His “pep” and notably his recovery while taking these. He was much spunkier - and that’s a sign he’s not in pain (FYI he is 8) and then after a nice hike or romp in The park he seems to not need as much rest after, so yes I do believe these work.<br /><br />Pro: dogs gobble em up, seems to actually help his hip and knee (most important) and beyond that the ingredients are good, not a hodgepodge of unidentifiable junk.<br /><br />Con: hard to determine benefit with a dog unless you are consistent with routine<br /><br />Verdict: definitely worth the try. I wish dogs could say “I feel much better!” But unfortunately we are left to judge by behavior. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:9dd81ea89d0293b9bcc0e56aad5ebdef]] This is the first time I’ve given this product to my dogs.  They obviously like the taste (see the video) since they both took one without any hesitation.  Since they are new to these treats, I do not have enough experience with them to rate their effectiveness as a hip and joint supplement.  I can say I like the ingredients and they should be beneficial with these ingredients - glucosamine via shellfish, MSM, Yucca schidigera, Chondroitin Sulfate, Calcium ascorbate (Vit C), Vit. E, Omega-3 (fish and flaxseed oil), Omega-6 (fish and flaxseed oil).<br /><br />In faint white print on the back of the package, it says to “double the daily amount for the first 3 weeks”.  My dogs weigh about 32-33# which means I need to give them 4 chews a day for the first 3 weeks and then 2 chews a day afterward.  The package contains 60 chews making a package last only one month with the maintenance dose and for the first 3 weeks lasting only 1/2 month.  At $19.99 a package, it is quite expensive.<br /><br />The packaging list “cautions” which one is giving the treat with food or right after to avoid GI upset.  It also lists warnings to keep away from children and animals and if there is an overdose to get medical care immediately.<br /><br />I like the fact that they are made in the USA but then it list it is manufacted for Kenn & Kit which has a Singapore address.  Humm…not sure what to make of that.<br /><br />I received this product in August, 2021 and the “Best By” date is 5/2024 so they have a nice length of time before expiring. [SEP] This Kenn & Kitt Hip and Joint Supplement for Dogs seems to help my older fur babies. This treat contains Omega 3 and glucosamine, which lubricates their joints, lowers the chance of inflammation, and makes them feel more comfortable as they age. Most of the trouble with a supplement like this is getting the dogs to eat it. My dogs loves these soft chews, and they never refuse them. They seem to consider them a treat. These treats are wheat-free and contain no preservatives. This treat is made in the United States. This deal is for 60 soft chews. [SEP] I have 2 large dogs and my vet recommends giving them glucosamine and chondroitin with MSM. When I had the chance to try these supplements, I jumped at the opportunity. My dogs didn't get any tummy upset from the switch and they're running around like usual on their old bones! Only time and consistency will tell if these hip supplements really do what they claim, but for now I'm happy. [SEP] Small treats. Very dense like a powerbar. My dogs aren't too interested in them and even refuse them some times. I really like the ingredients but have to coax my dogs into eating them. [SEP] I love their approach to packaging:  Great graphics and reseals easily.  My vet recommended starting our young dog on these supplements early to stave off any issues rather than waiting to address them once they occur so we have begun with these as a regular, daily treat.  They must taste pretty good as we now use them for training given that our dog likes them so much.  I will revisit this review once we have a few weeks or months of use.",3,True
"Natural Shoe Deodorizer Spray for Foot Odor & Sport Gear - INSTANT Shoe Odor Eliminator w 12 Essential Oils & Enzymes - Odor Eaters for Shoes, Foot Spray, Gym Bag Deodorizer (4 oz.)",[],[],,4.2,2392,1267,"Cured the stinky feet! Love this. Will buy again. [SEP] This works incredibly well for smelly shoes if you follow the directions. I washed my boots and they started smelling a couple days later so I tried this for several days and it worked!  I was skeptical because this is not a chemical product but it works really really well  and smells great.  I also love that it doesn’t leave any powder residue in the shoes like other products on the market [SEP] We used this on our work shoes.  It works pretty good and being all natural it is gentle on the shoes (and any residue should not effect the feet).  Make sure to read the directions as they are hilarious!  Effects of the spray last about a week but we have tried other sprays and they usually don't even last a week.  Do make sure to rest for color safe fabric as this could potentially spot or stain a shoe (we didn't have any issues). [SEP] My bottle arrived without a lid. Pretty unhappy about that because now I can’t carry it with me in my bag due to it possible getting the spray nozzle knocked off or broke or causing it to leak. The product works but I don’t understand how it could be shipped just thrown into a bubble mailer with no lid and nothing to keep it from leaking. [SEP] I bought this spray to try in my husband's work boots. The scent is a little strong but it seems to do the trick. I just spray the inside of his boots after work and generally the next day, his feet don't smell. The smell could be a little overwhelming for those sensitive to scents. [SEP] This spray works great on shoes that have “that wanky smell” to them.  I sprayed some Sketchers ankle boots that have had that smell since the day I bought them a year ago.  It was frustrating that new boots came with that smell, but they were comfortable so I tolerated them. So I sprayed just 2 pumps into each boot and let them sit overnight.  First off, the minty smell of the spray was very nice, secondly, in the morning the boots did not have that wanky smell anymore, thirdly the minty scent lingered in the boots, and 3 days later the boots had no wanky smell and no minty smell.<br />Amazing.  It has been a couple weeks now, and I have worn the boots 6 times.  That wonky smell never returned - it it wonderful.  This spray is fantastic! [SEP] It works well, and its aroma is, for me, quite pleasant. Follow the directions and your shoes will revive (at least mine did). [SEP] Shipping sucked! Loose in package,  lid off  product leaked. Seems to work well though. Just be aware you may be short of product after shipping. [SEP] I absolutely love this product. The smell is so nice and I like the fact that it’s all natural oils and no harmful chemicals. Will be purchasing again soon. [SEP] I am one of those people who wears my shoes without socks a lot of times, so needless to say, my shoes get a little stinky. I just spray this into them before I put them on, then spray again after I take them off, and this stuff really helps the shoes to not get that sour foot smell. The only thing I dislike is that the scent is REALLY strong, so I have to take it out into the garage to use it, otherwise it makes my closet smell!",3,True
"Skyfoot's Arch Support Shoe Inserts Plantar Fasciitis, Soft Gel Insoles for Flat Feet, Relieve Pressure from Pain for Men and Women 2 Pairs (Beige)",[],[],,3.7,13,235,"I purchased over 20 pairs of these [[ASIN:B01M7VGJNY Dr. Scholl's arch supports]] for my various shoes to reduce my plantar fasciitis pain. They never stick permanently but they work well for me. However, these arch supports look and feel nicer. I particularly love the heart-shaped design. I also tried similar arches [[ASIN:B07YDP8PXS like these]], but now I am liking this better.<br /><br />There are two pairs in this package. It is perfect for a tall arch like mine and they feel very comfortable in my sneakers. They do have an adhesive backing, but I do not expect them to stick forever. So far they provide me with good support. I might purchase these in the future over my Dr. Scholl's or the other ones I just tried. They are all good to me. [SEP] I have issues with my feet. A chiropractor showed me how to relieve the pain by using a golf ball and rolling it around with the area of my foot that happens. These inserts help prevent that from happening and I can do without the golf ball. [SEP] The quality of this particular brand of inserts aren't as good as the other brand of gel insoles I've been using (I forget the name) but it's decent. The padding seems a little less elevated but these will do in a pinch. My sensitive feet love this type of insole because you can use it in any type of shoe, unlike the gigantic insoles that require you to trim it down in order to fit into shoes. I find these convenient and comfortable to wear. Overall I like these, not the highest quality but the price is right. [SEP] Soft and thick, provide support and do not compress with continued wear.  Good adherence, and reasonably wide. [SEP] I absolutely cant go without arch support.  These are helpful in providing arch support in shoes that have none.  Its a little difficult to get them placed exactly right but worth the effort. [SEP] Once I got these positioned correctly in my shoe (easy to do because they're removable and re-stickable), it took me a while to feel comfortable in them. THey are hard even though made of gel. However, if they weren't hard I'm not sure they'd work. I got used to them the more I walked on them and they definitely made my flat-footed pair of shoes wearable (I have plantar fascitis) by giving arch support. I'd recommend if you have shoes that you can't wear due to no support.",3,True

[SEP] I think this is a very good red superfood powder but I can't see paying $46.99 (the cost of one can as of this review) for it.  I have reviewed several other red superfood powders and I don't recall any of them costing that much.  I have several red superfood mixes that contain many of the same ingredients as this but the cost is much less.  That said, I think this is an excellent mix, it has a lot of very good ingredients that are very beneficial for good health,  it dissolves well with little clumping, the color is pretty and the flavor is good.  I've only mixed it in water and like it best that way.  I'm trying to drink more water during the day and I always want either a red or green or a mixture of both powdered superfood in it. [SEP] I'm a busy mom and don't always have time to fix a big nutritious meal... and yet I still want to be providing my body with powerhouse nutrients to keep me going through the day. This powder is the perfect solution for me on days when a pack of crackers I found shoved in the bottom of the diaper bag between errands is what's on the menu for ""Lunch."" You just mix a scoop of the powder with 8 ounces of your beverage of choice and that's it! You've got a powerful nutrient boost! I'm really impressed by the ingredients in this powder. It's full of all the good stuff and free from all the bad stuff. It's sweetened with monk fruit and isn't full of a bunch of added ingredients and dyes. Flavor wise, I thought it was pretty good. It has a very pleasant berry/pomegranate flavor. It wasn't a chore to drink, although the hint of beets was a bit unsettling. I doubt most people would even notice the mild beet flavor, but I have a profound abhorrence of beets, so I'm uber sensitive to the flavor and can pick it up in things where most people wouldn't have a clue it was even there, so unless you loathe beets as much as I do, it's probably not a big deal. I only notice the beet flavor when mixed with straight water. If you make a smoothie using this powder, vanilla protein, a few frozen strawberries and coconut milk, It's absolutely delicious and I don't pick up on the beets at all. This product is definitely on the pricey side, but as with most things in life, you get what you pay for. I would order this again. [SEP] Light, pleasant taste. Easy to mix.

[SEP] This lovely antioxidant blend contains pomegranate juice powder grape seed extract, tart cherry extract, blueberry powder, cranberry powder, raspberry powder and strawberry powder. Besides the fruit powders, this blend also includes superfoods such as açaí powder, turkey tail mushroom and cordyceps powder. It also includes a digestive blend which includes apple pectin, quinoa, buckwheat and chia seed powder. As a bonus, it also includes a probiotic blend. The manufacturer has wisely made sure that almost all the ingredients are organically sourced. It contains natural sugars and further sweetened with monk fruit extract.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it already has 7 grams of sugar per scoop - personally, I don't understand why the manufacturer felt the necessity of adding the monk fruit (which doesn't really add much to sugar content,) to an already naturally sweet formula. I find it overly sweet and so have been using only 1/2 a scoop in my morning smoothie. Other than that, this is a great blend that I am really enjoying. [SEP] Unlike so many nutrition mixes, this one is not only packed with much needed nutrition and probiotics, it’s actually loaded with taste.  You won’t have to hold your breath and swallow to get the benefits, you can just enjoy the flavorful ingredients, knowing your doing something good for your body.  I enjoy it daily. [SEP] I think the ingredients are fantastic and important in helping to keep the bodies Digestive System in as healthy as can be. It arrived on time and in good order too. It comes with 30 Servings and mixes easily and well.<br />  I’m really enjoying it but, I don’t see any information about their Manufacturing and Testing processes and I always like to know all I can. [SEP] I have a bunch of ""Greens"" blends but wanted to round things out and try a ""reds"" blend. I've tried probiotics by this company before and they are unique in that they don't just resell some random blend but actually research and make unique, science based supplements. Given my experience with their probiotic and what I knew about the company from then I was excited to try this.<br /><br />This blend basically has 4 components: a phytonutrient/antioxidant blend with a variety of red berries and beets, some medicinal mushrooms, some gluten free grains, and a small bit of probiotics. In addition this is sweetened with monkfruit, my favorite sweetener. You can tell they really put care into these ingredients because for example they do mention they used fruiting bodies, and they could have used stevia or even some junk coconut sugar and they did not.<br /><br />I have tried this a few different times and it is just a neutral pleasant beet type flavor maybe with a bit of a berry undertone. I wouldn't recommend this just on its own but I don't think many of these powders really are meant to be just thrown in some water and washed down. If you are thinking of it being particularly ""berry-y"" it's more of a beet type powder. In any case I haven't had any problem with things I've mixed it in with as long as a beet and sweet taste is OK in that food.<br /><br />The reason I took off a star is because it is pricey and I'm not sure if I'd get it again due to this but I do think it's justified in this case as they used premium ingredients such as fruiting body mushrooms, went of their way to get GF grains, sweetened with monkfruit instead of stevia, and so on. [SEP] I usually doesn't really like those kind of superfood powders because they taste very weird but this one is different,it tastes really great.I enjoy it having with ice it is like a fruit juice and it has a lot of amazing ingredients like fruits and vegetables as well as probiotics and enzymes which are soo good for the body.I like this super food powder a lot and I definitely recommend it.

[SEP] I looked a LOT of these online and read all the reviews.  This one is really nice and gets perfectly warm.  I DO use it at the highest setting all the time but that is very adequate.  I like that it has a lower and upper heating elements.  The auto-shut-off timer defaults to 8 hours and you can change that to 1 or 4 hours. [SEP] Plenty of room for my feet to fit and move around a bit. Nine temperature levels -- I mostly use level 1 and my feet stay toasty. Can be set to stay on for up to 8 hours. A little longer would be helpful for me since I leave it on all night. But I just reset it for 8 hours when I get up to go to the bathroom. The Anti slip surface is very helpful to keep it in place all night, but still makes it possible to reposition. [SEP] When it arrived, I was amazed at how well made and soft the foot warmer was, and it was perfect in size with enough room to move my feet around inside comfortably.<br />The cords were easy to connect and were a perfect length. I plugged it in and set it on 3 (a range from 1-9 for the heat). It can be set at 2, 4 or 8 hrs and then it automatically turns off. I crawled into bed and put both feet in the foot warmer and within a minute or two I could feel the warmth. I ended up lowering the heat to a 2 and slept so comfortably through the night. I’ve used it nightly for a week now and my feet have never been more comfortable! There’s nothing I’ve found that compares to the quality, comfort and price of this foot warmer! [SEP] I have dealt with cold feet for quite awhile in the last few years. Yep, that happens when we age. I purchased a pair of heated socks, from Amazon. They DID NOT HEAT UP! They were quickly boxed up and returned. I searched for other solutions on Amazon. I found this product! IT IS WONDERFUL!  I SIT IN MY RECLINER and enjoy my feet being cozy and comfortable. I wear a pair of clean socks along with the warmer! I start at setting 9 and usually end on level 2. Using this in the evening before bed has improved my sleep quality. I googled and learned that warming your feet before you go to bed improves the quality of your sleep! BINGO! So worth the money! Enjoy! [SEP] Double sided. This one gets warm.  Large enough to place my size 13 feet WITH my shoes on. [SEP] I have Raynaud syndrome and always have miserably cold feet when the weather gets cold.  Nothing helps, despite warm socks and shoes/slippers, my feet hurt from being like popsicles attached to my ankles. This foot warmer feels so good, I can finally get my feet warm!  I have had it for 2 days and love it.  Easy to use, love the timer, adjustable heat, super soft and warm.  I have been taking it from room to room to keep my toes toasty.  Happy with this purchase! [SEP] This foot warmer is just the best warmer suit for me.<br />Daily rest time on computer desk but feet away cold feel bad.<br />this warmer really so easy slip in and out and 1 -8 hours control and temp can pick just awesome love it for daily use. [SEP] This is exactly as described and hoped for.  My feet get nice and warm without over heating.  The timer works every time.  I set it for 1 hour on a #2 setting.  It has really reduced the pain I was experiencing with very cold feet.  Now I can fall asleep.  It stays warm for quite a while after it turns off.  I don't dare move my feet when using it in bed because the cat has also found out how wonderful it it - he gets upset when I move about. [SEP] Purchased for my mother who has circulation problems leaving her with ice cold feet….she is in heaven with this foot warmer and I’m kicking myself that I didn’t order years ago.  She will no longer have her heater set at 78 degrees paying an enormous gas bill…she’ll just slip her feet into this remarkable little foot pouch.  Great purchase.",3,True
"Eye Massager with Airbag Kneading,Constant Temperature Hot Compress, Multi-Frequency Vibration and Bluetooth Music",[],[],,4.5,146,117,"These is a great sleep mask. I have a few that a too over the top. They just need to be like this one simple and soft. Silk is the way to go. You almost don't know you're wearing this. Fits well and is adjustable. [SEP] This silk face mask is nice against my skin and it does a great job of keeping out the light because of the lower strap. There are two adjustable straps. I had to adjust mine to be as wide as possible. The mask still fits me tightly and because of this, it keeps the light out, completely. Excellent materials and workmanship! [SEP] This is the best sleep mask I have used. It is soft and comfortable to your face–and conforms nicely to your nose and forehead. It has two straps that are extremely adjustable. I can't imagine anyone with a head or hairdo so large as not to be accommodated by this mask. The mask is large enough so that it blocks the light out completely around your eye sockets. The two strap setup ensures that the straps do not constrict, or irritate your ears. Also, the length adjustments are on the side not behind your head so you can position the claps where you need them for maximum comfort. The adjustments are quite small too, not large buckles that would be difficult to sleep in. The silk is all black without any silly designs or logos. [SEP] I got this for a cruise we're taking to Norway this summer - where the sun never sets.<br /><br />Just to ensure I could sleep with it on, I've been using it for the last couple of weeks; and have been impressed with both the comfort and the light blocking.<br /><br />Personally, I was nervous that I wouldn't be able to sleep with something like this strapped to my face, but the silky material is comfortable enough that I hardly noticed it even on the first night.<br /><br />If you're looking for a sleeping mask to block out light, then I'd definitely recommend giving this one a try. [SEP] Great product [SEP] I lost these in a house fire and replaced them with a different version that I did not like. I purchased these again because they’re so comfortable! [SEP] This is a great buy.  Very comfortable, especially with the second strap.  Really no light when wearing the mask.  I would recommend it.<br />J. Gonzalez [SEP] My husband uses a sleep mask every night. Even the slightest light will wake him up. So, I got this 100% Natural Silk Sleep Mask for him to use.<br /><br />He loves it. And he falls asleep very quickly.<br /><br />The two adjustable straps help keep the mask in place while sleeping, but because of the silk,. it's still extra comfortable. [SEP] I had to keep adjusting the straps. Otherwise, it works great! I slept all night. [SEP] I’ve used lots of masks over just as many years, but very few were purchased- either gifts, found (factory sealed in thrift shops, of course) and what appeared to be a lifetime supply of JetBlue “disposables” given to me by an FA friend- there were sort of a go-to collection, when the non-adjustable elastic stretched beyond useable limits, move on to the next pair. But, when I lost them all (and everything else) in the recent CA wildfires, it was one of those things you don’t think to grab under evac orders- sleeping in a shelter tended to make me regret that immediately, they aren’t really conducive to lights out sleep. But then, I am not sure I would not prefer to keep one eye open anyway. As luck would have it, I found a weird zebra-striped unit in the box of donations for we victims, but it was cardboardy and cheap feeling, it made it two nights. I did find two tucked into the suitcase I grabbed as I hastily packed, this was a small blessing (in view of everything else, very small, but I’ll take it)<br /><br />So enter the Tlinna (?) which I liked it right away, it had a baby-butt smooth surface on both sides, boasting mulberry silk on both sides; reversible is a nice touch, and I find either side equally comfortable. Two strap models are always superior, and with tiny buckles for adjustment it’s a lot easier to slide them into a comfortable length. (Continued wearing on the same side molded the thing into what seems like a tiny bra, so I now plan to flip it daily- I take enough flak for wearing one in the first place)<br /><br />The buckles lie flat, and the straps come from the center stitch of the mask, so while it may not be sold as such, I am finding either side equally comfortable. Properly adjusted it is as a mask should be- barely there.<br />No gaudy statement of a print or pattern or faux fur, just a pleasantly opaque blackout. I have had so many MRI’s recently that the imaging place tend to comment on my eye mask du jour)<br /><br />Time will tell how the elastic will wear, so I might pick up a spare or one for travel; although actually needing to purchase one tends to make me keep – a closer eye on it (sorry)",3,True
"Creatine Monohydrate by RAM ADVANTAGE | for Increased Strength, Muscularity, Power and Recovery | 100% Pure Micronized Creatine Powder, Unflavored | 300 G",[],[],,4.7,20,949,"Creatine Monohydrate is the most affordable form of creatine. This is also micronized creatine so it dissolves better. This dissolves almost instantly in water - I stir it a bit with a spoon. The taste of this creatine is almost completely neutral so it blends into any drink. The recommendation is to stir this into water, non acidic juice or a carbohydrate drink. The benefits of drinking creatine is that it helps you increase your energy so you can have more strength and endurance when lifting weights.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review [SEP] I got this to try out after I ran out of my other creatine powder.<br /><br />There really isn't much to say. This is a simple creatine product in which the only ingredient or component is the creatine itself.<br /><br />I find that this product works just as well as all of the other brands I have tried. No side effects or reactions to it. Mixes well with room temp water.<br /><br />I would definitely repurchase but would of course take price into consideration at the time of purchase. [SEP] This is good basic creatine, which is all you really need.  I don't need wacky flavors, sweeteners, or hype.  I take a scoop of this mixed in with my post workout shake, it blends in, and it gets the job done.  This is a reasonable value for this package size, but if you step up to a larger supply you'll get a better price/oz. [SEP] One thing I normally hate about creatine is the grainy texture it gives to drinks. I absolutely hate it when I have to drink creatine and it feels like you are trying to swallow sand. This creatine is perfect. The powder is super fine and dissolves great in water so if the creatine is in something flavored you cant even tell your drinking it. By far the best creatine I've had. [SEP] This product is exactly as advertised, regular old creatine monohydrate.  This is unflavored, as plain creatine is, so in terms of flavor, it is exactly what one would expect.  I have been stirring it into a cup of iced tea, which has worked perfectly.<br />This creatine does mix well, though I will stir it a few times as I drink it to make sure it is fully dissolved.  Stirring 3-4 times for 15-20 seconds each time will completely dissolve 2 scoops into 1 glass of the drink of your choice.<br />After a month of use, I can tell a difference in my lifts as well.  Definitely a slight increase in the amount of weight that I am lifting across the board on all lifts.<br />This is a great value for the money.  Creatine actually works, and this jar has 60 servings, for less than $15, that is a really good deal! [SEP] My husband has been using this for a couple of weeks and while it is too early to see long term effects, so far so good. It mixes well with water and does not leave a chalky aftertaste. His recovery time seems to be better and he has had no ill side effects thus far. You only use a small amount at a time so this container will last a while. He has been pleased and said that he would definitely purchase again. [SEP] Great creatine product, mixes well into your favorite drinks! And Very affordable!",3,True
Kion Colostrum | Grass-Fed Goat Milk | Gut Health and Immune Support | 30 Servings,[],[],,4.5,37,2135,"I've got a problem with  colostrum. It may be perfectly good for human consumption, but the soul that is supposed to consume it is the baby goat. I'm kind of sorry I selected this product for review because after reading up on it I don't think it's very ethically sourced. And it's pricey too. I'm finding it hard to believe that a $59.00 bottle of colostrum capsules will give any more health benefits than many other less expensive supplements. [SEP] These are made Gluten, Chemical and Hormone-Free and all Non-GMO. The goats are all Grass-Fed so, with all of those positive things, I feel like I’m taking a healthy product. The bottle also comes with 30 Servings in it; each Serving is 4 Capsules and you can take up to 8 Per Day, especially if you’re working out hard.<br />  I’ve been taking it off and on for many years (over a decade)and all I can say is that the older I get, I definitely start notice if I ran out and stopped taking it for a while. It definitely helps my stomach and it’s also good at keeping my Immune System in check. I’d recommend checking it out, especially if you’ve chronic stomach issues like me.🙂<br />  Cons: I think it’s a fine product, as I’ve been happy with others from them but, I’d like it if they posted their Manufacturing and Testing processes. I like to be able to quickly know instead of having to search around. It’s also pretty pricey but, unless you buy in bulk, that’s often the reality of quality Colostrum. [SEP] Yo he probado Kion pero no está versión, yo he tomado el que reduce los calambres y mas y ese realmente le doy 20 estrellas, pero no lo consigo más. Este producto no me convence. [SEP] Seems like a quality product, but for whatever reason goat milk doesn't give me the same amount of relief as cow's. [SEP] Love that this is from goat's milk. No smell and great immune booster supplement. [SEP] I didn’t note any improvement [SEP] I consider immunity boosting supplements a very necessary part of my daily routine. I decided to try these immunity boosters as I have never tried any that come from goat milk. I always take my supplements either first thing in the morning, or a hand full before bed. There have only been a few rare occasions where I have experienced any sort of stomach discomfort from taking supplements, but these ones do not apply to that at all. So to clarify, I did not have any sort of stomach disagreement from taking these immunity boosters.  I think we should all recognize how important keeping your immune system nice and healthy is especially in today's day and age and for obvious reasons that I don't think need repeating. Clearly if you are someone who is interested in immunity boosters, the chances are that you are thinking along the same lines as I am. I did find the product to be a little expensive or rather on the expensive side , but I also feel that it's working to operate preventatively in order to maintain good health. So from that perspective it's easy to justify the expense. As I have been taking immunity boosting supplements for a long while now, I don't really know how to quantify the results of these, but I will say that I do feel in good health and have had no issues whatsoever. All in all, I would certainly recommend giving them a try. They worked extremely well in helping to maintain my immunity health.",3,True

I have taken it off and on since high school, and it seems to make me feel better when I took it even back then.<br /><br />Ginseng is often rather expensive, and there are other ways to get many of the benefits of ginseng that are much cheaper options. However, ginseng is nonetheless a very renowned herb and known (at least in traditional medicine) to have a lot of supposed benefits.<br /><br />This brand uses mature ginseng (so it has more time to develop nutrients) and also does extensive testing, which is always a good thing when considering which brand to go with.

I also believe that it is effective as an immune support - especially in this cold and flu season.<br />I consider KGC CheongKwanJang [Korean Red Ginseng] Wellness Dietary Supplement to be an indispensable part of my daily regimen now. [SEP] I was really excited about this product. After my recent studies to learn what herbals could energize me besides caffeine, I was turned on to THEOBROMA, which is extracted from the cacao bean. (Crio Bru is another company that is selling cacao bean that brews like coffee) I have been searching for natural stimulants that don't rely on caffeine, which coffee and tea have in them and was excited to try this product. However, this product contains carageenan, which is a huge disappointment! I didn't even want to take it so I can't report how well it works. I know ginseng and theobroma could have been a winning mix, but I din't like ""other ingredients"". [SEP] I've been taking ginseng in a variety of forms for many years, so I'm familiar with what it feels like at various potency levels.  This is really good stuff.  I feel a sense of vigor and gentle alertness and focus boost when taking it.  It's quite nice, and very easy to take in this format.  This would be especially good if you don't enjoy the flavor of strong ginseng, as this is in easy to swallow capsules.

It keeps good immunization all the time, helped good daily life and<br />stay energized and focused. It works ~<br />I'll be buying again for sure! [SEP] 1 of the best korean red ginsengs available.

The flavor reminds me of something I cant quite put my finger on at the moment.<br /><br />The ingredients are very good.. organic, non gmo and plant based are always what I look for in a product.<br /><br />The bag is resealable, and it comes with a large scooper in the bag. The powder is pretty dense.<br /><br />I put 1 scoop into about 12oz of unsweetened non-dairy milk. Unfortunately it doesnt mix well just shaking it alone (will just clump up). You either need a blender or shaken with one of those coil springs, then it becomes smooth and looks like a dijon mustard color. You could adjust the thickness to your liking by adding more liquid, but I found that about 12-14 oz makes for a good thickness and sweetness. I'd consider getting it again, I'm interested in seeing what the chocolate tastes like.

I’m really picky on wanting all of the information I can about the quality of a product I’m taking.<br />  I figure that this company is relatively new because of using bags instead of containers. I always like to see new companies make a success of themselves and hopefully they share more information in the future because, there’s a great deal of competition they’re up against. I would support them.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁 [SEP] I use protein powder on a daily basis for post-workout shakes, and this looked like a solid option so I gave it a try,  I like the ingredients list, there's no weird ingredients, no junk filler, and especially no added sugars.  I tried the vanilla cold brew flavor, and based on the name I was uncertain if there is cold brew coffee in it, or if the vanilla itself is somehow cold brewed and there is no coffee?  The ingredients don't really explain what's going on there.<br /><br />Upon opening the package, there is a distinct coffee aroma, and when I mixed it with water and ice cubes to test there is a faint coffee flavor.  I don't know that I'd call it a coffee flavored powder, it's more a background note, so don't worry about it overpowering other flavors you may add.  The flavor in general is mild and not-too-sweet, which is just what I'm after with a protein powder.  If I want more excitement I'll mix frozen berries in.  The texture is a little grainy, but that comes with the territory for anything made with hemp/rice/pea protein.  The color is a slightly weird yellowish-brown, but whatever this isn't a beauty contest, it's a convenient way to get a hit of protein on the way out the door.<br /><br />My only complaint is the zipper on the bag clogging with powder and refusing to close. I hold the bag closed with a rubber band and am careful not to knock it over on the shelf, but this type of bag is an annoying way to package powders.<br /><br />In general, this is right in my sweet spot for clean ingredients, good nutritional profile, and good but unobtrusive flavor.

I love that they send you so many extra sand paper discs. I do my feet like once a week and I’m no where near halfway done and I’ve had this thing for months now.

All had to be thrown out.<br /><br />This black one is as terrible a pill case as the other colors. The door is difficult to open and the chamber was stuck on Saturday and a half. I cannot even use this; not to mention if I could I would not be able to see the pills. I threw this out. Avoid like the plague. [SEP] Works well for its intended purpose. [SEP] The product came in a plastic bag, not in a box. It was scratched up and extremely difficult to turn. It looked used, not new. The compartment drawer was stuck then it wouldn’t open at all. Overall, I was bitterly disappointed. [SEP] This Pill dispenser is a nice size and it's one of the nicest looking ones I've seen. But, I can't turn it without hurting my hands, it's near impossible! I really wanted this because it would be convenient to carry in my purse and the smooth, round shape would be easy to find amongst all the other paraphernalia.<br />I still thought it was reasonable to give it 4 stars, because this company is willing to replace the item or refund your money, no questions asked and I may have gotten a dud. I really like the design, if only I could get into it easily! [SEP] Easy to use pill case organizer.<br />Love it. [SEP] It's more compact than my other pill containers. Not good if you have a lot of pills to take but works fine if you have a couple of small daily ones. The round design is better for purses than the longer shaped ones and it won't pop open and spill the pills out. [SEP] I was looking for a pill holder for my medicine that was labeled for 7 days that DO NOT fade away after time, is discreet, sturdy, does not open up in my purse, and is travel sized. This item is perfect! It is also very cute and easy to open, refill, and manage. Very happy with this purchase! [SEP] I love these little things! I use a powder makeup over my foundation and the little pad that comes in them gets grubby after a bit because of the foundation I have on first so it's really awesome to have these reusable ones I can use once, place in a netted bag and then wash them when the bag is getting full. It makes me feel more clean too if that makes sense lol. I also use them for my face cleansers to get the makeup off after the day is done. They're pretty handy things.

We promise a 100% commitment to using the very best ingredients in doses that work and are manufactured to the highest standard.']",[],,4.2,31,1546,"Taking Trim Probiotic for Women has definitely made me feel better overall. I've taken probiotics for quite a while now and I always look for ones with a high CFU. 25 billion is a great number. I don't think they've made me any trimmer, but I think I've had less bloating overall. The serving size is one pill per day. Easy peasy. $50 for a month's supply isn't the most affordable, in my opinion, but I do think this is a good product. [SEP] This seems to be a well-formulated probiotic for women. I have been taking it for about a week and I think that it has been helping me, along with the other digestive enzymes, pre and postbiotics that I take. It's hard to quantify exactly how much, but it does seem to help with my digestion issues that come with post viral inflammation. [SEP] No complaints about the formulation of this probiotic. It hits the mark for both potency (25 billion CFUs) and strain diversity (total of 10 strains: 8 Lactobacillus and 2 Bifidobacterium stains). The specific strains are listed on the bottle, but not the specific concentration of each.<br /><br />It delivers the 25 billion CFUs with a serving size of only 1 capsule (2 caps are the more common situation), making this bottle of 30 caps a month's supply.<br /><br />The downside is the price. There are a number of probiotic options that achieve the same (or sometimes better) potency and strain diversity at a far lower price for a month's supply.<br /><br />While the formulation is solid, the very high price puts my rating at 3 stars (average). Equally good options are available that are a much better value. [SEP] Ever since I had a hysterectomy well over a year ago, I began taking pre- and probiotics as directed by my OB to help stave off imbalance and to help maintain good bacteria throughout my system. I've tried several brands and Formula Trim has a great probiotic here! I struggled to find blends that didn't trigger a yeast infection, leave me bloated and uncomfortable, or make me feel ""off,"" and I don't want something that I have to refrigerate. This blend checks all of the boxes I look for in a probiotic OTHER than the need for refrigeration. I was really disappointed to discover that, once opened, this needs to be kept in a fridge. Unfortunately, I have to travel a lot for work and it's not worth it to me to have to figure out how to keep a probiotic refrigerated.<br /><br />The capsules are tasteless and easy to swallow, and I've had no stomach issues or bloat, even when taken on an empty tummy. Because of the price, I began to taper off how often I took these and I was able to get away with taking one every other day and I still felt well-balanced. I don't believe a price can be put on good health, so this would easily scoop up all 5 stars from me if I could easily pack it with me when away from home. [SEP] I started taking this probiotic 5 days ago and so far it seems to be helpful for gas/bloating.  I was taking a couple different probiotics recently and this one seems to be just as good.  I've also cut way down on sugar lately so that helps too.  I took pictures of the size of the capsules for those of you who find it difficult to swallow pills.  It's about average in size I would say.  I have not noticed any negative side effects which I have had in the past with other probiotics.  So much so in fact that I quit taking them for YEARS, maybe a decade.  I have had IBS for 40 years so I've tried a ""few"" probiotics!  I haven't been taking these long enough to know if they help much for weight loss and haven't noticed that they make me feel full quicker.  I also can't tell if they make me sleep any better but I take Melatonin and a little dose of Amitriptyline which helps me sleep.  I do hope they boost the immune system and help with vaginal health as they are supposed to.  I will update the review if I notice any significant changes. [SEP] It was recommended to me that I should take a probiotic for stomach issues I kept having.  After a week of taking this I noticed a big difference.  I would love to give all of the credit to this supplement, but I will continue to take and see if I continue to see results.  I worry about the cost.  Not sure I can stay on these for long term - cost too much. [SEP] I've taken 3/4 of them.  I don't notice that my digestion is any better or any worse.  I'll take them all and if something suddenly changes for better or worse, I'll let you know. It says ""trim"" on the label, but I haven't lost any weight. I haven't gained any either. I don't think I'm doing anything differently. It's a mystery to me. [SEP] Easy to swallow. No after taste. Vegetarian. Gluton  free. Take 1 capsule daily before or during meals. 30 per container. I’ve been taking about a week. [SEP] 10 different strains of probiotics!  Easy to swallow pill.  This should probably be a part of everyone's daily supplement intake. Helps keep the gut biome balanced for overall health and longevity!  So many of us have wacked out gut bacteria from the chemicals and pharmaceuticals that are in our lives, that adding probiotics are pretty critical to maintain our health. [SEP] I've been taking many different brands of probiotics over the years and the ones that are made specifically for women seem to work the best. After taking this probiotic for about a week I noticed an improvement in my bloating. Normally I get very bloated after eating certain foods or when I'm on my period but this month my stomach was noticeably less bloated. I take this first thing in the morning on an empty stomach as this helps the probiotics work better.",3,True
ComfyCloud Swivel Seat - 360 Seat Cushion Pivots to Allow You to Easily Get in & Out of Seated Positions - Swivel Chair Cushion Is Portable & Lightweight,[],[],,3.8,38,3215,"Can't say I would ever use this.  It doesn't fit well in a car seat and isn't comfortable enough for the house.  I like the idea, but it isn't functional in a front bucket seat in a large car. My husband needs a little help in and out of the car and this was of no use to us. [SEP] works great [SEP] Thought Dad (age 94) would love this, but he had a little trouble with it.  Not sure why. [SEP] The seats in our Suburban are a little narrow, and the swivel doesn't sit even. It's a little awkward but works. [SEP] The &#34;comfy cloud&#34; has flattened out after a few days of use, the swivel part is still fantastic which is why I gave 3 stars. [SEP] Extremely helpful. My daughter has down syndrome and was hard to get her in out the car. This helped and is fun for her! [SEP] COMFORTABLE AND MAKES GETTING IN AND OUT OF ANY SEAT LESS OF A STRUGGLE. GREAT FOR ASSISTING  SENIORS OR ANYONE WITH BACK OR HIP PROBLEMS GETTING OUT OF A CAR, WORKS IN PASSENGER SEAT OR DRIVERS SEAT. JUST SIT SQUARELY ON SWIVEL SEAT TURN YOUR BODY SLIGHTLY AND STEP OUT. TRY IT, IT WORKS! [SEP] This is a blessing! I bought it for my wife, who just had a hip replacement. It helps her a lot in getting in and out of the car. It is strong and steady and perfect height. Doesn't bother in driving at all. [SEP] The ComfyCloud was something that interested me because I have really bad Arthritis and back pain, which is a big issue seeing that I am only in my 30’s. So sitting in a spot for awhile and then trying to twisting sideways to get out of an office chair or the car is very painful anything that helps even a little is a huge deal and the Comfycloud seat is great.<br /><br />The seat itself is made out of foam top of a plastic base that spins 360 degrees. This means you can use it in any direction. On the bottom of the base is a grip pad, this is wonderful because you can use it on all chair types and not worry about it moving around. The top is actually a gray cover that is really soft and plush. The cover has an elastic type band around it holding it around the foam edges. The cover itself can be removed and washed. I took the cover on and off with ease although I didn’t wash it yet.<br /><br />The ComfyCloud is very lightweight. I measured it across at about 15 inches. And the foam is about an inch thick. I found it to be very comfortable to sit on and swivel with. Even after sitting for a long period of time the foam did not sag. I also had my husband try this and he was able to use it so it does work great for different body sizes. I love this seat and will be continuing to use mine.I recieved this item for free for my honest and unbiased opinion. [SEP] Received as promissed. Will continue to purchase from this vendor.",3,True

The Cowboys emblem takes up the entire front side of the bag as can be seen in the attached picture.<br /><br />What I like about these is that they expand at the bottom. In the picture, the bag contains two 17.63 ounce containers of marcona almonds and I had room to spare.  The expandable bottom ensured that these stand up on their own.  Overall, I really like these. They do feel a bit thinner than other Ziploc bags but not so thin that it matters much.<br /><br />These are great for storing nuts, cheese, crayons, a wet bathing suit, and anything else that can fit into a one-gallon bag. At the current price of 9.99, this comes to $.50 cents per bag. [SEP] I'll date myself here, I have been a Packers fan since Vince Lombardi days - lol. You you can surmise I was thrilled that Ziploc has Packers storage bags - easy choice to make. [SEP] Go Steelers [SEP] let me start off by saying, i'm from philly, home of the superbowl champs, the Eagles !  Dallas is not very welcome around here however, i do like to jab my husband every now and then.  I will be using these for tailgating.  We have season tickets so I will be taking these to a few games, just to freak people out.  I used one to hold some cut up watermelon and take it to work for a few coworkers.  it zipped and unzipped fine.  it didn't leak and didn't stretch.  When i unpacked it at lunch, there wasn't even a drip that came out of it.  for me, that's important.  i take fruit to work every day and also pack fruit for my whole family. i use smaller bags for them but i was treating some coworkers so i needed a large bag like this.  i used a bag to store some soft pretzels and put them in the freezer.  you really can't go wrong with ziploc.  the only thing different is the logo on the bag.  it's really a beautiful star, dallas cowboys star. if you are a dallas fan or know one, this would be a great gift for them.  what i like about ziploc bags is the zipper.  i have had others that the zipper gets stuck and i land up breaking it and the bag is useless.  i used 4 of these bags and the zipper was easy open, and easy close and strong.  i have broken zippers by tugging too hard also.  these are great bags.  this is my normal brand that i buy and have always bought, without the dallas star lol [SEP] These are made for the Dallas Cowboy fan, but the star logo is a pretty design for a ziploc bag even if you're not a fan. Ziploc bags are so versatile - I use these to take snacks to work, for freezing leftovers and as a disposable ""shake and bake"" bag (just fill one with breadcrumbs and dump your egg-soaked pork chop or chicken leg, shake, then put the meat in the oven). Each bag is easy to seal and it's hard to tear - the bags are neither too thick nor too thin, which makes them ideal for storing food items. Overall I'm happy with it. [SEP] These are classic Ziploc gallon size bags with a nice slider closing. They are durable & hold a lot. A great find on Amazon for a loved one’s favorite NFL team! Fabulous price to pay for an unexpected special gift to receive in the mail! I definitely recommend! [SEP] There's no difference between the quality of these bags and the usual Ziploc bags, which is a pro -- I've found Ziploc bags to last the longest, and seal better than other brands. The Packers logo and color add a fun touch. The graphics are well done, colorful, and stand out well. There's some added cost to having the branding, but it makes what is normally a boring bag something that stands out. [SEP] Regular strong ziplock bags but with the Dallas Cowboys sign on one side.  They're relatively expensive for what you get, but if you're a big NFL Dallas Cowboys fan, you might not mind paying extra. [SEP] Bought as gag gift for a family member. She loves them [SEP] Bought these for my husband and he loves them we use them about three times before throwing away.",3,True
Improved Food Allergy Test by CERASCREEN – Analysis for Food Allergies to 44 Foods | Health Screening | Determine Food Intolerances and Allergies | Professional CLIA-Certified Lab Analysis,[],[],,3.8,37,1173,"I was happy to find this product .

It is easy to use and comes with everything you need. [SEP] This is just one of MANY at-home tests out there.<br /><br />I actually have experience with a similar test – my mom’s A1c test that is sent every few months. In fact, she got one just a few days before I posted this review.<br /><br />This works IDENTICAL to that one.<br /><br />Each has:<br /><br />✉️ Pre-paid mailer to send back<br />💉 Lancets (at least 3)<br />🧼 Alcohol Prep Pad<br />🩸Card for blood droplets<br />📃 Instructions<br />☣️ Bio-Hazard bag for sample card<br />🩹 Band-aid(s) for after<br /><br />The idea is simple – prep the card (with the sticker and fill out info), wash hands, prick fingers, droplets on card, wait until it dries, package it up, mail within a certain amount of time.<br /><br />As for the accuracy …<br /><br />My mom’s A1c was pretty accurate when done this way.<br /><br />This allergy test? I was a bit surprised by the results – no to nuts, which I thought I had an issue with. Turns out – maybe not. Goat cheese (feta) – no allergy there. STRONG reaction to goat’s milk. That’s interesting, but I wouldn’t doubt it.<br /><br />The cost? Under $150, probably comparable to a lab if you don’t have insurance.<br /><br />It is from a certified lab and the results are viewed by a physician. I wouldn’t use it to self-treat, but it isn’t bad to know what’s going on. [SEP] Still not my favorite lab.  Although they seemed to fix the shipping label issues from the past.<br /><br />Company asks too many personal questions on their website compared to other like companies.

Took me 3 times on 3 different fingers to get enough blood to complete the test and I have never had that happen before.<br /><br />Test showed no allergies to anything.  Which was odd because my whole life I have been allergic to *tuna*.  So either I fixed my gut biome to where I no longer have the allergy, slightly possible because I have been working on intestinal permeability issues.  OR ... the test is not accurate.<br /><br />I think in this case I still prefer Everlywell as a lab.  I trust them more. [SEP] This was super fussy and difficult to implement. It's not much more expensive to have your doctor run this panel for you at less cost if your insurance will cover it, and those are much more accurate. Drawing enough blood from your fingers for this is so challenging, and I do glucose tests regularly, so I'm used to finger pokes. But enough to fill 8 dots on the chart took a lot of time and blood. The results are not even close to the one I had done by my doctor very recently, and I'm eating the same way. [SEP] I have had friends do this test and receive their results with no issues. I received this item with intentions to take the test right away but life happened, a move later and I finally had some breathing room to start the testing/send it in. Unfortunately, the company has now closed their US store as mentioned in an email response from them:<br /><br />“Unfortunately, our US store is permanently closed since 12-31-2022. So unfortunately you can't activate the test or send it in anymore.”<br /><br />I have them 4 stars because when I attempted to register the test, it wasn’t working so I emailed the company and their email response was very quick. They even offered to look into if I qualified for a refund. [SEP] I didn't realize you need to prick your finger and dot a paper with your blood in order to get the results  I wasn't a fan of that. That's on me though för not reading the listing fully. The results did come quickly and I believe them to be accurate so it's definitely a good product. [SEP] I had the chance to try this out for the price of a review, so I figured why not. I do not really have much reaction to any specific foods, but it will be interesting as to what the report shows. I am reviewing the process of doing the test as I have put off doing it for a while and my results may take a few more weeks. I will update when they come in. The reason I have put it off is they want 8-12 samples of blood, lol. Not as bad as it sounds once I did it, but it did seem like a lot. Just a prick of your fingertip(s) to get the blood. The instructions are clear, and it comes with everything you need including a prepaid label to send it in. If you have certain foods that you think are a problem, you should probably have eaten them close to the testing for best results. Like I said, not as bad as it seemed and when the results are ready, I will update this review. [SEP] I’ve registered my kit online and mailed my sample to the lab. I’m currently waiting on the results. The kit includes everything needed to conduct the test from home. The instructions are detailed and clear. I reviewed them before and during the testing. This test requires a finger prick and even includes band aids. I encountered no complications with testing. He sure to keep your tracking number so you can track your results. [SEP] Now that I know my food triggers, I am feeling so much better. [SEP] Very helpful step by step instructions, easy to navigate app, easy to do and comes with everything you need, comes with shipping label to send it off!

KLOUD City Assorted Color Eyelash Curler Silicone Rubber Refills/Replacement Pad Cushion (18 pcs),[],[],,3.6,29,3502,"REVISED REVIEW-<br />These pads are great for like two weeks, and quickly get too soft/get a line in them to rip your lashes out or stick to them in my case (see photo).  For this reason, they should be cheaper.

"XUYU Far Infrared Heating Pad Mat for Back, Neck, Shoulders, Cramps, Pain Relief with Natural Jade and Tourmaline, Auto Shut Off, Smart Timer and Heat Settings, 16” x 21",[],[],,4.2,32,2088,"First thing I love is that it gets hotter than my other heating pads.  And then I love that it's stiffer so I'm able to brace it up when I'm sitting in a chair.<br />Not exactly sure how the jade stone work but I like them.  They press into my back and deliver more heat into my sore muscles.<br />Having the time and temperatures illuminated makes it easier for me to see at night when I'm having trouble sleeping and my joints are aching.<br />Have never had an infrared heating pad before and I am really liking this one.<br />Saves my settings.  Has auto shut off in case I forget I have it on.<br />I tossed my other heating pad and am now using this one every single day. [SEP] This heating pad only puts out heat along the center columns of rock: about 1"" wide x 10.5"" long column of rock with a 0.75"" space between the columns of rock. There's a 2.5"" border around the edges of the pad which doesn't heat and isn't highly flexible. It works ok on your back but can't be used on the tummy unless you're lying flat on your back. The area that gets warm is 15"" x 10.5"". It works alright in the sense that you plug the pad in, select the temperature and timer length, and it heats up. However, I had the pad on my lap, a pillow on top, and my Kindle on top of that (several inches above the back of the pad). I noticed that the battery power on the Kindle dropped 10% in just a few minutes (which is really, really fast) and I had to reboot the Kindle to fix the battery drain. It seems like the pad messed with my Kindle's battery which makes me wonder what it's doing to me. Natural jade sounds good, but they're using electricity to heat the stones to being with. [SEP] This is a very good quality heating pad with an excellent controller for adjusting heat and setting a timer.  Cords and connections are top notch.  It provides a good heating surface larger than many other heating pads.  It is premium priced undoubtedly due to the extraordinary health benefit claims and the addition of jade ceramic pieces which the seller claims have health benefits beyond normal heating pads.<br /><br />The science behind the seller's health benefit claims appears uncertain at best especially when FIR is employed in combination with jade ceramic chips embedded in heat producing fabric using heated wires.  Most scientific studies using FIR and ceramics use jade and tourmaline in powdered and tiny particle form embedded in fabrics emitting FIR using body heat. In my opinion, this device should not be mistaken for or inferred to provide the same therapeutic effects as these scientifically researched devices.<br /><br />While the health claims made regarding this product seem a bit over the top in my opinion it is an excellent general purpose heating pad if you're willing to pay a premium. [SEP] I don't know how this infrared technology works, but all I can say is that it provides long lasting pain relief without any side effects. I have chronic neck and upper back pain. This is the only heating pad that helps me 100%. I think the heat penetrates deep into the muscle and not just stay on the surface of the skin. I leave the pad on my favorite spot on the couch and use it daily at 130F for an hour. It has a memory function that remembers the last setting I used it on and starts from the same setting every time. I'd like to also mention that unlike regular heating pads, this one takes a while to heat up (about 10 minutes). After I come home from work, I start to heat the pad and cover it with a blanket so the heat doesn't escape. I go take a shower while it heats up and then sit in the couch and use it. It feels absolutely amazing every single time. This therapy became part of my daily routine and I realized I sleep so much better at night due to reduced neck pain. [SEP] It offered almost instantaneous relief from the usual pain as well as swelling. Great for lower back pain and pain in general.  So much nicer than my old heating pad, softer, heats up fast. I honestly thought it was just gonna be a typical heating pad but I was wrong.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] I'm used to using traditional heating pads for back pain... this one was intriguing to me because it has some features that look different than typical heating pads - notably the jade rocks and the infrared heat option. I am not sure about the jade rocks but was curious to give it a whirl. This heating pad comes rolled up in a nice looking box. It has an included storage/carrying bag (nothing fancy), as well as an elastic/velcro strap that you could use to strap this thing to your back while you're sitting up or something. There's a power cord that detaches from the pad, and the cord has an in-line remote similar to other heating pads. The instructions say that this doesn't work like other heating pads, to turn it on, leave it warm up for 10 mins before use. I followed the directions. I had it set to the max temp of 158f. There is an LCD display on the remote that shows what temp it is actually at, and after some time it was hanging around 140ish. I decided to just use it. It does feel warm to the touch, and the infrared heat does feel like it radiates into your muscles. It feels like it does a better job than ""normal"" heating pads. Probably the only thing about it that threw me off a little bit, is even after using it for roughly an hour, the max temp seems to hang around 139-141ish, and doesn't get close to the set temp of 158. It still feels plenty warm and everything, but I just found that a little odd. [SEP] My cat and I are fighting over this heating pad!  I keep a heating pad on my favorite recliner at all times.  Our cat likes to sit in my lap in the evenings and he's discovered that when I get up he can snuggle up on the heating pad which falls to the seat of the chair.  The fight happens when I come back, he doesn't want to move.  I've had a bad back for years and years and heat has been the one constant that helps ease the pain.  This heating pad is very easy to place exactly where you want/need it, it warms up quickly and has a digital control that lets you set the exact temperature (86 - 158 degrees F) you want, it remembers your settings and you can set it to turn off between 1 - 5 hours.  The heat generated by the pad seems to penetrate deeper into my back and is very soothing.  It doesn't cure the pain but it makes is lessen temporarily and that all I can ask.  I do have another hearing pan that I can use with a power bank that comes in handy when I need to be moving around (especially handy when baking Christmas cookies) but his pad now has a permanent home on my recliner.  Oh, and while the heating pad appears exceptionally large and somewhat bulky, it isn't.  When I looked at the pictures on the product information page I thought ""that can't be the same heating pad"" but it is.  While it is big it's very comfortable to wear/use. Highly recommend. [SEP] Having conditions like arthritis and other muscular issues is no fun at all. I am constantly searching for that magic heating pad to provide relief. I might just have found it! This review is for: XUYU Infrared Heating Pad Mat for Back, Neck, Shoulders, Cramps, Pain Relief with Natural Jade , Auto Shut Off, Smart Timer...<br /><br />This pad is thicker than most I've tried and it's heavier. Both of those are caused by the stones that are sewn right into it. Supposedly the jade and other stones help to hold heat longer and the infrared is supposed to help the heat penetrate better. This even comes with a velcro strap and two slots on the back side, so that you can say strap it around your lower back. There's only so much mobility you can get with it though, since it has to stay plugged in.<br /><br />I have no proof of it, but I do feel like it penetrates better, or maybe it's just that the benefits last a little longer. Usually when I take the heating pad off my back or neck, it's not very long before the pain or stiffness comes back. When I used this pad, it's hours before the pain and stiffness comes back. Maybe it's just in my head, but I don't think so.<br /><br />This is very well made, with neat stitching throughout. It seems very durable and so far I've had no problems whatsoever. I feel like the controller is a little cheap, but it works well and hasn't malfunctioned at all. In face, it remembers my settings, so that the next time I use it, I just turn it on and it sets itself to my preferred temperature. It does take a little longer to heat up than regular heating pads do.<br /><br />Overall, I love this heating pad and it's my favorite yet! [SEP] Feels great when you’re hurting. My only complaint is that I wish the rock area was larger. [SEP] There is alot to like about the XUYU Infrared Heating Pad Mat.  Its relatively large (app 16x21"").  The heating stones are well placed and the tubes are full enough to get the heating effect while still allowing for the mat to be rolled up.  The digital heat controller allows you to control both the temp and the heating duration.<br /><br />I've never used one of these before and it's a little different.  As opposed to your typical electrical heating pad, it doesn't heat up immediately - building heat into the stones over about a 30 min time period.  The control unit allows for temp selection so I just turned it all the way up and waited.  The heating was very uniform and did a pretty good job.  I liked the auto-turn off function as I worried that the heated stones would get too hot and start melting either the heating pad or my clothing.  I guess at the temp it reaches, that's really not a risk, but you never know.<br /><br />The only knock I have is that the mat did not reach its maximum stated heating temp of 158 deg F as it never go about about 146 deg.  This isn't a big difference, but if your documentation states a specific temperature threshold, it should meet that threshold.<br /><br />The purchase price of $62 sounds super steep for a heating pad, but after a quick look at other similar pads on Amazon, the price is actually on the low end of the spectrum for infrared/rock heating pads.  Some of the other pads have greater functionality and temp control and larger size, but you get the idea.",3,True
"Swonuk White Noise Machine,Sound Machine with Night Light for Sleeping Adults Baby Kids, 16 Soothing Sounds for Sleeping, Powered by USB, White Noise Maker for Bedroom Home",[],[],,4.4,86,212,"[[VIDEOID:30c0075a526f71d44a55e34c2e787667]] This is a nice white noise sound machine with a total of 16 sounds. It is not battery operated and comes with a USB cable but no A/C adapter, the unit itself, a round instruction card, and a regular instruction pamphlet.<br /><br />The unit must be plugged in to operate.  Operation is simple as per my video. There is a nightlight feature where several lights can be cycled through. The timer feature goes from 15 to 120 minutes or can be turned off to play continuously by holding the button down. The play button will turn the unit sound on or off. There are three sound controls - nature, white noise, and lullaby. There are six available sounds for the first two and only four lullaby sounds.<br /><br />The current price of $23.99 is reasonable for this. Of course, in the days of smart home speakers such as Google Home, no such device is really needed as I can just ask my Google Home to play sounds or tell it goodnight to get a routine. Nevertheless, for those who want a sound machine for a baby room or just for themselves, this does work. Know that there will never be more than 16 sounds available and it always has to be plugged in to operate.<br /><br />PS - I was almost going to lower the rating of this unit by one star because there was a card insert with the unit saying that $10 will be provided for a positive review. Such unethical practices annoy me. This unit is good enough to stand on its own merits without having to buy a review and if it were not, then it would not deserve a positive review. [SEP] I found the sound and the light difficult to adjust to exactly what I wanted, and the selection of sounds left something to be desired.  I'd say this is more for kids than adults. [SEP] This is a great value for kids' room. We especially like the crickets and yellow light. [SEP] My daughter was using a more expensive sound machine. But she gave it up for this one. Initially for the night light but also for the ease of selecting other types of sounds for drawing, writing, stretching and concentration.<br /><br />It recalls the volume and last sound. But will not resume if power is lost and restored. I mention this because the other sound machine I use just has a simple dial for power on and volume. I've kept a constant sound and volume by connecting it to a smart plug that resumes its present dial settings when power is restored by a sleep routine. So why mention this? I can imagine an infant finding comfort by a parent controlling an analog sound machine with a smart plug; sometimes gentle music can soothe a crying infant (like when you're confident it's not diaper or hunger causing the unrest). Can't do that with electronic controls without integrated smart home controls. This sound machine doesn't have smart home controls either. But works well for an older child that doesn't care about automation. So it's a good fit for my child.<br /><br />This machining did need a standard 5V 1A power plug to get started though. We had extras of those lying around. But know you'll need one if considering this machine. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:f0e91d6c4a7d2885dd283cc32de8b384]] This is a good light and sound machine, perfect for a baby’s nursery which is where I intend to use it. It seems to be pretty well-made and the sound quality is good and can be very loud if chosen! There are different functions for Nature Sounds, white noise sounds, and lullabies. There is a play pause button and different light features that vary from light to bright and color choices. The white light is more of a bright “blue” light so caution there. There is a timer function where a lady with a strong Asian accent says the increments of time...wasn’t expecting that haha.  All in all, I would recommend this machine if you’re looking for something that you intend to leave plugged in. I personally thought this was a rechargeable type so I was a little disappointed to learn that it has to remain plugged in to use. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:b0fdb8a2103956e4fff6d46a750184e0]] My video shows the sound quality which is really good and can go pretty loud. I like that the machine gives you the quick selection of what type of noise you want such as song, white noise, or nature. I also like how the sound fades in and out at stop and play so that it’s not just a sudden jolt of noise. The light feature is really cool. Has a low dim option and a brighter option as well as color choices. I wish it had more songs on it, but overall for a sound machine it’s pretty nice and has selection. [SEP] An excellent device to create an audio ambiance. There are a number of user selectable options regarding audio type, volume, color of lighting, timer setting.  So, it's easily customizable per your intended use.<br />We have a sound machine in the bedroom, and this will have a home in the home office, which is also the mediation room.  Usually we like to use the water sounds, but sometimes the white noise is more useful to block out extraneous sounds/noise. Setting the timer is a gentle way to know when the scheduled meditation has ended. Instead of an alarm of some sorts, the sound machine simply ceases. Wonderful.<br />Even if you're not into meditation, place this unit in your bedroom. When you're feeling stressed, set up a relaxing sound and lie down. Just relax and breathe...be conscious of your breathing and just don't think about things. Just relax. And, umm, well, now you're practically meditating. hehe. You'd be surprised how this little mental respite can refresh you.<br />The only issue with this product is the absence of a USB power plug. It comes with a usb power cable, but needs a USB power port. Having this near a laptop or computer kinda defeats the purpose of the sound machine (getting away from stress/work). So, you need to purchase or have a spare USB power adapter plug, like the one usually used for smartphones. Luckily, with the proliferation of smartphones, most people have a spare usb power plug. For a device like this, the usb power plug should be included.<br />Overall, it's a fantastic product. It meets expectations, matching up to the descriptions and pictures in the product details. Attached are photos to show real world images of the sound machine.<br />it's a very useful and competent product. If it came with the usb power plug, it might be close to a 5 star rating. However, based on impressions and considerations, this product earns a 4.75 - 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation. [SEP] I like this for the most part. It's very cute and a small piece for mood lighting. The lullaby setting is kind of monotonous and distracting to sleep to, for me. But I don't mind having it on if I'm just trying to relax or have a mindful meditation. I can't sleep to it just because the melody is so repetitive. I like the white noise and outdoors setting to sleep to, however. The colors are nice. I'd recommend! [SEP] This item is amazing. You have lots of functions to choose from to find your comfort level as far a sleep noise goes. I cannot even go through how many sounds you have and you also have a lot of different lights to pick from. Tons of night light features.<br /><br />I also think it works a little to well. The first night I was using it my wife set it up for rain and rain drops. I woke up in the middle of the night looking for a water leak or roof leak. It wasn’t even raining outside. It had me thinking it was a constant pour outside.<br /><br />Very good.l sound machine. [SEP] Don't like the soft touch buttons on this device. There no tactile feedback when using<br /><br />Aside from that works as intended.<br /><br />Sounds are good quality. Good selection<br /><br />Must press the play button to activate the sounds. Don't get why you can't just press the sound option directly to turn it on. Must use two button press to activate<br /><br />There is a timer option for 15,30,60,90 and 120min signaled by Asian Female AI voice with broken English.<br /><br />Volume selection doesn't have same feature and have to play by ear. When reach max volume it does have a beep sound<br /><br />Night light works well. Able to cycle through several colors.<br /><br />I like how it uses USB plug instead of a wall outlet. Plug that goes into device is propriety though. Wished it was type C to type C to be more modernized.<br /><br />Also would be great if it was battery powered. Seeing it's USB out, able to plug it into a power bank",3,True

I find it a bit difficult to hold well – but then again – not too terrible at all.  I think I just prefer the ones with a handle – that way I am relaxed when using and feel like I get my entire face and all its cervices without issue.  This one – I feel it takes more work because of the size and shape.  It is PERFECT for travel, though, as it is sooooo tiny and takes up much less room than the ones with a handle.  It has many different speeds as well.  Like I think I counted 5.  The rollers are nifty as they are silicone and nubby spikey.  They feel great when rolling around your face – really wakes you up – because of the spikey nubbins – as opposed to most facial rollers which are smooth.  BUT I thought the little rollers would also vibrate.  They do not.  The vibration is just for the main part. The nubbins – do not matter if the thing is turned on or not.  Also – for the rollers it is easy to hod and use as the entire rest of it acts like a nice handle.  It is easy to handle that way and the rollers go just where you want them.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] I am using this little face massager to help relieve my sinus pressure.  I originally wanted to try it for TMJ pain but discovered it works to help break my sinus pressure.  When using it on my face next to my nose it vibrates the maxillary bone and has been effective at relieving my sinus pressure.  It sometimes makes me sneeze when it hits the right spot.<br />It is rechargeable and the silicon skin is soft and non-slip.  It has 5 speeds and is very quiet.  All speeds have the same constant vibration and it momentary stops about every 20 seconds for some reason.<br />The vibration is in the body of the unit and it travels into the two circle/spheres and they work very well as manual rollers.  The rollers are NOT powered but the spin freely with very little tension on them.<br />It helps to relieve my sinus pressure so for that I give it 5-stars. [SEP] I feel like this is pricey but I really like this scrub.  The rollers don't turn on their own (for some reason I thought they were going to.. 🤦‍♀️) but I love the size and the feel of this scrub.  The bristles are the perfect length and the rollers are so nice around the bridge of the nose and cheek and eye bones.  Took me forever to figure out where to plug it in. (pics) it didn't say in the instructions and I didn't want to poke through the silicone if I wasnt supposed to! Wish they would have covered that.  Over $30 is a bit of a stretch but..  Would recommend<br />Update: I thought my battery was just low, but it's not.  On any of the vibrate modes after a minute it stops does a couple short vibrates then continues with the mode. I keep thinking it's about to die or something is wrong with it.. [SEP] A unique and small little vibrating brush, perfect for travel.<br /><br />This facial massager and scrubber is about the size of your palm, give or take.  The scrubber part of this is soft and soap lathers quite well.  The facial massager part is nice and the little balls roll well.  The balls don't vibrate, the device itself does.  That being said, it's an average massager that is still nice to use.  The main feature of this brush is the cleansing brush part.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice scrubber.  It took a minute to figure out the charger.  I was expecting a cover that flipped up, so I was trying to pry it up.  Well, all you have to do is just push the charger into the hole, that simple.

Go Healthy Vitamin D3 Gummies for Adults 2000 IU Vegetarian Kosher Halal (60 CT) 30 Servings,[],[],,4.2,38,103,"Great tasting vitamin d gummies. Easy to take and seem like great quality. [SEP] PROS<br /><br />1. Delicious taste.<br />2. Excellent ingredients.<br />3. Vegan, with no gelatin.<br />4. Less sticky than candy gummies (but you still need to thoroughly brush your teeth after chewing these).<br />5. At a dose of 1000 IU per gummy, you can easily titrate your dosage to a preferred dose (see below).<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1. This is an extremely expensive way to take vitamin D3. However, the price of these gummy vitamins is fairly typical. All gummy vitamins are exorbitantly expensive. I typically use gel capsule versions of D3 from either Solgar, Jarrow, Viva or Life Extension, which is much cheaper than these gummies.<br /><br />GENERAL INFORMATION ON VITAMIN D3<br /><br />Vitamin D3 is the most bioavailable form of vitamin D, which is well known by both alternative and mainstream medical practitioners to have bone-protective properties. There are varying opinions on how much D3 to take. As you can see, this product has 1000 IU per gummy. My own alternative healthcare provider has vacillated over the years between recommending a dose of 1000 IU per day, to 2000 IU, to up to 5000 IU. I personally take between 1000-5000 IU per day depending on the time of year.<br /><br />If you are concerned about a possible danger of overdose of vitamin D, note that the body itself produces up to 20,000 IU of vitamin D after just 20 minutes of unprotected sun exposure in the summer, with no ill effects. However, for those embarking on a dosage of more than 1000 IU daily, if you wish to be extremely careful, and you have money to burn (because your insurance won’t pay for it), you can do it under a doctor's supervision. You do this by having the doctor regularly test your blood levels of vitamin D by ordering the 25-hydroxy vitamin D blood test, abbreviated as ""25(OH)D."" This is touted as the most reliable test of vitamin D status. Optimal levels of vitamin D in the blood range between 50 and 70 ng/mL.<br /><br />Of course, if you are willing to allow yourself a few minutes of sun exposure in the summer, you can get all the vitamin D you need that way during that time of year. However, in the winter, the angle of the sun is such that if you don't live quite near the equator, the body produces inadequate vitamin D when exposed to the sun--not to mention that very little of the skin is exposed to the sun when it is severely cold outside.<br /><br />Research has discovered that Americans as a whole are dangerously deficient in vitamin D, especially during winter months. The body's ability to produce vitamin D naturally also declines with age.<br /><br />In addition to its well-known benefit of protecting bones, vitamin D encourages the body to produce substances called cathelicidins which destroy viruses, bacteria, and other microbes, which is why vitamin D increases resistance to colds and flu. Research has shown that people who take cod liver oil, which is high in vitamin D, lower their risk for respiratory infections of all kinds. (Apparently this 19th Century cure-all actually was a viable home remedy.)<br /><br />The risks associated with suboptimal blood levels of vitamin D are many, including: high blood pressure, increased cancer risk, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity. The benefits of supplementation and the risks of deficiencies of vitamin D increase as we age. In particular, in senior citizens vitamin D deficiency is linked with generalized bodily weakness, an increased possibility of developing macular degeneration, and a 2.5 times greater risk of death. In contrast, research has indicated that supplementing with vitamin D decreases the risk of developing cancer of the colon, lungs, and breast. It also improves balance in old people--which is a great thing since older people are at substantial risk of death from a fall. It also improves mood, and as such is a natural treatment for depression (it is well known that depression rates increase in winter due to lesser amounts of sunlight). Studies have shown vitamin D improves symptoms of all kinds of autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis, and that it can relieve the pain of fibromyalgia.<br /><br />During flu season, vitamin D3 can help keep you from getting sick or lessen the duration of bouts of colds, sore throats or flu. My healthcare provider recommended to me taking as much as 10,000 IU on a day I begin to get a cold or flu. I've been on this supplement for years, along with 2000 IU of vitamin C daily, and haven't had a cold or flu since.<br /><br />There have been many, many scientific studies on the health benefits of vitamin D3 over the years. Below is just a tiny sample.<br /><br />REFERENCES<br /><br />Marwaha, R., et al. Interventions for prevention and control of epidemic of vitamin D deficiency. Indian J Pediatr. 2019 Jun;86(6):532-537.<br /><br />Putman, M., et al. A randomized clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation in healthy adolescents.

[SEP] Vitamin D3 is one of several supplements which if I take in pill or table form upsets my stomach, so as with those other supplements am happy to try this D3 in gummy form.  These gummies are really good!  Their fruity flavor tastes great, they dissolve easily, do not upset my stomach, and are a good dosage.  2 gummies = 2000 IU.  Priced reasonably and made with citrus fruit pectin, this one is worth adding to my daily health regime. [SEP] These strawberry gummies taste great. They are very sweet. They do stick to your teeth a bit. Each gummy has 1000 iu of vitamin D in it. The adults in our family take 2 per day, the kids take 1. Living in the Pacific northwest we need some extra D. I like that everyone in the family can take the same gummy. [SEP] Taking these vitamin gummies is like popping a gum drop. They are very sugary. It's kind of ironic since the advertising is that they are all about health. Not a bad supplement, but I don't want my teeth exposed to so much sugar. [SEP] Great quality! [SEP] I give these gummies 4 stars mainly because $15 is expensive for a 30-day supply of Vitamin D3. There are other Vitamin D3 gummies that'll give you twice the servings at the same price. That being said, these gummy vitamins were pretty good overall. I enjoyed the taste and had no problems taking them. The strawberry flavor was prevalent without being too candy-like. [SEP] Fantastic!  Our daughter had bloodwork done and her Vitamin D was a bit low. I wanted to find her a supplement that would meet the requirements recommended by her physician and also taste good to her. She doesn’t mind these gummies at all and, after two weeks, she says she feels like she has more energy. I’ll edit my review when she gets more bloodwork done, but I feel much better knowing she is getting what she needs from these. [SEP] This is an excellent gummy D3 supplement - 2 gummies have 2,000 units of vitamin D3 and<br />Vitamin D3 is critical for staving off some really miserable conditions like depression, fatigue, obesity, alzheimers and skin problems. Studies have found that anywhere from 40% - 75% of people in the U.S. are deficient in D3. (Depending on which study you're looking at) I love this gummy form because it's so easy to take! I hate swallowing pills, so if I can get something in a gummy candy, I do it! This is an excellent vitamin to take, considering how beneficial it is and how common deficiencies are. I had a vitamin D3 deficiency and after taking a 5,000iu daily D3 supplement for only 2-3 weeks, (my doctors advice) I noticed a big improvement in my energy level and in the appearance of my skin.<br />If you have any of the conditions that I mentioned, such as frequent fatigue, your doctor can give you a blood test to find out what your blood levels are of D3, B vitamins and any others you suspect you may be deficient in. If you don't want or can't afford to go to a doctor, trying this D3 supplement is a safe and easy way to rule out a deficiency in this vitamin. If you take this and in two to three weeks you find that you have more energy, among other things -  you most likely had a D3 deficiency like roughly half the population does. Do a little research on dosages, because there are several factors that you need to take into consideration when you take D3 long-term. D3 is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means that it IS possible to get too much. It can become toxic and that can cause some problems. (Eg. Kidney stones, nausea) You need to consider how much sunlight you get, for instance - whether you use sunscreen, do you live in Alaska, or Arizona- things like that.<br />This is a very easy, inexpensive supplement to take and it can make an enormous difference in how you look and feel. [SEP] First, these are some tasty gummies. They're strawberry, sugar-coated, and have a soft texture, so they're like eating candy.  They'll really appeal to kids. Each gummy provides 1000 IU of D3 and my doctor prescribed a minimum of 2000 IU during the summer months. so this is a month's worth at a fairly high price. In less sunny months, she has me taking 5,000 IU, so this gummy is far too expensive for me.<br /><br />Gummy vitamin D is my sweet treat to myself -- everything else I take in pill form -- so I've sampled quite a few. For a couple dollars more, I can get 120 equally tasty D gummies that provide 5000 units in one gummy. (Just Nutrients Vitamin D3 5,000 IU Gummies, strawberry flavor.) I will stick to that!",3,True

There are two sides, one for your wash water and one that is dry. You dunk your mop in the wash water, there is a squeegee like thing on the side that the mop head scrapes against to get the water off and the second chamber squishes out even more water. I would like that second part to be a between mopping and dunking so you aren't just getting your water dirty and dunking your mop in dirty water again. The squeezing out of the water keeps the mop head pretty dry and your floors dry quickly. The squeegee tool also makes it so you don't have to touch the mop head which is great. There isn't anything scratchy on the pad, which is good, but I wish there was a spot for dried on stains. I try to spot treat those and pick them up later. The handle is unfortunate and pops out of place, which makes carrying the bucket precarious, even though it is light it can pull the handle out of it's notch. There are drain holes on the top of the wash side where you tip the bucket upside down to drain the dirty water. Just leave it upside down a while and it will dry out. [SEP] Overall, this is a pretty decent mop and bucket set.  The mop is excellent. The pole is metal, and the sections thread together well. The threaded portion is recessed into each section, making for a very durable, solid connection that won't come apart or loosen when using the mop. The mop head is not threaded, but it has a good quality snap button attachment.  The only mop-related complaint I have is that the point of attachment between the pole and the mop head is plastic. It's a decent quality, thick plastic, but metal would have been nice since that's a strain point on the mop.<br /><br />The mop head covers are of good quality, and attach well with Velcro to the mop head. Two pads are provided in the set. While they can be machine washed, it's better to hand wash them and let them air dry while laid flat. It reduces the wear and tear that the pads get in a washing machine.<br /><br />The bucket design could have been better. It is smaller than another similar product that I have which is actually a positive, since it weighs less when full of water. However, it lacks some key convenience features, such as a pop-open drain at the base. It is also not possible to remove the top to clean out the bucket well after use. The overall build quality of the bucket is somewhat lightweight, especially the handle. It lacks the heft and durability of other similar products.<br /><br />While the bucket issues brings my score to 4 stars, this is still a very good performing set. It's easy to get the mop head into the bucket since the mop head has a spring that allows it to automatically fold vertically so it can be inserted into the bucket. The ""squeegee"" on the dry side does a good job of wringing out the water. The ability to have a wet and a dry side to the bucket makes mopping quicker, easier, and results in a better job.<br /><br />Not perfect, but a decent value for the price. [SEP] I love products that are super functional yet engineered really well too - especially when it comes to the space saving aspect of something you want to stow away in a closet or cabinet.  This definitely fits the bill across the board.<br /><br />First it comes in a small box - just large enough for the bucket.  But the mop is also inside the bucket.  Genius!<br />Now when I unpacked it I was like will this mop be sturdy enough as it comes in pieces you screw together.  But YES - it totally is - and I was surprised!  It was sturdy and stable and yet maneuvered very, very well as it swivels beautifully.  In fact, even though my older mop is smaller - this one was much better for getting behind the toilet - again because it swivels and moves so well.  It did a great job.  The parts of the handle never came apart - until I took them apart (which was also easy).  It is also much longer than my old mop which, for me as a tall woman, makes life sooooo much easier!  In fact at the end of mopping my bathroom I was able to stand outside the door and finish up and was actually able to stretch and reach almost the entire bathroom from the doorway - I was impressed.  It was very easy to use.  I was even able to really scrub with it and it was still very sturdy.<br /><br />The best part is the bucket.  It is super tiny yet super functional. It is also much better than using my bathroom sink - as now I can properly dispose of dirty water right down the toilet.  Plus it does not take that much water to fill that part of the bucket - again the engineering is super helpful and thoughtful and conserving.  The mop definitely got up the dirt and I was able to rinse it well and then run it through the dry side a few times where it really did get rid of most of the water - you could see it literally pour off the mop with the little attached squeegee.  Then I just left it standing against a wall and by that night it was completely dry!  (Unlike my old mop which took like days to completely dry!)<br /><br />Lastly - when you are done with it - you just unscrew the handle and put it all right back in the tiny bucket.  Super easy to put on a shelf, in a closet, or in a cupboard.  REALLY space saving!  My pic shows the size next to a bottle of champagne - really small!  I am impressed with he size, engineering, durability, and ease of use.  Great product!  Totally recommend!<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.  Thanks! : ) [SEP] I like this bucket. I am happy that finally I found a way to rinse & wring out the mop without touching the dirty water. I can also save money by not wasting Swiffer pads. The handle is also sturdier than a Swiffer handle. The mop goes in and out easily and washes off very well. I love that I can take off the pad and wash and dry it separately when I am done cleaning the house. Overall I like the design and have used it a few times already and love it. It is well made. [SEP] I had to delay my review because I simply couldn’t get the top off this bucket and it doesn’t say anything about it in the instructions which is a huge oversight. Thankfully someone mentioned removing the red handle on here and I was able to finally get it so I could use this thing.<br />Here’s what I like about this mop and bucket set.  It’s compact so it fits anywhere. I like the idea of keeping it near the toilet as shown  in the photo. The microfiber pads work great.  Really mops well and picks up any dirt along the way. It glides under baseboards and into corners like a champ. You can easily control how dry you want the pad so the floor will dry faster. You can even use it as a dust mop if you like. Just throw it in the washer when you’re done. Two pads are included so you can change them out.<br />Here’s what’s not to like.  The pole handle goes together easily in metal sections, but it also loosens as you mop which is frustrating. I would need to tape the joints if I used it all the time. I also found the pole too short for me so I was constantly stooping while mopping.  I had way too much trouble removing the top so that I could fill the bucket with water and then dump the dirty water. I practically broke the handle off trying. The bucket is too tall for standard sinks and you have to tip it to fill it. I looked, but could not find a fill line on the side or inside the bucket so I had no idea exactly how much water to put in.  I discovered I didn’t put quite enough and part of my pad wasn’t even getting wet. Fitting  the mop head into the bucket just right and tugging it up and down to wet and dry it takes more effort than I expected.  Pull up too fast and you risk tipping the bucket.<br />This contraption makes mopping even more of a chore than it already is and I can’t recommend it especially at over thirty dollars. I would take my spin mop and bucket over this any day for the price. [SEP] Mom loves it but water gets into the dry part so the mop is soaked and the mop only goes one way so you can't dip or dry the entire mop. [SEP] Ordered one. Mop head broke after 2 uses. Amazon sent replacement. Broke after 3 uses. Amazon please stop selling this mop. [SEP] Like the mop part. The bucket is very hard to use. Mol gets stuck constantly in it. Would not recommend. Maybe of there was a pedal to step on to help hold the bucket down upon removal of mop it would be better [SEP] Easy to use, handle broke after the first use. Besides that I really liked it.",3,True
"Aneercare Reusable Pads Menstrual Pads Super Absorbent, Washable, Soft and Comfortable-6 Pads, 1 Mini Wet Cloth Bag.",[],[],,4.3,52,7585,"These are a great size. They have held with no issues. They are super soft. Love the colors. The snaps work perfect. I just rinse them out and put them in a wash bag in the washer. They have been hung dry and dried in the dryer without any issues. I was skeptical at first, but these are honestly awesome! They do come with a little bag to put used or new ones. Much healthier to use these! [SEP] So, a couple of years ago I got something similar from another brand. But those are bulkier. These are definitely easier to wear and softer. Easy to clean too. I typically use products like these in place of the disposable kind of panty liners. These work very well, day long and also when working out. Very nice material and don't make that crinkle sound some of these products can. The little bag is useful. There's also an extra small liner included. The outer material on these pads is almost silken and the prints are all very nice too. The pads are safe next to your skin too. [SEP] I love these liners, they are a great idea.<br />Pros:<br />Super soft microfiber cloths<br />snaps reverse<br />comes in multiple sizes<br />Easy to wash<br />they come in a pretty vinyl pouch that you can carry a spare in your bag,etc and put the used one into it. I would suggest keeping a ziploc in the pouch for a variety of reasons.<br /><br />Cons:<br />not very absorbant as they are microfiber<br />they slide and ride up and down constantly. I took hot glue and made strips on the back side to help them hold in place.<br />I also added a few snaps to the tops and bottoms of a few. [SEP] These Aneercare washable menstrual pads are okay overall. I haven’t tried any other reusable pads like this so I can’t compare.<br /><br />So far I have used them as a pad after the 1st and 2nd day of my cycle when it is lighter. I was too nervous to use when I first started this month because I had to work all night and didn’t want to risk having a huge mess on my hands.<br /><br />They are thick and soft on the grey pad side, and the outer material seems to be made of waterproof fabric with various cute patterns. I find them to be comfortable and and they don’t make any crinkly noise while wearing. I received 6 medium-large size and 1 additional smaller pad (not all shown in my pictures). A cute little waterproof bag is included to store as needed.<br /><br />Overall, these appear very nice and well made with good stitching. Each one has a snap button in the middle. The buttons work well and don’t come undone, but I will say that the buttons don’t secure them in place as well as I would like. There is a tendency for the pad to slide forward and back or start flipping sideways a bit. Therefore, sometimes frequent adjustments are needed. That is another reason why I’m not sure I would want to use these on heavier days.<br /><br />They feel thick, well-padded, and seem fairly absorbent, though I have noticed that stuff may appear to sit on top for a little while before sinking in a little more.<br /><br />They have washed well so far. I always do a nice hand wash before putting in the washing machine.<br /><br />In the future, I will probably try at least once to use this on heavier days to see if it works, but as of now I think these are nice for using like starting the 3rd day of my cycle. These would also be good as a backup to tampon or cup though I have been trying to just stick to pads lately. My honest gut feeling is that I think I’ll have a mess when I try this on a heavy day. Even if I never use these on heavier days, it is still nice to save money on disposable pads by using these on lighter days- environmentally friendly too!<br /><br />It would be much better if the company found a way to get the pads to stay in place better without so much sliding. Maybe a second pair of buttons is needed or the waterproof material could have some kind of grip on it.<br /><br />I’ll be sure to update this review if any other issues arise with regular use. I’ll update when I’m able to test them on a heavier day, but as of now I would recommend them them as a liner on light days if you okay with having to adjust their position every once in awhile. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know-thanks! [SEP] I  was really excited to receive these. They came just in time as I was fixing to start my cycle... fast forward to me being 4 days into my cycle and I absolutely HATE these cloth pads. I have other brand ones and was really hopeful and excited for these. however the one button that fastens it to your underwear is not enough, I find they slide forward or backwards a LOT throughout the day, which calls for a LOT of readjusting. there is a little tag on them that does not stay down and that comes up periodically throughout the day which causes you to scratch your behind like you have some issues in there.  they clump up a lot when you sit down which is really uncomfortable. the microfiber material is not absorbent to the menstrual blood, it is just sitting on the surface which leaves you with a really wet and gross feeling. also on a new pad, the first time you use the rest room, even if there is a VERY LITTLE on the pad, the smell is really potent and horrible... but worst was the little liner you get. I found myself SEVERAL times in my 2 hour grocery trip, hiding in an aisle and digging my hand down my pants to pull that thing more forward because it keeps going to the back and into my butt crack which was super uncomfortable... Overall I don't think these are good cloth menstrual pads, there are much better ones out there that will get the job done [SEP] I love how soft they are [SEP] This is a really nice set. I normally make my own pads but was in need of more and figured it would be nice to see what kind of quality is out there. I must say that these are great.  You get 6 large sized ones and one small light day one as well as a wet bag. The top of the pads are made from a very soft (kinda microfiber style) material that feels nice against my skin. It does. It appear to cause me any irritation (and I have very sensitive and reactive skin). The backs of the pads is made of a plastic type fabric (PUL) that makes noise when you crinkle it in your hand but not while you are wearing the pad properly. The snaps are strong and the whole pad is put together very well. They washed up really nice and I was even able to put them in the dryer and they came out perfect. No shrinking or changing shape. [SEP] I LOVE these!! I knew someone who made homemade pads years ago and started using them then and boy I haven't went back!! I DO use disposables for when I'll be out all day or on vacation just because I don't want to bother rinsing and cleaning these while I'm out but they feel SOOO soft!! The lady doesn't make them anymore and I've about worn out the ones I had and when I saw these available I jumped at the opportunity to review them! They are super soft and wash up well. I LOVE that they are dark on the side that needs to be dark because of stains and they seem to stay put pretty well. The little bag is really nice and would be great to take with you to carry clean ones and put the used ones in. I've washed them all 3 times already and they still look brand new. I really like this brand and will continue to use these and purchase more. [SEP] Amazingly comfortable. They actually stay put. [SEP] This is a set of all cotton decorative cloth pads for women's menstrual support. For any woman seeking additional aid with absorbing the monthly flow this makes a nice gift. For cotton cloths that are just worn underneath your clothes it is a little expensive, but if you like these colorful, attractive designs it is worth it.",3,True

I could smell it in the shower but wish it was a little stronger of a scent. I did like the scent so it was pleasant.<br /><br />UPDATE: I wanted to update my review a s state that depending on the scent, you may have more pleasant aromas!  I used another scent out of the pack and it smelled great and had my bathroom smelling like it. I think some scents are lighter than others. [SEP] I don't really see the advantage of ""travel size"" since all the other shower steamers I've reviewed were individually wrapped in plastic.  But, nonetheless these are easy to toss into a suitcase or bag for trips.  I used two of them at the same time yesterday in the shower and still couldn't really detect much scent.  They're pretty to watch dissolving but as far as scent goes there's not very much.  These come in a very good quality box with a bow, ready for gifting. [SEP] Love the packaging on this, perfect as a gift and the shower bombs are well packed for transport. I wish the aromatherapy aspect was a little stronger, but these were great additions to a shower session. [SEP] I love the smells it comes with! And it’s very useful if you don’t have a Tub but you want a luxurious bath experience. My ONLY complaint is that it dissolves son quickly also the smell. I’d wish it last longer so my whole bath could more relaxing [SEP] I had never used Shower Steamers before so I didn’t know what to expect at first. I must say that taking showers with these steamers immediately makes you feel relaxed after a long day at work. The smell is strong but not overwhelming, and puts you in a spa-like mode.  The item includes different scents to give you a variety to enjoy.  These will work amazing as birthday or Mother’s Day gifts. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review and photos of this product.  I hope it has been helpful in providing you with more information. [SEP] These are EASILY my current favorite bath steamers. Right out the box, they smell absolutely BREATHTAKING. I could not wait to take a shower sound these. One, puck (lol), lasts about two showers worth. They all smell soooooo good. I like the eucalyptus the best but it’s only by a little as all of them are amazing. It sets such a relaxing tone for my shower. Definitely stress relieving. I’d recommend. I’d also gift. This one came in a cute wrapped box. Great quality. [SEP] So cute. Would make a wonderful gift.<br />They all smell so good. They are also nicely packaged Individually.<br />I don’t smell them at all while they are in the shower with me.  I’ve tried repositioning them and I still can’t smell it. These are my first  shower fizzer things I’ve ever gotten so I’m not sure if they are all this way or if I’m doing it wrong. 🤷🏽‍♀️ [SEP] The scent is nit strong enough [SEP] These supple shower streamers are a fantastic array of aromatherapy goodness! I’m thoroughly impressed at just how they turn my shower hot water and mist into a pampering monsoon of deep affection.

[SEP] Review for BYGGVIR Shower Steamers, 18PCS Travel-Sized Shower Bombs Set, Aromatherapy Shower Steamer with Bow Gift Box.<br />First of all, the very attractive presentation definitely elevates the worthiness as a gifting option. In fact, it already looks like it's all set to be presented as a wrapped gift.<br />The attractive presentation is a prelude to the colorful and fragrant shower steamers within.  The shower steamers do not disappoint.  Covering them is a translucent page, with the respective fragrances, along with their visual coloring. It's an elegant manner to identify the size different types.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the shower steamer product, with a ruler for size reference.  I included photos showing measurements of the shower steamer. I hope these images are helpful during your purchase consideration.<br />I really like that each shower steamer is individually encased in a capable package. This eases packing the shower steamers in a gym bag or luggage. Usually, we have to put shower steamers into zip lock baggies (if you wanted them seaparated, you'd either use separate baggies or put a paper towel between them). So, this is a very nice and welcomed feature of this product set.<br />Overall, the product delivers as a gifting option, and supplies quality shower steamers with smart packaging that facilitates storage and travel utility. Based on these criteria, it earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",3,True

It’s all about what you prefer, and how much you need. [SEP] Magnesium is an important mineral, and many people are deficient in it. For this reason, magnesium can help with heart issues and even help with sleep. Some people even get relief from headaches or anxiety from taking it.<br /><br />Magnesium comes in a variety of forms, and some are better absorbed and utilized by the body than others. Magnesium glycinate is one of the best forms, and the body seems to absorb more magnesium from this than other, cheaper forms (like magnesium oxide).<br /><br />I have taken magnesium for many years and am healthier for it. I usually take it before bed as part of my nighttime supplements. The company seems to be quality and suggests that they are a supplier and as such, do their own testing and tracking. [SEP] Liked higher dosage, easy to swallow. [SEP] This is the way I wish all supplements would be made. I am so happy to see that a supplement company recognize consumers want third party tested even when made in the USA. There are indeed a few bad apples out there so thank you thank you Kappa nutrition for going the extra mile. Too many Made in USA supplements do not even know if the ingredients they used were made without heavy metals or contamination. I love love love as the seller stated "" We manufacture in our own facilities . We do not send to 3rd party to manufacture.""  You see we got lazy and just trusted what a company said was in the bottle. And there are some (me included) who have been taken advantage of with our trust. They knew all we wanted was a cheap price and 'promises' of quality and what not. There have been so many revelations recently of completely fake supplements as well as dangerous ones too with heavy metals etc.. So I personally look for companies that do their best to insure quality . And too Amazon now requires credentials/verification from supplement companies to try and help us. I can tell you now this will be my new source of magnesium from this company.<br /><br />Ok so why do I take magnesium. Honestly mostly for sleep and so in the morning I stay regular ( think bathroom). And too oh gosh is it good for your brain. Those who follow my reviews know my deal is skin care and supplements (which is the reason I am so impressed with this company being third party tested and made in USA). In the supplement world we know Magnesium is a no brainer. Its kinda like a basic element for everything else to work. The dosage here they are offering is a tad bit higher than what I usually take but very very close. It's just the right amount to aid me with sleep and help stay regular and loose weight. While at the same time doing the thousands of beneficial things that my body needs from magnesium. True enough we get  close to 'enough' from our food but if you go long enough with some inadequacies it can lead to neural problems. And we definitely do not get enough from food for sleep and digestion aid. You may have to experiment with dosage to find what works best for you but this is close to the dosage I take that being 2 caps at 280mgs.<br /><br />I want to point out too that I am seeing many companies...now..... stating third party tested but when you get the bottle it is missing the third party badge/marking. So if they even did send it for testing was it an independent company that tested it ? Rest assured this bottle from Kappa Nutrition has the badge/marking as well as all the others like the GMP certification.<br /><br />Once again I rarely review a supplement with a smile like the one I am doing now but it is so refreshing to see a company that cares what it is important to us as the consumers ! This magnesium is working great for me (because it's not fake and very bioavailable).  I hope this may have been helpful ! [SEP] In the '80s I took a lot of vitamins, minerals and herbs and mixed and matched my own concoction of a multi-vitamin and mineral.  The vitamin industry has come up with a lot more advanced compounds for supplements than they did 40 years ago. This Magnesium Bisglycinate Advanced Complex by Kappa Nutrition is supposed to make the magnesium more bioavailable with superior absorption. 2 capsules contain 1,556mg of their advanced magnesium complex providing 280mg of elemental magnesium which is less than the RDA.  They advise 2 capsules for women and 3 capsules for men.  There are 120 capsules in the bottle so it's a 60-day supply for women or a 40-day supply for men. [SEP] I've been taking this for four or five days, and I feel the same as I did on my previous magnesium supplement.<br /><br />The pills are about 3/4 of an inch long and easy to swallow.<br /><br />The expiration date is in 2024, so about 2 years from now.<br /><br />Seems fine to me! [SEP] These have worked well. Been a couple of weeks now, and no adverse effects to report. Also, my sleep quality has actually improved. Very surprised, would definitely repurchase these for myself. [SEP] It works but don't mix too much with lotions/moisturizers [SEP] I need to take magnesium due to low bone density issues which is the result of cancer treatment decades ago.  I have learned that not all magnesium supplements are created equally and that some forms of magnesium are more readily absorbed than other forms -  the National Institute of Health notes ""studies have found that magnesium in the aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms is absorbed more completely and is more bioavailable than magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate.""  As a result, I switched from the less expensive magnesium oxide I had been taking to using more absorbable forms of magnesium.  My research led me to find that magnesium diglycinate is one of the most readily available forms of magnesium for digestion.  One study, entitled Bioavailability of Magnesium Diglycinate vs Magnesium Oxide in Patients with Ileal Resection confirms how much better-absorbed magnesium diglycinate is over the common magnesium oxide.  As a result, magnesium diglycinate is one of the best magnesium forms available for absorption.<br /><br />For a magnesium supplement, this has almost all the positives going for it (the only thing lacking is they are not organic):<br /><br />Made in the USA<br />Third-party tested<br /> Vegan capsule<br />Uses Magnesium Diglycinate<br />Well-sized and easy to swallow<br /><br />The only issue I have with this supplement is that to get 420 mg of magnesium requires 3 capsules rather than the daily dosage indicated on the package of 2 capsules.  Given the emphasis on the product page and package of 420 mg of magnesium and that the product contains 60 servings, I believed that one serving contained 420 mg of magnesium when the 2 capsule recommended serving contains only 280 mg of magnesium. [SEP] As many now know, magnesium is need for hundreds of chemical processes in the human body.  Most people buy it for muscle relaxation, sleep or to relieve muscle cramps at night, but there many other positives to taking magnesium.  Almost everyone is low in Mg, unless they supplement.  But here's the KEY, all Mg is not created equal.<br />The lowest quality, least soluble form is Magnesium Oxide.  This is basically useless and is actually the ""rust"" or oxidated form of magnesium.  This is also the cheapest and most magnesium supplements use only this form.<br />The next up the chain, with a little better absorption and a little more expensive is Magnesium Citrate.<br />The magnesium forms that are considered top tier, with best absorption is a class called chelated Magnesium.  They included Magnesium Malate, Mg Theonate, Mg glycinate and bisglycinate and a few others.  These are the forms that are the most soluble and the best quality......BUT they also cost the most.<br />This Magnesium uses a chelated form, which is one of the best.  ""Bisglycinate Chelate"" is the form used in this supplement.<br />This supplement uses a superior form of magnesium, is more absorbable and more bioavailable.  I personally take this and also recommend this to my patients.<br />Side note:. Too much magnesium, taken too frequently, will cause diarrhea, but you can work up the dose slowly to avoid this.",3,True

[SEP] These are wonderfully fancy punch glasses. Most of the cup is clear so you can see into your cup  easily, but the top of the cup is gold. It looks really nice. They cups come packaged well to prevent crushing - a thick sturdy cardboard box and bubble wrap inside the box. They are the perfect addition to any party. [SEP] These Homely Connect 100 Gold Plastic Cups are really pretty, and have some weight to them. The cups are 9oz and have a nice gold trim around each one, and come in two different stacks in the box. They came well packaged, and are really nice cups and would be good for any occasion! [SEP] These plastic cups come in a nice box. They have gold color along the rim. They are thin and lightweight, which is perfect when you need a disposable cup. [SEP] Great cups [SEP] Ordered for an 80s party at work. They were a great buy - reasonably priced and worked well for mocktails. [SEP] It’s amazing how just this gold lip adds so much to the cup. We wanted a classy touch to a party, but didn’t want to wash afterwards so this was a good choice. Great packaging as well. Thx [SEP] I like the gold bands around the cups. It added a bit of elegance and match my decor. I purchased these cups to use for a bourbon tasting. Well made and durable.",3,True

They have perforations, and they're easy to tear off one, but the paper towels themselves aren't easily torn. I've been quite pleased with them. [SEP] If you have to use paper towels, KitchLife Bamboo Towels are a great alternative.  The paper towels are square and perforated for easy removal from the roll.  They are very durable and can be reused multiple times.  I like to use these to clean water droplets from around my sink.  I have used the same one for a few days now and it is still in great shape.  These are definitely a great alterative to traditional paper towels and I love that they are more environmentally friendly. [SEP] I love paper towels, but hate the waste. So these bamboo paper towels are the perfect ""happy medium"" for my needs. The bamboo makes them extra thick and durable, so that you can wash and let them air dry and continue to reuse them as long as you'd like. They have a very thick build to them so you can easily use them to scrub dishes or any other stubborn areas that you need to. [SEP] We use way too much paper towel in my house. You really can rinse and reuse these!! [SEP] I will just use this as a paper towel and throw it away. I may use it for more heavy duty things but I so t reuse it. I’m not that thrifty anymore. Plus the things I use it on you’d want to throw it away. Nice paper towels though. [SEP] Not good, the whole roll sticks together. [SEP] These bamboo towels are so much nicer/thicker  than regular paper towels. I have yet to have one tear apart on me while using and I mean really using…and then rinsing and using again! The design is beautiful and the fact that these are environmentally friendly-you can’t go wrong with these!

JJ Autumn 100% Vegan All Natural Dental Floss - Waxed Corn Starch Thread with Soothing Mint Oil 54.6-Yard,[],[],,3.2,21,1621,"This was worse than eating corn in the cob. I came in trying to floss, and I left with strings that I had to remove by flossing with regular floss. I’m not sure why this stuff was so fragile, but it’s absolutely useless unless you have really spaced out teeth. I wish it had worked better, since I support the eco-friendly packaging it came in. [SEP] Even though it's coated, I still had a hard time threading this through some of the gaps in my teeth. It was too thick to get through in places, and it shredded. I have very sensitive teeth and gums and only Glide has managed to work for me, so someone else with different sensitivities may like this brand. [SEP] I like the fact that this dental floss is not enclosed in a plastic container (better for the environment to be in a paper box). I also like that it is made from limited ingredients (see my pictures). However, if the dental floss does not get thread through the cutter at the top of the box, it easily slips back into the box which is a little frustrating because you have to open the box to thread it through the cutter - and this is a paper box so it won’t withstand a lot of opening the box. Also, when flossing in tight spaces, this dental floss has a tendency to break - which leaves floss in your teeth. I would recommend the retailer finding a way to make it a little stronger. [SEP] As a lifelong flosser I was excited to try this floss.  I like the feel of it, its thin and seems to dig in to any buildup on my teeth.  Thats where the good review ends.  The box and metal cutter are pretty flimsy and I am always in danger of loosing the end of the floss back into the box.  The biggest concern I have is the weakness of the thread.  My first floss lasted a few seconds and the floss broke.  A second peace broke in the same spot. After four breaks I pulled out a different brand and flossed that tooth with no breakage.  I tried going back to my original floss and broke it twice before a successful round could be completed.  One break or two I can understand but this was too much.  The slightest sharp edge on a tooth renders this worthless. [SEP] I am so hopeful that this will get better that I keep trying to use it.  Unfortunately I usually only make it through two or three teeth before it breaks.  It feels waxy and thin.  So it goes in easily but it usually rips when you pull it up an out.  It is great that it is environmentally friendly.  It really did not have much of a flavor for me.  Overall I just think this is junk and more wasteful though since I have to use about 5 pieces to get through my mouth one time. [SEP] I have tight space between my teeth and several caps on my teeth. This works in between the regular teeth but it catches and snags on the edges of my caps were the teeth are tightly packed. I like the environmentally friendly features, but I can't say I would purposely get this since it catches too much. [SEP] Tried 2-3 consecutive days and it just ripped every time on the first or second tooth. Returned. All for natural products, provided they do what they’re supposed to. This product did not. [SEP] This is not good floss<br />its really thin and flimsy<br />its natural.. and i want to support it<br />but it just cant hang with the reality of my tight teeth.",3,True

[SEP] Cute little box.  I was hoping it would be deep enough and large enough holes to hold my larger bottles.  It isn't, but still holds a lot of EO bottles so I will keep it. [SEP] Amazing quality for the price! Very well made wooden box designed specifically for the storage of essential oil bottles. I have a bunch of them (essential oil bottles) but not enough to fill the box. This makes organizing and finding the scent I want much easier. I also find that if you use a box like this, the bottles are less likely to leak in your drawer, or a dresser top.

"Organic Doctor Organic Charcoal Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce",[],[],6.99,3.2,25,259,"This is a forts for me, and I wasn’t sure if this was going to be a waste of f money and time.  I wash my hair daily now, due to exercising needs.  What I loved about this conditioner and despite the color and the initial scent. The end results was beautifully soft hair and a beautiful honeysuckle smelll!  If it weren’t for the fact I washed my hair everyday, the fragrance would linger.  It is not overpowering at all, just a whiff when you shake your head.  Wow. I can’t believe this conditioner, and it didn’t leave my hair feeling too thick and sticky.  I am converted to continue with this brand.  Not sure I am brave enough to try the other brands.  Definitely a hit for me. [SEP] At first I thought this was just weird. Black and unlike other conditioners I've used. It's got a faint charcoal scent. I gave it a shot and it actually works really well to get the gunk off my hair. Whereas most conditioners feel slippery, this one actually feels the opposite. I can't say I prefer that or not, but something to be aware of.  Give it a shot. [SEP] Though the gray color put me off at first, the results were great--soft, shiny hair. The smell is strong, but it  reminds me of a spa that uses a lot of natural products and I like it. [SEP] It is a good idea to change conditioners from time to time. This is a great product that has a strange scent but doesn't bother me or my wife (who is more sensitive to scents than me). The active ingredient is charcoal so it will detox your hair if you have been subjecting it to a lot of harsh chemicals. [SEP] Okay,, scared at first. Charcoal black conditioner on light hair?  Nothing to fear!  I love the light scent, and my hair feels softer and thicker- really.<br /><br />There was NO unwelcome color transfer ( I have natural salt and pepper going on now) and, if anything, the silver looks BRIGHTER and the overall shine is fantastic!<br /><br />I have happily used this brands body wash too-- looks a bit scary, but again EXCELLENT results with a nice fresh unisex light scent.  Charcoal  is  so on-trend right now, time for you to jump on-board!  The cosmetic chemists have done a sensational job with this line. Easily the best charcoal product line I have used. [SEP] Although I don't like the scent of the charcoal, I like to use this conditioner paired with the Charcoal Shampoo to give my hair a bit of detox once a month. It makes my scalp and hair feel very clean, and rids it of all the residue from the previous shampoos and conditioners. [SEP] This conditioner was just not for me.  I thought it left my hair well-conditioned but the reasons it was not for me are sorta off the wall.  For example, I did not like the color....I did not like the odor (although it didn't last a long time); and the darkness of the color made me wonder if it would affect the color of my hair.  I don't think this are reasons for customers to pass it by, they were strictly personal.<br /><br />The color did not bother my hair color.  The smell did not last long enough to be overly bothersome.  The dark color was a new  reason for me not to like a product;  it was coupled with the other reason.  None of the ingredients bothered me at all.  Nor did the price bother me as I certainly pay as much as $40 for the same amount of conditioner.<br />I added a star for that reason alone.  So, all in all, I think potential customers should give this a try, particularly so if you have read up on the reasons  why charcoal has crept into a lot of our body washes, face scrubs and body scrubs.  It seems to be everywhere all of a sudden.  I did not think my 'dislike' reasons were bad enough to give it less stars as it did a credible job as it promised. [SEP] Smells like a health food store! But in an herbal good way. I can use this all the way to my scalp and not have buildup. It leaves my hair so soft. It won't make me replace my Pureology but I save this to take on trips. Very nice. [SEP] Great conditioner from Organic Doctor. I have never thought to use a charcoal conditioner. It’s unlike any kind of conditioner I have used before. Typically it’s thick paste-like and feels that way when I put it in my hair. And then water it off and it leaves my hair Smith. This conditioner has less thickness to the texture and does not “lather”. So it feels more dry. However, I admit, I am really enjoying the results. My hair doesn’t feel softer, but has a nice sheen to it. I don’t get that from all conditioners. Further, my hair has a more relaxed feel. I am not using Organic Doctors shampoo, just the conditioner. I imagine the effects would be greater if used in tandem. [SEP] This conditioner left my hair feeling soft and smooth after one use.  I love that I'm not adding unnatural ingredients to my cleansing routine so I like to use this in addition to my keratin treatments to strip away my regularly used conditioner once a week giving my hair a fresh start.  The minty smell is nice and refreshing and better than I was expecting for a natural conditioner.  At $10 for 9 oz, it is a little pricey for a consumable, but when I'm using it once a week, it is a doable splurge.",3,True

Well, I'm new to the idea of using something designed especially for cleaning the face.  These Makeup Remover Cloths are wonderful.  They are so, so soft and easy to use.  All these years a simple wash cloth that matched the rest of the towels was my go-to for removing any stuff on my face, and sometimes staining them.  These Microfiber cloths are so soft and skin-friendly, and they seem to remove any makeup more efficiently, and wash up so much better than the cotton wash cloths.  This package contains four 8 1/2"" square cloths, and eight 3 1/2"" round cloths, so plenty for any job.  I think that even if a person didn't wear makeup, these would be great just for freshening the face, you only need water.

If you are okay with that, then they are for you They also do not dry quickly like the MUE does.<br /><br />I used this with just water, then followed with my MUE, I was horrified at what the MUE removed AFTER using this brand first. Stay with what works - for me, it's the MUE. Normally I do use a foaming cleansing in the AM with my MUE and double cleanse in the PM using my MUE - but for testing purposes I wanted to see if this product worked like the MUE without product and it did not. I was also concerned about the item not drying and staying moist unlike the MUE, which dries out really quick after use.<br /><br />I currently use these more as cleaning cloths - not for what I actually bought them for. [SEP] I was surprised at how big the shipping box was for only makeup remover cloths, then I opened the box and saw the bag of cloths that nearly filled up the shipping box! Too many things ordered online nowadays seem to have the dimensions of a postage stamp in person, so this was a pleasant surprise!<br /><br />Very soft on both sides, thick, the colors are vibrant and can be color coded if you want that.<br /><br />Could be used like a washcloth if circumstances tend toward you wearing less makeup.

I think it feels more like a nice quality throw blanket (not like typical microfiber cloths/towels) and these cloths feel the same on both sides (unlike most throw blankets where one side not as soft or smooth feeling). The cloth is like the size of a large pot holder. I like that it included small round ones that are perfect for around the eyes. I'm not wearing much makeup these days since all this mask wearing but I did wash my face with it. It feels nice and gentle on my skin. I first tried it with just water but I felt my skin was still felt a little bit oily so I used a little bit of cleanser with it and my face felt a lot cleaner. The cloth absorbs a lot of water. I just washed it by hand after using it and hung it to dry. It dried beautifully in a few hours and it looked brand new as if I had just taken it out of the package.

I have long fingers so the length is perfect, but they are a little baggy. No worries! They still work well for washing dishes and general cleaning around the house. Be sure to note that only the teal gloves are flocked and the pink and white gloves are not. I'm fine with either, but that may cause an issue to others. [SEP] Durable and comfy! I clean vacated apartments and they can be quite a mess. I LOVE these gloves they come almost to elbow and they dont make me all sweaty and gross feeling like a lot of rubber gloves do. 5 stars! [SEP] These household gloves are made of PVC instead of latex and come in a 4-pack that includes 2 green flocklined pairs and 2 white/pink unlined pairs. Each pair is separately sealed. The colors are quite pretty compared to my standard yellow household gloves, and these gloves have cute details like scalloped rims at the opening with dots and little flowers.<br /><br />These gloves feel thicker and a little bulkier than my usual yellow latex gloves. I do like the feel of the cotton coating inside the two pairs of green gloves as it prevents and/or absorbs sweat and keeps them from feeling clammy or sticky inside. The white/pink unlined gloves don’t feel as comfortable as the PVC does feel sticky to my skin, but they’re ok for short time periods. I’d prefer all the gloves were coated with cotton inside.<br /><br />These gloves come up higher on my forearms than my similar household gloves, so they offer good protection of my arms and hands from hot or dirty water and grime when I’m washing dishes, cleaning the toilets and so on. The hands have a grippy exterior, so my dishes, wine glasses and other breakables don’t slip through my hands as easily.<br /><br />These gloves seem to run big. I normally wear a size L in household gloves, but the size L are roomy everywhere. I can and do still use them, but my dexterity isn’t quite as good, they slip down almost off my fingers and the arms gape open a bit much. I’ve reused both styles of gloves and haven’t had any issues of tearing, and I find these easy to get on and off. While not perfect, I like these household gloves for chores pretty well (especially the coated pairs). 3.5 stars. [SEP] All kidding aside (well, they ARE cute!), these PVC (yes!! not latex but STRONG PVC!!!) gloves are VERY sturdy, comfortably lined with flocked material -- update -- only the blue ones are but the white with pink tips are so comfy inside that they fooled me -- I thought they were flocked too) and for me, are just what I need for washing dishes, washing the car (they are big enough to comfortably fit a pair of warm gloves underneath) and clearing out all matter of detritus from my garden while protecting my hands from cold water, wet leaves, mud.<br />I see little difference between the utility of the pink tipped gloves and the blue gloves, although the pink fingertips seem to enhance the strength of those specific gloves. And since there are four in this set, I can rotate them for better  longevity.<br />And since the cuffs are longer than usual, there is little chance for me to get water into them while I'm using them -- hence they are so much easier to stay dry and be available for more use in a heartbeat.<br />The price, divided by four (the set)  is terrific!! [SEP] I love these gloves they are high quality gloves. These are large and usually when I wear large on the other gloves I can only get them to just barely above my wrist. These go all the way up and stay. They don't break down. They clean off easy after each use. Dry fast when hung up. Keeps your hands from getting dirty or wet. Come in great colors. Great deal ,Great for all your needs or DIY projects. I hope this has helped. Thank You [SEP] I received a packet with ""green"" (turquoise) and white/pink gloves; each pair was individually wrapped.  The gloves fit well and were comfortable, although I prefer the green ones with the flocked lining.  I particularly liked the length - they cover about 2/3 of my forearm.  I also liked the feminine touch with a scalloped edge and flower motif.  The fingers and the palm are textured to ensure a good grip with wet surfaces.<br /><br />These are made of PVC so those with latex allergies can use them without concern. [SEP] I love how thick these gloves are.  They are comfortable enough for cleaning but make my hands really hot.  They do last a good while and haven't started to fall apart or rip. [SEP] These gloves are perfect. Not only do they come individually wrapped, keeping them sanitized, they are tough material. One lasted a month before breaking and it was my fault because I was washing a knife and poked my glove with it. Otherwise, it would have continued strong. I hate washing dishes without gloves and go through them rather quickly. I use various brands and find that these are the best. They are lined which is so helpful! The fit is also spot on. I HIGHLY recommend them.<br /><br />**If this review was helpful, please press the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you!**",3,True

Sometimes, however, I can not get the wheatgrass so I am limited to what I can find that is available like this.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a WHEATGRASS JUICE powder.  That is important because you are not getting all of the fiber like wheatgrass powder has which tastes awful.  It is a bright green and needs to be kept sealed in the foil bag it came in.<br /><br />HOW TO USE IT?<br />I have found the best way to use wheatgrass is alone.  In absolute dire necessity fresh apple juice will go with it, but anything else tends to give an upset stomach.  I put a tsp of powder in a small glass of water, put it in my tiny cordless blender, blend it up and drink it.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT TASTE?<br />As much as I prefer fresh wheatgrass juice, this is a decent substitute.  I did not find it repulsive or difficult to drink and it is a pretty green color too.  Some might find the flavor a bit over whelming, but I like it.<br /><br />DOES IT HELP?<br />Believe it or not, it does help some.  Not as much as fresh juice, but it still does perk me up a bit.<br /><br />OTHER USE?<br />I use a tiny bit of juice in our cat's homemade food on the winter time.  That way she is getting some greens but not in an overwhelming amount.  She loves it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great way to get wheatgrass juice if you don't have any way to get fresh.  It should be kept sealed and consumed regularly until gone and kept in the refrigerator once opened to keep it fresher.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I am glad to have this and am surprised at how good it is compared to others I have had which I did not like.  I would buy it again. [SEP] It has been a tough winter.  We have barely seen the sun for weeks at a time.  That has a tendency to make a person cranky and feeling more tired than normal.  I have been trying to get more fresh, raw, and green into my body to help counteract this winter problem.  Let's take a look at this..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a pretty large foil sealed bag of barley juice powder.  Notice it says JUICE.  That is essential when you are taking barely green.  Some people think that buying ground up barlely greens is just as good- it isn't.  This is very bright green and smells VERY fresh.<br /><br />HOW DO I USE THIS?<br />I do not put this into things, but I prefer to get some refrigerator cold water, put it in my tiny cordless blender, and put a teaspoon of this powder in.  I run it for one cycle which is barely a minute, and then I have the most luscious fresh green drink you can get without fresh greens.  There is a lovely layer of foam on it and it tastes heavenly.<br /><br />DOES IT REALLY TASTE THAT GOOD?<br />I must preface this by saying that I have had varieties of green powders, fresh green drinks including fresh wheatgrass and kale smoothies.  I know what fresh juice from many greens tastes like as I have made them from time to time.  This powder is one of the best I have had since the days when I used to take Green Magma from Japan, which was one of the original barley juice powders.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS COMPARE TO WHEATGRASS?<br />This has a sweetness that is not quite as intense as wheatgrass juice is.  It is easier to drink in my opinion than wheatgrass.<br /><br />DOES IT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE?<br />I will say that using barley juice powder helps a lot to add energy to my day, helps me to sleep better and it does tend to detox.  I would recommend you start with a half teaspoon at first if you are not used to this kind of product.  Work up to a teaspoon.  It also does keep me regular and not feeling quite so wiped out in times of stress.<br /><br />DID I GET A DETOX REACTION?<br />I eat really healthy, do I did not get a detox reaction, but I also made sure to start with half a teaspoon and work up to a teaspoon.  It is important to go slowly with this as it can be a bit much if you are not used to it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This has given me energy, a more positive outlook, helped me feel supplemented, and definitely is helping me through winter very well compared to not having it  This tastes fresh and makes a wonderful drink.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I will be buying this again.  I stopped getting barley juice powder because I just could not find a really good quality one.. until now.  (grins). [SEP] Barley grass has been well known as a superfood for at least 30 years, which is when I was first introduced to it and began taking it. Some of the well documented health benefits of barley grass include:<br /><br />--It is a source of high quality protein, vitamins and minerals.<br />--It is filled with chlorophyll, which is a powerful antioxidant. As such, it is very helpful in controlling or preventing many diseases, due to enhancing immune function. Some of these diseases include: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, inflammation and diseases impacted by inflammation.<br /><br />Barley grass powder is similar to wheatgrass powder as to its health benefits, and both tend to be quite expensive. Buying this organic green superfood in bulk from this vendor is a cost-effective way of obtaining this wonderful supplement. [SEP] This stuff is GREEN!  But it's a nice deep green which tells me it's loaded with good wheat grass juice.  I'm not particularly fond of the taste but it's drinkable.  I know I'm getting good nutrition when I drink it so I easily tolerate the taste.  It mixes up nicely in water and that's the only way I've been drinking it so far.  I kind of got off of smoothies but will try some in one eventually.  The bag is big with a lot of servings.  I've never had wheat grass juice before so when it came up on my list of items I could review I wanted to try it and am glad I did. [SEP] This is my first experience with Barley Grass Juice powder and I think I love it.  I've read that it's a complete food and is excellent for Vegans and Vegetarians though I'm neither.  I don't know the exact price of this bag as of this review, but I think it's probably around $48.00, which is out of my price range.  Therefore, I will consume it for the health benefits, (probably in more smoothies) and then go back to my other green superfoods that I also love.  This is very good, high quality barley grass JUICE powder and not the Barley plant dried and ground up. [SEP] I really like the taste of this wheatgrass powder. I like to replace some of my meals with wheatgrass shakes and I have been able to easily meet my weight loss goal by doing this. [SEP] This powder smells like a fresh bale of hay, and tastes okay. It dissolves pretty well in water. I'm putting it in my smoothies and the taste is pleasant and isn't a consideration in the smoothie. In water the taste is okay, I may grow to like it in the same way I grew to like stevia, because it's good for me. It doesn't taste like wheat grass, but it's better tasting than Spirulina, in my personal opinion. The product feels good, good energy and the quality seems excellent.  Great value, and convenient. 5 stars. [SEP] I add this to smoothies for an extra green boost. The flavor is very clean. Those unfamiliar with barley grass juice (in liquid or powder form) may find it bitter and slightly off-putting to consume by itself, but in a smoothie you can't taste it at all. Love this stuff! [SEP] This is my favorite organic Barley Grass Juice powder for making morning smoothie. The price is very reasonable too. [SEP] This ones easy if you’re a fan of Wheatgrass Shots. A shot of it in an establishment can cost a few bucks and this bag is currently $34.99 and has enough for 266 Shots inside; Deal! I think it’s also a comparable price in general too.<br />  It’s a taste that I just had to remember that it’s good for me so, I like it now. I just add it into my concoction of other healthy supplements like this throughout the day for some healthy and natural energy. I would definitely recommend it because of everything I said and because it’s also USDA Organic.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁",3,True
"ComforTrac Wave Cervical Traction Neck Support & Stretcher – Made in USA, Provides Ergonomically Correct Support for Relief of Pain, Headaches, Cervicalgia, TMJ & Spine Alignment",[],[],34.95,3.8,47,177,"Simple instructions are provided but it is unclear of the correct positioning of the neck without looking at the photos on the Amazon site because the sketch in the instructions does not match the slope of this ""pillow."" Note that I have tried three other varieties of pillows and this is as good as the 5 star one listed below. The only reason I am rating this 4 stars is because the price is double what others charge.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09KQ3R1J1 one like this for half the price]] - 5 stars<br />[[ASIN:B09F7PH4QR foam one]] - 4 stars<br />[[ASIN:B09G9YKF1H wedge pillow]] - 4 stars<br /><br />For 10 minutes (one can go up to 15 minutes) I just wedged this under my neck with the open wave in the back of my head and let my head fall back. It is super comfortable to use. This actually works for me to help but not eliminate my neck pain.<br /><br />I woke up many months ago with neck pain. After trying everything I could think of, I went to a chiropractor. His adjustments were helping me and he gave me a similar exercise that this helps one perform. He had me roll up a towel, lay on the floor, and then put it under my upper back so that my neck was hanging back.<br /><br />Now I do not have to spend time rolling up a towel. Also, this is firm yet soft enough in the center to be comfortable which is better for alignment. It works great and did not  take any getting used to like the foam device I have. This is a perfect daily exercise for my neck. I just lay on the floor while the back of my neck/head hangs over this. I am able to do this for 10 minutes.<br /><br />In summary, this works for me but the current price of $49.95 is extremely expensive for this. Had it been $29 or less, this would have received 5 stars. I just wish it came with better pictures in the instructions. [SEP] Over the past eight months, I’ve tried a few different neck traction pillows. I’ve found they are all quite similar and accomplish the same goal, with only slight variations in design. This one, like most others, is made of a hard foam with just the slightest bit of give when you rest your head on it. It’s possible to use the pillow in either direction, one way providing a more gentle stretch, the other, a more intense stretch. This pillow does not have the bumps and nodes that some others have which are supposed to provide some acupressure and massage to your neck, though I can’t say that they make much of a difference for me. This pillow does, however, have a softer cushion in the center that makes it a little more comfortable on the back of my head. It's a very nice feature.<br /><br />If you’re new to this type of device, go slow. When I first used one of these pillows, I could only lie on it for a few minutes at a time, but have worked my way up to 10-15 minutes twice a day. I also recommend starting with the side that gives you the more gentle stretch. For me, using a device like this has provided quite a lot of relief to my neck and shoulders that tend to carry a lot of tension since I sit at a computer all day.<br /><br />If you’re looking for an alternative to medication for some relief for back and neck pain, this is definitely worth a try. [SEP] I have tried a few different kinds of neck traction and find this one the easiest and the comfiest way for me to ease my neck, shoulder and back pain.<br />The material is of great quality, no weird smell and it’s very easy to store. Compared to others it may be pricey but for the comfort you get this kinda justify it.<br />I am not completely pain free but I’m glad that this thing is helping me ease the pain and hopefully over time this will help me fix my neck issues. [SEP] I'm behind a computer screen with my head down a lot and I am also a bit too into my phone for my own good. The consequence of that is neck and shoulder pain. This does seem to provide a little traction support and I could feel the glorious pull of muscle in my right shoulder and neck area when I had a terrible knot. It really did feel great! The material seems solid and it's solidly constructed. It seems to be on the spendy side (because it's USA made maybe) of this type of product and not having owned one before I can't comment whether it's worth the extra cost or not, but I do like it and and does what it's supposed to. One note, I can't use it for long lengths at a time. [SEP] I loved the shape and the support it's give to the neck. Thank's. The package arrived intact. Well done! [SEP] For years now I've dodged sit ups and pilates moves that require my neck to be off the floor. With this neck support gadget, I'm able to do my ""One Hundred"" again with Denise Austin (yes, the DVD is 20+ years old by now). My one complaint is that this gadget is too hard. If it had a bit more cushioning, I'd give it 5+ stars for sure. [SEP] This is a great neck relief gadget. I use it 10 minutes at a time at the end of each workday to relieve the neck tension from staring at a screen all day long. It is great for after a hard workout session too as part of post workout stretching routine. The instructions are pretty light but you have videos online to reference. It's made of a study soft material and not straight hard plastic. [SEP] Although this is a little uncomfortable with the first use, this product has helped my tight neck muscles so much. I wasn’t sure that this would really make a difference but I was really desperate as the tension in my neck was causing headaches. I use this every night and it helps so much! I’m so happy! [SEP] I have been experiencing neck pain and I’m sure it’s from strain from using electronic devices. I got this product to see if I could help diminish that pain. I’ve been using it the last three days for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time and it does take a little bit of getting used to. I wish they were a little bit better instructions on head placement, but I have somewhat figured it out myself. I do feel like some of my pain has been relieved by using this and I will continue using it to try to get my neck and spine back into alignment. I think it’s a good tool to have for neck strain. [SEP] The ComforTrac Wave Cervical Traction Neck Support helps to stretch my neck in the correct, ergonomic direction to assist with headache reduction. It is one solid unit and very lightweight. I couldn’t find the exact materials this device is made of, but it feels like a rubberized plastic with soft’ish’ lighter colored foam insets. I only notice the very slightest ‘give’ to the shape when I press hard enough on it with body weight. So, I’m not entirely certain it has ‘give’ at all with just the weight of my head on it.<br /><br />It’s fairly compact measuring 8.5”Wx7.0”Dx4.75”H so it’s easy to store. It will even slide right under a bed assuming the bed is standard height or taller.<br /><br />The materials look to be very durable so this device should have a long life. It is really easy to clean and disinfect due to the hardened feel of the material. It doesn’t have an unpleasant odor. In fact, it just smells very lightly of rubber.<br /><br />I wasn’t impressed with the instructions but found a way to lay my neck over it that was comfortable enough anyway. I ordered this product with hopes that regular use, along with chiropractic and physical therapy, could help restore some of the natural curve back to my cervical spine as well as reduce pain due to herniated discs, pinched nerves, and chronic muscle spasms.<br /><br />There’s no special rubber bottom for traction on the floor but it seems to hold very well without it. It doesn’t slip when I position my neck over it. I can’t get my head to hang backwards over it like advertisement photos demonstrate due to my neck curvature issues, but that’s the goal. I realize achieving the goal will take time and regular use so I wasn’t unrealistically expecting immediate pain relief.<br /><br />I also use the raised upper ledge of the device to roll the muscles across as a type of mini massage. It’s also good for applying targeted pressure for trigger point therapy with the same technique of utilizing the raised areas.<br /><br />It has not eliminated pain. I think that will be a long time coming, if ever, but it does help to reduce headaches for short periods of time with the trigger point work.<br /><br />It is definitely, grossly overpriced. Other products are available on Amazon that are nearly identical to this one for half the price.  Otherwise, I’d give it 5 stars. Hopefully, the seller catches on and does a reasonable price adjustment.",3,True

There is also a USB cord for charging and also a user’s manual.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Facial Cleansing Brush to family and friends.

It’s easy to use, easy to handle and dose a good job. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t bother it. [SEP] I bought this for my niece that just turned 12. She's been having some acne on her face, as well as almost everyone else her age. She especially had a cluster between her eyebrows and in her temples as well as on her nose.<br />She has been using this for about a week now and it has already made a considerable difference. She has her first dance in a couple of weeks, and I suspect that she will be cleared up for the dance!<br />She says she has quickly discovered what ends work best for what zones on her face, switching to a different one for different locations to reach and strength. [SEP] This Glowa Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush works well.  It is sonics to there is vibrations along with the rotating brush heads.  It has 3 different speeds and 3 different brush heads.  I ordered this sonic brush due to it darker colors and its masculine design.  It works well and is easy to use while I wash my face.  I like to keep it on the bathroom counter but If there is a brush head on it, it is top heavy and will fall over.  Ideally it would be more convenient to be able to stand on its own.  Overall I like the design and is a nice addition to my face care routine. [SEP] Really love the one that is more like silicone. Massages the face and cleans at the same time. Like using it in the shower with my purity facial cleaner. Easy to change out to the brush head. You charged it via USB so you will need an adapter for your outlet if you don't have USB in the bathroom. Would make a wonderful gift for anyone really who enjoys clean skin. [SEP] I got the white version of this and since my son really likes it, I got him this black. If you have a teenager (specially boys) this is a nice way to introduce them how to properly take care of their face now that they are having pimples or wanting to avoid to have them.<br />The product is user friendly and extremely well made. The brushes that comes with it is super nice and don’t let that soft bristles fool you coz they do the job real well. He loves the silicone brush head the most as it helps cleans out his pores and have been helping him to have less pimples lately.<br />Battery last a long time and charging is fast. Uses USB C! [SEP] I love the simple look of this facial cleaner. The buttons are easy to navigate and use. Uses USB C and charging and is fast. Battery last a long time. The brush heads are very nice and works real good. The only issue I have is interchanging them coz it gets hard at times and I have to mind how I remove it or else I will hurt my finger. If you have a long finger nails I suggest you ask someone to change it for you or figure a way to remove it without break your nails. I wish they added a release button to make it easy. For the price I think it should be added.<br />Overall the product is extremely well made and is ergonomically designed. Definitely one of my favorite facial cleaner! [SEP] I use a facial spin brush daily, and decided to order one for my hubby. He gets ingrown hairs from shaving, and the Ohio winters make for extra dry flaky skin. This brush did wonders to not only help exfoliate and prevent ingrown hairs from happening, but it also helped with dry flaky skin issues. He surprisingly uses it regularly and has good things to say about it. Overall recommended. [SEP] This facial cleansing brush does a fantastic job of removing dirt and debris from your face and neck. It gently exfoliates leaving your pores smaller, skin softer, and younger looking. It stays charges for a really long time, and is great for everyday use. [SEP] I have tried a few different cleaning brushes and the Glowa Sonic Facial Cleansing Brush is one of the better ones.  It comes with three different cleaning brushes which are easy to put on and take off.  It is very comfortable to hold and has a sleek design.  I like that there three different brushes.

NatureWorks HydroMATE Electrolytes Powder Packets Hydration Accelerator Drink Mix Rapid Party Relief Recovery Vitamin C Orange Citrus 30 Count,[],[],,4.1,188,472,"Little packets resisted tearing open for me. I ended up needing scissors or a knife to easily open these. The flavor was okay. Seemed to help in hydrating the skin something I need a lot of help with. I've had better mix-ins and I've had worse. [SEP] I know this increases my hydration and I am drinking it. I just don't care for the taste. Citrus is always what I choose first but this just doesn't taste good to me. Has an aftertaste that I don't care for. I have found using a half a pack makes it much more tolerable. [SEP] As others have mentioned, this is a good electrolyte mix with lower than average calories and sugar content.  The quality is good and the price is on par with other quality electrolyte drink mixes.  I don't really love the flavor of this particular one as well as some of their others, but I also recognize that taste is a subjective thing and there may be others that think this is the best ever, so not taking any stars off for the flavor. [SEP] I actually was able to try several different flavors from this line.  I liked some more than others, but all of them were not bad.  I love how these are both for hydration and also have the added immunity benefits.  I just mix with a bottle of water and I am good to go.  The packets are convenient for easy use and for the on the go.<br />I like that these were not salty tasting compared to some electrolytes I have tried.  I also like the price point as it is pretty decent for a 30 pack, especially compared to others I have tried. [SEP] We live in the south. You need all the help when you live in the south in the summer. The humidity and heat are brutal. If you don't beat the heat, you'll need these. The trick I found to these is to do a little more than 32oz of water. I do 4oz with warm water for the powder to dissolve and then I had 30 oz of cold water and ice cubes and shake again. These tastes much better cold, but the powder dissolves easier when it's mixed in warm water initially.<br /><br />The orange tastes good. It is a bit sweeter than I would like, but sweet is better than salty and the sweetness gets better when you add those extra couple oz of water. It doesn't taste like the fake sugar thankfully. And it doesn't taste like salt which I half expected like other fluid replacement and electrolyte mixes.<br /><br />They come in an easy to keep package. Grab what you need and stick it back in the closet. These are even good for school sports since you can hydrate a whole team for just over $1 a piece. Still cheaper than name brand. [SEP] I'd forgotten that I'd ordered an assortment package of these hydration drinks a few months back.  When I tried the various flavors back then I liked one of the flavors but I did not like the orange citrus flavor.  I tried to put my previous experience aside and mixed up a new glass.  That's when I noticed that the packet is supposed to be mixed with 32 ounces of water.  I think I mixed my previous try with 8 ounces.  That's where the ""stupid"" comes in.  Once I actually mixed the packet with 32 ounces the result was completely different.  It's still not the best tasting drink out there but it's a whole lot better than it was with only 8 ounces of water.  Mixed correctly the orange citrus taste is weak and the mixture seems a bit sweet.  I use hydration drinks during the hotter months here in Central Arkansas, which means from April through October.  Although not my favorite hydration drink, it does taste reasonably good and now I have to go back and modify my previous review.  My dad always said: ""If brains were gunpowder, you wouldn't have enough to blow your nose.""  I guessing he may have been right. [SEP] I actually was able to try several different flavors from this line.  I liked some more than others, but all of them were not bad.  I love how these are both for hydration and also have the added immunity benefits.  I just mix with a bottle of water and I am good to go.  The packets are convenient for easy use and for the on the go.<br />I like that these were not salty tasting compared to some electrolytes I have tried.  I also like the price point as it is pretty decent for a 30 pack, especially compared to others I have tried. [SEP] I actually was able to try several different flavors from this line.

Herb Essential Pure Triphala Powder - 100 g,[],[],,4.1,19,310,"Triphala is probably as ubiquitous in India as aspirin is in the US. It's used for digestive health and overall balance. You can make a tea with it or simply add it to your favorite beverage/smoothie. For the best absorption, you should take it first thing in the morning on an empty stomach.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] Triphala powder is a combination of 3 powerful Ayurvedic herbs - Amla, Bibhitaki and Haritake.  Triphala has several uses which have been studied.  It is an anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogen and a anti-microbial.  It has shown promise in mice studies to reduce belly fat and it is a natural laxative.  It also has shown to be be very helpful in reducing plaque and gum disease.  A mouthwash made of this can help with periodontal disease.  This particular Triphala powder seems to be high quality and is organic. [SEP] This supplement which is used for digestive issues is very good quality. If you are looking for a pure supplement without unnecessary fillers, additives, etc, check this one out. It also works very well. [SEP] Very good for digestion. A great Ayurvedic blend. While it is not a palatable powder on it's own or in water, it is easily consumable in yogurt, raita or lassi. I've even sprinkled some in soups and daals. Just helps with digestion and not feeling bloated. [SEP] Triphala is a great laxative and good purge of our intestine.<br /><br />Worked really well [SEP] CAREFUL how much you use or the effects might not be so gentle!!! [SEP] I got this for my husband as he has ulcers and stomach issues often. He puts this powder in smoothies and teas and do far seems to be helping him a little bit. His ulcers have caused him less frequent flareups since taking this which is mainly why I got it for him. So hopefully it continues to be helpful and I hope to get more soon. [SEP] Triphala powder mixes a few different fruit extracts with a slightly bitter taste and helps with digestive issues and other health concerns. This is a pure, natural powder that can be mixed in a beverage. The bag is resealable. This is a time tested Avurvedic remedy and this bag is a good value for the amount it contains although the bag I received does not appear to be organic certified, so the item listing that says organic may not match the product correctly.",3,True

I love almost everything about this mask. The black color goes with everything too and keeps dirt from showing. There are three in the package.

This mask gets 4.5 stars from me. [SEP] I was surprised upon receiving these masks. I opened the poly shipping bag to find the three masks inside. Not realizing it, I had ripped not only the shipping label but the packaging label at the same time. It contained information about the company and the masks. I found this unprofessional, but I guess the company is saving money by making the shipping polybag their official company packaging.<br />The masks are made very simple, without any adjustability to them. I found them difficult to wear because I wear glasses, and they do not have a nose bridge piece to make them more fitted. The elastic bands are also too long, and it's hard to tie them to make them shorter. Therefore, my glasses always got fogged-up when I wore them.<br />Overall, my impressions are that the packaging is unprofessional, and the masks are subpar and could use improvements. [SEP] I like that these masks don't press against my mouth making it hard to breathe.  The material is nice and soft.  Very comfortable against my face.<br />The elastic has the cord adjusters on them.  Makes it nice to loosen or tighten the elastic as needed to fit my face as it should.<br />The elastic is comfortable against the back of my ears.  Not irritating at all.<br />If I need to wear a mask, I like wearing these. [SEP] Nice masks. They fit my face perfectly. [SEP] These face masks are extra comfortable. They fit nicely around the nose and sweep down to close snugly right under the jaw line. They poke out a bit infront allowing for this nice pocket of air that makes these super comfortable and very easy to breathe in when you are up and moving around. It's an excellent design, mostly. If you are like me, wearing the disposable masks most of the time then you know all about the itchy fibers inside the mask, the burning of the strings behind your ears. So comfort is a bit of a thing for me.<br />That leads us to the downside. There isn't any sort of wire along the top for your nose. What happens here is you have a space where the air you are breathing basically swishes upward. Now if you are conscious of safety as your main concern this is a big fail for a face mask. It should be fitting close to your face around the edges of the mask, otherwise the vapors are escaping and it defeats the purpose of wearing a mask in the first place.<br />That's not to say I think this is entirely a fail. These might be fine for the most part but if you are in a close space with a group of people this is probably not the best mask to be wearing to be considerate of other people's safety.<br /><br />I believe I will be able to use them because I have my own office and I'm not really close to a lot of people. Regardless of that I keep the mask on at all times just to keep other people safe. So I will likely wear these as I think they will do enough under those circumstances. [SEP] These masks fit well and are very comfortable.  I am an adult and these seem overly large and I likely would have been better off with the medium size they offered on another Amazon listing for this same product.  That being said they aren't too tight around the ears, fit the face well and provide some room between your nose/mouth and the mask which is very much appreciated.  I think $18 for 3 is a bit steep these days since everyone is selling masks but they are quite comfortable as I stated before. [SEP] They are bigger masks and a bit on the thick side but thats both fine for winter or cold weather. Also the straps are thin but also very comfortable for my ears. These are surprisingly comfortable and non irritating masks unlike many others I have tried so far, especially the vial disposable ones.<br /><br />I had one where the ear loop broke but that appears to have been a fluke as otherwise the rest have been totally fine. The materials are very soft and it lacks the steel nose thing so these don't hurt after long term wear. [SEP] These are a bit bulky and a little loose but overall a pretty good mask. Soft, comfortable and good for a medium to large sized face. The seam creates a duck bill front which is nice for easier breathing and comfort, but not for ""fashion"". There is no nose clasp so it can be a little loose at the nose and cheeks. It does feel a little cheap but has held up pretty well. [SEP] These black masks are extremely comfortable. There is no nose bridge, but the way they are designed created a good fit and there was not an issue with my glasses fogging up. They provided good coverage for my face, and I did not have any gaps either on the sides of my face nor at my chin. The ear loops, though not adjustable, were comfortable and were the right length for me. These masks appear to be well made, with two rows of stitching all around the edges. The ear loops have the same double row of stitching holding them in, which is nice. The mask is thick (the description says it has built-in dual filters), so it is a little harder to breathe through than others I own. I would wear something a bit more breathable for exercising or for all-day use, but for running errands around town this mask is great. 5 stars.",3,True

It’s been a while since I’ve had a pedicure. My feet are in love! The foot file did a pretty good job of removing rough skin without harm. Works much faster than a pumas stone. I did my husband's feet and he likes a result too. [SEP] WOrks like a charm.  Has the bottom of my feet feeling baby soft.  I have,  the funkiest, sweatiest feet ever seen in a woman.  I have tried the “As Seen on TV” products, and  slathering my feet in coconut oil and wearing socks, etc. to no avail.  But when I found this all the other went in the trash.  I have been using this product on my feet for a few weeks .  After use  I apply some foot cream to smoothen my feet. Foot cream and this scrapper are a  good combination to have healthier looking feet soon. [SEP] It is a waste of time and any amount of money. The charge does not last long enough to use a reasonable time. It is not working well and very ackward using it. [SEP] Oh boy oh boy oh boy! I’m on a mission during COVID-19 to get the most pampered feet of my life. I have plantar fasciitis and so far I’ve started using CROCs, hot foot baths, etc. This was the missing piece! I need to use it a few more times (with soaks in between) to feel confident enough to take pictures of my heels but this definitely helps with the painful cracks. [SEP] Easy to handle and easy to use. Never bought one before so I can’t compare to others but it works well for me. [SEP] This device is really different in that it sucks up the dead skin cells that it removes.  My feet were noticeably smoother after using it on the callouses under the balls of my feet.  Aside from some light powder, there was nothing to clean up.  It seems like it is strong enough for you to press fairly hard and still have it rotate and work.  I would recommend. [SEP] With the electric foot file device I received six (6) small grinding heads, and two (2) large grinding heads. All of them are coarse-grit. There is a USB charging cord but no adapter. Attach either 3 small grinding disks  or one large (your preference), turn on the machine at one of the two (2) speed settings, and it does a fine job at smoothing down dry skin.<br /><br />The vacuum is kind of cool! There is a fan behind the grinding disk mechanism that is facing inwards, into the handheld device. It pulls air through and behind the grinding disks. The dead skin that it catches goes into a fine screen mesh cup with holes that are too small for skin to pass through. Empty the cup by removing the grinding head and a plastic grind head holder. It's easy to clean because the parts are water resistant.<br /><br />One star removed for there being only ""coarse"" grit grinders unlike the ad mentioned. All of mine are ""coarse"" grinders. However, the product works as advertised. Follow-up with something finer like a nail file or fine pumice stone (if needed afterwards). I only needed lotion afterwards.<br /><br />The ad says the following, but I can't see or feel a difference between any of them.<br />>  Three Different Replacement Roller Heads<br />> •  Fine roller head: Suitable for dead skin on hands and feet, or some delicate skin care.<br />> •  Regular roller head: Suitable for new calluses on feet and normal skin care.<br />> •  Coarse roller head: Suitable for stubborn thick calluses on feet, corn, and dead skin. [SEP] I loved it. It gets the job done .  . However becarful clipping the discs of sand paper on. When I pushed down on the sand paper to click in place the plastic clip on the inside broke!

"Heatless Hair Curler For Long Hair Curls，Adjustable Heatless Curling Rod Headband, No Heat Curling Ribbon Kit You Can Sleep In Soft Cotton Curling Ribbon Overnight For Women",[],[],,3.5,36,17087,"I used these last night. I dampened my hair and used the curlers. I slept with it on. I am so impressed how comfortable they were to sleep in. I still need to work on the rolling technique but what I did do made soft curls. I am pleased [SEP] Love these! As described, so awesome not to have to spend hours damaging my hair for curls. [SEP] Love what my hubby named the  KRAKEN .<br />I have very heavy hair and it really doesn’t take curls with heating tools well . The best curls I get are always after taking out two French braids . This is almost as good with the way the curls stay and even better , I can do this myself , I can’t French braid my own hair .<br />I’m totally shocked how well this works. Much better than expected! [SEP] I love curling my hair but I don't like to always use a heat curling iron. This is the weirdest looking no-heat curling headband but it works! I have medium length hair. It's very easy to wrap my hair around the sections. There are no wires in this headband. I wrapped my hair while it was wet with leave-in conditioner and curling creme. I wrapped the main band around my head like a headband then sectioned off my hair for each ""leg"" of the headband. My hair was still a little damp when I took it out but you can see that it worked to make really great full waves. I did have to use my own rubber bands however as the ""legs"" were longer than my hair. So if you have long hair it would still definitely work for you. If you have shorter hair it might be tricky. It's a very comfortable wrap even though you might resemble Greek mythical character! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:6ae1f8178f6b3120767639310d7341db]] My hair curled so nicely and I love the fact that i didn’t have to use any products. [SEP] This hair curler is healthy for your hair since it doesn’t use heat. It is easy to use. Wrap your wet hair around the loops and sleep in it overnight. When you take it out the next day, your hair will be curly. [SEP] I wanted to try this on our super long hair. The heatless curler that has a single tube that goes over your head curls more in the front and leaves the back of your hair straight and curled at the bottom because of the large part is creates pulling your hair to either side of your head.<br />This makes much better curls but takes a lot more time to wrap hair however dry time is shortened.<br />Curls depend on hair condition and products used but the material on the tubes is nice, the seems are done well and the elastic grips your head LOL.<br />It's been fun playing with this. [SEP] I like the idea of this - especially if you don't like to put heat on your hair. The theory is that you ""braid"" sections of your hair around these fabric curling ""rods"" and either sleep in them, or otherwise let your hair air dry with them on.<br /><br />I found that each time I've used it, my hair comes out inconsistently curled - either due to my hair getting loose on one or two rods, or unknowingly braiding one or two differently. Since I have fine hair, if I braid a section too tight, it comes out pretty frizzy.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a good concept, it just takes practice to get smooth, uniform curls. I'm going to keep practicing and see if I get better results. [SEP] I liked how soft it was and easy to use. I’m not sure I love the curl pattern as much but it’s possible I didn’t leave it in long enough. [SEP] It was easy to use. I used it on freshly dried and straightened hair. I used texturizing spray to hold the curls. It did the job quickly. Curtain bangs I have to keep adjusting to make sure they were being curled. I also had to keep fixing the tie at the bottom some of my hair kept slipping out.  It did leave and indent in the front of my hair, but that was easily fixed. I would not be able to sleep with it in I feel like it would shift, but it worked great. It is silky type material which is nice. I was happy with the curls it produced. So far the curls were the best of the heartless curlers I have used.",3,True

A positive review is not required and all thoughts are my own.<br /><br />At my mom’s last doctor’s appointment, they did a bone density scan and it was recommended she get vitamin D as well as calcium.<br /><br />As we don’t go out much due to the pandemic, I thought this was a pretty good way of meeting her needs.<br /><br />The small, easy-to-swallow, capsules are a BONUS. As she lives with me, she hasn’t complained of; nor have I seen any; side effects.<br /><br />Manufactured in the USA and gluten free. The GF is important as she is trying to reduce her gluten intake.<br /><br />Pretty fair price as well. [SEP] Even being in the sun a lot, my blood work always shows me a little low on Vit D.<br />I like these pills.  Nice and small to swallow.  Helps boost my Vit D levels so there's no concerns.<br />I like the strength of these pills.  Plus the added benefits that coconut oil gives me.<br />I'll continue taking these Vit D capsules for many years. [SEP] 125 mcg equals 5,000 IU which is about what I take on a daily basis, more or less.  These vitamin D3 pills are very small and easy to swallow.  D3 is fat soluble and should stay in your system longer.  I think one small capsule/day is plenty, at least for me.  The bottle is too big for the quantity because it looks like the bottle is nearly empty but it contains 60 little vitamin D3 pills.  The vitamin D3 is in coconut oil. [SEP] These are nice, easy to swallow little pills. They are quite small so even people who struggle to swallow pills shouldn't have too much trouble with them. I appreciate the fact that these are made with coconut oil to aid absorption. I've been trying to increase my vitamin D levels after several doctors have come out with studies suggesting that people with higher levels of vitamin D tend to not get as sick if they catch Covid-19. It's not going to hurt anything so it's definitely worth a try! I live in the mid-west where the winters can be pretty brutal, so I don't get outside much, as a result my vitamin D levels aren't as high as they could be. My only disappointment is that after I ordered these vitamins I found a bottle that has an entire years worth of vitmain D in the same dosage, same small pills, also liposomal and also made with coconut oil, but it was an entire years worth for only a couple dollars more, so these definitely aren't the best deal out there. [SEP] There's more Coconut oil (194 mg) than Vit D3.<br />So this is a win / win with two good ingredients.<br />> Coconut oil increase natural cholesterol and supports heart health.<br />(easy to digest because coconut oil doesn't require pancreatic enzymes from the liver to digest)<br />> The capsules are small and very easy to swallow.<br /><br />Had to smile when I saw the bottle = yes it's small at 3 1'2"" tall,<br />but the soft-gels fills only 3/4"" in the bottom.<br />Not a big deal, but it's amusing and the down side is the extra room required on the self.<br /><br />Serving 1 in the AM / 1 in PM = so this 60 capsules is 30 days supply.<br />5 stars [SEP] LOVE how tiny this is!! My 8 yr can take this no problem and I LOVE how it has coconut oil in it to help with absorption. I've had to be very mindful when taking my other D3's and make sure I'm taking them with a higher fat meal so I will absorb more but there's no worrying with this one. AND it's only one pill! It's 5000IU too!! That's a great amount! I don't take this everyday though since it is so much. I try to go outside and get D that way but if I can't or if I feel sickness coming I take this. It's a great price too! This is 2 months for more for me. It says to take it morning AND night but if you don't have a deficiency I personally wouldn't recommend that. I am NOT a Dr or even a nurse but I do research a lot and too much D can be a bad thing so research your stuff before you go taking a whole bunch of anything. D is not water soluble and it's like Vit C where you just urinate out what your body doesn't use. You can build up D in the system which can cause unwanted side effects and possibly an ER visit. Only throwing this out there since D is like the ""thing"" right now. It IS great but be responsible! :-) [SEP] These seem like a very good option for Vitamin D.  They compare well with other Vitamin D's I have used and are at a reasonable price.  I think in times like these Vitamin D supplements should be standard fare.  I am satisfied with the level of Vitamin D in these capsules. [SEP] These tiny vitamin D softgels are made with coconut oil, so you get a vague but very pleasant tropical scent when you open the bottle. The claim is that the coconut helps the D to absorb. I have no idea if that's true or not, but I do like these gelcaps.<br /><br />They're filled with 5000 IU of vitamin D and they're tiny and extremely easy to swallow. You get two months' worth for $10. Not the lowest price, but not bad. I like them! [SEP] I started taking these because I am not going out as much in the winter and I am not getting as much vitamin d. I like the size of the pills and that they are soft.

Well clearly if you are on here you do and you are in the right place if you ask me. These bath bombs are great. They are a very nice generous size which means they last a nice long time giving you a nice longer experience while you enjoy your nice soaking bath. The fragrances these have are fantastic. I tend to be very picky when it comes to fragrances and love that this one has a huge variety  from citrus to flowers to “plain” vanilla.<br /><br />You get a total of 12 of these bath bombs for just over $20 which is a good deal in my eyes and well worth it. These come in a very nice box that also lends perfectly to gift these for the holidays but also for birthdays but really any occasion if you ask me. I will probably have to get these again when I am out. The only one I am not a fan of is eucalyptus mint, but that is because I just don’t like that fragrance but it will come in handy when I have a cold or flu to clean up those sinuses. [SEP] I consider myself a bath bomb queen. I was impressed by this bath bomb set. The packaging was very vibrant and readily giftable! The box holding the 12 bath bombs is sturdy.<br />The bath bombs have different scents that are floral/earthy or fruity like Lily, Vanilla, Eucalyptus, etc. The scents were aromatic, but not too overwhelming. Each bath bomb has a label with the individual scent.<br />The bath bombs are made with natural essential oils and are cruelty-free. My skin felt more moisturized after using the bomb in my bath.<br />I was a bit hesitant about the bath bombs when I first opened the box. The bath bombs looked to have a shimmery outer coating. In a picture I attached, you can see the outer coating coming off onto my hand. I was nervous, because I did not want my skin or my bath tub to be glittery/shimmery. I was pleasantly surprised to find out the bath bomb did not leave a shimmery residue my on skin or bathtub after use in water.<br />Overall, I was impressed with the product, and I enjoyed using the bath bombs in my bath. [SEP] These are HUGE. they last SO long and bubble. My baths are brightly colored, smell AMAZING and VERY moisturizing. Love this product. Will be ordering more. [SEP] I really enjoyed using these bath bombs.<br />They are big, and so last a lot longer than the smaller ones.<br />The scent is amazing.<br />I have semi-sensitive skin, and I had no skin reaction. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:30387c4d84b895347bf792c1066fab50]] These are great value. They’re large enough that you could gift individual ones as stocking fillers or just gift the whole box.<br /><br />I love bath bombs but find they can be very drying. Not so with these. Honestly I couldn’t really discern the different scents but I liked that they didn’t dry my skin out. I live in a hard water area so they took a little while to fully dissolve but they make for a lovely relaxing bath time. So far the rose scented is my favourite but it’s a very faint scent.<br /><br />I don’t have a plastic bath so I didn’t encounter any staining and the bath was easy to clean with no dye coming off on my towel afterwards. No sensitivity issues either. [SEP] Bath bombs are getting popular for the last few years. I like to gift something adds to the experience and consumable, not clutters. This is one of the better choices. These bath bombs are OK. They smell great and moisturizing maybe due to Shea butter.  The price is about $2 a ball, which is comparable to other similar products. My only concern is that it is made in China. You want to watch out who is on the receiving end to see if it is a problem. [SEP] This came in a nice presentation box, exactly as pictured. The 12 bombs are a decent size and aren't overwhelmingly scented but are strong enough when placed in the water. At about $2 a bomb the prize is definitely good. The only downside was they didn't all completely dissolve so left a little powder in the bath that needed wiping over (which is something I have found with a lot of these type things). [SEP] Great variety of bath bombs and they’re large!  They dissolve at a nice and slow rate to evenly distribute throughout the bath! [SEP] Great fizz good scents. The only thing I didn’t like was these seemed to leave more run residue on the tub than others but I needed to clean the tub anyway and it came off [SEP] There is 12 big bath bombs and they all smell amazing. Don’t think they all smell like described, for example eucalyptus mint smells like some kind of flower, but I don’t really care. It’s a great gift idea for the awesome price.

"Nepure Face Mask Lanyard Fashion Strap Convenient Safety Holder & Hanger Comfortable Necklace Made in Korea (Double Clip C, 5 pcs)",[],[],,4.3,36,191,"These lanyards are perfect for hanging my masks around my neck but they can only be hooked onto masks that have a very thin elastic due to the tiny clasp on either end.

[SEP] Many masks we have, the straps are are way to thick to use with these straps. I do like the clips, similar to a necklace clasp, which is more secure than many of the plastic clips other straps use, but we cannot use as extensively due to the narrow width. [SEP] If your kids are in school and require masks this year, you may be familiar with them losing them everyday! It’s exhausting and wasteful so I was happy to pick up these babies which keep them handy around their necks.

I work in the healthcare field and being able to have my mask just hang around my neck when I don’t have to have it on is wonderful. The lanyards look great too. The only issue that might come up is if the ear bands are too thick, the connectors on the lanyards might not be able to fit on the ear loops. Other than that, the lanyards look nice and are comfortable to wear. [SEP] I got these for me and my kids to use. They use it for their masks at school everyday. I use it for both my mask and my vaccine card. Not a single one has broken and it’s been 3 months. Surprisingly more sturdy than I expected and definitely worth it. I love the little clasps that I’m able to change on their masks easily. [SEP] We use these every time we leave the house.  They are sturdy and easy to clip onto masks.  My children are able to transfer them to other masks if necessary without assistance.  Great item. [SEP] The little spring-things at the end of ours have become ""unraveled"" on a few. I would not recommend these for kids, or anyone else who might pull or otherwise treat them roughly.<br />If you're careful with them, they're fine. [SEP] These mask chains remind me of childhood friendship bracelets. My son will be using these as he returns to in person learning. Mask chains, in general, are great for kids so masks don’t get misplaced. These chains can be adjusted in length and my only comment is that the clips are small so if you have a mask with thicker ear loops then it might cause some fold-age (see attached pictures). [SEP] Got these for my kids but am using them myself as well. Quality is good, and color selections are versatile. Get compliments all the time. Looks like the price doubled since when i got these, but it's still a good deal IMO.",3,True
Oopee Toilet Room Spray - Odor Eliminator For Strong Odor Room Fresheners - Toilet Spray For Poop Odor Eliminator - Air Fresheners For Home Room Fresheners - Travel Size Bathroom Spray - Sea Salt Scent,[],[],,4.1,97,1188,"Don't Go without it! [SEP] This is my new favorite bathroom Pre-spray. And I have tried a bunch. I use to love ""unicorn gold"" but they have discontinued it and the replacement brand Pootanicals from the same company are terrible. They clog and don't spray. HOWEVER this line from Oopee is amazing.<br /><br />Sprays without getting clogged, smells great, covers the ""business"" , and is reasonably priced. My only beef is that so far of the two I've tried neither smells anything close to their name.<br /><br />Pear smelled like powdery old lady perfume, bleck.<br />Seasalt smells like a faintly fruity soft floral that is just lovely, but not anything remotely close to salty.<br /><br />Of the two I've tried, Id say avoid Pear and I give an enthusiastic thumbs up to Seasalt. [SEP] This toilet spray does do a good job of killing odors, and is quick and easy to use. The scent, however, is just OK. Granted, pretty much any scent is better than the scent this is meant to cover up, but the Sea Salt scent is more floral than I was expecting. It's an OK scent, but not 100% to my liking. The other issue I've had is that the sprayer doesn't always spray properly. Instead of a mist, it sort of splatters the liquid at times, making a bit of a mess unless your aim is perfectly true. It's only happening with one of the containers, so it seems that the sprayer is defective. Given the price point, better quality sprayers should have been used.<br /><br />The scent plus the sprayer issue lowers my score to 4 stars, but it's otherwise a decent product that does what it says it will do. [SEP] Doesn’t smell like it should and doesn’t work as well as the name brand [SEP] Scent is weak compared to other products I have purchased [SEP] This strong odor eliminator is wonderful, and packs a punch in hiding unwanted embarrassing orders naturally.  Just a few sprays is all it takes!  It is a perfect size to easily carry in your purse or backpack!  I stopped using/purchasing harsh chemicals a long time ago because of all the serious health problems chemicals could potentially cause.  I will never get away from chemicals 100% because unfortunately others still use them, but making simple changes like this helps me and my family improve our quality of life.  Placing one of these allows others to use them too! [SEP] No one wants to leave a foul smell when using the toilet.  This works simply and effectively. A few pumps into the toilet bowl before ""conducting business"" and it's your little secret. I'm not sure what salt water smells like, but the scent is pleasant and not perfumey. It's not like spraying air fresheners after the fact.  It is convenient size to toss in a bag for when you have to ""go"" on the go.  The better known poo spray is about $10 a bottle so this is definitely a reasonable price for 2 good size bottles. [SEP] This is more of a room spray than a odor eliminator for me.  It smells really good and has a nice light scent.  It smells great but I am not sure about covering up smells.  It does make an amazing room spray though.  I can spray this and still smell it hours later.  I love it using it that way and will buy again for that reason. [SEP] No bathroom is complete without something designed to freshen up after “business” is conducted. This product gets things back on track…it smells fresh but not like “cover up” sprays. I try to spritz one shot into the toilet first, then a shot into the air afterwards. It works well. [SEP] OOPEE Toilet Room Spray | Odor Eliminator Air Fresheners & Bathroom Spray | Air Freshener Poop Spray<br /><br />Two small bottles of bathroom seasalt spray. The fragrance is a bit floral but it's not overbearing. It takes care of the odors in the room! I would recommend this spray for any of those unpleasant odors lingering in your bathroom.

Supports Endurance (Strawberry))",[],[],,4.0,100,302,"I've never tried a protein drink that's basically a shot. It's a novel concept that I enjoy very much. The bottle is small enough to fit in a bag to take on the go. You can drink it alone or add it to other liquids. The flavor is pleasant. There are artificial flavors if you're trying to avoid them. Otherwise, this is a good product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] They aren't terrible. With such a small amount, I can gulp it down quickly. I actually had to go to look up what predigested hydrolyzed protein was. It is protein that has been reduced to the amino level. At that level, it is considered predigested and more easily absorbed. [SEP] this is the worse tasting thing I have ever put it my mouth. I couldn't stand it and threw it away. [SEP] Oh my!  I found this to be like drinking pancake syrup it was so thick and sweet.  I have since started diluting it in about 6 oz. of water.  I can't really tell if it helps with recovery or not.  I play a lot of competitive tennis and sometimes come off the court absolutely whacked.  The next time that happens I'll try this protein drink again and see if it helps with energy recovery.  Until then I'm giving it 3 stars. [SEP] I’ve been using protein supplements from their infancy and am consistently impressed by their amazing evolution from those terrible tasting days. This one truly takes the proverbial Cake though. These are not only decent tasting, but they taste good.<br />  This tiny 2.5 ounce bottle, which is easily drank in one shot, has 26 grams of Protein Hydrolysate, which is a form that’s essentially had the protein broken down to a smaller molecular level to make it Much easier for the body to use and it’s absorbed more completely. I’ve never seen anything like it; if this type has been around, it’s All new to me and I’m happy to know it’s here.<br />  This is a little box of 12 and I think it’s a fine deal for what these are. It may be a tad bit obvious but, I think I would recommend it to everyone; especially the dedicated Gym Rat, which I may not be now, but I always was and Still am at heart.😁<br />  Happy Health Everyone! [SEP] very good product works well [SEP] I am on a high protein, low calories diet.  At 26 grams of P and very few calories, this stuff is great.  I would like to try the mango flavor, but can't find any one selling it. [SEP] I have ordered this product twice.  I love it!! It’s not thick and gooey.  The delivery time is awesome.  I will be ordering again soon!! [SEP] These are pretty sweet in flavor for being sugar free and Keto friendly.  Easy to drink no weird after flavor, overall think drinking a liquid fruit roll-up.  Mixes well in shakes or taking as it.  Price point is very reasonable .  Overall, does what it says and doesn't taste bad at all. [SEP] The taste is awful. I borderline gagged when I drank this. I just can't drink it. I gave it to my father in law as he does crossfit... no word on how he liked it so that wasn't the best sign. He usually has something to say about protein drinks I've shared.",3,True

The benefit of the cinnamon makes it even more desirable. I have ordered this cinnamon supplement exclusively for my memory. For that reason, I can't say if it works or not&lt; since it should be taken for prolong period of time to see the change. [SEP] I am trying to consume more cinnamon as it has health benefits. You can't really eat enough cinnamon to get the benefits, so I resort to pills or gummies.<br /><br />These gummies have 1000 mcg of Ceylon cinnamon and 1000 mcg of cinnamon bark in each 2 gummy serving. The flavor is good and they are easy to chew and swallow. I like that there is no added sugar. [SEP] Great! [SEP] Really nice subtle flavor, not a real strong cinnamon taste.  I would've liked more of a cinnamon flavor, but it works.  It doesn't stick to your teeth too bad and no aftertaste. [SEP] Good supplement, but the taste is not great. Was expecting more of a cinnamon flavor. [SEP] Seems to pull 20 points of blood glucose level [SEP] I purchased in hopes it would help lower blood sugar, failed.

Works great for countertops, floor spills, bathtub, sink- I've used it on many surfaces and it works great on all of them! [SEP] I prefer natural cleaners, especially because my kids like to help clean. Unfortunately this cleaner just doesn't work as well as others I've tried. It took 3 applications and lots of scrubbing to clean my stovetop, and it's still not as clean as it normally is after a wipedown. Honestly a sponge with soap does better. This cleaner also comes in a pretty small bottle for the price. It works to wipe down my kids eating table and art table, but for kitchen and bathroom cleaning it just doesn't cut it. [SEP] Here to reorder this spray. It works very well from the sprayer itself to the product within. The smell is very light and vanishes quickly. Leaves surface clean and sanitized. [SEP] I expected this to smell like nothing. That’s it, just nothing. But it’s so much better than that!!! Bleach- freaks are going to LOVE this!!! It’s the cleanest of clean smells I have ever tried. And I use some pretty clean brands, at those most affordable price point for me. This beats them all!!<br /><br />It seems to work well enough! Without a microscope, who’s to know, really? Definitely not for deep-cleaning tasks, but they tell you that upfront. Maintenance only. And that is fine with me!!!<br /><br />I love using this because it is already soooo very clean. So I’m not worried about cumulative fumes, or problematic residues—they have the market cornered there! I hope it’s actually working as well as it seems to.<br /><br />The cost is a bit too much for me here. So I will attempt to hunt this down for no more than $5 per 16oz bottle. That’s my sweet-spot. Otherwise it’s just gonna be an occasional relief item, from chem-overload. Not willing to pay more.<br /><br />I AM shocked and extremely impressed by how wonderful this cleaner is. I hope it does well.<br /><br />It’s beyond amazing! [SEP] I met the creator of the product at a skin care event a few years ago and when I saw him last year at an event I was impressed by the product and even recommended using it in the spa I worked at. It is state board certified for use in spas and yet environmentally friendly and safe. [SEP] This is no super cleaner, what it is, is a very effective cleaner that helps sanitize better than most cleaners, without leaving an odor or film.<br /><br />We used this in a lab setting and our microbiological plate counts, taken from our counter surfaces, did come out with lower levels of bacteria than with our other cleaner.<br /><br />It seems to be a very appropriate product in attempting to reduce spreading germs.<br /><br />Bear in mind that this will clean but it is not a surfactant like soap, and so greasy areas will likely still need some soap.<br /><br />Review of: Clean Republic All-Purpose Everyday Household Cleaner [SEP] This cleaner came in a small bottle with a spray pump.  The liquid is clear and watery with no scent.  I have been using this on my kitchen cabinets and other surfaces.  My kitchen cabinets are glossy white and pretty low maintenance so I only need it for light dusting and fingerprints.  I have also been using this to clean my desk too and that is okay.  I tried using this on glass and grease spots from cooking but it does not do very well.  I like that this is completely free of chemicals and made in the USA.  It feels like it is mostly water, so I am not exactly sure how much ""cleaning"" is just the water. [SEP] I've had eye problems for 30 years, conjunctivitis type eye problems.  Had an eye doctor tell me my eyelids were allergenic to my eyeball of all things, then a different eye doctor told me to spray some Hypochlorous Acidon a cotton round pad and wipe my closed eyes every mourning and night to kill the bacteria on my eyelashes, AND IT WORKED, after over 20 years of eye problems, GONE OVERNIGHT,  it's been three weeks now and no eye problems, this stuff is GREAT! [SEP] I use this to clean couches, the baby chair, anything I need to deodorize. It’s a great light cleaner/deodorizer/disinfectant.

I washed it once in the machine and it did o.k. but I decided to spray it all over with this spray.  It went on fine.  The family said it had a smell but I could barely detect it.  I had enough to lay on two coats with some left over.  I haven't used my backpack yet but I needed to get a review up in time so I will update it if I think it doesn't work as advertised.

The bottle only sprayed out a tiny amount and took forever just to put on a jacket that I wanted to protect.  It says to do two coats, but even though the bottle still has a lot in it, the sprayer no longer works and I can't get any out. [SEP] This stuff is great!  Much better than kiwi or other brands.  It still has that same smell but nowhere near as strong.  No staining, goes on easy.  Great stuff [SEP] Multiple treatments are needed to get the desired effect.  Odor is strong but does fade.  I really wanted to like it because it is environmentally friendly. But it simply does not work well.

The melt dissolves quick enough and the bottle is small for easy storage. The one aspect I really do like about this is the fact I only have to take one a say. Most other beauty supplements require you take at least two daily for optimum results. This is one and done, which is a huge draw for me. It may be enough for me to continue purchasing just for that aspect alone. [SEP] I love the taste and this really makes a difference if you stick to using it.  You can add fruits for more flavor.

For your knee, you need more support than what this brace offers. The side supports are not metal, they are a plastic and bend easily enough. I don't fight the fit to be very good and am disappointed in this knee brace. [SEP] I have issues with my knees and found this helpful. It gave added support and reminded me not to move recklessly where dislocation can become an issue. It fit...okay...but perhaps my knee is longer than usual the brace fit better when straight than when bent where it kind of lost contact and wasn't all that comfortable. The Velcro straps are otherwise easy to use and adjust. [SEP] Works Amazing! I have a lot of trouble with my knee and before i got this had a lot of pain, but once I put this on my pain level went down about 90%. Great support and very comforable.

I don’t run anymore; no surprise here, my knees don’t ‘take kindly’ to running; but I do enjoy walking as much as I can.<br /><br />And, I must say, for the entire walk the Ancocs Adjustable knee brace was extremely comfortable.  I would never go so far as to say it didn’t feel like I wasn’t wearing anything on my knee, but it was pretty close.  Unlike many neoprene-based knee braces, which quickly get soaked by sweat, this knee brace stayed cool for the entire time.<br /><br />The lateral coils (which is where I need the support), performed their function well and did it with surprising comfort.  At no time did I feel any ‘hard mass’ trying to push up against the sides of my knee.  Just the right amount of support to do what I need a knee brace to do.<br /><br />The flexibility, meaning how easy is it to bend the knee when walking, was very good.  The shorter, middle hook&loop strap came around enough to keep the brace tight enough but didn’t dig into the back of my knee with every step.<br /><br />I think this is a product worth trying.<br /><br />I’ve included some pictures to give you an idea of the overall length of the brace, the size of the individual hook&loop straps and the width of the brace.  I’ve also include a picture of the lateral coil ‘stabilizers’.

This knee brace is very comfortable, and when I tried it on it went on easily and was not difficult to figure out how to use.  It was also comfortable to walk in, the contouring was very well done.  I found it provides very good knee support and is a great value for the price.  Definitely recommended! [SEP] Supports the knee well. Slips a little bit when you go from sitting to standing position a lot. Good for short period use. Easy to put on and adjust with 3 straps. [SEP] This knee brace is working well for the arthritis in my knee.  The side stabilizers are especially important to me and this brace gives me the support I need without restricting to much of my mobility.  The brace is thicker than others I have tried but that doesn't mean it is hot or uncomfortable to wear.  There are three straps that are adjustable with a zip and lock type wrap around closure so I can easily adjust the tightness I want for a particular activity.  The middle strap goes right around the middle back of my knee so I was worried that strap would be uncomfortable to wear over time.  The middle strap does give me a reminder that I probably shouldn't repeat some specific activity.  I do find that I need to take the brace off or at least loosen the middle strap in order to be comfortable driving. [SEP] Very helpful<br />I love this brace, its well made and easy to take off and put back on.<br />Velcro is very sturdy and holds my knee extremely well in place.<br />I use it on my leggings or yoga pants and it’s very comfortable<br />I would recommend",3,True

The black side is best for removing makeup and the white side is best for applying toner or whatever you use. I have other white ones that are totally stained with makeup even after being washed a dozen times. They are made of 70% bamboo and 30% cotton and come with a bag to wash. Make sure you tie that bag tight before machine washing or you will be spilling cotton pads everywhere. I did notice that the panda on the front of the packaging is the exact same logo as the WWF panda named “Chi Chi” and I’m sure that panda logo has a copyright. [SEP] Pros:<br />-it is Eco-friendly<br />-100% cotton so it is easy to wash and soft on my skin.<br />-Works well as a makeup remover.<br />- It is easy to wash and reuse.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cannot think of any !!! [SEP] I found these Bamboo makeup remover reusable pads to be a good concept.  It has a large surface area (3 inches diameter) for applying makeup remover, facial lotion, etc.  I found that I can soak it with cold water and place each one over my eyes.  It fits exactly over each eye.  It is a nice, relaxing treatment for my tired eyes.  The material is very soft, but not as absorbent as I wanted.  There are two sides- a white and black side.  I found the black side to be more absorbent.<br /><br />I gave it one fewer star, because:<br />1) Because of its size, it’s hard to apply around the eyes.<br />2) It is recommended to wash the 16 pads in the provided mesh bag in cold water and then to dry on a towel.  It took a few hours to dry them.  I will put them in a dryer from now on.  It is made of 70% bamboo and 30% cotton, so it shouldn’t shrink too much.<br />It comes with a nice bamboo holder that looks minimalistic on my bathroom counter.  This product is a nice way to avoid using endless cotton pads which can reduce waste and help with expense. [SEP] I really like these. They work good. They are soft but could be softer. But they do clean the face good so no complaints there. They came with a lovely case and a laundry bag. It is so convenient to put in there then throw in washer and dryer when full. The black doesn’t fade on anything. Of course, I wouldn’t want to bleach it. They are as good as new after washing each time. Very much a five star because of all included and how nice. [SEP] I use a lot of cotton rounds. Every day, I use them to remove makeup and to apply toner and softeners. I use at least 2, sometimes more a day. Cotton rounds are cheap, so it doesn't cost much to use them like I do. But it's wasteful.<br /><br />These bamboo cotton reusable rounds are much less wasteful and so soft on your skin! They absorb my makeup remover just fine, and take off my makeup with little issue. I find they work better than the cotton pads for toners and softener because they don't hold onto the liquid quite as much. I wash them immediately after use and leave them on a table to dry. At the end of the week, I put them all in the included mesh laundry bag and toss them into the washing machine with the rest of my laundry. They always emerge perfectly clean.<br /><br />I give it four stars instead of five because of the container. I adore this brand, and have a couple of their metal containers. This one is plain bamboo, which gives a nice sophisticated but understated look. But I don't like using it in areas that might get wet or damp, like the bathroom, because I don't want the bamboo to warp or get damp. Also, there's a cutout in the box so you can see how many rounds you have left. I understand the idea, but I don't like these type of items to be open to the air and dust when I'm going to be applying them to my face. The top comes off easily enough, which is useful when you're using it every day, but not amenable to the entire thing being packed in a travel bag. [SEP] This was definitely a great idea and concept, but the pads were too big and didn’t fit properly in the container. I ended up buying a different set from a different company and there was definitely a big difference with the softness of the pads. These pads on Amazon are a little bit more tough/rough. [SEP] I love the holder. It's so nice. Also, the bag for washing them is included, a little rough like jute fiber.  One side is white and the other side is charcoal black. Both work well. I use them to wash my face and with micellar water. They are gently exfoliating if you scrub. [SEP] I have moved from using the regular colored microfiber pads to these types of bamboo pads for removing make up. The regular colored microfiber pads sometimes irritated my skin for some reason. I haven’t had that the same problem using bamboo pads. There’s remove a light amount of make up with no cleanser. However if you are a heavy make abuser you definitely want to use some type of cleanser when you use these pads. They wash and dry well with my regular towels I just put them in a delicates bag. I wouldn’t use fabric softener on these either.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful🙂 [SEP] I got these for our Airbnb guest so they could remove their makeup without damaging our staining our white towels and washcloths. I love that these come with a holder to keep them organized and sanitary. They are also super easy to clean between guest I just soak them in some hot water with blue Dawn dishsoap and Oxi-Clean to get out all the mascara stains and then place them in a zippered wash net bag and throw them in the washer and dryer for a cycle and voila they are ready for the next guest. [SEP] I really like these. They work good. They are soft but could be softer. But they do clean the face good so no complaints there. They came with a lovely case and a laundry bag. It is so convenient to put in there then throw in washer and dryer when full. The black doesn’t fade on anything. Of course, I wouldn’t want to bleach it. They are as good as new after washing each time. Very much a five star because of all included and how nice.",3,True
Facial Steamer Home SPA Humidifier Skin care in House Unclogs and diminishes enlarged pores Bonus 4 Piece Stainless Steel Skin Kit,[],[],,3.3,27,9306,"I love this really cute and very easy to use face steamer. The only issue is that there are no good instructions on how to use the steamer or the device to help remove blackheads. There is also a filter looking part that I have no idea what it is for. The steamer itself seems to be working great without this mystery piece. Thankfully the steamer is very easy to figure out and works very well. I also like that it is compact and does not take up a lot of space. [SEP] This facial steamer is great for people who want that luxurious spa treatment at the tips of their fingers in an instant. Great to have on hand and really helps open up the pores for maximum skin health. Overall recommended. [SEP] This facial steamer seems like a generic product.  In general, it's a capable product and functions properly.  There's one button, that powers the device on/off.  That's the only control element, which demonstrates the simplicity and ease of operation. Assembly is very simple, too, with one hitch.  The main body is already complete, needing only the extension arm to be installed.  The extension arm is slightly tapered, and the correct orientation is very obvious.  Insert the end with the opening, which would allow the steam to flow through the tube.  Also, the other end has a small opening port for the steam to exit.<br />The reservoir is removed by lifting it upwards.  Once removed, you simply unscrew the cap and fill the reservoir with filtered/distilled water (they stress the use of distilled water to avoid any residue or contaminants which would negatively affect longevity).  Screw the cap back on, put the reservoir back. Position the extension tube so the opening is in the desired direction.  Press the power button, and within 30 seconds, the steam will issue forth from the slot in the extension tube.<br />The user manual/guide is horrible.  Besides the broken english, there is a lack of information.  For example, there is a small ""half tube"" with slotted openings.  It fits into the opening in the body, and the extension tube can fit over it.  What is the proper orientation of this half tube? What is the function of the half tube? It would be nice to know, but there is zero mention in the manual/guide, nor in the product details.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the product and accessories.  You can see the half tube alongside the extension tube.<br />Facial steamers range from $20 - $40+.  This is priced in the mid to upper range of comparable products.  While the product does function, with decent performance, it was an underwhelming experience.  Based on initial impressions, this facial steamer receives a 3.5 star rating. [SEP] this is a decent steamer but the instructions are really horrible. like others said, there is an extra piece that seems to have no use. when you do first use you place your hand at least 6 inches away, it is HOT! burn my self when placing my hand too close<br /><br />one downside is the cable length. it very very short. it like 2-3 feet long.  i couldnt even use it in my restroom due to the short cable. [SEP] Looking for flawless skin? This is what you needs. I love this facial steamer with a long spout. Easy to hold and light weight. I use it twice a week after my daily skincare cleanse routine. Then wash my face with cold water and apply moisturizer. [SEP] This is the ideal size for a face steamer. It's tiny enough not to take up much space, yet strong enough to make you feel like you're at a spa. When fully charged, the steamer lasts around 10 minutes. I enjoy that I can add essential oils to truly nourish my face while also making my room smell lovely! The face steamer has a 180ml expanded water tank that emits a mist that moisturizes and cleanses your skin for 10 minutes. The facial steamer's built-in proprietary inner UV disinfection technology sterilizes the nano-mist before it comes out the nozzle, ensuring that the steam is purified and 100 percent clean, protecting your skin. The steamer for face does a good job of penetrating and hydrating the skin. [SEP] A friend recommended getting a facial steamer so I jumped at the opportunity to try this.  The instructions are awful.  I actually thought I'd missed a page.  The angle of the steam piece is weird.  The reservoir gets put in upside down so I end up spilling water on the floor.  And there is a mystery basket piece that I can not figure out what to do with.<br /><br />Its small and lightweight are perhaps the best I can say.  For $40, I expected better. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:fbe9443561faa3185c8a641fabb391f8]] This facial steamer works well for me. I like that the arm is long it helps a bit, because the cord is short. I also like that the steam is funneled through the small hole, so I feel like I get a good flow of steam. The reservoir holds a decent amount of water, for at the minimum twice weekly. [SEP] The product is not good!",3,True

The Most Bioavailable Liposomal D3 2500iu + K2 100 mcg MK-7 on The Market. Unique Dual Encapsulation Delivery System for Rapid Absorption. 2oz. (60ml),[],[],,4.3,66,1554,"I chose this because it is a DK combo and encapsulated in fat. Here is why ==>  K helps you absorb the D and both D & K are fat soluble vitamins.  For about a year now we have been using DK combos in our bulletproof coffee in the morning. (more fat for absorption)  Both my husband and I have had our D checked and we are both slightly over 100.  With the present climate, one wants to be over 75.  If one has an auto-immune, one wants to be as close to 100 without going over.  When I first started last year I was tested at 41.  Which is normal, but not high enough for certain things.  That was considering, I already took a standard D supplement and we were very much outdoorsy people.  Most people just do not not realize they are deficient.<br /><br />So ... all that said ... I appreciate this product.  We still use it in our coffee.  It seems to work well and keeps out levels where we need.  We have gotten our D checked about every 6 months.  No regrets here. [SEP] The flavor is good. I can't say much about this average product. But the low-pressured pump/head that shot out the liquid vitamins is terrible. It was poorly designed. It causes the liquid dripping out a little and straight down to the pump and bottle on every single pump. You will lose an average 1 & 1/2 pump of vitamins per dose of 8 pumps. I will never buy this item again. [SEP] First thing.  Unless you have super near sighted vision and/or a magnifying glass, good luck reading anything on the bottle's label.  I had to go back to Amazon's site to find out how many squirts make up one dosing.  As far as taste goes, I found the liquid to be a bit sweet, but not unpleasantly so.  For the amount of D3 included in a dose, this liquid is pretty costly. Most small capsule preparations include double the D3 as a dose of Purehealth's liquid.  Now...Purehealth may be correct, however, that in liquid form the bio-availability is greater than in capsule form.  Still when considering that in addition to cost, there are more cost effective ways, in my opinion, of getting your D3 and K2. [SEP] I love taking liquid vitamins like this one, I add it to my smoothies or herbal/vitamin iced tea every morning and can't even tell it's in there. Also, I've never seen a D3 supplement that also contains vitamin E and beta carotene. Those are two supplements I won't do without, so this is a real bonus and ups the value of this supplement, in my opinion. I've tried the maximum dose in my drinks and still can't detect any taste, there are no bothersome aftertaste or stomach issues, either. Great ingredients, made in the USA with no Chinese influence- I've never seen a better D3 supplement, or even any I've liked better. Highly recommend. [SEP] Don't like taking pills. This  is great and tastes good. [SEP] Reasons I bought: could help with my slight tinnitus (ringing in ear). I read that I should have K2 in my diet and since I am not super familiar with that vitamin and this has it, I am trying it. Reasons I like it: pretty decent taste, really easy to squirt and go. Things it could improve on: label! It's TINY print. It took me a while to find out it is 8 pumps a day. Other than the tiny font, I haven't noticed anything terrible. I will keep this updated if ringing changes. So far, it has not. [SEP] Absorbtion was definitely there. I feel great when I’m taking this",3,True
"Forbidden Bliss Aromatherapy Roll-On, by Halsa Essentials Aromatherapy",[],[],,3.7,28,2471,"I like this therapy roll on.  The smell is great and despite not having any lemon oil it smells like lemon to me (Grapefruit and lime bergamot are the citrus scents in this plus a fir and peppermint).  I tried it out when I had a slight migraine and it didn't help but it also didn't make it worse.  I don't think it was designed for headaches so I'm going to give it a go on a non headache day and see if it helps with mood and alertness.  I like the smell a lot and expect it will help somewhat with mood improvement. [SEP] Maybe others love this fragrance but for me it's a giant YUCK. The packaging is fine, the oil feels ok on the skin but I hate the smell. It reminds me of the big name lemon-scented furniture polish. [SEP] This perfume smells really good and based on my experience most of the people would like it. it is easy to carry to everywhere and easy to use because of roll-on functionality.  The only issue is it does not last for a long time. [SEP] A light fresh, not overpowering scent.  Easy to apply.  And I find this to be somewhat helpful for my general 2020 stress level; it's not a miracle, but it does seem to help a bit, and it doesn't smell unpleasant.  Worth a try. [SEP] This has a nice citrus scent, reminds me a little of the essential oil bug spray that I use.  There is some overlap with the ingredients so hopefully this will also repel mosquitoes. [SEP] Big fan of aroma-therapy oils.. Got this one to try as it said it had Bergamot in it. I love the smell of bergamot, but upon receiving this roller-ball, smelling it before and after application on the wrists (even after some time), the lime and peppermint are overpowering the grapefruit ad bergamot (which are basically non-existent in this rollerball). Now I like peppermint, but this combination smells like I had a few mojitos lol :) (you know what I mean?). This is standard quality aroma-therapy oil roller-ball, if you like the smell of lime and peppermint, this may be your product. (Minus one star for the smell). [SEP] I love the fresh smell. The roller ball makes it super easy to apply. I love all essential oil rollers and enjoy trying new scents! Bonus its made in the US! [SEP] This essential oil is so wonderful. I love the smell and even though it's a pretty good size bottle, only a few drops add plenty of smell. Good quality but did find it a little overly oily. [SEP] Quality thick oil bottled in a roll-on. Can be applied directly to the skin without diluting or mixing with other base oils. I didn't experience any irritation on the skin or in the senses. Soft mild scent is appealing and works well with my yoga and mediation routines. [SEP] I absolutely LOVE the scent of this product.  It's predominantly grapefruit but I can smell the lime and maybe only a hint of the peppermint.  I have it on my wrists and behind my ears.  My son told me he could smell it after I left the room faintly.  This is fast becoming my favorite.  I bought it for the stress relieving properties but I will continue to use it daily because I love the fresh fragrance.  I think I'll use this as a substitute for my summer perfume.  It's wonderful!",3,True

Yes, it has aspartane but then again, the last thing I want in my diet is more sugar. I thought the taste was a little sweet, so I did dilute this more than the recommended mixture (you will probably need to do the same depending on your taste). High in electrolytes and protein, this is great for my Florida workouts with the heat and humidity (and I lose more water sweating than in probably any other area of the country). I was previously a Gatorade drinker, but I honestly prefer this Science in Sport and will be buying more. [SEP] The Lemon Lime Sport Go Electrolyte powder is very high in carbs....36 of them in fact! For athletes, marathoners and long distance bikers, this is an excellent choice to rehydrate and get that extra burst of energy from carbs. For the rest of us who are not into sports, it works darn well when you have the flu or some other illness that depletes your hydration and energy. I generally will have my hubby get me Powerade, Gatorade or any of the other replenishing brands, when I am sick, not eating and having gastric issues. This could literally help you through the rough times. Same thing when you are out in the hot sun and need to keep hydrated. I am keeping this handy as one of my go to's when I am having issues. [SEP] everybody has different tastes me personally didn't like it because it is too sweet for me. [SEP] This Sport Go Electrolyte in Lemon Lime is very tasty.  The directions recommend 2 scoops with the included scoop, added to 16 oz (500 ml) of water, for one serving size.  I mixed a 1/2 serving size (1 scoop to 8 oz water) in the white ceramic mug shown in my pic, and stirred it with a spoon. It dissolved fairly quickly and evenly, making a slightly lemonade-type milky looking drink, which tasted very sweet to me. I put it in my water bottle and filled the rest of the bottle with plain water, to get 1/2 the recommended concentration, which was a better flavor for me, because I don't love sweet drinks- but, you can easily add the amount you want, which is convenient.<br /><br />I compared this Sport Go to the leading-brand sports drink starting w &#34;G&#34; that  I often have on hand.  The G contained artificial colors and natural and artificial flavors, whereas the Sport Go had only natural flavors,but also contained aspartame (the blue pack sweetener on tables at restaurants).  G contained 27.5 grams Total Carbs (22 grams in my 12 oz G bottle increased 1/4 to account for the 16 oz comparison) vs. Sport Go's 36 g. G contained 100 cal (80 cal x 1.25) vs. Sport Go's 150 cal.  G had about 26g sugar (21g x 1.25) vs. Sport Go's 7g. Sport Go contains several other electrolyes and minerals missing from the G, however, including Magnesium and Calcium.<br /><br />Overall, depending on what you are looking for, this Sport Go is a multi-mineral electrolyte drink that tastes great (diluted for me), and will provide a good supplement for your heavy sport activities, without unnecessary artificial colors or flavors.  On the other hand, I am not a big fan of Aspartame. [SEP] I'm big into biking and this is my go to. It's not overly sweet but still has a lot of flavor. I also don't get sick of drinking it as it always taste good. Seems to replenish my body for needed energy too. [SEP] This is a product for athletes to replensish electrolytes. I tried it, and to me it tastes awful.  I spit it out before gagging.<br /><br />When  I got a hold of the bottle I was dismayed to find aspartame in the ingredients. No need to go into an argument. You are either in the pro aspartame or anti-aspartame camp and I am in the latter. Fructose and aspartame, my two not favorites.<br /><br />I'm really surprised by the unnecessary use of aspartame in such a product. Many don't mind, but those who are against it are very against it. Maybe it is more popular in the UK where this comes from?<br /><br />Anyway, this is not a product I can get behind because I did not like the taste, and it has ingredients that I avoid. [SEP] This product is loaded with sugars already, and an artificial sweetener on top. Even at half strength, I just don't feel like drinking it anymore halfway through my bike ride. [SEP] This product is loaded with sugars already, and an artificial sweetener on top. Even at half strength, I just don't feel like drinking it anymore halfway through my bike ride. [SEP] I was concerned this would have a fake sweetener aftertaste, but not at all. It's a good taste and good mix of replacement electrolytes. [SEP] I never really had many issues with dehydration, but I have lately been playing about 3 hours of pickleball a few times a week and lately the temps would be over 90 - 100F. I have several other electrolyte drinks to see what I get the best value from. If I want the carbs for some reason I use 2 scoops of this but in 48 - 64 OZ of water. If I want less carbs I use one scoop of this and one scoop of another drink that has no calories. I think the taste is just fine at 1 scoop per liter of water if you want less carbs. This drink has a lot more electrolytes than an average sport drink, so you will be OK if you want to use more water than just 500 ml per 2 scoops. I imagine if you are on a bike you won't carry around a big 64 oz container of water though. I think this is a great drink if the carbs are fine for you.",3,True

During the pandemic we were not able to bring in anything that wasn't individually wrapped.  I had been looking for something to bring in cupcakes, but most were cost prohibitive.  When I found these I was happy to see that they were much less than the others I was looking at (and not having to buy a huge amount as was the case with commercial containers).  These were just great, and I received lots of compliments.  I've already ordered another box. [SEP] Love these containers!!<br />Will buy them again for sure!!

We are using these for a drive-by baby shower as favors. I can’t wait to see our guests’ reaction! [SEP] These were very sturdy and held the cupcake in place very well.  I’ve ordered other containers from other vendors before and they were super flimsy and didn’t close and were terrible. These were great!

Eventually had to change my shampoo and conditioner as well since they were also irritating. Anyhow that combo did help, but even the Vaseline was not keeping the dry skin at bay. I had to reapply several times a day. After sleeping I always woke up with dry flaky patches. I was desperate to find something more long lasting.<br />I searched the national eczema foundation website and found that Theraplex Emollient had 5 out of 5 on their rating system so I ordered it to give it a try. Initially I got the smaller tub since I wanted to waste s little money as possible if it didn't work. When I started using it I immediately noticed a difference.

Replace as needed as adhesive naturally wears off.""]",,3.6,45,8185,"I've been going on walks more often during these last few months. I think my health has improved, but my feet have started to hurt from all the miles I've covered. I decided to give these Barefoot Scientist So Jelly Pressure Relief Insole Grips a try. They come with 2 pairs (1 pair for the heel, 1 pair for the balls of the feet) of clear gel, shock absorbing inserts. Each of the inserts has a self adhesive side.<br /><br />After removing the backing material, I stuck the inserts onto the insoles of my usual pair of walking shoes. After trying them out on a walk, I had to stop after a few minutes to adjust the placement of the inserts. The squishy balls of the front inserts just weren't hitting the right area of my feet. Luckily, I was still able to peel the inserts up and relocate them on my insoles. After another mile, I stopped once more to make another insert placement adjustment. The 3rd time was the charm and I finally got the inserts on the spots that worked best for me. I've had them in my walking shoes since and they've been working out very well in cushioning and relieving the pressure on my feet. I recommend using these, but you will likely have to make some adjustments to get them on the right spot for your needs. [SEP] I was not impressed with neither the quality nor the effectiveness of these inserts.  They are standard pieces of gel, nothing special or particularly supportive.  There are four pieces that come in the bag, two pieces for each foot (one for the ball of the foot and one for the heel).  As soon as you put them in your shoe one of two things happen:  they either slide around, even if you have some two-sided tape or they flatten completely under normal body weight.  Both options are unacceptable.  I would pass on these if you have serious foot problems.  For a young adult simply looking to add support to well-worn shoes it will be okay, but if you are looking for quality support, spend quality money on a good product. [SEP] These really didn't stay in place in my shoe as expected, but when I was able to use them without them moving around in my shoe they were very comfortable and super helpful. I would have liked for them to not slide around but things happen. Very comfortable to walk on and easy to place in your shoe. Initially it felt weird having them in my shoes but after a few minutes i forgot they were there until the next time I put my shoes on. [SEP] These a gel like consistency and feel like silicone.  They stay in place best in a clean, dry shoe.  Two of the pads have an extra arch support piece so I place these in the front and the others under my heel.  Overall I feel they greatly increase the comfort of my shoes.  The fact they are clear makes them much more versatile with my formal shoes. [SEP] A couple of things about these inserts.  The pair for the higher heeled shoes are a mystery. I wasn't sure where to place them, but I'll continue to work on that. The adhesive keeps them in place and obviously, they can be moved. The other set? Waste of rubber.  The padding is ok, but there is NO adhesive on them making it hard to put a shoe on without bunching up the insert. Might work in some shoes, but if they are to be advertised usable in other types of shoes they should work in all, and it should be noted they won't stick to the insole. I tried them in a pair of short boots and they scrunched up when I put them on. [SEP] I have a bunion on my left foot and sometimes have pain on the balls of both my feet (the joys of aging).  Even wearing sneakers or my sensible shoes can cause discomfort.  Not anymore.  These are great!  I was on my feet most of the day the first time I wore them.  What a difference!  I didn't end the day feeling like my feet had been beaten up.  High recommend to anyone who has foot issues. [SEP] super cushy and pillowy! Nice and thick so it actually gives some support, but because of that, don't put them in shoes that are tight. [SEP] These shoe inserts add great comfort.  They are gel.  I love and appreciate these inserts. [SEP] While I was expecting that these would be full foot insoles rather than two part (one for your heel and one for the base of your foot) these genuinely aren’t all that bad. About your standard range for this price point on shoe inserts. The jelly insoles are nice and comfortable, although sometimes they aren’t too keen on staying in place, and quite frankly they get the job done. [SEP] I got these to wear with a few pairs of my heels to help them be a little more comfortable to wear. These are so soft and squishy. They make my heels so much more bearable to wear over a longer period of time. I like that these are transparent too as a sort of ""no show"" feature. I need these for every pair of shoe I own!",3,True
"A Blood Pressure Sensor by Antrolife. for The Upper arm, it boasts The Biggest Backlit Display with The Most Accurate Adjustable and Pulse Rate Monitor. Bag, and USB-C",[],[],,4.3,26,173,"[[VIDEOID:579d94ad1af6e4875028086757c7cc69]] This is the 31st BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and is a basic monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy errs on the lower side by a few points but is still within an acceptable range. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.<br /><br />INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One BP unit<br /><br />- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet<br /><br />- One large cuff<br /><br />- One carry pouch<br /><br />- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA Batteries<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.<br /><br />- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.<br /><br />- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.<br /><br />- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.<br /><br />- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese.<br /><br />- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.<br /><br />- The display is large.<br /><br />- Accuracy is ERRs on the side of the low range compared to my gold standard monitors but is still acceptable.<br /><br />- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.<br /><br />- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.<br /><br />- The date and time settings are NOT remembered after the power is removed but the BP numbers are remembered  -- I tested after one minute of battery removal.<br /><br />- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />- It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- The accuracy is off by several points on the low side compared to my 5-star monitors.<br /><br />- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator.<br /><br />- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed. The big negative is that the accuracy is not as precise as my god standard monitors but is still within range, and the cuff is thin.<br /><br />Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.<br /><br />In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. There's an irregular heartbeat indicator.  The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.<br /><br />For those who are interested, I attached some notes about the other monitors I have tried.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KPQB2N Omron Series 5 Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors and one I purchased a few months ago on Amazon.

Unfortunately, the BP is actually 20 points lower than it should be for the top number (systolic pressure) and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number (diastolic pressure) mostly due to the unit/cuff design that does not allow for a secure fit.  The respiration number is accurate, however.  (2 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09DPPF2ZD URBEST Large Display Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This monitor has two user modes with 90 readings per user.

The cuff is large enough to fit almost anyone. This can be powered by two AAA batteries, NOT INCLUDED. The LED is large and the unit is simple to use and operate. There’s also a voice assist option. Unfortunately, the BP is around 10 points lower than it should be for the top number (systolic pressure) and 0 to 5 points lower for the bottom number (diastolic pressure). The closer the user holds the arm to heart level, the less the inaccuracy but it is still not as good as the gold standard.  The respiration number is accurate, however.

The digits them selves look to be individual white LED and very bright. The operation was very easy, just need to press the start/stop button and then machine does it's thing. once you find to sweet spot to put on your arm, it only take a few moments for it to start to read out your measurements. this is also perfect for telemedicine as you can easily show the display to the doctor on the other end and can easily read the display also with no issues. Perfect little machine that does what it needs to do. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:dcb83b99b76f4e40016817be9850eac9]] I'm a guy who typically tries to set things up without reading the instructions and found that I had to read the instructions here to figure out how to set it up as the date/time settings were not intuitive to me.  Set up was a bit of a pain and I used the single sheet instructions that were printed in LARGE type to do so, but I found that these instructions skipped some setting and the instruction booklet requires me to grab my reading glasses so I haven't sorted that out yet.<br /><br />Once setup, it is easy to use WITHOUT THE VOICE and the readings are accurate as compared to an OMRON machine my wife uses.  That said, this does take a bit longer than the OMRON.<br /><br />The display is clear and easy to read and stores 99 readings for each of 2 users. It is easy to switch between users.<br /><br />The device comes with a set of 4 AA batteries but also includes a USB A to C cable that can power the device.  I was surprised that when I disconnected the USB cable to move the device from one room to another that my settings were saved so I did not have to go through reprogramming the date and time.<br /><br />The verbal reading is helpful but with a thick accent.  When I turn it off, I'm honestly not sure what the machine is saying - I think ""measure over"" but I'm not certain.  I also find it odd that it reads out systolic and diastolic measurements as  ""X millimeter or MERcury"" - I think just a number or even 106 millimeters but hearing ""of MERcury"" twice each reading will wear on me.  There was some setting for PA which I turned off that gave a reading in some other measurement as well, but that was not useful to me.<br /><br />Overall, this is easy to use (after setup) and does the job fine.  The package includes the device, armband, batteries, a warranty card (12 months), USB cable, and a small carrying case.<br /><br />I'm happy to recommend this Antrolife blood pressure monitor - it is easy to use, functions properly and the visual and verbal readout are easy to see/hear. [SEP] I’ve been using a wrist monitor for many years, mainly because the upper arm monitors can be so bulky and awkward to use.  This Antrolife machine is so easy and there’s only one tube which makes it perfect.  Actually, my doctor said he’d prefer if I used an upper arm machine.<br /><br />I like that the cuff is large enough for me.  There is no inconvenient power cord to worry about.  Needing to find a place to sit close enough to a wall plug always annoyed me with previous models.  Not so with this one.  A Battery, USB-C connection, and soft storage/travel bag are all included in the package.<br /><br />The readout is a large LED and backlit module.  I find I can depend on the accuracy. [SEP] About four months ago, I was offered a free Antrolife Blood Pressure Monitor for review via the Amazon Vine Program, and I accepted.<br /><br />My blood pressure (BP) has always been a little high.  It's great to be able to track it at home with a straightforward, compact, lightweight, easy-to-read, easy-to-use device like this.  It is SUPER easy to use.  The most difficult part is putting the arm cuff on, and that's easy!  Once you have the arm cuff in the correct position, slightly above the elbow, attach the hose to the main unit and press start.  The built in voice guidance is fairly good and understandable.  The cuff will inflate and your BP will register on the bright, crystal clear screen.  When the reading is all done, the unit will read the results aloud and give you a prognosis.  Depending on what you're shooting for, your interpretation of the numbers may be a little different than what it says though.<br /><br />The unit itself is lightweight, but feels like it's well made.  I like the clean design a lot, too.  The edges are all rouned so it's easy to handle and hold.  The LED screen is super crystal clear and easy to read... in fact, I'm not 100% certain, but I think it may be OLED.  There are four rubber feet on the bottom along with the the speaker.  The cuff is easy to insert and remove.  The design is great.<br /><br />It comes with a nice little carry case that fits the main unit, the arm cuff and a USB-A to USB-C cable for using it without batteries (and it includes 4xAAA batteries).<br /><br />Overall, it is an excellent quality device at an incredible price point.  I gotta say that at this price, everyone should have one of these along with a fingertip blood oxygen monitor and maybe even one of the new ECG (EKG) readers.  Take charge of your health.  The first step is knowing your readings.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Just a little side note:  One of the most important things in taking an accurate BP reading is to be relaxed.  If you look up info on the proper procedure, you're really not supposed to be doing any activity for at least 10 to 15 minutes prior to the reading and certainly you wouldn't take a BP reading for hours after any strenuous excercise.  BP is very sensitive to both physical activity and stress.  IMO the best time to do it is when you're relaxing at home, maybe even just prior to going to bed.  When you put the cuff on, try to stay calm and let it do it's thing.  You can throw off a reading by a lot just by being tense. [SEP] I can't comment on the price of this unit because its currently not available but I can comment on the reliability of the numbers it put up.  The numbers are big and this unit has a back light on the display that allows you to see it well.  I find it to be reliable for reading my blood pressure correctly, it may be off by a couple of points but not enough to make a significant difference.  It comes with a USB-C cord, a battery and a carrying case, the case is great if you decide to travel with it.  The cuff on this unit says it will fit just about anyone, nope I have a very big arm and it barely fit me.  My suggestion would be to measure your arm prior to purchasing a blood pressure cuff.",3,True
"Go Green Power Memory Foam Travel Neck Pillow, Red, 0.59 Pound","['Spandex', 'Imported', 'Spandex Material Cover', 'Premium Memory Foam', 'Lightweight for Travel Purposes', 'Removable Slip w/ zipper Closure', 'Snap Button Enclosure']",['The Travergo Memory Foam Neck Pillow is specifically designed in such a way that it has just the right softness to provide the most comfortable support for your neck. The cover is made of high-quality machine washable spandex like material. Snap enclosure allows your to place on luggage or back pack for easy travel convenience.'],,3.7,24,269,"The pillow itself is really comfortable. It is super plush and thick memory foam. Very comfortable. Definitely made for an adult. However, the fabric isn't the best. It is soft, but the stitching isn't durable at all. The snap on mine broke off pretty quickly. It just ripped straight out without me pulling or anything. The pillow is just heavy and if you are snapping it to your bag when not in use, it puts too much stress on the weak seams.<br />Update: downgraded my star rating because the cover fell completely apart after only a few uses. Then you just have this memory foam “pillow” that definitely needs a cover. So, about a month from opening the package to throwing the pillow away. [SEP] My husband travels a lot for work, including trans Pacific several times a year. He has tried and tossed out many travel pillows over the years for a variety of reasons. I thought this one might suit him.<br /><br />He doesn't like it. He says it's too thick and too stiff for his tastes. Plus he doesn't like material on the cover. However, all is not lost. I've found an alternative use for it. I'm using it as a support pillow for my right hip. I pulled a muscle last week (trying not to fall out my saddle when my young mare bolted over two jumps) and just sitting upright is excruciating.<br /><br />This is stiff and thick which wait very durable for sitting on. It doesn't give or sag and it returns to it's shape when put up. Since the cover is removable, I can wash it as needed. So....too hard for a neck/head pillow, but just right to support my injured hip. [SEP] This is the first actual neck pillow I've used. I always wanted to get one for air travel, though I dont travel that often. This pillow is comfortable yet firm, which I like. the memory foam is good. it's a bit thick, though, not sure if that is a good thing or not. I've worn the pillow sitting on the couch and it was comfy but my 15 minute test isn't the same as an hours-long flight from Arizona to Maryland. I have just such a trip planned in the next few months so I'll have to update this review after I've been able to use the pillow for a prolonged time.<br /><br />I do like the fact that the outer cover can be easily removed for washing. the snap is great because I can snap it onto my luggage handle and not worry about it falling off. If I had a choice, I probably would not have picked red, but now that I have it, the red is actually a good thing to have because it stands out. I certainly wouldn't lose this easily or forget it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a firm but comfortable neck pillow, this will do the trick! [SEP] I have yet to find a comfortable travel neck pillow.  I was hoping this one would be the one that I loved, but it was not to be.  The quality of this product is great and the foam is supportive.  This pillow is just too big for me.  The sides of this pillow end up being too far from my neck to offer much support and the back sticks out too far such that my neck is pushed forward.  I'm a small woman and I think this pillow would work well for a larger person, but it doesn't work well for me.<br /><br />The construction quality of this pillow is nice.  The fabric feels nice to the touch and the color is vibrant.  There's a little snap closure at the end so that you can easily connect it to a suitcase.  This neck pillow takes up a lot of room, so I think it would be better for train trips rather than plane trips. [SEP] If you travel or even have lengthy medical treatments like I do, this neck pillow is a lifesaver.  It is a sturdy memory foam and well constructed.  I had been using one of those foam bead pillows but they offer not support and get worse and worse over time.  This pillow never surrenders!  Very well made and durable and keeps its support.  Highly recommended! [SEP] Wow, it's super light-weight but dense enough for great support. The cover is easy to remove as well and it does not smell after a few days. Even though it's bulky, I can see myself traveling with it even on the airplane. The buttons prevents it from moving around my neck when I am trying to sleep. I even use it on the bed when I just need to face down for a few minutes.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend it. [SEP] This pillow is great.  My husband and I carpool to work so I'm lucky enough to catch a quick nap.  I had just a regular pillow and it was okay, so I was very eager to try this pillow.  It's super soft and comfortable and definitely helps with the head rolling situation.  I love that the cover comes off for washing.  It is a bit bulky but I'm hoping after more use it will better shape to me. [SEP] We have a long trip in the Jeep planned for later in the year and in the past I have always used the neck pillows with beans in them.  Unfortunately, beans will eventually move around and the support for the neck dissipates.  Over a long trip, I may have to re-adjust a bean pillow over and over again.<br /><br />Therefore, I was very happy to see a memory foam travel neck pillow.  First off, this thing is bright red and matches the red and black Quadratec seat covers in my Jeep.  Not a big deal, but it fits my red and black theme.  We tested the neck pillow over an hour long trip over the weekend.  Unlike the beans, it supports the neck without needing constant re-adjusting.  It is stiffer than the bean filled pillow, but we like that feature.  Also, the pillow can make your neck a few degrees warmer than the air temperature when you snap the ends together.  My neck gets stiff over a long ride, so I like the fact that it has some warmth to it. If you unsnap the ends, you will get more of the air temperature back in.<br /><br />The snaps can also make it easy to attach the pillow to the outside of a backpack or suitcase, since it is bulky, which gives the snaps another useful feature.  The cover can be removed easily, as well.  There is a zipper on the back and you can just unzip it and toss the cover in the wash.<br /><br />Really, I am not sure what more you can ask for in a neck pillow.  I guess it could be a bit more cushiony, but I like the stiffness since I have neck problems and I prefer support over something like a bean filled pillow that loses its shape over time. [SEP] Comfortable and easily packed travel pillow. Its soft and fits nicely around your neck. Great for long flights. Reasonably priced. [SEP] This is an excellent neck support travel pillow for planes, trains or (the shotgun seat) in an automobile.  I had to look twice at the price point for this quality memory foam construction pillow - what a deal!  I like that the cover zips off for laundering but must admit that I had a little bit of trouble getting it back in - it has a nylon zip so I didn't want to push too hard to dislodge it.  Other than that one critique I really like this pillow.  It's firm, comfortable and if you choose the bright red color you won't be leaving it behind on the seat.",3,True

[SEP] I got this blend because I thought it would help me fall asleep faster. It doesn't. It does have a pleasant aroma and applies easily with the roller ball. But aside from being a pleasing fragrance, I must say that it doesn't really do much for me, so I won't be ordering it again. [SEP] This smells devine! I have been trying to improve my sleep quality and especially the falling asleep part and have incorporated this into my new sleep routine. I am finding it effective, it helps set the mood for sleep. the fragrance is light and I think it smells gorgeous. It definitely helps to relax me and this with playing some sleep music is really helping with falling asleep faster. [SEP] I've been using this nightly - I love the scent - can be worn as perfume.  Definitely relaxing, recommend! [SEP] A handy 10 ml bottle made of dark glass to maintain the oils' properties. An elegant, modern packaging design and good quality long black cap. The roll-on works smoothly. You can enjoy a relaxing, gentle, long-lasting scent of Bergamot, Chamomile, Lavender, Copaiba, Lemongrass, Organic Jojoba Oil, Roman Chamomile, Sandalwood, Siberian Fir & Thyme. A full list of ingredients is not included on the label (you need to visit their website to check it out which is not convenient). [SEP] Lovely oil that is lightly scented.  It absorbs quickly leaving a pleasant aroma.  I've been using it before bedtime and I think it leads to a more restful sleep.  I like that it has a metal roller ball instead of the usual plastic.  I'm not very well versed in essential oils and the subtle differences between various types.  I do know that I very much like these MONQ blends. [SEP] This is a relaxing, gentle scent, but the scent is so faint, I can barely even smell it. I might not be able to smell the lavender much at all, and the chamomile barely. I am not sure if it really is helping with sleep in any way. The bottle is a decent size, and it is easy to roll on. [SEP] This is an enjoyable scent to wear.  You can roll it on anywhere.  We prefer the wrist and neck.  It helps you calm down and get the rest that you need. [SEP] Came packaged in a plastic bag. Roller ball took a long time to prime and then was glitchy (sometimes a lot of oil came out, sometimes barley anything rolled out). Scent is heavy on the bergamot- which is a spicy orange and reminds me of cloves. It’s a very warm and cozy scent. [SEP] Came packaged in a plastic bag.

Elderberry Gummies for Kids & Adults Immune Support - Vitamin C Echinacea Propolis & Sambucus Black Elderberry Gummy Vitamins - Organic Nature Booster Non-GMO Gluten Free - USA…,[],[],,4.5,140,2138,"These elderberry gummies are very near the top of my list of favorite elderberry gummies.  These taste very good but my main reason for liking them so much is that they include propolis, echinacea and vitamin C.  These don't have any zinc and I'm glad of that because it seems like zinc is included in so many other supplements.  These gummies have about twice the amount of elderberry of many other gummies that I've reviewed and I've learned from experience what an incredible anti-viral elderberry is.  I haven't got sick at all this cold and flu season. [SEP] Love these Elderberry gummies. Whatever I can do to help my immune system during this pandemic is a plus. The taste is pleasant. Vegetarian and GMO free is also a plus. [SEP] These are basically candy... With a small amount of elderberry and vitamin c. The dosage of elderberry is quite low and they are pretty much straight sugar. They also don't look anything like the picture and are coated in sugar. They definitely are delicious, but if you want something with a higher amount of elderberry and lower amount of sugar I'd probably get something else. [SEP] Great product and value [SEP] Tasty way to stay healthy and increase my immune system [SEP] This review is for Elderberry Gummies for Kids & Adults Immune Support - Vitamin C Echinacea Propolis & Sambucus Black Elderberry Gummy Vitamins - Organic Nature Booster Non-GMO Gluten Free - USA - 2 Pack. I like to take elderberry to help with immune support. I like that these also have added vitamin C in them. The texture is good and they aren't too hard or too soft and they don't get stuck in your teeth. They do have a good berry flavor and do not leave an aftertaste. Overall these are a good gummy vitamin. [SEP] These gummies are really good. They do not taste too bad. It does not have that chalky after-taste. I taste like candy to me. [SEP] I've tried other brands of elderberry chews. What was wrong with the original flavor? This one has more sugar coating, then raspberry flavor, then elderberry. To me it was in that order. But actually, I thought it was an artificial sweetener aftertaste. First impression. I read the label ingredients and came up with the odd flavor description (order of taste). I still don't like it much.<br /><br />Maybe the taste was meant to be unique? But it isn't my favorite. I've gotten accustomed to elderberry flavor, even the black elderberry is fine to me. I just don't need the flavor enhancement.<br /><br />Other than the taste, seems a good product blend. [SEP] I purchased for my daughter's to take with their vitamins. My youngest normally gets sick easily and she has not been sick at all considering what we are dealing with. [SEP] Great!",3,True
Blue Magic Petroleum Jelly 12 oz.,[],['unknown'],8.46,4.6,32,6710,"I bought Blue Magic's Petroleum Jelly on a whim, and I'm glad I did. I've heard of this product from them before but found it for the first time at my local hair supply store in NYC. I used it as a sealant for my 4C natural hair after washing, deep conditioning, and then moisturizing it with hot water and aloe vera gel. What's most interesting about this product is that it's not really a grease, but it's too shiny, too oily, and too smooth to pass off as petroleum jelly, it's also too white in color to even pass off as something like Vaseline, which is an off-yellow color. I was skeptical at first as to how my hair would respond to this because this product is very in-between, and also odd, in many ways. It's scented but its scent is barely there, like there's a slight floral smell, but it's really hard to detect it, sometimes you smell it, sometimes you don't. Using this as a grease on your hair makes you feel like you're using what I'd call a ""clean"" grease, where it doesn't have the heavy coloring, fragrance, and oils like their original blue or green Blue Magic, it's just petroleum jelly infused with aloe vera, safflower oil, and vitamin E. To my surprise, this product worked just like those greases. It's not too heavy, but it's not too light either. It held my two-strand twists together very beautifully. It actually gave my style a slicker and smoother look to it, and my hair was so moisturized. This is advertised as being like an all-purpose petroleum jelly where you can also use it on your body, hands, lips, etc. but I think you're better off just using straight up Vaseline; I just don't think it quite works in the same way because, again, it's just way too shiny, oily, and greasy for that, but as a sealant on moist/wet hair? Fabulous. I wouldn't go out of my way to just buy this product, but if I go back to the shop to get my favorite products and I so happen to see it's in stock still, sure, I'll grab it! [SEP] Been using this for a while my scalp tends to get sensitive in summer, due to it being hot so it'd always get very itchy. I like using this because it's simply is what it is, no additives just pop some on and I'm good.

"Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Professional Painless Ear Nose Hair Trimmer Clippers for Men and Women, Battery-Operated Shaver, Waterproof Stainless Steel Head, Mute Motor and Easy to Cleaning and Carry",[],[],,3.8,108,827,"Solid construction and efficient. This ear and nose trimmer does a nice job of trimming without any pulling or risk of injury. It's not terribly loud, either. Recommended. [SEP] If you want a nose hair trimmer with zero power this is the one for you! [SEP] Previously, I had a Wahl trimmer that I was using. Same form-factor, same battery. However, the design of the cutter tip is different. Apparently, that makes all the difference! I was very surprised by how well this trimmer performed. My previous one would snag all the time on my nose hair. With this trimmer, it cuts easily and keeps on going!<br /><br />Cleaning is a little harder with this trimmer, but a little more effort in cleaning is a welcome trade for my trimmer not snagging all the time! [SEP] This nose hair trimmer is exactly as described. It’s small and very portable - only the size of a thick marker - and easy to operate. It needs one AAA battery, which is a little inconvenient but hopefully one battery will last a long time as I don’t use the product super often. I have been using it to trim my nose hairs since I noticed some starting to emerge. It works well for that purpose and hasn’t caused me any pain or cut me. I don’t have any ear hair (yet at least!) so I can’t speak to its effectiveness there. I like that the whole thing is waterproof so you can clean it thoroughly without worrying about submerging it. This overall seems like a good product for the price. [SEP] Apart from getting pretty hot during extended use, this device actually works pretty well. I wouldn't use it on my ears, but it works well for my nose hair. [SEP] In my uploaded pic, on the left is my old one.  My old one has visible teeth and works quite well.  It is useful for the nose but also eyebrows or anywhere.  On the right is this 'Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer'.  When using this one, the hairs need to go into the small slots (the slots are clear in some of the sellers pics).  You need to keep moving it around until the hairs enter the slots which is where the blade is.  I was due for a nose trim so I tried it out.  It took considerably longer and just did not do as good of a job.  I finished up with my old favorite.<br />In fairness, this new one is much gentler, my old one does make the inside of my nose a little raw for a brief period of time but not a big deal.<br />I am giving this 'Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer' 3-stars.  It works but just not as well as others and also is limited to nose and ear and not effective for eyebrows.  If sensitivity is your primary concern, this one is worth considering and I would recommend.  But for all others, consider the versatility and better performance of other styles. [SEP] Very compact nose hair trimmer. Great for traveling. Fits perfectly in your bathroom bag. Waterproof is another great feature. Sleek design makes it discrete as well. [SEP] # My Review<br />This review is for the ZHIBAI Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer. This is the first time I’m trying an ear & nose trimmer from this brand and at first glance this looks like a nice and easy to use product. I’ve been lucky to try a similar product from another brand, and after comparing them, I can say that they do the same job, but there’s always room for improvement.<br /><br />All of the included items are packaged in a ZHIBAI branded black box that snugly fits each of components in plastic casing to protect the contents while in transit. Even though this appears to be a budget quality product, from a packaging stand-point it presents well and can be considered as a gifting option! All in all, I’d say that the packaging has a good shelf presence.<br /><br />To learn more about its functionality, the online product description does a good job detailing its features, so I won’t repeat all of that. The handheld unit is slim, compact and is sleek black in color. It’s easy to hold and position while in use; it feels solid and has a good weight to it which makes this comfortable to use. Once the battery is installed, there’s a hidden switch in the base which can be confusing for the first-time user. The unit is a somewhat powerful and works well; however, I’ve found that the rotary blade slows down from time to time and often snags hair which is painful. Replacing and cleaning the unit is easy, as you disassemble and run it through water to dislodge any hair remnants.<br /><br />Overall, this is an ok trimmer for the price. It’s very easy to use, and works ok. Maybe worth a try if you don’t want to spend too much on a trimmer.<br /><br />If you found this review informative, then please click on the “[Helpful]” button to let me know to continue providing these unbiased and in-depth reviews for this community.

It is very fast, and you do not feel any pain when you use it.<br />It is very easy to clean, and it is very small (a little bit bigger than a pen).<br />This tool does what it should do, and it does it perfectly. [SEP] This thing has a metal body, like a good flashlight.  The quality of the housing is great, although it's harder to assess the motor and blades.<br /><br />This works fine on nose hair, but it doesn't seem to work as well on ears, where the hairs could be coming from any direction.  The blade design depends on you getting the hairs to it at the right angle.  I have another such trimmer that works better for ears.  Too bad this one doesn't work well on ears, because it is nice and quiet, whereas the other one I have that works well on ears is uncomfortably loud.",3,True
"Easy-Tang Bath Bombs Gift Set 12 Large Fizzies with Pure Essential Oils and Shea Butter to Moisturize Dry Skin, Ideal Gift for Women, Mother, Christmas",[],[],,4.4,44,186,"There are 12 individually wrapped bath bombs in this set and they all smell the same to me. The box is wrapped around the center in packaging tape which looks hideous. The bombs themselves, however, are presentation quality in the sense that they are wrapped in tissue paper and then also shrink wrapped in plastic under that.<br /><br />I hardly detected any fragrance with these and they all smell the same to me. Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I test them in a foot bath first to either bathe my hands or my feet. Because I was skeptical of these, I bathed my hands.<br /><br />One bath bomb dissolves in about three minutes in close to hot water and the suds last about 10-15 minutes. The fragrance is almost non-existent and the results are horrendous. First of all, as I was filling the foot bath, the color of the bombs sprayed all over my sink and kitchen backsplash just as a result of running water over the bomb. I had about five minutes of cleaning to do from that. However, after bathing my hands, they came out pink as can be seen in the photo and I was unable to wash the color off with soap and water. These are a complete disappointment.<br /><br />I would not recommend these at all only because of the color staining of these bombs, the limited fragrance, and the way the box is wrapped. [SEP] The bath bombs all look and smell the same. They are fairly large--about the size of medium oranges. Not gift quality IMO as the box doesn't scream luxury--rather it says utility. Plus it has a wide plastic wrap around it. There's a bar code label firmly stuck on the box which says 'made in china.' I was unable to remove it without tearing the box. So again, an argument against gifting.<br />The bombs are individually wrapped and are strong smelling. Just all the same which is a great pity. There is a tiny variation in colour due to to the swirls, but that's it.<br />Bath bombs have become fancy these days and so these don't compare well. They fizzed and floated for a while and kids love that, but other than that, nothing special. Overall the smell was too strong. [SEP] I bought these for my granddaughter and she lives to watch them fizz. They aren’t really moisturizing but they smell nice and turn the water an orange-red, which she loved. I would buy these again. [SEP] It smells really good and they are so moisturizing and colorful [SEP] I love bath bombs, but i don't love spending a lot of money on bathbombs which are, at the end of the day, a relatively brief pleasure for me. My daughter in law can spend hours in the tub. Me? 30 minutes is about my top. Hard for me to spend the equivalent of a movie theater ticket (okay matinee) at Lush for that.<br /><br />These particular bombs have pros and cons. First, they transform the color of the tub quite quickly and offer a lot of color saturation. The smell is not too strong, but that works for me because I have perfume allergies. I find them oddly different from many bath bombs in that they aren't very buoyant. They sink and dissolve and at the end you have a slightly silty, highly colored bathwater just the same, but without the intermediate effervescence. Unlike some higher end products, all of the bath bombs seem to be the same in color and scent.<br /><br />They *are* a good size. I'd be pegging this as base-level acceptable if not for that- but the generous dimensions make them a cut above. I've bought big-box-store bombs that were about the same price but half the size, which nudges these up in my estimation. [SEP] If you like to help break apart bath bombs, these will stain your hands. It will look like you were dying someone hair neon pink without wearing gloves.<br />Aside from that these are quite large. [SEP] This is a nice, giftable box containing very pretty, colorful, and nicely scented bath bombs. They are good for relaxing and self-care. The oils and shea butter help with moisturizing your skin, so you come out of the bath smelling great and with your skin also feeling great. It's fun to watch them dissolve, also. [SEP] And to our suprise theyre freaking huge!!! Give off a good color, my kids love them [SEP] Bath bombs are very creamy and fizzy. Love the scent and colors. Very fragrant and each have their own little unique pattern. Love! [SEP] These bath bombs have the best spin and fizz of any bath bombs I have ever had. I was so busy watching the show once I dropped one into the tub that I totally forgot to take pictures until it was more than halfway gone, but it was still spinning and fizzing away down to the very last bit. The bath bomb floats on the surface, and if I push it under the water, it bounces right back up, so the entire spinning, colorful effect stays readily visible. The whole show lasted for about 15 minutes. The colors are vibrant. The blue cap dissolves first, and the purple and orange dissolve pretty evenly after that. The fragrance is faintly floral. It leaves my bath water a beautiful reddish orange. The oils and salts in the bath bomb feel very soothing to my skin and leave it feeling clean, soft, and well moisturized when my bath is done. The bath bomb did not leave a residue or a stain of any kind. These bath bombs spin very energetically, and I would not recommend putting one in something as small as a foot bath. Instead, use them in a regular bath tub per the instructions. The only reason I gave these delightful bath bombs a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because the box, instead of being shrink wrapped like most bath bomb sets, is instead held together with a huge piece of packaging tape that goes all the way around the box. When the tape is removed, it leaves a wide stretch of stickiness that prevents the box from being set on anything after that or it will stick to it and spread the adhesive to whatever the box is placed on. This also prevents the box from being used as a gift box, although the bombs themselves make great gifts. Fortunately, this is a problem that can be easily remedied by the seller. Either shrink wrap the box, or just put a tiny amount of tape or another type of seal on the edges of the box, not all the way around the top and bottom. In the meantime, I simply transferred the rest my bath bomb set to another container, no problem. I think these 12 large (4.2 oz), vibrantly colored, fantastically fizzing bath bombs are a good value and very giftable, even if I have to place them in another box each time.",3,True

"Beekeepers Naturals B.Soothed Peppermint Honey Cough Drops-Organic Sore Throat Relief Lozenges-Immune Support & Cough Suppressant with Zinc,Propolis,Vitamin D,14 Ct",[],[],,3.2,62,99,"These seem like great quality cough drops with beneficial ingredients for when you are under the weather. A couple downsides for me are that the outside of them are rough so they cut up your mouth a bit and secondly no place saying where they are made. They have a mildly sweet and minty taste. [SEP] There are 14 lozenges in this package and the maximum ""dosage"" per day is 3 lozenges.  Each one contains 10 calories with 1g of added sugars, 1500IU of Vitamin D (as cholecalciferol--which is apparently D3 and animal based), 3mg of Zinc, 25mg Bee Propolis Extract, 12mg of Peppermint Extract, and 7.5mg of Eucalyptus Extract.<br /><br />Other ingredients in this are chicory root fiber, tapioca syrup, and honey.<br /><br />The current price of $8.99 comes to an expensive $.64 cents per dietary supplement drop.

They have natural ingredients, like propolis, peppermint, honey. The amount of sugar is low. Also it is a source of Vitamin D and Zinc. The taste is fresh, sweet and refreshing. [SEP] These do exactly what you expect a cough drop to do; soothe the throat. The flavor is nice (primarily eucalyptus and honey - I didn't get much mint). And you can tell this is more ""all natural"" than brand name cough drops, as they melt in a bee-hive like fashion.<br /><br />The immune system support jargon feels a bit like overkill to me. I definitely get a stronger effect from products which contain menthol. And these cost at least 5 times what most of us are used to paying per drop.<br /><br />Still, I definitely enjoy the unique mouthfeel and somewhat muted sensation of these cough drops. If most lozenges are too strong for you, and you don't mind spending the money, these are a great option. [SEP] I use lozenges daily during allergy season and these do more than any other to sooth my throat. They actually work and do not make me jittery. They are the best by far to sooth your throat when you feel it's been scratchy.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] Really like these, they are soothing and help with cough.

It's not a bad idea to keep it in the car just in case, or with any outdoor activity gear.  The kit contains almost anything a slightly injured person might need for a quick fix.  There's gauze and tape, band aids, antiseptic towelettes, safety pins, tweezers, and even a small Pocket Guide for First Aid.  (I wish it had a small pair of scissors, though I have a pair and will put them in the kit).  The almost cube-shaped bag or pouch is made of a sturdy cloth with zipper across the top and sides with two different ways to carry it, and about the size of a man's open palm. [SEP] Nice [SEP] small but has the basics [SEP] This is a well constructed first aid bag that is very small so it is a great option when you are tight for space.  It has a belt loop strap on it so you can run your belt loop through it and also has a couple of small loops you can run a cord, hook, or caribiner through to hang it on the outside of your backpack.<br /><br />In terms of contents, it is very oriented toward bandages of various types so it is really made for treating scrapes and cuts.  It has scissors, tweezers, gloves, and antisceptic wipes as well.  The most unusual element is a large number of safety pins.  They may come in handy, but seem out of place compared to other parts of the kit.  There is so much stuff in there that it is a tight fit to get it all back in the case.<br /><br />I am keeping this in the trunk of my car for emergencies and can take it out with me on a spontaneous hike or climb as well.  The compact size makes it a great option when you are really tight on space.  Would work great on a bicycle. [SEP] This is perfect to keep in the car or desk or just in your purse. It has a lot of different items which are useful for everyday cuts and scrapes. The items are handy and pretty good quality. Comes in a red first aid bag. [SEP] Best to familiarize yourself with contents inside before an emergency happens so you don't skiffle around.<br /><br />Everything is tightly packed, may be difficult to get some items without dumping it all out (especially in a panic).<br /><br />Quality of items inside is decent. Not the best quality, but gets the job done until a replacement is needed.<br /><br />Has a belt pass-through for those who like to carry on at all times [SEP] Nice and small fits perfectly in my glove box And Has a little bit of everything. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:46267d34caf579aa53ecbe39a3c1dfcc]] What I like:<br />-- the elastic bandages feel soft.<br />-- the gauze pad and triangular bandage are in sterile packages, keeping them clean until I need to use it.<br />-- antiseptic towelette is good for cleaning a wound before applying a dressing treatment.<br />-- the bag is compact and portable, and has a number of loops to attach it to something else (for instance, I could put this on a carabiner inside my backpack).<br /><br />On the other hand:<br />-- there are too many safety pins and adhesive bandages. The smallest sized adhesive bandages (10*40mm) do not stick well once I place them on my fingers.<br />-- adhesive tape is too thin in width, being only 1.25 cm wide (1/2-inch), and it doesn't stick as well as I would like. I have to use multiple pieces of tape to secure a dressing.<br />-- the plastic tweezers are too flexible.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent mini first-aid kit.",3,True
Noise Cancelling Ear Plugs by EarJoy - for Swimming Sleeping Musicians. Reusable. for Shooting Swim Concerts Sleep. Earplugs Sound Blocking. Silicone Base. Best Sound Reduction.,[],[],,3.9,817,3047,"Very comfortable earplugs. Would work well at noisy sporting events or concerts. [SEP] These are pretty good for general noise cancelling - mowing the lawn, sporting events, etc, but I wouldn’t recommend them for shooting. None of them felt like they protected my hearing as well as my over the ear protectors do. [SEP] If you have a husband who snores and keeps you awake at night I would suggest you buy these. I don’t know how I have lived so long without these. [SEP] ===== RE: the Orange ""Permanent Deaf-Maker"" Ear Plugs AKA ""Let's go to the ER at 5am"" Plugs =====<br />I put the orange plugs in and went to sleep.<br /><br />At 4am I woke up with pain in my left ear. I remove the right plug and try to remove the left plug, but the clear plastic nib comes out and leaves the plug in my ear.<br /><br />For the next hour I try to pull the plug out but I can't. It's painful and I'm worried I need to go to an emergency room. Without the clear plastic nib it's impossible to grab onto. I try tweezers, but I can't get a grip.<br /><br />At 5am, I wake up my neighbor and ask them for help. He tries the tweezers but it doesn't work. We decide to gently insert a wooden toothpick into the hole where the clear plastic nib used to be, and after about 30 minutes of very careful jiggling, we get it out.<br /><br />I cry.<br /><br />My neighbor consoles me. We go to bed. I can't sleep, my adrenaline has been activated. I normally wake up at 9am, so I lost 5 hours of sleep that night.<br /><br />This is DANGEROUS and should never be sold to consumers.<br /><br />===== RE: The Gummy Silicone Earplugs =====<br />These are the most usable, but they worry me. They aren't effective unless the gummy part extends into the ear canal, which you're not supposed to do based on the directions, but if you do this it forms a vacuum seal and does pretty good at keeping sound out.<br /><br />The issue is that if you so much as tap your ear, you'll feel it on your ear drums because of the seal. You have to be VERY VERY VERY careful when you pull these out or you'll rupture your eardrums.<br /><br />If you put them in like you're supposed to, just covering the outside of the ear canal, they let almost all of the sound in still. They can't be used safely, in my opinion, and I recommend NOT using them in an unsafe way just to get them to work. I was desperate and so I did it the unsafe way, but don't do what I did.<br /><br />===== RE: The other earplugs =====<br />The grey bomb-shaped ear plugs were not effective at all for me, they sat in my ear and let all the sound in still. They have clear plastic fins on them to pull them out, and although mine didn't break like the orange earplugs did, I would still be afraid of them being a safety hazard if they did break.<br /><br />The blue christmas-tree shaped earplugs seem the safest, they are all one piece of rubber and so it seems like a very low risk of breaking, and you can safely insert them and they seem to work. The only issue is they're not really meant to block sound so much as reduce volume, so I can still hear snoring, construction work, etc. Plus, they have a long piece that sticks out and prevents you from putting your ears on your pillow comfortably. If you sleep on your back, or you don't use them for sleeping, they would be fine. I'd recommend this pair to you if you just need to reduce noise and not block it out completely and don't sleep on your side.<br /><br />===== Quick Summary =====<br />Except for the blue christmas tree shaped earplugs, I would recommend you just throw these ear plugs in the trash so you don't hurt yourself. [SEP] It is awesome they came with cases for storage.<br /><br />I have very sensitive ears that hurt with the expanding kind. I have worn the swimmer wax ones but hated how they caught in my hair or dislodged over night. I work night shift so sleep in the day and cannot sleep through anything. Now I can.<br /><br />These are perfectly flexible and nice soft feel. Definitely reccomend! [SEP] They don’t block any noise at all.  I tried inserting them many different ways.  Followed the directions precisely.  They’re worthless. [SEP] Seriously I’m writing a review about ear plugs? They’re that great. I have very sensitive hearing and even moderate noise sometimes makes my eardrums hurt. I always carry one pair of these around with me, keep one in the car, etc. just in case I need them. They’re very comfortable and don’t get irritating. They cancel enough noise that I can feel at ease enough sleep, but if I wear them loosely I could still have a conversation with someone at dinner. They are fairly discrete and the little cases are great, too. I’ve used these for almost a year now whether it’s sitting in a coffee shop or traveling on a plane. If you are in the market for ear plugs, look no further. Seriously these are awesome and so comfy. [SEP] working great found 1 set works best for me [SEP] These have proven perfect for helping me sleep. My husband snores.  I wake up and push him over, nudge him and even smack him sometimes.  He always just starts snoring again within a few minutes. These have made us both sleep better. I don't have to wake up to become an abusive wife and he doesnt have to wake up for 30 seconds while I try to make him not snore.<br /><br />I barely feel them. I have a daith piercing inside of my ear and it doesnt bother me! [SEP] enjoy this product, comfortable.",3,True

The sponge comes off the plastic piece the minute you start scrubbing. [SEP] Seriously don’t buy these unless you want to lose your mind.

[SEP] Stunningly low quality. Sometimes they’d survive one use, sometimes three or four, but the sponges come unglued so fast it’s like they used a water soluble glue. I’m flabbergasted at how poorly these hold up. I mean it. I’m not exaggerating, a few dishes cleaned per sponge and they come unglued. [SEP] Every one of these I have used the sponge has come off the holder.  Very disappointing [SEP] Didn't fit the standard handle I got from Walmart that was a name brand.

Actually you get only one - the red part is the inside of the bottle, while the cover is blue and decorated with stars.<br /><br />The rubber bottle is thick and feels solid and durable. My hot water stayed hot for hours. It's great for soothing an aching bottom or bad back. It didn't leak and it kept sleeping contentedly for hours. Overall it's a nice piece, I just wish the photos showed just one bottle and a cross section, as that would have been less deceptive. [SEP] I grew up using hot water bottles when I had stomach aches or back aches. It's been harder to find hot water bottles though. This bottle is the same as I'd used for years. It is easy to fill up and comes with an additional cover to prevent people from touching the bottle when it is too hot.  While many people don't use these hot water bottles, once you've used it when you're feeling poorly, you'll see how helpful and comforting they are.  I rely on them when I'm feeling poorly and waiting for medicine or my cure to kick in. [SEP] This is fantastic. It does not leak, the rubber bladder keeps the water hot/warm for a really long time, and it's a great size.<br />The cover looks just like a pretty night sky, and is really soft. I actually thought it was neoprene at first, but it's just the tactile feel from the rubber bladder inside.<br />Large opening makes it easy to fill. I heat up water on the stove, and before it hits boiling is my ideal starting temp. My kids prefer the heat lower, but I like knowing that it hasn't stressed under the hotter water I use.<br />Classic, comfortable and a great item to have for so many different things! [SEP] Perfect for aches and pains, and warming up in the winter. I love this hot water bottle. The cover is very soft and I love that it's washable. Although I've only hand washed and air dried mine, so I'm not sure about the sturdiness of the fabric otherwise. [SEP] This is a classic rubber hot water bottle like I used to use as a kid. It stays warm for 5 hours and has a super soft velvety removable cover with a calming Galaxy print on it. The cover is really well made, and the bottle doesn't leak. The bottle has a nice wide mouth so you don't spill filling it up. It doesn't come with any instructions on how to use it, so here's what I do: boil a tea kettle full of water, remove it from the heat and let it stand for 5-10 minutes, pour into the hot water bottle, screw on plug. (Tap water isn't hot enough, and boiling water is so hot it will damage the bottle.) This provides the perfect amount of comforting heat for muscle aches, cramps, or chilly nights. [SEP] Well - it's a hot water bottle. There's not much to say about hot water bottles. Been around for decades (if not longer). This one is about as good or bad as every other hot water bottle I've ever owned, HOWEVER - the starry cover is super-cute. Perfect for our space-themed bedroom. LOVE it! [SEP] For some reason, its asking me to rate if this is easy to drink from... Please, do not drink from this. I filled this with super hot tap water and it lasted for a few hours... great for all of my aches and pains... and the cover is nice and attractive, giving the standard water bottle a nice upgrade. Not sure why its listed as flannel either... the cover is kind of like a neoprene or like the material of a scuba suit/surfers' rash guard. [SEP] I threw up in a home where a hot water bottle was a mainstay.<br />But lately I have found that hot water bottles are not necessarily that easy to find but as always Amazon comes to the rescue.<br />My main uses are for back spasms and for heating up my bed in cold nights.<br />No leaks and the the flannel cover makes sure that I do not burn myself. [SEP] I’ve been experiencing more and more leg soreness after long runs, particularly in my quads.  I’ve tried different hot and cold therapies, but true to my Asian roots, decided that it was finally time to try using a rubber water bag.  Here are some thoughts:<br /><br />• Size/Design: The water bag is appropriately-sized to cover a large area of the body.  I have a fairly large hot water kettle that I use for this bag (about one kettle fills one water bag).  The exterior cloth is both comfortable and aesthetically pleasing.  I also appreciate the buttons, as it allows me to peel the cloth bag to avoid getting the cloth wet when pouring the hot water into or out of the bag.<br /><br />• Ease of Use and Effectiveness: As noted, this holds a good amount of water.  The rubber design is nice and flexible, allowing for good contortion to the body.  I actually don’t think you have to fill the water all the way, as it helps to “slosh” the water a bit to get a bit more heat.  Be careful at first, however, as I found that the water bag was a bit too hot in the first few minutes of use.  It may be good to take some breaks here and there, as I had some noticeable red marks on my quads afterwards.  Overall, I found that the bag stayed well-heated for over an hour (if not closer to one and half hours).<br /><br />• Leakage: This is well-made with a screwable top that prevents water from leaking out.<br /><br />In summary, I’m happy with rubber water bag and will continue to use this to treat general soreness.  My only concern is that this water bag can get a tad hot in the beginning and may leave some redness, but as long as you are cognizant of these factors then I think this is a great addition to the home.  Recommend! [SEP] This is my favorite hot water bottle so far. I've bought a few over the last few months and the quality of this one beats the other ones out.<br />The cover is soooooo soft, good quality material, and nice craftsmanship too.<br />The bottle has what looks like a nylon cap and threads. It's not metal, but this material will actually endure better than some of the ""metals"" I've seen in other bottles and it will definitely last longer than regular non-polyamide plastics. I left it in my chair and accidentally sat on it when I came back (full force - forgot it was there - I'm not what you would call light). It was fine, no leaks, no sound, it actually bounced me back up some. Now, I wouldn't recommend jumping on it or anything but if you're forgetful like me... =)",3,True

Sorry, I didn't have a before photo but my 2006 Nissan Murano looks amazing. Even was asked if I got a new car. Note that the white line on the left of the hood is a reflection not a scratch.

Having a dark color you get clear coat scratches just looking at it. I found this does not eliminate scratches but colors the white clear coat scratches to blue clear coat scratches. You have to get twice as close to see the scratches , about  18 inches. So standing over it the paint looks brand new.<br />This wax gives your finish a wet and even finish look. The biggest perk is hiding the scratches from the black shiny plexiglass they put inside and outside of cars ( big mistake) nowadays. Once you stop using this wax , or soap up your vehicle you will see the the clear coat scratches all over again. So buy another bottle if you run out.<br />This wax is easy to apply. Even putting it on with a moist micro fiber towel to dilute the wax it works just as well and buffs off instantly. The moral of the story ... buy a white vehicle. [SEP] Have a blue vehicle with speck like chips in the clearcoat that regular polish turns white so, with with focused application and repeated buffing the chips turned blue and vanished from sight.  About $4500 cheaper than a paint job. [SEP] I have a swirl pattern of scratches on the hood of my pickup. I've tried several products to improve the looks but nothing has done much good. This made the scratches less noticeable but the scratches are still easily visible. There is an improvement but still a way to go for the scratches to be invisible. If you have bad scratches, this will improve the area but not clear it up. I would recommend the product based on the amount it did improve the spot. [SEP] purchased this product because of past product experience. this is expensive, does not hide heavy scratches even with crayon (gimmick). what it does do is hide very minor surface scratches and it does leave a deep deep shine and if you follow it up with a sealer it will last for a while.

It does not affect operation of the light, however.<br /><br />BULB<br />I am still on the original bulb, but bought a backup in case.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This light is fantastic.  It works great, provides fantastic light and is my go to for artwork, sewing, or knitting.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I would buy this again no problem if it is the same quality is the one I have now. [SEP] Great task lighting with two slightly different settings. Adjustable for most positions next to a chair. hope the replacement bulb is reasonable when necessary. [SEP] I bought this as a gift for my mom, it was at the very least a bit of a pain to put together and cheaply made.  It required electrical tape and a good bit of cursing!  Is now working ok.  The grill is cheap plastic.  It is bright and helps an elderly woman to read better. [SEP] It was all and more than what I expected and arrived in less than 3 days. I am a jigsaw puzzler and it is the only and best way to have enough light. Love it ! LoveIt [SEP] worth buying it. really good task lamp [SEP] I had one of these lamps for several years and liked for reading.  As I consider it a fairly expensive lamp I was disappointed when the switch quit working.  I didn't get a response when I contacted the company so I tried to do a home repair but the switch is almost an integral part of the lamp stand.  I finally disposed of the lamp simply because of that faulty switch.  But I missed the lamp and later bought another one.  That has now been a few years and the lamp and switch has worked well. The orginal tube is till working but I have the one from the original I kept for spare if I ever need it.  Great lamp....and maybe the switch in mine old one was a fluke. [SEP] I was sitting on my bed last night doing some embroidery and I noticed that I really needed some more light on the ""subject.""  My hubby reminded me that I had the Verilux lamp still in the box that had not yet been opened.  I said I would LOVE to have that to enlighten my work if it wouldn't be too much trouble and he had the tools available.  10 minutes later I was sitting there using this wonderful lamp!  Most of that 10 minutes was cutting up the box to get the lamp out of it.  He didn't use any tools that I saw, he just stretched it out from the slightly bent position it was in for shipping and plugged it in!  This lamp has two on switches so you can decide just how bright you want it.  There is a grill looking shield that protects the bulbs that I think is a great idea.  It seems to be made of a plastic of some sort and this does not prevent any light from getting thru to your reading/working area.<br />This is a strong recommend to buy and I think the price is very, very fair for this nicely made lamp. [SEP] I use this lamp at my bedside either for reading books or with my Kindle Fire for reading and apps.  Before getting this lamp, I was content with using my overhead lighting to read in my room.  Since getting the Verilux lamp, I use either the lamp alone (particularly at night) or the overhead and Verilux lamp combined.  It also improves use of my Kindle Fire or other tablet/cell devices.  In any of these situations, using the Verilux lamp makes a clear difference in ease on the eyes so there is no eye strain or related headaches.  The contrast of a black and white text page is perfect.  The gooseneck of the lamp is adjustable to get just the right angle for your reading or craft work.  It does provide a good pool of light for these purposes as opposed to lighting up the room.  If you are reading at night it won't disturb a partner sleeping for example but is significantly higher quality than using a booklight.  Replacement bulbs are available currently priced at around $20.  A comparable product in desk/table top lamp is also available, though for the bedside or an armchair this floor lamp is just the right height.  I have also submitted pictures of what the lamp looks like in my room to show the height.  Most people think of a floor lamp as being taller than this is.  I wouldn't want it at a taller height for my purposes.  I have also added pictures of what text looks like under the light so check out customer images for those pictures.  I will absolutely continue using this light for reading and I suspect replace the bulb maybe once a year?  It could even last longer but $20/yr or so is very reasonable for good reading light.  Now that I am used to this, I couldn't go back to just my overhead lamp or a table lamp at my bedside. I will recommend this product to friends and family as well. [SEP] I have, for a long time, found it difficult to read in the evening...couldn't get the light just right.  This reading floor lamp was just the answer. Would not say it is a piece of fine decor but, also, not a bad looking lamp. Still, I wouldn't part with it.  I can finally catch up on my reading and well worth the price. [SEP] Wonderful soft light and no heat!!!!  Great for those who have trouble seeing small print.  Like the long life of the bulb.",3,True

I got myself the medium, which fits perfectly. The lining makes the gloves easy to slide on and off, plus makes them feel soft while on, and doesn’t cause my hands to sweat like one brand I’ll never buy again. I put these to the test immediately, polishing silver and copper for the holidays. The gloves made everything easy to grip while protecting my fresh manicure from being ruined. Then, the gloves rinsed off perfectly, and did not stain or discolor in any way. These are really great gloves, and I highly recommend them! [SEP] I received 4 pair of these household gloves to try.  I am a small person and have small hands.  I received size Medium and they fit just right—roomy enough that I can pull them off my hands without any difficulty, but not too lose.  For that reason, I would say the run a little small and would recommend that you order one size up from what you think your hand size is.  The gloves are a nice durable weight.  I can wash dishes in very hot water and the heat does not burn me.  The gloves come all the way up my forearm—they are just slightly under 13 inches long from the tip of the middle finger to the opening.  The palm area is slightly textured for a good grip. Each pair of gloves is individually packaged.  I do recommend them. [SEP] I guess it’s hard to find good gloves nowadays. These whole package lasted less than 2 weeks, it kept tearing. I wonder if the quality of gloves has gone low because of the corona virus, so that we keep buying them, maybe? I just can’t make a sense of going through 4 gloves in 2 weeks. [SEP] We like having gloves to protect our hands from the variety of harsh chemicals we use to clean… especially when we clean our toilets or drains. I wasn't sure initially if these were more the latex like gloves that my mother introduced me to years ago for dishes or if they were more a thicker, industrial type. This is more like the light house cleaning type. They are a good quality product… but a slightly better quality. Great for a variety of different reasons where chemicals could possibly touch your hands- gardening, dishwashing, and overall cleaning. We have been using another brand of reusable gloves to clean for years and years… glad we found these… I prefer these over the other brand. [SEP] The gloves are pretty thick to handle daily washing dishes, cleaning the bathroom etc. I’m pretty happy with the quality. [SEP] I generally buy the Playtex gloves. You know the ones, they're purple and sell them in just about every grocery store or Target. I liked those because they're not super thin like the cheaper dish gloves and I don't feel like I might accidentally tear them or cut them open when washing a knife. These are a little thinner than Playtex but still way thicker than the typical cheap kitchen gloves. The lining is softy and keeps my hands from getting stuck in the gloves. So far they've worked out really well. I can bend my fingers easier than I can in my old gloves but I still feel like my hands are well protected when doing dishes. Is there really any more to ask for out of dish/ cleaning gloves?<br /><br />BONUS, It's cheaper than any decent store bought pair of gloves that I've purchased. Usually they're about $5-6 a pair and I actually like these better! [SEP] I like this thickness of glove, with more tactility than the heavy-duty cleaning gloves I've tried, and much more strength than even the strongest surgical-style disposable ones. I can actually type with these (if a little clumsily), and clean a toilet with them without getting a leak.<br /><br />This set lets you try a couple pairs with a cotton lining (flocking) and a couple pairs without. I prefer the lining, makes it easier to get the gloves on and off, absorbs a little sweat, and may strengthen the glove. The lining can be harder to clean, though, so some prefer the unlined for repeated use or for use with nasty substances that might get in and have to be completely washed out for reuse.<br /><br />The solid color are the lined ones, the bicolored unlined. Besides that difference, the bicolored seem thinner (maybe because of the lack of lining) except at the darker-colored parts, which are beefed up to at least match the solids.<br /><br />They both grip fairly well, not quite as well as bare hands for some things, slightly better than some of the similar gloves I've tried out.<br /><br />I usually wear medium, and these mediums fit well, snugly. My palm is towards the large end of the large size according to the size chart in one of the Amazon photos (3.5""), but the medium is actually a little larger than some very similar mediums I've got from other brands.<br /><br />I've noticed that this kind of glove, with the right and left fit, tends to be tight between the thumb and palm when the thumb is stretched out, but that hasn't interfered with their practical use. They may wear out faster there.<br /><br />Made in China. [SEP] I'm very happy with these household gloves.  I got them for use doing house cleaning and for changing my car's oil (where they keep my hands clean and give me good grip).  These are of good quality, with sturdy durable material that has a nice bit of flex and good grip.  I like that two pair are thinner with a little more tactile response and two pair are lined for added comfort, protection, and/or warmth.  The length is long enough to cover beyond the wrist and to go over long sleeves.  The sizing is also accurate: I have medium-large male hands and the mediums in these fit me snugly  and also work well for my wife and her smaller hands.  Very happy with these all around. [SEP] These gloves are thick and have a soft cloth interior.  They are water proof and perfect for use when washing dishes or cleaning. [SEP] Both pairs got holes really quickly.",3,True

I just love how soft they get once you add water and that they help exfoliate my skin without being too rough.

It says you can use them for up to two months, but I tend to only use them for a few weeks before changing them out. [SEP] Konjac sponges are made out of konjac root, a porous root vegetable that grows in Asia. They work great to exfoliate the skin gently. When soaked in water, the konjac sponge becomes incredibly soft and almost feels slimy. Because of its texture, you can exfoliate every day. I have used konjac sponges for my babies too.

My other konjac sponge came with the instructions to microwave on high for 2 minutes to sanitize, but this brand doesn’t ask for that. After use, it’s important to rinse, squeeze out the water; your sponge will last longer and be cleaner. That should be routine with any washcloth, though, so this may be an unnecessary comment.<br /><br />These are great, I scrub my face EVERY DAY with my Red Clay konjac sponge, and my skin does not get irritated. They are recommended to change every two months, but I first have to see if they can live for two months. [SEP] I am very happy with these konjac sponges. They come in this nice and resealable package where each one of the sponges come wrapped individually.<br />Each color supposed to have its own benefit. So far I have tried 2, not quite sure I saw a difference while using one or the other one. However, in general they all help to exfoliate your face and it is nice to switch colors. They do not smell at all.<br />If you have never tried the konjac sponges, you will be amazed on how different they feel from the regular cellulose sponge (the yellow-brownish ones you can get anywhere). They feel hard when new but when you soak them in water become really soft and slick. [SEP] These facial sponges feel good when I use them on my face. They are easy to use.

Not sure if it was a particular batch that was plain and not soft, though this time around they feel incredible. I’m repurchasing.

I followed the directions and mixed it with 8 oz of cold water and it was easy to dissolve and tasted like sugar water. Would probably taste better mixed with a little juice to give it some flavor for a child. But overall seems like a great product for all members of the family. [SEP] Not only are these very helpful when you have a sick child with the flu etc.<br />My husband had open heart surgery over a month ago, but when he came home from the hospital his electrolytes<br />Where still off.<br />I mixed one of these with water, he drank it as his Dr. Told him too when he called him to say how<br />Awful he was feeling. This mommy’s Bliss saved us a trip back to the hospital, but put my husband back on track to recovering. [SEP] We always keep electrolytes of various brands and flavors not just for the kids, but for us grown ups too.  I've used Mommy Bliss products before and they were very good.  These do taste a bit salty but salt is a very important electrolyte and for me, the most important one.  But it's in balance with other electrolytes so whoever is feeling ill should probably get some relief if they can keep these down.  I use electrolytes every time I play tennis since I sweat so much and I need the salt to recover quickly. [SEP] Great for dogs struggling to eat / drink [SEP] This product is sweetened but not flavored, so it just tastes like faintly salty (from the electrolytes) sugar water, but NOT watermelon, grape, orange, mixed fruit, etc. I doubt dogs would mind the sweetness added to their food, and cats do not taste sweet well, if at all. I have been using this to great effect with my picky eater elderly cat who has Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with chronic diarrhea. I just add some of this to whatever he's having. (I firmly believe feeding him raw meat/bone/organ has kept him alive, since his brother died of the same condition before I discovered raw feeding. I also add ground psyllium husk to help solidify his poop.) Anyway, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND for rehydrating sick or chronically dehydrated pets. [SEP] Great product! Easy to use, unflavored, works well. [SEP] I love that these are about the size of a thick straw and that they can fit in the zipper pocket of my purse.  I have an issue with dehydration because of a health condition and it is wonderful to be able to always have these with me to help prevent trouble.  They don't taste bad andI won't need to use too often so the box should last a while.  I was drinking too much gatorade for a while - way too much sugar, so I like having an alternative like this. [SEP] Product expired in 2018 [SEP] Excellent way to buy Pedialyte type powder. Only mix up what you need. Comes in individual packets which is so nice. None gets wasted. Good price. Good seller. [SEP] I bought these for an international flight in the event my kids get sick, so I had them try in some water to make sure they liked it, but they did not. These are supposed to be flavorless, but they do have a flavor. I wouldn't say it's ""bad"" but not good... I wanted something without too much sugar too. Unfortunately they thought this tasted bad in plain cold water.<br />I will be trying Drip Drop next.",3,True
Compostable Cling Wrap (100 ft x 0.47mil (Pack of 1)),[],['compostable cling wrap'],,4.0,51,567,"--Very clingy- truly grabs onto whatever it is being wrapped around/onto; including itself. Be careful!<br />--The material is thin. I have used other compostable cling wrap, and this is the thinnest I have used.<br />--Comes with a slider cutter that you have to attach to box for use in cutting sheets of wrap.<br />--A little tricky to dispense & cut.  Once I got a piece off the roll, I was able to effectively wrap some food. It was while it is still on the roll and trying to get some off that is slightly problematic for me. Perhaps with more use I will get the hand of it.<br />-- If you can get a whole sheet off, then know that whatever you wrap, this will provide a good seal.<br /><br />I find that the compostable wrap is much more clingy than regular cling wraps, and for that I will likely continue with buying compostable cling wrap. This is about what I expected, and works pretty well. However,  I prefer this brand: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XVSWFZ2<br />(more pricy though).<br /><br />3.5-4 stars [SEP] This worked very well for covering my dish to take to the potluck. It was clingy like what I am used to but had the added bonus of being compostable! [SEP] The cling wrap works great - just like name brand.  The box it comes in is cr*p and wants to fall apart.  I haven't had it long enough to see how well it decomposes in my compost heap but if it remains in it for long I will update this review. [SEP] I like this compostable wrap. It is heavier than most and doesn’t get tangled up. It seals well. All in all a decent wrap. [SEP] I try to use plastic wrap as little as possible, but sometimes it’s just the best option. This makes me feel better knowing it’s compostable. It’s very clingy and provides an excellent seal. [SEP] i wrote a so-so review. they pay attention! saw it and are in the process of redesigning their boxes! thats amazing! they really do care, and they are trying hard to make amazing biodegradable products for all of us. for this world! pls give them a try, if you dont like something let them know. they actually do care!PLEASE give this company and their for sale items a try! they are wonderful. they care 100% about this planet, and work hard to sell very good products that work, and ones that are good for this world. PLEASE help this small, new company succeed! they are all amazing! [SEP] I like the idea of using a wrap that is environmentally friendly. A bit on the expensive side for plastic wraps, but it's worth the investment considering the world needs more of this! Work well, very standard! [SEP] The package is simple. (I like the idea of simplicity and being eco-friendly)<br /><br />The cling wrap has a good quality, similar to those I purchased from the supermarket. I used it to wrap the not finished dish and food. The wrap worked perfect.<br /><br />It took me a while to figure out how to use the slide cutter (included in the package). It turned out the slide cutter I received is not the same as shown in the product figure in Amazon. The slide cutter I received has a glue strip in the back, so I attached to the box holding the cling wrap. The cutter worked okay.<br /><br />I like the wrap is biodegradable. We should protect our earth together! [SEP] Ran out of the normal stuff and thought I'd give this a try.  Can't tell you how Eco friendly it will be since I probably won't wait around for it to decompose.  Maybe I'll test it in my neighbors compost.  As for the rest of the review, it works like normal cling wrap.  Sticks to itself and nothing else, ha ha, Comes in a nice recycled box and works like normal.  Just the weird cutter is an issue.  It's supposed to be Eco friendly but it comes with a attachable slide cutter made of plastic.  Huh?  Why not just use the tried and true aluminum cutter.  That's more Eco friendly than plastic.  Just my thoughts.  Enjoy. [SEP] We went all-compostable on our disposable goods for a recent event, including this product which we used to cover left-overs. The film is strong, just like the non-compostable kind. You have to find the little plastic sliding cuter and attach it to the box, which worked well. It's no more challenging to use than any other kind of film. I'll be buying more of this.",3,True
Inno Supps Natural Vegan BCAAs + EAA,[],[],,4.2,69,5785,"I like that these BCAAs are vegan, flavored and contain glutamine. The apple is pretty good. It dissolves good enough to not leave chunks or blobs of powder, but it doesn't turn sheer. In total, these are pretty good, not perfect, but I've had much worse. I do think drinking this helps with my workouts and muscle building and healing. [SEP] This is a good post-workout (or, for me, often a mid-workout formula). It contains branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) that are vegan, which isn't a big concern for me, but if you are concerned about that, then that's a plus. It also contains glutamine, and all the essential amino acids. Adding EAAs not only has been shown to help build muscle mass, but can help vegans get a more balanced amino acid profile.<br /><br />The flavor is really good too! Even though I'm not vegan, this is a formula that anyone can appreciate and use. [SEP] I like this sour apple bcaa blend because it's easy to mix in any drink and has a really sweet flavor that I really enjoyed. I like to take BCAAs because I believe that they my body achieve quicker recoveries after workouts. [SEP] Good tasting much needed bcaa, and it’s vegan which is a plus. It taste good and it’s even better with ice. Definitely recommend it [SEP] The flavor isn’t terrible, hint of the sour apple. I can drink it so I’m happy about that. I’ll have to do some additional research on a few of the ingredients but the part I’m happy with is it being lab tested. Wonder if they would provide the lab results...anyhoo... my husband keeps telling me I need to add BCAA to my diet because I’m super sore after my workouts and I’ve looked at many before ordering this one so I hope it helps! Will post an update after I use it for a while as I just received it. [SEP] This powder mixes well into water and is good for hydrating either before, during or post workout.  It is vegan and has BCAAs, which are branched-chain amino acids. They they can't be produced by your body and must be obtained from food. BCAA supplements have been shown to build muscle, decrease muscle fatigue and alleviate muscle soreness.  The flavor is okay too, not too sweet, I like the sour flavor. [SEP] One of the best tasting BCAAs out there. Quality ingredients, vegan and gets the job done. I always feel hydrated and energized when drinking during my workouts [SEP] I haven't used a lot of BCAA to have some comparison to but I'm glad I was introduced to it with this! It's a good starting point, the taste is great, easy to consume, and mix with water. There's a scooper in the container. I drink this right before a workout and it helps with recovery. Also it prevents fatigue to push further than my normal workout routine. It's great and it's something that is now part of my exercise regimen. [SEP] I've tried a lot of different aminos and I really enjoy the sour apple flavor of these ones! It's tasty and I look forward to drinking these during and after my work out!<br /><br />The powder dissolves fairly quickly and easily. I tend to dissolve it in warm temp water and then just add lots of ice to make sure it all dissolves.<br /><br />Personally I find that the scoop of these is a LOT for me. I usually use like half or 2/3 of a scoop just because it's a lot of powder for me for one drink. To me just a little less of the aminos is still really helpful and a great amount of flavor. Plus then the jar goes a longer way. Hope that helps! [SEP] The flavor is okay- not terrible. Wish it was a little sweeter. But it does have an apple taste. Blends in a shaker bottle  easy and goes down smooth. Can drink this anytime in the day.",3,True
"Hangsun Portable Water Flosser Oral Irrigator 360° Rotation 5 Pressure Levels 450ML Travel Water Teeth Cleaner HOC850 IPX7 Waterproof for Braces Care, 2 Modes for Clean and Massage",[],[],,3.6,37,560,"In short: open reservoir cup makes it easy to add water, keep clean, and to allow dry between uses. Can adjust strength. Slim design makes it easy to maneuver around mouth. Takes up little room. Can be packed up for on the go use. Loud, but similar to my corded tank style.<br /><br />I use water flossers all the time. The best (to me) is a particular name brand that has a tank, and is plugged in. I keep that in my main bathroom that has a plug nearby. Since I rely greatly on water flossing, I wanted to have one in my 1st floor bathroom, which is like the size of a closet, and has no counter, and no plugs. So, I have been tried cordless flossers for use in that bathroom.<br /><br />Here is the thing I find with most of them: the water reservoirs are bulky and are hard to clean. I dont care that they dont hold much water. That is easy enough to deal with, but to have an enclosed cup that really can ever be cleaned out? gross. Then I tried one where there [[ASIN:B09L1H1G31 is no reservoir cup just a hose to put in any sized cup]], and that works really well for my needs. That one wins out over this due to one aspect- it is fully cordless. When I saw this Hangsun water flosser I decided to try it--it has appearance of regular plug in, but an open water top that makes me feel better about it drying between uses. I didnt need another flosser, but I wanted to find out more about it and report back in a review.<br /><br />SO, this may be for you if you are (like me) in wanting a CORDLESS* flosser with an open water reservoir. I can easily add more water to it, it is easy to clean, and it dries between uses. Charge has been long lasting, so I like that I dont need to fuss. It is nice for use in no-plug areas. While cordless, I still feel attached, as I need to set the base down. Doubt I would use this in shower. With my other one, I may need to supply my own cup for water, but it can be any size, and I can use it in shower just by cupping my hand.<br /><br />Kinda loud-- similar to my plug in name brand one.<br /><br />I tend to only ever use one head- the slightly curved one. Havent tried the other options, and likely wont.<br /><br />Of the half dozen cordless flossers I have tried (including a name brand cordless), I like this one, and the one I linked to the best. I use them secondary to my plug in. [SEP] I'm willing to admit that part of my complaints may very well be user error. I've never used a water flosser thing before, so it was weird to try this out. It is very messy as the water sprays everywhere, though again it might just be me.<br />It is also kind of loud. Though, again, I don't know if that's different with this versus other ones. I also didn't feel like it was effective. It didn't really remove plaque/build up, but maybe if the setting was high enough it would work. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:73b3d7c2b2a55b088dc3994a5e357ebb]] What I liked about the HANGSUN cordless water flosser is the stylish and sturdy design and it’s easy to use and easy to setup and it’s compact and the storage case is a plus it flosses your teeth very well it’s a good value for your money and it makes a great gift and it’s a good addition to your oral hygiene care [SEP] The idea behind this is great, it works well and is nice to have on hand. It is a bit large for fitting in a traditional toiletry bag when traveling but can easily fit into your other luggage. [SEP] Gets in the hard to reach places [SEP] this is loud but also it does the job. [SEP] I have been using this flosser for a few days now and so far i like it, it's small and function like a flosser should, also flosser is rechargeable and it is usb rechargeable.<br /><br />The small size it is good for travel and it also comes with a carrying pouch and thinking to bring it with me on my next vacation trip :)<br /><br />Device is a little loud and i think the price is a bit high for a small flosser. Other than that everything works good and it works and function like a flosser should. [SEP] This works well. Use it over a sink, cause all the water squirting out needs to go somewhere after it cleans your teeth and gums. This is rechargeable via USB cable. So, no need to keep it plugged in. It has a lot of power and blasts out the water with good force which helps clean teeth and provides a nice gum massage too. Helps stimulate blood for healthy gums. Good product [SEP] So, I’m really torn on this product bc I love that it’s cordless, but the size of the water tank is small for my needs. I have a bigger set (different brand) with a cord and the tank is probably triple the size and that barely last long enough to clean my teeth as well as I like them to be.<br /><br />If you are limited on space, I would go with this product bc of cordless and the design being smaller, but the price is still a bit more than I would usually expect to pay for something this size.<br /><br />Size aside, the functionality works great [SEP] When this arrived it was much smaller than I expected however, that could have been a plus for traveling.  That did not turn out to be the case; after installing the handle to the base unit, it would not release.  I had to twist the handle with pilers to get it loose.<br /><br />The water pressure on this unit is fine, but it does not come with the rubber tipped nozzle that I usually prefer to use on my Waterpik.  Another issue was how little water the reservoir held - I was constantly refilling the reservoir while I flossed.  However, I found it very advantageous and convenient that this was a cordless flosser, since I didn't need to look for an outlet.  This flosser is quiet and it was no louder than other water flossing machines I owned.  For now, I think I will stick with my WP-72.",3,True
"Aggressive Labz Behemoth Creatine Power Plexx - Seven Elite Forms of Creatine - Promotes Power, Strength, Size and Explosiveness - 60 Day Supply - Lions Blood Flavor",[],[],,4.5,29,3364,"I purchased this for my husband as he was looking to try a new creatine. He’s been taking it daily and has so far seen some pretty decent results. The taste is good, dissolves fairly well in water (which often times is a challenge with creatine in general). Overall it’s a little early to really tell how well this is working out, but it seems to be just fine. I’ll update the review with more info once more time has passed from taking it! [SEP] I’ve been using Creatinine from its inception, when it was Crazy expensive and the next best thing since sliced bread, so to speak.😁 I know it’s helped me but, I don’t think I’ve had one that actually has 7 different forms of it as this does. It’s too knew to state any serious differences but, I can say that I do feel energy from it and I definitely tastes better than plain Creatine.<br />  It also includes what they call a “Rapid Cell Drive Matrix”, that looks to have some great ingredients that help the blood flow to the muscles and to be absorbed better. I’m happy I tried it.<br />  The only thing I would change is for their Testing and Manufacturing Practices to be listed so I can know all I can about what I’m taking. [SEP] I was really excited to try this especially after the hype of what they offer I couldn’t wait to give it a shot. I’m 56 I train hard I have been since I was 15 I want to give this an honest review before people shell out over 40 bucks. I am not at all new at the bodybuilding supplements game so I do know what I’m talking about so here it goes.  I will say the flavor is good goes down real smooth. Now there is 60 servings in this and they say over 250lbs take 2 servings a day thats 15 days for over 40 dollars for guys like me. Ok This does work gives you the extra reps but it doesn’t give you the energy like the pre workout with creatine does I am a freak for the nitric oxide that a lot of companies incorporate in their product but this has none at least that I can tell. To me they over hype their product especially with the name “Lions blood” flavor and that I laughed at especially when it mixed up clear with a hint of red maybe closer to pink, they also claim all these different types of Creatine, ingenious but don’t fall for that marketing strategy. I would not recommend this mostly because of the price for 15 servings for guys over 250lbs and it doesn’t do anything more than the 200 servings of German Creatine for half the price. Again this is my opinion if you have the cash to shell out go for it but there are much better products on the market. [SEP] Works well has a nice flavor and provides decent results. Been using for a couple weeks and very impressed with the results. [SEP] The flavor. OK thats a hard one. One time last week I came in after working outside for many hours in the direct sunlight, dead dog tired, beat down, and exhausted. I grabbed this container, and dropped a scoop in my cup of filtered well water. It was nasty. I could hardly drink it. YET RIGHT NOW IM DRINKING IT AND LOVING IT... so maybe Im messed up in the head? Ok another sip.. downed the glass. No. I was right the other times. I really dont care for the stuff. But honestly, im not the typical person. I pull 14 hour days and I feel at times like I could pass out. I work a lot in heat, sunlight, hot attics, on black plastic at the organic farm. You name it. I do physical work. At the end of the day Id drink (well i wont say that word I was thinking) but lets say I dont care what it tastes like as long as it puts those nutrients back in my system FAST and as long as I can recover. It must be nice having a posh life in the AC.  I dont have that option. So does this stuff work? ABSOLUTELY. Every single time Ive drank it I was exhausted and on the verge of a heat stroke, and every single time it hit the spot. It could taste like fecal matter for all I care. I love the stuff because it WORKS. Take that however you want. Taste wise Im giving it one star. Understand too, I rarely ever say something tastes bad. I grow Carolina Reeper chiles, I love cough syrup. I love licorice. I LOVED Beverly soda at Club cool when everyone else spit it out. Im NOT picky. i just dont like this, which is really weird for me. Again i rarely ever say that. Its not bad enough that i wont drink it though. I just dont really LIKE it. Not saying i hate it. I drink it fast and it makes me feel better. It relaxes me. I feel refreshed. I know this isnt my usual review but they want honest, and thats what I gave you guys.<br />Hope it helps. Would I buy it? Let me put it another way. Id buy the same product in a different flavor!!! ABSOLUTELY!!! I just wouldnt buy THIS flavor again. But Id buy it for the benefits positively. [SEP] I was always under the belief that creative monohydrate was the best and most effective creatine available, in fact, until this supplement, I had not ever seen other forms of creatine.  I figured I’d give it a try to see if I noticed a difference.<br />The first thing I noticed was how well this mixes.  I mixed it with about 12 oz water and it fully dissolved within 20 or so seconds.  The flavor, “Lions Blood”, actually tastes good and was easy to drink.<br />After about 3 weeks of usage, I decided that I could not determine any noticeable difference between this and plain creatine monohydrate.<br />My one complaint here is the price.  Creatine is generally inexpensive, however, this is just under $40 for a 60 day supply, which is simply too much. [SEP] So far so good. Other brands of creatine gave me upset stomach symptoms but this blend so far has not given me any issues. Tastes good in plain water and mixes easily. [SEP] I only recently started adding creatine into my routine.  I am enjoying this one.  I enjoy the flavor and it mixes easily with just water and ice.  I do only use this a few times a week as I do seem to wake up feeling a little more water retention. [SEP] Good for price [SEP] This creatine supplement arrived in a double sealed container. I was easily able to find the scoop at the top of the container. With a flavor named ""Lion's Blood"" I was expecting the taste to either be really bad or be somewhat close to blood orange flavor. I used 24oz of water instead of the 8oz suggested and the taste is actually pretty good. It has a light orange taste (because it is watered down from adding more water). There are no extra unnecessary ingredients and no ""proprietary blends"" in the powder. There is a higher than average amount of creatine in this powder which is reflected in the additional warnings on the label regarding its use. This supplement is targeted toward the serious athlete or body builder and not the casual gym user. I would recommend this supplement for those that need the additional creatine for their sport but it's probably an excessive amount of creatine for the average person. I would recommend this supplement for its intended audience.",3,True

I guess it is OK. I feel a little smarter. I will let you know how it goes. Thank you for reading my review I hope it was beneficial to you. God bless you and yours. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  OZ [SEP] Recommended 3 caps daily dose delivers noticeable results. BrainiLex is a high-end compounding using proprietary and patented ingredients that have shown interesting clinical results.<br /><br />An issue is fishy burps and after taste. It's potent. I found that pairing BrainiLex with Ceylon cinnamon supplement reduces the after-effects.<br /><br />Surprisingly good. Better than expected. [SEP] I've tried this supplement in capsule and in powder form.  I think I like the capsule form better because the powder tastes kind of fishy and has no sweet (but it's not bitter either).  These capsules cost $119.95 as of this review and the powder is about ten dollars more.  Both are a one month supply.  However, 3 capsules/day is the recommended dosage and I'm not fond of swallowing pills.  I really wish I could say, ""Wow! This has dramatically improved my cognitive abilities"" but I can't.  I think I'm the wrong person to test it out since my cognitive abilities are already pretty darn good.  But, I've only been taking it as directed for a little over two weeks and these things often take more time than that.  The directions on the side of the powder container say to take a cognitive test before starting and then after 30 days take another one to see how well your cognitive skills have improved.  I don't have that much time to wait before I can write a review.  I will say that it doesn't make me sick to my stomach or gives me any unwanted side effects at all. [SEP] I completed the full bottle of pills and my conclusion is that this product did nothing. I consider myself a biohacker and I am in tune with how my body responds. Perhaps the effect is masked by all the other supplements and peptides I take. I tried to isolate the effect from my other supplements and energy drinks. I tried taking more than the recommended dose, taking it spread throughout the day, taking it in the evening, in addition to recommended three pills at once.<br /><br />If this supplement does anything, it is too subtle for me to notice. Some supplements and medications take time to build up before their effect becomes noticeable, but I did not notice anything from this at any time during the month. I was hoping this would work since the company seems well-intentioned with a belief that what they are selling works.<br /><br />This is clearly not a stimulant. Anything that is a stimulant is more immediately effective than this product.<br /><br />The clinical trials are meaningless if they used a placebo as a comparison. They should be comparing competing products, such as caffeine, Adderall, Ritalin, and Modafinil. All of these competing drugs are less expensive than this supplement, excluding the cost of the doctor's visit to get the prescription. The real challenge for supplements like these is how it stacks up against caffeine, or a Monster Energy Drink, not a sugar pill.<br /><br />People that are avoiding stimulants are not going to eat cocoons either. Products like this target the fringe of biohackers, who already take numerous other supplements and are not nutrient deficient in anything. The target audience is different from a clinical trial group.<br /><br />The main compound adding to the cost is the peptide. For brain-enhancing peptides, Semax and Cerebrolysin are established, proven, and scientifically validated peptides, and both work great in me and have noticeable effects. I am not sure what cocoon peptide is supposed to do and the Web site of the vendor does not mention how it works. What is the mechanism of action? The other peptides I mentioned increase BDNF levels and are less expensive than this product.<br /><br />I am a man in my 40s and I have tried a large number of supplements, nootropics, medications, and peptides to help increase productivity, focus, and mental performance.<br /><br />The money-back-guarantee helps for a product like this, but it seems like you will need to take a test at the start of the 30 days to activate the offer. [SEP] Based on some research, this supplement may work, over time, to increase mental stamina and clarity. The main ingredient is an extract of the cocoons of a type of moth! I am not going to lie, that is kind of wild, and I have taken almost every supplement under the sun. There is, however, some evidence it works. I personally haven't felt anything, but then again, I am already taking quite a few brain-enhancing supplements and my memory is already very sharp.<br /><br />However, the price is really high, probably because we are dealing with something as time-consuming as collecting moth cocoons to get the main ingredient. If you want to give it a go, it may work, but the price is prohibitive in my opinion. Nonetheless, it's a pretty fascinating supplement. [SEP] I thought after using this for a week after finishing the regular Braini formula that I was on to something really great. I really thought this would be a better solution for me.<br /><br />Compared to the regular formula, this is three capsules instead of two capsules per serving. If you look quickly you may not notice this major difference and how it contributes to an obviously higher amount of each ingredient in the formula (925 mg vs 700 mg)<br /><br />Further, this adds Omega-3 DHA and Zinc to the formula. I am not sure which of these factors led to it working better for me, but I would probably be safe to assume it was the overall serving size versus what I was seeing with the original formula.<br /><br />All said, this had a decent impact on my focus the first couple of weeks of use. After a month, however, I wasn't able to notice anything compared to if I missed a day. I tried this by using it five days a week and taking two off. Sure, there are always traces of supplements that remain for ""off days"", but I got to a point where I didn't feel too much different. That has been magnified in the time since I emptied the bottle. I really want to think that these ingredients, unique that they are, could be more beneficial than they are.<br /><br />Is it worth a shot? Absolutely. Their brain test and money back guarantee is pretty interesting. If you are so inclined, I think it's worth trying this out. Otherwise, there are many other proven ingredients that you could either take individually or combine into your own stack for goals trying to be reached with BrainiLex. [SEP] At the moment I'm taking one of Braini's powder forms<br />that the ingredients are the same - but higher potency - 2.3 gram per scoop.<br /><br />It's too soon to know about it's effectiveness, but I'm looking forward to finishing it<br />to get to these capsules. I don't like the taste / after taste of the powder.<br />HOWEVER - it wouldn't be noticed in smoothies, but I don't make one everyday.<br /><br />THIS Braini's proprietary blend of 925mg includes -<br />> Peptylin (pure silk protein peptides from silk moth cocoon fibers)<br />> Neurxcel (plant-based omegas 3-6-9)<br />> Wild Canadian Blueberry fruit powder (natural antioxidants)<br />they say it's designed to have both short and long term cognitive function benefits.<br />>>> Plus vegetarian -100mg  Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) from algae oil.<br />> Zinc Glycinate - 5 mg<br /><br />First thing is suggested to go to there website and take a brain power test.<br />There's a card included in the box with a code to enter.<br />> Find a quite place with no interruptions for 15-20 minutes.<br />> Find the Brain Power test link in your emails.<br />Take the first test. > Start taking Braini > 30 days later you'll receive the next Braini power test.<br /><br />The capsules are 3 daily, bottle = 30 servings.<br />Comes in a cobalt blue glass bottle for preserving the integrity of the product.<br />What I received has an best date January 2022.<br /><br />Braini is stimulant free - natural ingredients.<br />It's a pretty standard size vegetable cellulose capsule 3/4"" long.<br /><br />Gluten free - NON dairy - Caffeine free. [SEP] i recently started a new role at the same company - with that comes a lot of still doing the old while jumping into the new.  i decided to give these a try to see if they would help me through that ... unfortunately 2 weeks in, my body decided that it wouldnt be a thing.  i have hard time explaining what exactly happened but i can just say when i attempted to swallow these one morning - i was unable to - my body, not me, said no thanks.<br /><br />speculating here - but i am pretty sure it's the smell / taste that did it.  the recommended dosage is 3 pills - and they have an extremely heavy odor - they don't have a lingering taste or comes up later taste - so it's a little bizarre to me.<br /><br />either way - i was unable to finish the bottle.  perhaps my body just decided i am plenty brain perfect as i am. [SEP] The BrainiLex Brain Supplement over the last few months provided some benefit in mental fogginess in the morning, and sometimes I thought it helped me focus better. Still, I somewhat question its effectiveness versus the cost of the product. While I am not an expert in the formulation of supplements and such, it's hard to determine the efficacy of brand-name formulated products due to the lack of third-party research. While I thought I had noticed some sort of difference when I took this product compared to not, it's hard for me to know whether this is placebo or legit. While I would like to know more about the studies done into this supplement, I know I probably wouldn't be able to purchase this again due to its high cost of $119 for a 90-day supply. Overall I thought it was somewhat effective, but I'm not exactly sure. [SEP] I liked the ingredients listed. I like that the bottle includes the exact amount of capsules required for a month supply. Due to the pandemic, this pill is perfect to help you keep focus when working.",3,True
"Dr Amy Myers Beef Bone Broth Collagen Powder - Type II Collagen Protein Powder from Organic Beef Bone Broth - Supports Hair, Skin, Nails, Bones & Joints Health - Keto Friendly, 20 Servings",[],[],,4.2,54,706,"We’ve been eating a lot of one dish meals lately - stews and soups - and it is so easy to just add this to the gravy or sauce as it’s cooking.  Haven’t been using it long enough to report spectacular results - but it makes sense to add collagen when you can, since we lack it as we age.  The bone broth just adds more flavor to our dishes, so we have every reason to continue with this healthy practice.  Good quality product - no negative effects. [SEP] This broth is not going to be salty or flavorful enough for most people.<br />Mixing a scoop into any big bowl of soup, however, adds a boost of healthy benefits.<br />An added plus is that many ingredients are organic, such as the spices and flavor.<br />Making my own bone broth is a process that takes forever. And every minute of that process means that my dogs are whining because they know something good is cooking! It's easier on everyone, when you can just take a scoop and mix it into hot water or soup.<br />I'm in my sixties, and always get comments on how youthful my skin looks for my age. Part of it is the serums and moisturizers, but a big part of it is taking collagen. Prior to using this, I used the Amy Myers MD chicken broth. I'm more than satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of both. [SEP] Fine quality! Tasty broth. If you have been consuming bone broth, the price and the quality do correlate. This is top-shelf.<br /><br />Much better than  expected [SEP] The absolute best bone broth is that which you make yourself using cracked bones and boiling them for several hours.  Drain and filter and freeze what you don't use right away.  However, that is time consuming and messy.  Though I know I get the best quality bone broth by making it myself, a powder is so nice and easy.  I've added this powder it to soup stock and into my meatloaf recipe.  It's savory and not sweet or chocolate flavored (a lot of them are and I really get tired of chocolate everything) and can be added to a lot of dishes or drunk as is mixed with hot water.  It tastes fine and though it's kind of pricey, you get a big container of it. [SEP] Although this is bone broth for humans, I mainly got this to sprinkle over my dog's kibble. Bone broth is SO good for both us and our furry little loved ones. The sodium is fairly low, one scoop has 95 mg. So with the small amount my two dogs get each day, it's probably only around 10 mg each.<br /><br />I pour the kibble in their bowls, with this powder on top, then I put a little water over top of that. And of course they LOVE it. I also got some mushroom powder for my dogs, which is a bit bitter. But mixed with this bone broth powder, they lap it up like they haven't eaten in years! They've been on this for about a week now, and I've noticed that their poo looks a lot better (I won't get too much into that, lol!).<br /><br />Ok, all that being said, my husband really likes it too. I put it in soups, gravies, etc, and it boosts flavors like bullion, but better. And without so much sodium. It is a little pricey, but it seems like it will go a really long way.<br />All in all, my experience so far with this has been great. [SEP] This is definitely not a cheap one financially, but I can tout it as a great Bone Broth that’s so good for my aching Bones and Joints. It’s also a major benefit for Hair, Skin and Nails too. This actually directs to heat it up and sip it like a cup of soup and I’d say that’s about the best way to do it.<br />  I’d definitely recommend it and I hope you enjoy its benefits as much as I do. [SEP] It really doesn't have much flavor, mostly tastes like warm water.<br />with a very light beef flavor which is different than I'm used to having beef taste like.<br />Having said that = I've not tried bone broth before now.<br /><br />The directions don't say how many oz of water to mix a scoop with so I used 8oz.<br />This instantly mixes well. The dark specs in the photos are parsley flakes.<br />When you get to the bottom of the cup, there may be some very small pepper corns.<br /><br />But I was disappointment with such little beef flavor that I added<br />1/8 teaspoon of each = Better Than Bullion = beef base & vegetable base.<br />That made it more to my liking, and quite tasty.<br />The instructions mention you may want to add some flavor to taste.<br /><br />Our daughter makes it from scratch, and says how she adds lots of herbs / onions / garlic etc<br />then simmers it in the slow cooker for 80 hrs. (Eighty hours)<br />Drains out all the added vegetables for a very tasty and extremely healthy broth.<br />Being as I'm never gonna do that = I wanted to try Dr Myers beef broth.<br /><br />This appears to be a high quality broth with the same sort of ingredients<br />as our daughter makes.<br /><br />> All organic ingredients - beef flavor - sea salt - black pepper -<br />dried parsley flakes - onion & garlic powder.<br /><br />This is naturally type II collagen, supports healthy hair - skin - nails.<br />Don't think I've seen as many certification badges on a product before now = 10.<br /><br />> Gluten free - NON dairy - NON GMO - AIP friendly - medically formulated - GMP -<br />soy free - grass fed - paleo (diet) - keto.<br />The container is just over 1 lb = 20 servings [SEP] I'm not a huge fan of sweet collagen drinks/mixes, so this is an interesting alternative.  It's pretty good, and makes me think of a less salty beef ramen broth. I mean this in a good way.  It's convenient to have a soup flavored collagen, and I've been adding it to soups and stews as both a flavor and protein boost.  I don't think this is the best value when compared to plain collagen and beef bullion, but it is handy. [SEP] Lacking in flavor so I had to spice it up. I’m not a fan… [SEP] Not a fan of the flavor!",3,True

Getting ready to renovate but until then bought this to help with smell and toxins.  After about 3 days the smell was completely gone.  Amazing.  Quiet little fan which is not annoying. [SEP] This GERMGUARDIAN GG1000 PLUGGABLE UV-C SANITIZER AND DEODORIZER seems to be a “designer” model of the [[ASIN:B00OLBR0LG rectangular pluggable GermGuardian]] that I’ve used successfully for a couple of years.  The pluggable Guardian air purifiers do remove most of the kitchen cooking odors (tiny grease globules in particular) that escape the “air guard” feature on my oven.<br /><br />This “shapely” air purifier runs more quietly than my rectangular version, though motor noise may be determined by the motor in individual devices.  (The motor was louder in my second rectangular device than it was in the first.)  The fans run constantly in these air purifiers, but they don’t seem to require a lot of electricity.<br /><br />The air purifier will operate in the up, down, or sideways position, so you don’t need to be concerned about the orientation of your household electrical outlets.  The purifier plug does NOT have a third prong for grounding, though it has wide and narrow prongs like most modern safety plugs.  The purifier covers only one outlet in a two-plug wall outlet, so the second outlet remains available for general use.<br /><br />My first pluggable GermGuardian lasted well beyond the one-year warranty period.  These little air purifiers don’t seem to require maintenance beyond replacing the UV bulb when it burns out (the blue light on the purifier will go out).  The bulbs are easy to replace, but you should NEVER look directly at a plugged-in UV bulb (with the purifier cover open), because this can permanently damage your eyes. [SEP] This air freshener is perfect for a room we have a bunny rabbit in! It takes all the smell away! Great product for the money! [SEP] My husband has pollen sensitivity.  We put this on his side of the bed and he can definitely tell the difference in the air quality. [SEP] This does wonders for its size! My bf and I both have extremely bad allergies, especially during season changes. This helped us to get amazing sleep without stuffed noses ever since I got it! It takes about a day to sanitize the air (I have it in an 15x10 room), ALSO my guinea pigs were have allergy problems but after about a week of having this in my room (the guinea pigs cage is in myroom) their allergies cleared up and saved me from a huge pricey vet bill! I'll be buying another soon for my cat room! [SEP] A little disappointed. I have another air purifier by the manufacturer and it works great so I thought this would be perfect for the laundry/litter box room. It was great for size and didn’t scare the kittens. But it didn’t do much for the odor. [SEP] Since I plugged this in a week ago, and my litter box cleaning days have not changed, I am having no odor at all  - revealing the existence of a cat in my house.  It makes almost no noise and the only indication that it is on is a soft blue light and a slight breeze.  I can’t attest to it creating a germless environment - how do you test that -  but just for the odor management, this is worth the price.  We are in the midst of allergy season, and I haven’t experienced  any lessening of symptoms, so it may not be much help with allergies.  If you have a cat or dog though, this is a winner! [SEP] It's working so far :-) I purchased one a while ago ( I think about 5 months ago ) and plug it in not far from litter box . It works , maybe not whisper quiet ( I can hear it working , not too loud but identifiable :-) , so I bought second one for my bathroom . [SEP] How much do I like this?  I have two big, oily, elderly Labradors and they sleep in my room.  Although I am immune to the doggie smell, others are not and had commented on it.  I run this in my room all day, turn off at night.  It rendered my room doggie-smell free.<br /><br />I'm buying another for the kitchen.  If it works as well there I'll try in the camper, too. [SEP] My brother has allergies and has had problems at our house before; we plugged this in his room and not only did he have no problems, he slept like a log.  The unit gives off a slight white noise; it also has a blue light that is a little too much for me but can be blocked, I guess.

It has different heating options and it’s really easy to use, at first I felt uncomfortable about putting something hot by my eyes but now I realize that was silly. This is going to a main makeup bag where all the favs are. [SEP] This product works. But it basically bends the lash at the base. It works best when you use a curler to give your lash a curl in the middle then lift with this heated eyelash curler.  It definitely gives lift but it doesn't curl the lash. I think a better name is Heated Eyelash Lifter.  I still gave 4 stars because I do love it and use it but in my opinion you still need an old fashion curler.  The lift lasts a long time too.  Maybe not quite all day but pretty much. The good thing about it is you can bring this along and re-lift during the day if needed. [SEP] I don't like this product. It doesn't curl lashes as claimed.<br />I would not recommend to anyone. [SEP] It did curl naturally my Asian eyelashes, but I have to use high temperature settings 85/95 degree.

What is smells like is an overly powdery old lady perfume. It sort of covered bathroom smells but not as well as other brands I have tried.<br /><br />That said this same company makes another scent called ""seasalt"" that oddly enough smells nothing like saltwater but is a softer fruitier smell that works extremely well. So while I cannot recommend ""pear"" I do think the brand does make some versions that in fact do a spectacular job. [SEP] I'm not impressed with this toilet spray. The scent is quite modest, and it requires several sprays to produce any appreciable scent. The scent is has is more of a floral/chemical type of scent than pear. In fact, if I didn't know it was a pear scent I would have not guessed it from how it smells.<br /><br />It does have some benefit as an odor preventer in the bathroom. The spray is used before the toilet is used, creating a film type of barrier to minimize odor. It does have some effectiveness in that regard, but other similar products I've used have far more scent to them (and a more pleasant scent as well).<br /><br />Since it does provide some benefits, I'll give it 2 stars. It is not, however, a toilet spray I would recommend. [SEP] Smells amazing. [SEP] These work great, far better than I expected and their entire line is fantastic!!  Floral-scented and definitely disguises/purifies the air.  It's top-notch and this has become my new favorite spray!!!!!  The size makes it very portable as well. [SEP] I could smell this right out of the package. In fact my hand smelled like it for a while. I think the bottle leaked slightly as the pump looked wet but the box was dry. I shook the bottle and sprayed it twice into the toilet. I couldn't really smell the scent at that point. I've tried this with formed stools which don't really smell in first place. Then I tried it with soft stool/ diarrhea and it masked the smell but not completely. Maybe if I sprayed more into the toilet it would've completely masked the smell but I didn't want to go through the whole bottle so quickly. Overall I think it works for the most part. [SEP] When I first saw this article I only saw the pear name and was expecting the fruit but is a flower scent. no issues with that and still has a nice smell and does a great job eliminating bathroom bad odor. when your going to use the toilet spray this before sitting 2 times in the water and you will see how this helps. nice when your going out and need to use a bathroom in someones house. sprayer is nice and does not leak.

This also charge is using a USB port which is very convenient. This comes with a charging cord but not a USB port. Overall, I like this product and I would recommend it. See my pictures and video for more details. [SEP] I saw a Facebook ad for one of these and ran to Amazon to order one when I first saw it. This is my second one and really is a nice, convenient version. I like that it recharges easily and uses a USB C charger, which I seem to have everywhere throughout my house so I don't have to worry about losing the charger for this one. As another reviewer mentioned, the temperature is in Celsius, but I just care that it's hot, so that didn't bother me.<br /><br />The problem for me is, I have thin, shorter, old lady lashes. And I just think heated eyelash curlers don't do as much for us as they do the younger set. That's been my experience anyway. While I like the idea, and might try it with fake lashes, it didn't seem to lift my eyelashes as much as I would have liked (or as much as my trusty Shu Umera version already does) even when I used it AFTER applying mascara, so it's not something I'll use often unfortunately. [SEP] This is one of the coolest things I've ever used. I had no idea this even existed until my cousin told me. She's an esthetician and uses this herself. Thought I'd give it a go. I have long eyelashes, but they don't always stay curled upward as much as I'd like. I rub my eyes a lot from allergies and it messes them up. I used this without mascara and it was so awesome! My lashes curled with such ease and stayed that way even without a mascara. I'm going to keep using every day and see how they stay, but so far so good for four days in a row! [SEP] Great little thing! I have short eyelashes so this makes a world of a difference. [SEP] Having multiple levels of heat is very helpful and works for everyone. We all have different lashes and different needs. After my accident my lashes were thicker on one side than the other. Because heat settings vary I can use different settings on separate eyes. I love it and use it every day. [SEP] Does not turn on...does not function. [SEP] Very easy to use [SEP] The curler is easy to use but I didnt feel like it made a huge difference. In the photo I showed one eye curled with mascara and the other with nothing and no curl. I did not do it the way the instructions said (which was mascara and than curl) because I read somewhere else that you can damage your eyelashes if you use mascara before the curler. This may be why my results weren't great however I don't want to damage my eyelashes. [SEP] I've always wanted to test out the electric eyelash curler. It actually worked for curling my eyelashes. It heats up well without harming my eyelashes or eyelids. The eyelashes keep its structure for a long period of time. It is safe to use with mascara on before you hate your eyelashes. Always make sure your mascara is dried before you curl those lashes. It is so convenient that I can take it everywhere with me. It is simple and easy to use when you get the hang of it. I highly recommend. [SEP] I liked the eyelash curler and was very easy to use.  Thank You.",3,True

I don't think you would want to replace your permanent shaving solution with this, but good for quick brush up or travel.  Would recommend as a backup or travel shaver.

It also includes a 4-piece stainless steel skin kit with storage box, power cable, instruction and support contact manual.<br /><br />This elegant looking nano ionic steamer looks awesome and effectively works at such a great value too! Based on the design, performance and the cost of $25.00, I totally recommend this Kingstream steamer! [SEP] I wouldn’t recommend mines broke after a month. It started to pop like it was going to catch on fire. [SEP] I really love the way this works. It is very effective, giving a great amount of steam....and it is easy to use. I am so happy with the design of this device. I looked for a steamer but hated the look and color of the others. This one is perfect! [SEP] My daughter says it’s amazing, just wish it held more water. [SEP] I don't see anything special about this facial steamer. Whatever ""Nano"" is, there is no difference compared to a regular steamer running side by side [SEP] This is great for steaming your face for congestion or a facial [SEP] I like the design appearance of this facial steamer. I feel it has a modern, professional appearance. And, it functions as well as it looks.<br />The company states that many technological improvements/advancements are implemented into the internal machinations of the steamer. For the end use, the results may not be as noticeable. I will state that it provide a good misting steam, of comfortable temperature. Further, it seems to maintain a uniform output during the session duration. That’s already a good improvement. Some other facial nano steamers will have fluctuating temperatures (although not in an extreme sense) and occasional sputtering of steam output.  In our initial testing, it was very responsive, providing a quick steam output with a pleasing warmth. They state that is will endeavor to hold a steady 40℃. Without confirmation from a thermometer,  I feel it did keep a consistent warmth throughout the treatment duration.<br />The attractive appearance would fit most decor, especially in a bathroom or bedroom (the significant other will often indulge her home spa experience between the bathroom and bedroom). Attached are photos to show real world images of the device, with a ruler for size reference.<br />Overall, thanks to a very favorable initial experience, it garners a 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",3,True

I've used it for smoothies, but when I realized it doesn't taste awful, I started using it to cook toaster-sized protein pancakes to store in my freezer. [SEP] I am not a vegetarian, but I do use the vegan protein powder, as well as non-vegan. One generally mixes better than the other and there are usually less carbs in the non-vegan. I use them equally and have at least one protein powder serving each day. I typically mix it with my cottage cheese or with raisin bran. I like that this one has stevia in it. I have used stevia for so long that sometimes the one without stevia is too sweet. [SEP] Oh boy if I knew this had stevia I would have never got it.  I wish manufactures would stop sticking stevia in everything.  I absolutely loath the taste of stevia.  Plus it also contains xanthan gum which messes up my GI something terrible.  When I ordered this, there wasn't anything showing the ingredients.  All I knew was it was supposed to be a blend of Vegan proteins.  I now see that there is a +1 in the pictures.  That last picture shows the ingredients.  So disappointed. [SEP] Well, this is the least disgusting flavor of the vegan protein powders by this company (the other flavors being the strawberry and chocolate) but that's not saying much. It tastes more like over ripe bananas than vanilla and it has a gritty texture. It leaves a bitter after taste and a fine layer of silt in your mouth. I have had many many protein shakes over the last 10 years, and I can't say I recommend any of the protein powders that this company makes. When the best you can say about a product is ""it's better than something that is undrinkable"" that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. It comes in a deceptively large jar that is only half full. I'd recommend trying something else and skipping this product all together, but if you must try this particular variety of protein powder for some reason the vanilla is the best, then the chocolate, the strawberry is undrinkable. [SEP] I've used a lot of different sports drinks, and I can confirm that this vanilla flavor is better than most when mixed in the proper proportions.<br /><br />As a protein drink, its very good.  I like the fact that it is plant based, probably because I'm such a carnivore... I need more plant based options.<br /><br />As far as value goes, at this time its $1.25 per serving, and I would like to think that this is based on the fact that it is plant based.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend it as part of a rotation of protein powders.  I don't like to use the same protein powder for months in a row, and this was a good alternative. [SEP] When it comes to protein powder both ingredient and flavor is essential. This does a good job in both categories with one caveat...I'm not crazy about the consistency. In fact, I find it a bit heavy which ultimately makes me less inclined to use it. I know most of these are watery so it sounds absurd to complain about the heavy consistency but it's too much...fortunately it's easy to remedy so still gets high marks.",3,True
"Elaine Wellness Hydrolyzed Collagen Powder Packets for Women, Convenient Single Travel Size Supplement for Skin, Hair, Joints and Nails, Protein Peptides Dissolve Easily, Unflavored (10 Gram, 7 Pack)",[],[],,3.7,43,1579,"Collagen is a part of my daily routine, usually in coffee, since coffee is part of my daily routine.<br />Each packet has 35 calories and 9 g of protein, all from cow collagen peptides.<br />Unflavored, so nothing to interfere or overly sweeten.<br />Pricier than similar collagens, and the serving size is larger than some others as well.<br />Still, these are convenient packets for on the go. The packets are thoughtfully designed, very easy to open. No scissors needed. [SEP] These travel packs only contain collagen from one source - bovine and they are very pricey.  As of this review 7 travel packs of 10 grams each costs nearly $20.00.  I don't think the convenience of having 10 grams of collagen in a pack is worth all the extra money.  I have reviewed a lot of collagen products and the latest one I've reviewed only costs $24.95 for 324 grams.  And it contains collagen from 5 different sources. The ELAINE collagen only contains bovine collagen.  All that said, it mixes in with my hot coffee completely and I couldn't even tell that it was there.  It's totally flavorless and did not clump at all. [SEP] I loved the convenience for travel.  It dissolved beautifully in my morning coffee and had no taste at all.  And I like the fact that it comes from grass fed cows.<br /><br />I've been taking collagen for my fingernails and they are getting stronger.  They continued to get stronger on this collagen but I only used 7 packs so it's hard to say if they helped but it did not hurt.  It's pretty expensive so I might not use it for everyday but for travel the  effectiveness, taste, and convenience might be worth the extra cost. [SEP] Convenient take with you doses of collagen.  It adds no taste to your coffee in the morning. My skin has improved greatly from daily doses of collagen. I have always had fine thin hair. As I have gotten older it was thinning more. I feel like it has thickened up a bit. I was getting skin tears too and that has stopped. I started to see results in about 6 weeks. [SEP] Travel friendly, easy to use and has a good taste [SEP] [[VIDEOID:be0666c6e3b211fdb913538e1d623c9e]] This is actually a good quality collagen supplements. It dissolves pretty nicely compared to other supplements. The individual packets are helpful for travel and convenience. The kicker is, it's pricey. For 7 packets you're paying almost $20 (at the time of this review). Good collagen supplements are indeed expensive but you can get 30 servings for $40 - $50 on average of a similar supplement . . . it's just not in individual serving packets.

[SEP] I am rating this collagen three stars only because it is expensive. I appreciate 'travel size' and 'single size' often comes with an upcharge, but this collagen is very pricey.<br /><br />I take collagen every morning. I mix it with water and move on with my life. The collagen I use has no flavor and mixes well, even in cold water. The trick is to use a whisk and pour the scoop of collagen slowly while whisking. It's really pretty easy. I wanted to have collagen packets on hand so I could have an easy way to take my collagen when I was not at home. These packets really do make it easier, but the price is just crazy. I would rather scoop out a serving and put it in a tiny container and bring that along with me.<br /><br />This collagen does mix well and does not have any flavor. I drank it with cold water using a whisk to mix it in and had no issues with clumping and there was no graininess. [SEP] Great collagen packets.<br />They dissolve easily, even in room temp water.<br />No flavor.<br />Can't reccomend enough [SEP] I've always been interested in collagen but the few that I have tried would always leave a bad after taste. I'm so happy that this brand does not have that problem - I put it into my morning drink or smoothie and can't even tell. Recently, I have been dealing with a lot of skin issues and have become VERY conscious of ingredients in all my products and food. So it was really important for me to find a brand of collagen that didn't include any fluff, additives, artificial ingredients. What's great about this product is that it is already portioned into single servings so no fuss, no hassle. Have nothing but positive things to say about this collagen!",3,True
Bonsai Wellness Mini Wedge Seat Cushion for Home Office or Car Chair,[],[],,3.8,26,386,"Not bad better then my car seat [SEP] Not as wide as expected. Will take a little getting used to sitting on it. [SEP] This wedged seat cushion is much better than several of the reviews are giving it credit for, especially for the price!<br /><br />Because of this, I feel I should address some of the specific concerns mentioned in the other reviews...<br /><br />FIRMNESS:  At first glance, this cushion seems very stiff because it is.  If you weigh less than 115 lbs or are very sensitive to firm seats, you may want to look elsewhere for a softer cushion.  However, for the average person, the initial firmness slowly gives way as you sit in it and offers a nice balance of support and cushioning, rather than disappearing beneath you as some softer cushions do!  Also, as anyone who has owned memory foam products knows, the stiffer foam should hold up better over time. My wife is 125 lbs and uses hers all day, every day, as a receptionist in a busy office.  She loves it!  And it's still supportive enough for me to use, despite me being a much bigger and heavier person.<br /><br />SIZE:  The stated measurements are spot on.  This is NOT a &#34;large&#34; or &#34;extra large&#34; cushion, much more of a &#34;medium&#34; size.  In fact, it says &#34;mini&#34; in the product title, so anyone thinking they were getting a huge cushion simply wasn't paying attention, ha ha!.  That said, it's not really &#34;mini&#34; either.  It's a nice versatile size that will fit most kitchen and office chairs, as well as car seats.  I'm a tall guy with a wide 38&#34; waist and my wife is naturally &#34;curvy&#34; where it counts...while we definitely wouldn't want this cushion to be any more narrow than it already is, neither of us has difficulty getting comfortable on it.<br /><br />ANGLE:  Someone complained that they didn't like the fact that the cushion was &#34;angled&#34;.  Well, it says &#34;wedge&#34; in the title and it clearly shows the heavily angled profile in the picture!  This is great for keeping you from sinking backwards into chairs too deeply and also relieves pressure on nerves and arteries in your thighs by decreasing their angle.  Of course, not everyone likes the feeling of an angled cushion, but if you bought this thinking it was a straight cushion, you should probably get your eyes checked!  Also, just because you don't like the shape, it doesn't mean the cushion isn't a good value, because it is!<br /><br />If you want a &#34;soft&#34; cushion, a &#34;straight&#34; cushion or are worried about the overall width, feel free to look elsewhere, but be ready to pay more!<br /><br />Personally, I'd probably opt for a slightly wider cushion myself if I was going to buy another, but my wife and I still have no complaints about the overall performance and quality of this product.  Recommended! [SEP] I ended up buying a second one for my dad. This cushion has saved us both so much pain while driving. My seats are bucket, and very uncomfortable. This cushion fits perfectly and is very comfortable. Long drives are a breeze now. I may buy another one for my office chair. [SEP] This cushion is pretty darn hard and I didn't think I liked it at first, but it really is comfortable and is much better than a donut because I can lean against the back of the chair more easily. [SEP] This item was too narrow for my seat. But, it is good and durable. I'm sure it will work for those with smaller seats. [SEP] Very satisfied with the cushion.  My wife and I use cushions in our Mustang because the seats sit too low and are not the most comfortable in the world.  Her cushion cost much more than mine and, admittedly is a little more comfy, but this cushion works just fine for me.  Used it all the time on a 2,500 mile trip recently and was very pleased with it. [SEP] I liked it so much, I just ordered a second one, for my car. It's just right; tilts the knees lower than the hips, and easy on sore tailbones. [SEP] I had hip pain when I drove. This took the pain away. Love it!! [SEP] Great seat for the car.  It levels a worn car seat so you do not sink down.",3,True
"Furniture Repair Wood Repair Markers Touch Up Repair Pen 21PCS, 10 Filler Wax Sticks with Sharpener Kit for Stains, Scratches, Floors Wooden Furniture Stains Scratch Cover Crayon Color Restore Pen Set",[],[],,3.3,28,2174,"I'm new to wood repair kits but our contractor suggested using this sort of kit to hide small cracks and scratches.  Depending on the depth of the scratch, I used the wax crayon first and then the marker to cover the color.  I used this on our older scratched furniture and on the wood accents on our window sills.  Not too difficult although it takes some time to get used to the materials.  It did help make scratches less visible, so the kit was worth it for us. [SEP] These go on great however if your using this on any object that will be in direct sunlight it will change color completely [SEP] When moving or just during day to day life, it's all but inevitable your furniture will end up scratched.  This 21 piece set is a good value, considering that one scratch repair marker will have cost me $5 at my local home improvement store.<br /><br />Here you get not only the markers, but wax ""crayons"" that can also be used for scratch touch-ups. I recently helped my son move from one apartment to another and a Craftsnman-era table got horribly scratched by a wayward something in the back of the moving van. With this set, we were able to carefully touch up the scratches so that it looks almost as if nothing happened to it.  Since then, I have used it on wooden horse carving that I inherited and it looks almost brand new.<br /><br />Be careful with the colors that you choose, start lighter and work up. Use your finger or a soft cloth to blend areas that you treat in order to smooth out lines of demarcation. If you go too dark, it can be a glaring mistake, so easy does it.  The markers and crayons do tend to last and stand up to light dusting. Over time you may have to touch up. This is a great thing to have on hand when a complete refinish of a piece of furniture isn't possible. [SEP] Decent set of wood furniture repair markers. There is a good variety of different colors and these markers work well in covering up scratches and other blemishes. These colors are also available on touch up pencils, which are included in the package. Colors perfectly matched with our doors and made scratches less visible. [SEP] It is inevitable for furniture to get dinged, scratched, and scuffed.  Most of the damage is only millimeters thick, while some may be deeper.  For these light scuffs and scratches, the touch up marker is perfect.  Just select the color that most closely matches your finish, and then rub it on the scratch.  The coloring agent will blend into the scratch, hiding it from view.  The markers come in 10 colors, and match everything from painted while furniture to oak to maple to grey-cedar and everything in between.<br /><br />If the scratch is a bit deeper, then use the wood-filling sticks that are included in this set.  They resemble crayons, but the material is much stronger for a lasting fill.  The fill sticks come in 10 colors that match the 10 colors of the markers.<br /><br />This is an excellent set, and everyone with furniture should have it. [SEP] If you get a scratch, scrape or minor chip on wooden furniture (actually any wooden surface), somehow it seems magnified and always catches your eye. Even a tiny, slight scratch.<br />This touch-up kit can help minimize that annoyance. It comes with 10 touch-up markers and 10 filler touch-up crayons. The supplied colors: Black, Gray, White, Mahogany, Maple, Oak, Cherry, Walnut, Chestnut and Brunt Sienna.  Each set has it's own specialty.<br />The touch-up markers will mask a slight scrape or scratch. The 10 markers have a range of wood tones that should accommodate most finished wood surfaces. The filler sticks resemble crayons, and you use the included sharpener to make a finer point, depending on the nature of the repair. They recommend warming the filler stick before application. You rub this filler stick into the problem area, 'filling' it. Allow it to dry. To refine the repair, use the touch-up marker to attain a close match to the surrounding wood.<br />If the filler stick doesn't handle the repair, it's probably not a minor issue. Then you could try other repair products, like wood putty or plastic wood to fill the chip or crack. Then when those products are dry/cured, you can use the touch-up markers to match the original wood.<br />The product matches the product details. It's a worthwhile repair kit. Besides furniture repair, it can be used in arts/crafts projects, too.  Overall, the product is exactly as shown and described. It won't create magic and restore things like new. But, it will mask obvious scratches, scuffs and chips. So, it earns a 4.25 - 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] I ordered the repair markers to touch up on worn out edged on my dining and living room table. The set comes with 10 markers in brown, grey, and black gradient colors so you can pick out the color that best matches the surface you are trying to cover. The kit also comes with 10 touch up fillen sticks in colors that match the markers. These sticks look like crayons and they work to cover any small nicks, scratch or cracks on the furniture.<br /><br />The markers work great. I only really needed the grey and dark brown markers but it's really good to have a set with variety of colors in case other furniture starts to show wear and tear. The tip of the markers have an edge shape. It's not fine marker but I can use the tip to color over the small nicks.<br /><br />The crayon, fillen sticks I did not find much use for. I was expecting it to work like soft wax that would harden over the application but it's really difficult to get it on and the color is not as visible. The kit comes with a sharpener to give sharpen the shape but not sure that I would use much of the actual crayons to begin with. [SEP] I don’t know what happened to this product but when I opened the box that YONGI’s “Total Furniture Repair System” it looked like a boom had exploded. All of the ten repair markers were cover to some degree with an orange, waxy substance. It took forever to get the substance off of the markers. Some of the makers were permanently stained and others lost the wording on the marker when the waxy substance came off. The substance had also seeped through the cardboard packet and was oily so when I left it on my cherry wood table the oil left a ring – so another mess to clean up. Only two of the fill sticks had the pointed tip of a new “crayon” all the rest had flatten tips some to the point of being only half the size as the rest of the sticks.<br />I tried the repair markers out first and they worked well matching the wood in color. The fill sticks were terrible. I wanted to fill in a little nick on my kitchen. So, I ran the stick over the nick and nothing happened. Then I tried again and the wax “crayon” filled in with little crumbles, I tried to smooth the crumbles out and it all fell out.<br />This product is made in China. [SEP] I have been using magic markers to touch-up wood scratches, but it is expensive to buy a large color set and most colors are not applicable. This repair kit has colors that match better for most wood.<br />The pens work well, especially on fake printed wood like those on cheap furniture. It fools the eye and hides flaws amazingly well.<br /><br />The crayons are used for deep scratches. Unfortunately the crayons are soft and not for permanent repair. They also melt in the sun, so not for things near the window. What they really need to provide is some kind of putty instead that can harden permanently. Then the filled location can be color matched using their pens. This crayon stuff is not good when it smears. [SEP] This order includes a set of 10 markers, 10 crayons, and a plastic sharpener for the crayons. There are six colors designed to match wood types: oak, maple, chestnut, mahogany, cherry, and walnut. There are four colors to match paint instead of wood types: black, white, gray, and burnt sienna. Each marker and corresponding crayon is labeled accordingly. I have used furniture wood repair markers before, but I have purchased them individually as needed, so it's nice to have a complete set on standby. I tested several of the colors on various bits of older furniture around the house, and each worked well. For the current list price of $15.88 for the full set of 10 crayons, 10 markers, and a sharpener, I consider this a good value and a useful item to keep on hand.",3,True
Nature’s Edge® QGel® 100mg A Superior Form of Coenzyme Q10-30 Counts,[],[],,4.1,36,307,"This is a superior form of Coq10. It is absorbed better than other formulations. This supplement is useful for many cellular functions, so it's a good idea to add it to your diet.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] CoQ10 is an anti-oxident that's produced by your body, but that decrease as we age. Taking suppliments is supposed to help maintain heart health as well as blood pressure, among other things. This formula touts itself as being water dissolvable and therefore has 3 times the absorption, so the 100 mg gel caps should be more effective than comparable brands. So far, it appears to be exactly as described, though sometimes it's difficult to tell with suppliments such as these. They're considered safe and have health benefits beyond even the heart health (which is enough). [SEP] QGel is made in the USA but, unfortunately, it contains gelatin, which is not vegetarian or vegan. It is manufactured in a certified Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility and is laboratory tested and approved for guaranteed potency and purity.<br /><br />This supplement indicates that it contains both vitamin E as alpha tocopherol and CoQ10 AKA ubidecarenone AKA ubiquinone. CoQ10 is a biologically active compound similar in its chemical structure to vitamins K and E. Research has indicated that CoQ10 and vitamin E work synergistically as powerful antioxidants, exponentially multiplying the positive benefits of each. (See reference below.)<br /><br />This supplement also includes lecithin, which additionally helps improve the bioavailability of CoQ10. (See reference below.)<br /><br />CoQ10 is particularly well known for its function within cells in the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cascade, a crucial aspect of energy production within the body. Because cellular functions are dependent on an adequate supply of ATP, CoQ10 is crucial to the maintenance of health in virtually all tissues and organs in the human body. (See reference below.)<br /><br />CoQ10 is of particular benefit for cardiovascular health, especially for heart patients who have been prescribed statins, which have long been known to dangerously decrease levels of CoQ10 in the body. Symptoms of low levels of CoQ10 due to statins can include: muscle weakness and fatigue, high blood pressure, and mental fog. In the extreme, symptoms can include chest pain, heart failure, and seizures.<br /><br />CoQ10 has also been found helpful in the treatment of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, no doubt because of its raising of ATP levels in the body, as described above.<br /><br />Research has found that selenium makes an important contribution to the body's processing of CoQ10 in that it is required in order for the body to fully utilize CoQ10. (See reference below.) However, selenium is not included in this supplement. Therefore, it is a good idea for anyone hoping to maximize absorption of a CoQ10 supplement such as this one to add a selenium supplement to their nutraceutical regimen.<br /><br />Because it is fat-soluble, it is recommended to ingest CoQ10 with a meal that contains fat and to take it at a dose of 30-200 mg per day. The dosage of this supplement is 100 mg per each softgel. That is a pretty standard dosage for persons such as myself who take it to promote good health and not for a specific health condition.<br /><br />RELEVANT RESEARCH<br /><br />Alehagen U, et al.

[SEP] I've been taking a CoQ10 supplement for the last several years mainly because it's very good for heart health.  These gelcaps are big, but not too hard to swallow and only one per day is the dosage.  I'm not a CoQ10 expert, but as far as I can tell these are good quality and I have no reservations in taking them. [SEP] What I liked:<br />-Product has a nice amount (100mg) of COQ10<br />-Plus 100mg of d-alpha-tocopheryl (Vitamin E)<br />-Both ingredients have many health benefits<br /><br />Having some heart issues, I take COQ10 every day! [SEP] Co-enzyme Q10 has been shown to have multiple benefits, and I have taken it for many years as a general anti-aging supplement. This supplement is labeled ubidecarenone, which is basically a synonym for ubiquinone, the more common name for co-enzyme Q10. I admit I have never seen that chemical name used, so I had to look it up.<br /><br />This is co-enzyme Q10 that is supposed to be absorbed better. I'm guessing this is because it is mixed with lecithin, which has been shown to enhance the absorption of co-enzyme Q10 and a variety of other chemicals. Since co-enzyme Q10 can often be challenging to absorb, this seems like a good formula. [SEP] I believe this has improved my cardiac response.  I have felt less fatigue during the past two weeks and actually have been feeling better each day.<br />I was tiring by midday during the previous month or so, since I stopped taking a previous product because of some stomach upset.<br />I have had none of those symptoms with this product and my blood pressure has been more stable than it was.

Over 93% of non-organic soybeans grown in the USA are GMO. There is a similar problem with non-organic canola oil. Since 1995, the notorious chemical giant, Monsanto, has been consistently genetically modifying rapeseeds, the source of canola oil, until currently about 90% of the world's canola crop is GMO. (The leading producers of rapeseed include the European Union, Canada, China, India, and Australia. The USA is the largest importer of rapeseed in the world and receives the bulk of its rapeseed from Canada.) Note that, if organic, canola oil is not a bad choice in and of itself. It consists mostly of healthy monounsaturated fat (61%, which is almost as much as olive oil) and a relatively low percentage of unhealthy polyunsaturated fats (32%). It contains a relatively small amount (7%) of saturated fats.<br /><br />Second, in and of itself, even if organic, soy can have a negative impact on the thyroid, particularly in women. So it is not a good idea to consume soy products, such as this one, on a regular basis.<br /><br />Third, this product contains the artificial sweetener, sucralose. Health conscious individuals avoid it because there are strong indications that it can reduce beneficial gut microflora. It is also harmful to the liver, kidneys, thymus and lymph nodes. For these reasons, it should rarely, if ever, be ingested, making it a bad idea to include it in a product such as this, which is intended for frequent consumption.<br /><br />Fourth, I try to avoid products which include natural flavor. The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.<br /><br />Rather than using this product, I think it would be cheaper, healthier, and definitely safer, to simply take a multivitamin pill and drink some plain protein powder in water, juice or in a smoothie and consume healthy, organic fats, such as coconut oil, nuts or olive oil, rather than the GMO canola oil in this product. I certainly would not consider buying this product again.<br /><br />Ingredients: Soy protein isolate, high oleic canola oil, maltodextrin, isomaltulose, soluble corn fiber, modified food starch, potassium chloride, magnesium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, soy lecithin, dipotassium phosphate, mono & diglylceride, salt, choline chloride, natural flavor, xanthan gum, sodium ascorbate, mixed tocopherol, DL-alpha tocopheryl acetate, ferrous gluconate, zinc sulfate, D-calcium pantothenate, niacinamide, sucralose, thiamine hydrochloride, copper gluconate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, manganese sulfate, riboflavin, vitamin A palmitate, potassium iodide, chromium chloride, biotin, folic acid, sodium molybdate, phytonadione, sodium selenite, vitamine D2, vitamin B12. [SEP] Soylent meal replacement. I've tried the original I'm not a fan of it of the flavor it's kind of blah but when you add in some fruits like pineapple or blueberries are bananas it really becomes pretty good. But over time you get tired of it. This flavor though is really good the chocolate. You don't really need any added ingredients to drink it. I do a dice kind of make it a smoothie in a sense. One thing I do got to say it goes by and I go through quite fast doing the measuring properly. Portable generator last about a week if you use it on a regular basis. I really love the product. I think buying the bottles is a waste of money. Especially if you're drinking you on a regular basis. [SEP] This was the first time I ever tried soylent.  For $34 I thought it would be a good way to try it.  It is a bit bland but great for the drive to work in the morning.  From now on though i will be getting the pouches as that is a bit cheaper.<br /><br />TLDR: Soylent is good, this is a bit expensive for volume but a good way to try the powder for not much to see if you like it. [SEP] Powder has developed funny color and taste within a year, maybe I just got a bad batch. [SEP] I like it! Usually I throw half a banana, ice, and some ovaltine with it, just depending on how hungry I am. I do two scoops, which I think comes to less than 2 dollars a meal. Use it for breakfast and sometimes dinner too.<br /><br />PRO TIP: Save the scoop from the previous purchase, because sometimes the measuring scoop gets buried at the bottom from shipping. [SEP] Good for busy guys. [SEP] Added a scoop to protein or fruit smoothies and loved it. Drinking it plain in water is a bit much, but in milk or a non-dairy sub like vanilla soy or oat, it's delicious [SEP] Fast shipping good flavor especially with almond milk [SEP] Full disclosure: I totally thought this was a joke. I saw the image in the description of the ironic hipster holding a green smoothie and thought this was a &#34;soylent green&#34; type gag gift for your literary friends who like a dark joke. Turns out this is actually a legit meal replacement powder. Boy I feel silly, having a giant tub of neutral flavored Slim Fast sitting on the counter forever now.",3,True
PUREMEDICS NAC 600 mg (N-Acetylcysteine 600mg) - NAC Supplement to Support Glutathione Formation and Respiratory Function - Doctor Formulated - 3rd Party Certified - Hypoallergenic - 250 Capsules,[],[],,4.1,27,667,"I gave this NAC 5 stars because it’s easy to swallow, it doesn’t upset my stomach and it’s the 1st NAC I’ve taken that doesn’t smell like stinky rotten eggs upon opening the bottle every day. There still is a subtle smell but totally bearable. [SEP] My pulmonologist has NAC on his respiratory immunity supplement list like zinc, etc. I was unfamiliar with NAC until a few months ago. So far, no covid symptoms.<br /><br />NAC is listed among potential life-extension supplements planned for future in depth study. So far, I'm still kicking. It must be working—no negative metabolic side effects to report. The combination of NAC and TUDCA did a great job normalizing a couple of marginal liver panel test results. [SEP] N-acetyl cysteine has some potential lung and liver health benefits, and I have taken it fairly regularly for almost 10 years. Since it may raise glutathione levels in the body, it could potentially reverse the graying of hair as well, at least in theory.<br /><br />NAC is best taken on an empty stomach, since it is an amino acid. And, I suggest not taking it before exercise, since it has antioxidant activity, and too much antioxidant activity during exercise can actually negate the benefits of exercise (you want some bodily stress to happen).<br /><br />My main issue with this is the price. It's more expensive (as of now at least) than most other brands of NAC I have ever bought. [SEP] This is an honest review for this product.  I am a Whole Medicine and Healing Minister and I am always researching products for best ingredients, no unnecessary ingredients, clean ingredients, NON-GMO, GF, etc.  This product is fabulous!  I could tell a difference in how I was feeling a couple of days into taking it.  No stomach upset and I feel good know that I am taking a QUALITY supplement for immune health!  I will definitely be repurchasing this brand! [SEP] NAC is just a great supplement that is a powerful Anyi-Oxidant down at the cellular level and especially works for the Lungs and the Brain. This particular one is made by an award winning manufacturer. It’s made super clean by meeting and exceeding GMP Standards, is also 3rd Party Tested and done so in the USA.<br />  I’m now a real fan of this company and this product and would definitely recommend. [SEP] You take NAC to increase Glutathione in the body, which -- among other things -- is believed to help with COVID-19.  600mg per capsule -- that is the recommended dose.  See MedCram for more info. [SEP] I wanted to try this supplement to see if it would give me any performance improvement with exercise. It did not seem to, although I didn't do any strict metrics. However, it didn't do anything bad. So maybe this supplement will help somebody else. Amino acid deficiency is a thing, so anybody not getting enough NAC might benefit.<br /><br />This NAC comes in fairly standard capsules, which makes them easy to swallow. It seems like good value for the money because of how well it's packaged, how much is in the bottle, and it being about average to other NAC supplements. [SEP] With COVID being such a huge danger right now, I searched for supplements that could potentially help to keep me safe from it.<br />While doing research, I can across NAC several times, and learned that it positively effects the respiratory system.<br />The pills are easy to swallow and are flavorless.  The dose of NAC is an appropriate dose.  The issue is that there is no way to tell if this works at all.  I feel no difference whatsoever [SEP] My doctor always recommends PUREMEDICS, and this is one of their best products. I use it as muculent to reduce congestion and inflammation. I take one pill per day and can notice the effects right away. I’m sensitive to medication and have no problem with this. [SEP] Capsule form. Anti Covid 19 medication.",3,True

These are just the right size for a snack at work (see my picture comparing the size of the mini bar to an original sized one I had on hand). They look really dark in color...probably just because of the coffee that has been added. You can really taste the espresso flavor, though it is very pleasant. [SEP] Product packaging was poor, with no protection for a thin box. Product itself seems to be undamaged. Quality of product is fine. [SEP] Very strong coffee taste.  Does what I'd like it to do to give a instance boost on a hike.  Nice size for packing and also for being a quick, small snack.  It's more of like a quick energy booster when you're feeling a bit tired.  Nice texture and flavor. [SEP] I've been using dozens of different protein bars over the years and have settled on a few that I keep ordering and use in rotation to keep from getting bored. Most of those have turned out to be Clif Bars, so when I saw this one on sale I tried it out, not realizing that it was a mini-sized offering.<br /><br />At first, I was disappointed by the size, but they did taste good, so I kept using them and figured I'd never reorder them. But by the time I finished the box, I had found that the small size was a very good option to have around for the times that the full sized bar was overkill. So instead of having some half-eaten bars, now I can a bar tailor made for the need. I do a lot of bicycle riding and do a variety of different rides. This size is perfect for the shorter rides.<br /><br />I mentioned at the start that they do taste good, so that is the first requirement. They are a very rich coffee taste, but not too sweet, which is one of the failings of so many protein bars. I'm on my fourth box now, so that speaks for what I think of them. [SEP] I love the taste of coffee&u can definitely taste the expresso in these but it's not overwhelming. They are semi sweet&delicious. [SEP] They were ok [SEP] I’ve been eating Cliff Bars for decades and I’ve never seen tiny ones like these. It’s perfect to actually have 65mg of Caffeine in each one and call it Espresso. They are a little chunk of Espresso goodness and I would highly recommend them.  Enjoy and Stay Healthy Everyone!😁 [SEP] The claim of expresso is certainly not the liquid shot most are used to but ground beans. There is an initial good taste followed by a terrible texture like eating compressed coffee grounds and a very bitter after taste.  In my house my wife liked them. Both adult age kids hated them and I disliked them for multiple reasons the taste and texture being the most significant.<br /><br />Additionally the ingredients say “may contain milk” which usually means it is made on shared machinery so cross contamination is possible. I had a VIOLENT lactose intolerance response so I think you can assume the may contain is DOES CONTAIN in significant quantity should that matter-lesson learned about Clif Bars. [SEP] Damaged [SEP] Really good energy bar, very tasty. Sometimes the chewy bits are too hard to bite but overall great flavor, great energy and calories aren't bad either!",3,True
Probiotics 50 Billion CFU | 60 Capsules | with Prebiotics for Men & Women | Non-GMO & Gluten Free Supplement | by Zurich Research,[],[],,4.6,67,2105,"No complaints at all about these probiotics. The potency is very good, with each capsule providing 25 billion CFUs (the recommended dosage is 2 caps per day for a total of 50 billion CFUs). The strain diversity is excellent, with a total of 14 strains. The strains are identified, but the specific concentration of each is not. It also includes a small amount (5mg per capsule) of a prebiotic (FOS) to help with probiotic establishment. The bottle I received in May 2021 has an expiration date of July 2022.<br /><br />It hits the mark for both potency and strain diversity, and the price for a 60 capsule bottle is quite reasonable. Performance has been very good for me, and I've not had any stomach issues (such as gas or bloating) when taking them before a meal. Very pleased, and a solid 5 stars. [SEP] Like the size of the pills, not too big. Taking for stomach issues. So far I think they are helping. So grateful! [SEP] By far not my favorite probotic. I have taken probotics for years and I swear by them. Not impressed with these at all. [SEP] Mixed strains of good bacteria, excellent price and high count =equals everything you want in a probiotic. No gas, no diarrhea but helpful in maintaining or achieving regularity. Normal size capsules, easy to swallow. No refrigeration. Recommended. [SEP] I have Celiac, so I often have issues with digestion. I started to take these pills and I noticed a significant difference in my stomach issues after taking them consistently for a week or so. I am a convert! I would say, you should give it some time to work, but if you take them every day they can help with digestion problems in a natural way. [SEP] Product has helped my IBS symtoms, give them a try. Always check with your doctor before you start taking. [SEP] I've only discovered probiotics for people since discovering them for an elderly cat with major digestive issues. She benefits greatly from her feline dose -- as long as she gets it in her food, there's no diarrhea, but watch out if I forget!<br /><br />Because the cat benefits so much, it occurred to me that maybe I could eat bell peppers again -- like I did when I was younger -- if I tried probiotics. Over the last few years, it's gotten so bad that I don't even touch a tiny square of green bell pepper because the result is that I need at least six simethicone pills to ease the bloat. Then, red bells began to affect me, and my love of pizza and fajitas was severely impacted. The gas just isn't worth it. The simethicone can't handle it well enough.<br /><br />So, I tried these and found out that this broad-spectrum probiotic is just what I needed. While I still don't eat green bell peppers -- they aren't my favorite, so why risk it? -- I can have red bells again as long as I take these about an hour before I eat.<br /><br />My husband recently began reacting to the same peppers and found that one of these pills fixes him right up.  We love these! Highly recommended! [SEP] Doctor suggested these to me. [SEP] These had one of the broadest range of probiotics I saw so I got them to make my own soy yogurt from the soy milk I make using soybeans.  I put two capsules in a liter and it thickened after 12+ hours in the yogurt maker (Instant pot).  Will buy again. [SEP] Does this supplement work? I have no idea. Are the ingredients of good quality? No idea. That’s sort of the problem with supplements. They all make these claims, but it’s largely impossible to tell if they actually do anything beyond give you expensive pee. Obviously, I hope this works and provides me with some sort of useful benefit, but it may be the case that the benefits, if any, are subtle or that they take weeks or even months of use to start making a difference. All that I can really say about this is that I  have not experienced any negative effects from taking this. Also, this bottle says to refrigerate after opening, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />This bottle says 50 billion CFU per dose (two pills) and 14 probiotic strains. If you’ve never taken probiotics before, you might consider starting with a probiotic with a smaller dose to see how that affects you before jumping in with this.<br /><br />Further, regarding supplements in general, you should always pay attention to the dosage. First of all, you can’t be certain, unless you’ve come across 3rd party testing, that the dosage on the bottle is what you’re actually getting. It’s possible that the dosage could be higher or lower. This goes for all supplements. So, be careful and pay attention to any changes in how you’re feeling. Further, before you take any supplement, do some research. Just because something is being sold with a specific dosage doesn’t mean that dosage is safe, or at least safe for everyone. There are some things that have no upper limit when it comes to safety, but there are a great many things that do have tested upper limits, and there are many things that can interact with medication you may be taking or medical conditions you may have.",3,True

"gracosy Disposable Gloves, Food Grade Cleaning Gloves PVC Powder Free Textured Foodstuff Chemical Domestic Industry White 100 pcs White Large",[],[],,3.2,38,1526,"These are the higher end gloves that you might see at fast food places or in higher end hair color kits.<br /><br />They are really “tough” but also comfortable to use.

They're not quite ""true to size"", but there is barely wiggle room. [SEP] I was really disappointed with these. They smell like mildew, inside and out. One of the gloves I pulled from the box appeared to be burnt as it had some brown matter and a hole near the wrist area. Also, the box itself was marked as size small, but the little barcode sticker that was placed on the package was labeled Large, so I received tiny gloves that were incorrectly labeled and therefore did not fit. Also, the material is super thin and tears easily. [SEP] Review of:  gracosy Disposable Gloves, 100 pcs White Large<br /><br />I’m pleased with the results I’ve had with the Gracosy disposable gloves.  These gloves aren’t anything fancy of course, but I’ve found that for general around-the-house use these gloves will get the job done; and that is exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />The quality of the gloves is about what I expected for disposable gloves; not super thick but not so thin so they tear super easily.  Of course, long nails or rings (etc.), anything with an edge could poke a hole in the gloves but, in my experience, the same could be said for other similar gloves.<br /><br />The gloves are ‘powder free’, which I prefer, but I found that the gloves were still easy to slip on.<br /><br />The gloves I tested are listed, on the box, as being a size ‘large’.  I normally wear a size small in gloves so, for me, I found the gloves fit very comfortably without having to count on any stretchiness on the gloves.  As I prefer gloves that are looser, this fit was fine for me.<br /><br />As a quick test, for this review, I tested the stretch of the latex gloves by trying to put two hands into a single glove and I found that test worked okay as the glove stretched without tearing.  After testing the stretch of the glove, I found that a medium sized hand should fit without too many issues.  My test also demonstrated to me that a large size hand, even if the glove doesn’t tear, may find the fit too tight to be comfortable.<br /><br />For me, the Gracosy gloves are just what I need for working around the house.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click the Helpful button below as that helps me know that I'm providing useful information in these reviews. [SEP] Overall, these gracosy disposable gloves that are foodgrade PVC powder free are just as high quality as any other gloves on the market. Upon using them the past few months for mixing food dishes, these have held up incredibly well without noticing any tears at all. They're easy to put on and I actually really like that they're transparent, i'm not a huge fan of food grade cleaning gloves that are blue or green. It's also great to note that the box itself that houses the gloves is well made. Many other companies provide amazing gloves but the box is poorly made resulting in pulling out multiple gloves at once.<br /><br />Overall, it is a great product but not a 5/5 for me because the item is definitely more expensive than other products out there that offer the exact same thing. [SEP] When I ordered these gloves, I expected something akin to what you see people wearing in fast food places - baggy, thin, crinkly food handling gloves. These are much more like nitrile gloves or exam gloves. They have a good fit (my hands are generally between a medium and a large and these large ones fit nearly perfectly with just a little extra room above my fingers). They have good ""touch"" (aka, you can feel things through them). They're stretchy and are easy to put on and take off. They aren't powdered inside, but they glide on easily anyway. They are pretty strong for thing disposable gloves as well. The only small point is that they are very short at the cuffs and don't expend much past the top of the wrist. I'm also not sure that they are good value compared to similar gloves, but they are high quality. [SEP] In times like these, keeping your hands from not getting infected by virus has become very important since most of the germs spread by rubbing the hands to the nose or face. So I got these disposable gloves. I wear them before cleaning up a trash bin, picking up mails from mail box or unboxing online orders.I also wear them before washing the vegetables and fruits that have come from a store to home. Once used, just remove and dispose them easily. They come in a pack of 100 and would last for innumerable uses. They could be used while gardening and planting too. These gloves are reasonable for the price. They are very useful, especially in these times to protect your hands.",3,True
"1875 Watt Negative Ionic Hair Dryer, ENISECA Precise Wind Heat/Speed Setting Tech Professional Salon Blow Dryer Fast Drying Low Noise with Powerful AC Motor and Diffuser Comb for Women Men, Grey",[],[],,3.6,43,2004,"Update 2/5/22: I tried to give this blow dryer a shot on the highest wind setting at medium heat. Mind you, it normally takes less than 10 minutes to dry my terribly fine thin hair. It didn't even make it halfway through before it crapped out. Dead. The plug didn't shut it off. It just died. With all of its shortcomings and now this, it's a definite no go...<br /><br />2/3/22: This ENISECA 1875 Watt Negative Ionic Hair Dryer is not as versatile as it is made out to be. I was really looking forward to being able to change the temperature and wind settings to my liking. I have fine thin hair, and need a lower speed with hotter temperatures than most blow dryers have. With this blow dryer, it's impossible.<br />The only time you can adjust the temperature is if it's on the highest wind speed, which is totally ridiculous. If you lower the wind speed at all, it goes to the coldest temperature, which is even more ridiculous. I do appreciate being able to change the temperature on the highest wind setting, but I need a lower wind setting and a higher temperature setting than cold. And, I do mean cold.<br />After deciphering the meaning behind this seemingly faulty setting, they make it appear that a lower wind speed should only have low temperatures for children's sake. I didn't buy this blow dryer for a child, I bought it for myself. Furthermore, I would not want to blow dry my child's hair with cold air.<br />This blow dryer could have been a super win all around, but instead it's a flop for me. It's fine if you only blow dry your hair on a medium/high speed at all times, but for those of us who don't or can't do that, it's pretty much useless. Just to note, the highest wind speed setting is not nearly high enough to please those with thick long hair, but it  get extremely hot. This is not my favorite. [SEP] I have fine, dry, flat hair that gets frizzy at the ends. I blow dry with a large round brush and need to switch back and forth between warm and cool settings often to style my hair. I wrap my hair around the brush barrel, blow it with heat and then use a cool setting to lock in shape. I’m constantly switching between and heat and cool settings. But I haven’t found a practical way to do my routine with this Eniseca hair dryer. This hair dryer makes a good initial impression based just on looks in that it’s lightweight, nice looking in black with rose gold, compact, digital and comes nicely boxed with accessories. But I’ve tinkered around with it for days and can’t find a workable way to toggle back and forth between my desired warm and cool settings. I haven’t been able to properly style my hair once with this dryer.<br /><br />To explain, the heat setting comes on at 50 C, but I need it at about 76 C (max is 99 C). I have to press the plus button 26 times to get my desired heat level. After drying a section, I need a cool burst of air so I switch to cool air, but it defaults to 99 wind power. That’s way too strong, so I have to press the minus button 20 times or so to get a reduced usable air flow. It takes more time to adjust to the cool air flow than to actually use it. The worst part is that I then need to switch to heat again for the next hair section, but I can’t find a way to toggle back to 76 C as the heat button seems to default back to 50 C. So then I have to press the plus button 26 times again to get the right heat setting and that tedious cycle just continues. This is not a workable product for me. If there actually is a way to toggle between desired temperature and air flow settings and not be resetting constantly, then it’s far too complicated for me to figure out. I don’t like it. 2 stars. [SEP] Update 7/11: dryer is now dead after less than 10 time of use. Terrible.<br /><br />I never thought I would review a hair dryer using a term called “user interface” or UI, but the UI of this hair dryer is simply too confusing and make it very hard to use. First of all, I don’t know who needs to control the temperature in one degree resolution. To crank up or lower temperature, you need to hold the + or - button and wait it to go from say 90F down to 60F. Why can not just have three preset temperature and the user can switch between them in one single click? It is a hair dryer not a computer and majority of the people just don’t need such feature. Also, I can never understand why when switching from hot air to cold air mode and switch back to hot air mode, it can not remember the temperature I used previously in hot air mode. It always starts with 50F which is simply to low and I have to spend another 10 second to crank it up to 90F. It is just too difficult to use. [SEP] 3/08/2022: Was very happy until today. Been using it only about 5 minutes per day and it burned out about a month. I was not expected a hair dryer only last for a little over a month.<br /><br />1/28/2022: Very easy to use. I especially love that I can control the speed and temperature. It is very handy when coming to styling my hair or when I only want to dry it up to certain point.<br /><br />The attachments are very easy to use and work well. The biggest attachment (the one that looks like lotus) is looser than the others and do need to handle with care in order to prevent it falling off.<br /><br />Other than that, love this hair dryer and the best replacement for my older one. [SEP] I am really liking this blow dryer. It’s pretty straightforward when it comes to the way you use it- with three buttons. You turn it on by long pressing the fan button then you can adjust the temperature and the wind speed with the other two buttons. I have really fine, thin hair that is regularly bleached- so I like to take care not to cause more damage than the bleaching already does. I used this on about 60• which was just warm enough to get my hair dry without burning it up. My ends looked less frizzy after using this hairdryer which is always a plus! I also like that it came with a brush, a couple of attachments and a really cute travel bag! I’m hopeful this will hold up to regular use! [SEP] It kept shutting down when I was using it.  I had to keep turning it back on after my hand holding pressure would turn it off.  That was frustrating enough not to be fond of anything else. I was not a fan. Thank you. [SEP] It is a good hair dryer. It provides good drying power and it's light weight. [SEP] I prefer to wait a little while before leaving reviews on any electronics that come from China (which is about 99% of them these days) so i gave this item some time and use. I reviewed the reviews and I dont want to just say the same generic things everyone else is saying. Not saying theres anything wrong with that. We need those generic reviews. Im just saying it lasts daily use. Thats my only point. It lasts and hasn't died in 2 weeks. Ive had it many months now. I personally think one week reviews on electronics are useless. If it breaks know that I WILL and ALWAYS DO go back to this review and update it if Amazon allows it (they usually do). One primary reason i do that is negative reviews get more upvotes for helpful than positive reviews do, and I think its sad that that is a real issue, but it is. So yeah if it breaks ill DEFINATELY update it because that will only help my reviews helpful quota, but for now Im saying GO FOR IT!<br /><br />Quality and longevity seem to be there.<br /><br />I hope that helps. If it did plz hit that HELPFUL button! It makes me smile when people like my reviews. [SEP] This hair dryer works great. My wife and I highly recommend this.mFirstly, it is lightweight. My wife is a traveler so this hair dryer is powerful yet compact enough to put in her carry on. My wife uses it on the coolest setting and she states her hair dries fast, without causing damage from high temperatures. It’s light in weight and easy to hold. [SEP] Small but it does the job and it's not so noisy like the others",3,True
"40 Inch Numbers 0-9 Birthday Party Decorations Helium Foil Mylar Number Balloon (Digitale 2, Tiffany Pink)",[],[],,3.9,59,1806,"I got the number 2.<br />It didn’t come with a tube to inflate it as some of the other balloons that are this style do.<br />Deflated it measures around 43 inches tall.<br />I used a common straw to inflate.<br />My mouth it took me about 2 minutes to inflate. I was worried I popped it. But it was just settling in and was full shortly after.<br />Inflated my 2 measured only about 33” tall. For this reason I deducted one star as the listing was for a 40” balloon.<br />The pink color is really pretty.<br />There are two loops on the top and bottom to hang this balloon.<br />To manually deflate the balloon simply slide in a straw and move the air into the direction of the straw. The air will move out of the balloon through the straw. It took me around 5 minutes to deflate the balloon.<br />The air coming out of the balloon smells like nail polish. [SEP] I think these balloons are pretty good quality.  Mine didn't have any holes like some other reviewers balloons did.  You only get one number per package of balloons so if you need two of the same number you'll have to order two packages.  I used a mattress inflater to fill them but only used air - no helium, though I think they would look great floating.  They seem to hold air for a long time and the pink color is very pretty. [SEP] This is a really nice size balloon.  We didn't have any helium handy so we just filled it with air.  Inflates easy and held the air overnight so no issues there.  Great for kids birthday parties.  I checked with a local store and they will fill the balloon for use for a nominal charge (they said $1.99 same as if we bought the balloon at the store).  Great fun balloon. [SEP] While I was blowing this up (by mouth) I noticed it wasn't inflating, then I saw the slit in it. I was able to tape it to where I could inflate it some. Didn't blow it up till right before the party so I had no other choice but to use it. [SEP] Great balloon that literally stayed filled for weeks!!! Large and beautiful, perfect for any birthday or occasion. [SEP] Excellent Balloon. It was easy to inflate, easy to seal, and easy to use. The color is pretty and to me has just a slight shimmer to it that makes it gleam. 5 stars!! [SEP] Was well packaged. No damage or rips. Blew up with portable compressor. [SEP] Almost $8 seems like a lot for this but it is cute and will be great for my daughter's 2nd birthday party. [SEP] Not a bad balloon. Not exactly as pictured but still nice. Didn’t take long to inflate either which I appreciate.<br /><br /> I did encounter one issue where I filled the balloon and thought I had it filled completely but after I sealed it and brought it inside it started to look partially deflated. There is no leak that I can see but it was deceiving. This could be user error though.<br /><br />The color is exactly as pictured and it’s a great size balloon.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful please remember to vote for it. [SEP] Exactly as described",3,True
"HEAVY DUTY Stainless Steel Cleaner and Polish for Pots, Pans, Clad 16oz – Removes Stains, Burnt Food, Tarnish – Pot Cleaning Kit – Includes Scouring Cloth for Scrubbing",[],[],,3.7,140,9751,"Was so hoping.....  Actually, the stainless steel pots/pans that we have are shiny and debris free, so really didn't need this special Heavy Duty Cleaner for those.  Was hoping (even though the label says -no) to give it a try on a couple of frying pans made of aluminum with the non-stick coating on the inside.  They're the favorite pans of the spouse for frying eggs, but are horrific looking on the outside.  Was hoping that this cleaner just might be ""strong"" enough to cut through the burnt-on food and not harm the aluminum to badly.  Sorry, pans - you still look hideous!  I do have one pan that has that non-stick stone-looking surface inside and out, and it did clean up the bit of discoloration on the outside, so that was good for the reputation of The Crown Choice Cleaner & Polisher.  I did give it try on the glass on the stovetop and that worked fine.  Actually, I'm pretty good at cleaning up any messes as  they happen, so not that much current use for this product, but it's here when the need arises. [SEP] It takes a lot of effort and time to remove stains and to polish.  It is a decent polish, but I was hoping for one that works easier and faster. [SEP] Perhaps I care too much for cosmetics. Maybe I obsess over my tools. I do think that build-up on the inside of my pots matters in the long run, at least.<br /><br />Crown has given me the best gentile abrasive I have ever used to such effect. Heck, even aggressive abrasives have not matched this performance, except in creating new scratches.<br /><br />This cleaner worked on my hard anodized aluminum pans to remove varnish on the flame facing side. It removed the remnants of foods on the inside. As for stainless steel, which is the named purpose for this cleaner, the varnish came off the bottom and the inside looks as new.<br /><br />The cleaning pad included is particularly effective, as opposed to a sponge or something more aggressive. Thankfully, they have included two. A little of this cleaner works better for me than a heavy hand. [SEP] Finally found a product that does what it advertises.<br />Did a great job on my stainless steel grill.<br />Sat outside  4 years and now looks brand new [SEP] It does scrub away any stains and oil stains. scrubbers are included. works very well for me and make all my kitchen pots shining clean. Thanks [SEP] I used this to clean a stainless steel gas cooktop that had some stains well cooked in. I have tried lots of other things ... vinegar, and several other products that claim to be for cleaning stainless steel. None of them did a thing, but Crown Power Cleanser and Polish did the job. I had to use some elbow grease too, but that is to be expected, and is ok. I also used the scrubbing cloths that came with the product. Read the directions carefully, this is a strong cleanser. [SEP] I wanted to try this product for 3 very specific cleaning needs - stainless steel pans, a crockpot crock and an enameled cast iron dutch oven.  All three had stains that didn’t affect the usability, but just didn’t look all that great.  I had previously scrubbed with multiple things trying to get the stains out but to no avail.  So, here is what happened with this product:<br /><br />On the enameled cast iron dutch oven I would say that it removed 80%n of the discoloration.  Perhaps I could scrub longer or put more elbow grease into it and I could have gotten it all, but I got tired (lol).<br /><br />On the stainless steel skillet, it took quite a bit of elbow grease but it removed ALL stains and it looks like new.<br /><br />On the crockpot crock - I had darker colored stains on a white crock and white (lime???) deposits on a black crock.  I used this product on both and it was a breeze to remove the stains/deposits.  Unlike with the stainless steel and the enameled cast iron I didn’t have to scrub nearly as hard to get the good results with the crocks.<br /><br />So… overall I would call it a success, especially with the crocks and the stainless steel.  The cleaner comes with two non-scratching scrubbing pads (sort of the size of a wash cloth) that are easy to use and easy to clean.  I do wish it had worked a little better on the enameled cast iron, and I am going to give it another try but am pleased that it did at least remove about 80% of the stains.  Overall, a solid 4 star product.  I hope this info is helpful to you in our buying decision! [SEP] I used this heavy oil cleaning kit once and it didn't work as well as expected. It doesn't have a very pungent smell and comes with two cleaning cloths. [SEP] I tried this on several pots and pans that had tarnish and greasy bits, my stainless steel sink that had grease and water marks, and my quartz counter that has mineral stains from dried water under the dish rack. Unfortunately, after carefully following the directions about shaking it, letting it sit on the surface to be cleaned for a while, and then using the included scrubbers (and lots of elbow grease) , the most it did was take of the upper layer of crud, which I could have already done with plain old dish soap and regular scrubbers. I thought it might easily handle my sink, but it couldn't even remove the light layer of grime from that. Ajax powder would have handled this job easily. CLR would have handled the water stains under the dish rack with ease. The one pot that it did do well on has a polished surface and it was able to remove some light water stains from that. I give this 2 stars even though it's disappointing because it helped with the one pot and the 2 included scrubbers are pretty nice. [SEP] This cleaner removed varnish from the flame facing side of my hard anodized aluminum pans. It got rid of the food remnants on the inside. The varnish came off the bottom of the stainless steel, which is the cleaner's named purpose, and the inside looks brand new. This worked great on a burnt pan as well as in my stainless steel dishwasher. It does state that it is ""not recommended for use on stainless steel exteriors."" On the label, I couldn't find the precise reason. I'm guessing it's to avoid dulling a super shiny exterior, but my dishwasher has a satin finish. I used a gentle hand and only a small amount of product, and it turned out beautifully. This product is packaged in an opaque plastic bottle that is tightly capped and taped to prevent leaks during shipping. It also comes in a printed box with two scouring cloths. These cloths are fairly thick, approximately 11"" x 12"", and folded to form a scouring pad.",3,True
"Keithwood 11.5"" Pendulum Board for Divination Wooden Dowsing Board Metaphysical Message Board for Witchcraft Wiccan Altar Supplies, Spiritual Divination Tool - Butterfly with Moon Phase",[],[],,4.3,17,563,"Large, engraved, unsealed blond pinewood disc. Natural, earthy, simple. Very appropriate for a dowsing board. I like the graphics on it (butterfly, moon phases, etc). They also have a black option, which appears stunning.<br /><br />Lightweight, but sturdy.. just add your own pendulum. [SEP] This is a pretty and functional dowsing board A circle of lightweight wood it features attractive center illustrations and large, readable responses. The back is plain and there is no carrying case, bag or box. It is nice and functional  It also comes with a complimentary ankh pendant, vintage style postcard and little thank you banner. [SEP] Nice sized & easily portable. The wood is not sealed. I believe it is made out of pine which is a very soft wood. It was packaged well & arrived safely. My only complaint is the dirt in the letter E in the top YES (see pictures). Otherwise it's perfect. [SEP] These appear to be laser engraved given the detail of the design. I thought I ordered the Triple Lunar Goddess design, but received the Butterfly with Moon. Both are designed for the same purpose, so it was no major consequence. The wording is large and clear and in its appropriate order and space. The design in the middle is more about something symbolic and you can make its meaning however you want. I don't recognize it from any archaic text, so my guess is that it's made specifically for this or it is something obscure that I am not aware of. The wood seems light and on the fragile side. Without even using it yet, I noticed when it sat flat on the table, it had a bow to it. Examining it further, the right and left sides are lifted off the table. This could be from the water being absorbed, or it was not cut flat. It has a thickness, but I feel like one would need to treat it with some care and it probably could snap easily. Luckily it does not need to go through much in the way of a stress test, so as long as it's away from heights, it should be safe. Its still a unique and pretty cool item, even if it's just for display. [SEP] The design on this is gorgeous. I got it as a present for one of my friends and I know she's going to love it. Everything is very simply laid out while being a work of art. [SEP] I have a nice handmade 5 inch believer and was in the process of looking for a good pendulum board when this came up in my feed.  I am in love with this board!  WOW it is large!  I was not expecting that.  It is the perfect size for my huge pendulum.  Whomever crafted the board did a great job and put effort into making sure it was perfect.  The picture is detailed and the words are clear.  I really love that it was kind of personalized with a little thank you card and ankh as a little gift.  The price for this board at the time of my review is $13.99 which is a great price.  I watch crystal live shows all the time and have seen boards not even half this size or this much detail go for way more.  I recommend this product. [SEP] I received the natural wooden butterfly pendulum board.  The board came wrapped well in an unpadded Amazon envelope through the USPS.  Because it's wooden, it arrived in good condition.  It's an impressive size. The pattern is laser engraved and very detailed.  Because it's a natural product, my board has a natural wood grain in it. The laser engraving does have some darker areas throughout the pattern and there is some darkened areas that were heated past the design leaving browned areas on the board, but overall, I think it adds to the beauty and uniqueness of each individual board. The back of my board is a beautiful, even piece of wood.  When I'm not using my board, I may just flip it over and use it as a platform to showcase my pendulums. Included with the board was a small thank you gift and included a post card (quite random design for bubble gum) and a small metal ankh with hanging loop that can be used as a pendant or on a charm bracelet.",3,True
"AyurForest Karela Powder, Momordica charantia | Bitter Melon | Bitter Gourd 1.41 oz 40 GMS, All Natural Non-GMO, Balanced Blood Sugar Level & Boosting Immunity",[],[],,4.0,27,303,"Bitter melon is a good natural medicine. It can help you maintain healthy blood sugar levels. It also helps to regulate lipid levels. You can make a tea or add it to your favorite liquid. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] I don't know why I keep selecting these weird powders when they appear on my list of items I can review. I really can't tell if they have any positive or negative effects on me after consuming. I assume they are healthy in some way so I dutifully add a spoonful or two to of them to my daily smoothies. I can't even detect that the AyuForest Karela powder is in my smoothie because it blends in smoothly with everything else and I can't taste it. You don't get very much of it though and the package is small.  I guess if you are interested in Karela powder you already know why you want it. I'll just tell you it tastes fine and mixes well. [SEP] This is a great supplement for lowering blood sugar and aiding digestion. You don't need to go to strange lengths to take it, it's not meant to taste like fruit. You don't need to hide it in smoothies or soup. Just add 1/4 tsp of this into a small cup of warm water 2 times a day and drink. It's not going to taste delicious, but it's really just like a slightly bitter tea. If you're used to herbal remedies, you won't be phased by this. If you're used to gummy vitamins, you probably won't like it. [SEP] I very much hope this works for me, because it addresses almost every issue that I see as a concern. I tasted the dry powder first, and was surprised to find it herbal and earthy. The bitter taste came after I added it to hot water and some tea. It remained suspended in the water for the most part, but I wouldn't say it completely dissolved. It was easy to drink, even thought bitter isn't my favorite flavor. I think it would be nice to add to soups, vegetable dishes, and smoothies, rather than teas, just because of my personal taste. The measurements are given in grams and, since I'm American, a virtually useless guideline for me. I use a light half teaspoon per dose and hope that's on track.<br /><br />I find that so many typically recommended supplements have done me little good, so I'm always willing to try something more unusual. Bearing this in mind, I feel comfortable recommending this. [SEP] I believe that bitter melon can help to control blood sugar levels. I can’t stand to drink bitter melon tea, but I can tolerate this powder mixed into my smoothies. The herbal taste of this is very slight. I think this is effective, as evidenced by me taking this and then eating something high in carbohydrates, but still having normal blood sugar levels right after. [SEP] I am a Natural Supplement Advocate and I am constantly learning and trying new things and this is one of them. It sounds like it can help with my Digestion, which is a big thing for me. It may help to keep normal Lipid levels and boost the Immune System too, so I’m looking forward to seeing if it does.<br />  It comes in a thick and Hermetically Sealed Ziplock Bag and the Label is well done. As with others in the Reviews, time will tell. I’m impressed so far! [SEP] I had hoped as a type 2 Diabetic that this would help me out. I just cannot get past the bitter taste. I suppose it would mix well into a smoothie which I will try next. However I will be looking to other things to help control my blood sugar. [SEP] This seemed a bit strong for my system - it takes very little so perhaps use additional caution when first starting to try this out in order to determine your personal tolerance. A little goes a long way. Personally this isn't something I use often because it's tough to find the right dose level. I also wish it were organic but having said that, there are clear benefits to the use of this and since it can be difficult to find in season, I really like the ability to find it in a powder form. I would buy again and enjoy the size - plenty to use without waste but not over done as it takes a minimal amount to get effect. [SEP] This is a resealable bag with bitter melon (karela) herb powder. There are no other additives. This mixes easily in beverages and can help a lot with some common health concerns. The taste is of course bitter, which is why it helps the digestive system balance sugars similar to how other bitter herbs may work in that way. The bitter melon fruit looks like a wrinkled cucumber and is something you can find fresh at some grocers. This particular item isn't organic certified. This is a good supplement to use and if you don't have access to fresh bitter melon then the dry powder is something to consider, although it is a bit expensive to buy it in this small amount. [SEP] This is a great supplement for lowering blood sugar and aiding digestion. You don't need to go to strange lengths to take it, it's not meant to taste like fruit.

Spotlight Oral Care Toothpaste for Total Care | Prevents Cavities & Desensitizes Hypersensitivity | Vegan & Gluten-Free | Active Ingredients of Fluoride & Pentasodium Triphosphate | 100 mL/3.4 fl oz,[],[],,4.1,43,1618,"This toothpaste worked great, leaving my mouth feeling fresh and clean, and not too dry (I tend to have dry mouth). As for the ingredients, they are vegan friendly, and the materials used in the container are ocean safe and recyclable. Bonus: made in the USA. Good toothpaste! [SEP] This Spotlight toothpaste says it's vegan and claims to rebuild enamel but I showed this to my dentist and she was skeptical. She recommends Sensodyne which has much stronger ingredients to fight tooth decay and eroding enamel. I suspected as much - I didn't like the texture of this toothpaste and though it does have fluoride (thank goodness), I don't feel the same sensation of cleanliness I get with Colgate Total or Sensodyne. It feels very mild and there is no foaming action. There are many obscure toothpastes like these on the market that claim to be ""healthier"" but I have yet to find any equivalent to what's already working for me. Oh well. [SEP] When I first opened this toothpaste, I found that it was very thick... meaning I had to press the toothpaste tube rather hard to get the toothpaste to come out.  But on the plus side, once you get this on your toothbrush, it isn't going to drip off.  As far as smell and taste, it has a pleasant smell and taste.  It's not overpowering like some tooth pastes, but it's not the most gentle either.  It does what it's supposed to do and cleans the teeth, and with the Sodium Fluoride I am sure it helps reduce cavities.  It's an okay toothpaste. [SEP] I ordered this because I'm currently using this brands whitening system & wanted a toothpaste that would help with sensitivity as well as remineralization. The thing is, it says nothing about desensitizing or hypersensitivity. I took off a star for that.<br /><br />The title at the time of ordering & of my review:<br />""Spotlight Oral Care Toothpaste for Total Care | Prevents Cavities & Desensitizes Hypersensitivity | Vegan & Gluten-Free | Active Ingredients of Fluoride & Pentasodium Triphosphate""<br /><br />I'm middle aged & have need to strengthen my enamel. I normally use Sensodyne for enamel repair. I like this toothpaste better than Sensodyne. I also use the generic ""Act"" remineralizing mouthwash at least twice a day. So far, I can't really say if any of it is actually helping.<br /><br />Anyway, this toothpaste has a nice clean minty taste that isn't too strong & it doesn't have that crazy rabid dog foam. The price right now is about double what it was when I first looked at it. I'm not sure what the deal is there. I'd suggest keeping an eyeball on it & nab it when the price is a bit more realistic as it's not worth paying $10 for a  3.5oz tube of toothpaste. [SEP] The tube came in a box that seems oversized for it, but the tube was undamaged (even if the box seemed a little beat up). The protective foil was easy to remove, which I like a lot; too many others seem glued on, you have to use a knife. Tasted like normal quality toothpaste, so no odd flavors or what have you, brushes well. [SEP] Doesn't taste bad or leave your mouth sticky, I've replaced my regular toothpaste with this [SEP] Spotlight Oral Care Toothpaste for Total Care is packaged and priced like a higher end toothpaste, so I thought I would give it a try. Maybe I’m just used to toothpastes like Colgate, but this toothpaste has a strangeness factor to it that I haven’t adjusted to yet. I don’t hate it, but I don’t love it either.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that it is thicker than any toothpaste I’ve ever used. I have to work at it to get just a little out of the tube onto my toothbrush. The consistency is somewhere between toothpaste and caulking. The second thing I noticed is that it doesn’t suds or lather much at all. I’ve never experienced that before. I wondered how well it could be cleaning without hardly any sudsing. If you are a messy brusher, this might be a plus. The third thing is the flavor. When they say mint flavor, they mean mint. I get the mint tingle through my whole mouth and lips. I’m talking about the Blistex tingle, not a mild tingle. It’s a bit too much for my tastes.<br /><br />All that said, when I do finish with my rather unique brushing experience, my teeth do feel very clean, more so than with my regular toothpaste. The clean feeling also lasts longer. I do think this toothpaste is overpriced for one that doesn’t contain whiteners. It’s ingredients are aimed at cavity prevention and plaque buildup, which are basic toothpaste functions. While it seems to work at cleaning my teeth, I don’t think I would get this again. [SEP] But this is you’re foolish and think it’ll whiten your teeth. [SEP] I got this toothpaste for my son. His recent dentist visit brought to light a cavity he has that apparently causes the need for a root canal. My son has complained of sensitivity with hot and cold foods. My insurance sucks and the dentist wants $700 so in the interim I was hoping this would help with the sensitivity. IT DOES! My son said he can barely notice it. Great product. I’d recommend!

This makes me feel better as us ladies have to take precaution when bathing especially with harsh soaps and dyes. They are definitely not ""LUSH"" quality but still work well and look nice.

I wouldn't say they are more moisturizing than other bath bombs but they aren't any less either.<br /><br />The presentation is really nice with this set and these would make a great gift. I can't find anything about these I don't like and I look forward to using the last few. [SEP] My daughter loves bath bombs and I thought these would be a nice surprise when she was home from college break.  They come nicely packaged and very giftable.  Unfortunately, she did not like the smell of them.  She said they were a very fake, floral scent and just never used the rest of them.  She said the bath bombs are well made and dissolve slowly in the bath tub. [SEP] These are so lovely. they come in a beautiful presentation box which should make them wonderful to give as a gift. I also love that each bath bomb is individually wrapped so you could easily break these up and give them separately. They smell lovely as well. [SEP] Was unhappy that it did not ship in a protective box. The gift was seen by the intended when delivered.

This is a great deal for this set, and I love how it’s ready to go especially for a gift! Good scents and good presentation in the box and would highly recommend this to others!

So, they are really easy to swallow and don’t take up much room in my pill box. It’s only been a week, so it’s hard to know if the vitamin is having an effect, but I’m pleased with the size and potency for the price. [SEP] These pills each contain 5000 mg of Vitamin D. That is 1250% of the recommended daily dose. Your doctor may recommend that you take a high daily dose for a time if you are Vitamin D deficient. If your levels are in a normal range, you may want to take one of these pills every few days or once a week. To maintain proper levels.<br /><br />The pills are small cylinders that are very easy to swallow. [SEP] My vitamin D was dangerously low about 4 years ago. I had to take a prescription Vitamin D for about 6 months then switched to 5000iu daily. Nice to have 6 month supply in 1 bottle. Small easy to swallow. During Winter it can be difficult to get enough Sunlight to keep levels up. Now during the Pandemic even more you want your immune system to be in good shape. [SEP] Much needed for these crazy times, helps me not be so fatigued from a vitamin d deficiency [SEP] This is a good dose of Vit D3, there easy to swallow<br />although not as small as some others I've tried, but good..<br /><br />I wouldn't say these are 'super strong' at 5,000 IU.<br />A different brand I like is 10,000 IU which seems to work well for me.<br /><br />Since Vit D is good to double up on sometimes during a health regiment<br />it's nice to have a product like this one that's just plain Vit D.<br /><br />> Googling - found it stated that 1,000 IU to 2,000 IU should help most folks<br />achieve and adequate blood level.<br />> And doses of more than 40,000 IU daily are usually required<br />before the issue of high blood calcium occur.<br /><br />Serving -1 = Bottle 6 months supply. [SEP] Working nightshift, my vitamin D stays low. I’m like a vampire lol. So I have to take a supplement of it. These are easy to swallow and don’t leave a bad taste. They keep my level normal. I recommend them. They are a good price too. [SEP] These tablets are 7mm wide and small enough to swallow easily. No side effects, and no aftertaste at all. I am taking two of these per day, the label recommends one per day. I always take 2 per day in the winter and I have not seen any negative effects from D3, only positive.<br /><br />I personally believe everyone should take D3 each day. Even 5000iu will help boost immunity and enhance your mood. Those are easy to see in my life and I haven't been sick for a couple years now and I think vitamin D3 is one of the main reasons. No COVID, no flu, or even a cold. I also take zinc and vitamin C daily as well as a probiotic but that's all. Nothing expensive or complicated. D3 has other supposed health benefits and of course you can get D3 for free from the sun by being exposed to UVB rays. I can't do that during our cloudy winters working in an office all day and one of the first things I noticed when I started taking D3 softgels a couple years ago is that my mood was better after just a few days and it's been more stable ever since.<br /><br />These tablets are not as small as other D3 doses I've taken, but they certainly aren't too large to swallow for anyone who takes any other pills. I suppose these could be crushed up and eaten with food if you are unable to swallow, I haven't tried it. I'm happy with this D3, there doesn't seem to be any toxic ingredients and nothing is genetically modified.",3,True
White Air Purifier and Dehumidifier Q10 True HEPA Air Purifier Purifier(200 sq.ft.),[],[],,2.8,16,7,"This is a nice basic sound machine. I have used sound machines for years now to aid in getting a quality night's sleep. I have been using Alexa for the past year or so for my sound machine, so I was actually looking for a machine I could take with me when I travel. This is really nice, super compact and can go everywhere. My deduction of a star is only because of the loop, I can her it when the system reaches it's 90 second interval. However, once I am asleep it is barely noticeable and has not disturbed my travel sleep. I will keep this is my overnight bag and will continue to use it when away from home. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:4fb8863b7bacf229caca45924b0227ba]] This is a white noise sound machine with a total of 6 sounds. It ""sits up"" like an alarm clock. I love that it is battery operated. I charged it overnight. This comes with a USB cable (not the typical micro USB; perhaps type C), the unit itself, and an instruction pamphlet. <br /><br />Operation is simple as per my video. Press and hold the on/off button for about three seconds to turn the unit on or off.  <br /><br />Rotate the dial on the front to move through the six sounds of brook, thunder, white noise, wave, wind, and bonfire. All but one sound is pure annoying noise.<br /><br />The timer can be set from 20 to 120 minutes. Each press turns on a light in the front of the unit and when the lights are off, it means the timer is off.<br /><br />There is a nightlight feature that only works when powered on. The nightlight button is in the center top. There are three light varieties that can be cycled through with each press and the 4th press will turn off the light.  The first press turns on a light dot that rotates around the dial. The second press turns on one side of dots, then turns off the top dot and turns on the next bottom dot until it cycles around the dial with half the dots on and half off. The next press keeps all the dots lit. This is what they call breathing lights.<br /><br />The volume buttons are on the right side top that can be used to increase or decrease volume.<br /><br />The current price of $16.19 ($26.99 minus 40%) would be extremely reasonable for this if I liked it but I do not. It has a limited musical repertoire that is more annoying noise than anything else and the nightlight feature is more of a series of indicator lights. I like the look of this and that it is battery operated. I also like the simple operation. However, the two most important features (nightlight and sound) are lackluster in my opinion. [SEP] This white noise machine isn't that great. The sound loops are probably acceptable to most but the actual volume of this unit is low even at the highest settings. It's usb-c at least which is nice but other than that I wouldn't recommend this white noise machine. [SEP] This was perfect for my trip to Vegas I just took. You can turn off the lights and set a timer which helped a lot. I couldn't tell much of the difference between a few of the sounds but it helped drown out the partying in the city. Perfect size for traveling! Can't wait to use it on my next trip. [SEP] ""White Noise Machine Afloia with Breathing Night Light for Sleeping, Sound Machine for Baby and Adult...""<br /><br />This device accomplishes its primary function, but it's held back by a few strange design choices.<br /><br />The sound loops are short, and there's an audible sound artifact in the splice between loops on at least some of the tracks. (The join sounds like a distant bird chirp.) It's not really very annoying, but it does come around every 90 seconds.<br /><br />The speaker quality is so-so. I've definitely heard better from other devices in a similar price range. It can be set fairly loud if you want but stops short of what would be dangerous for young ears I think.<br /><br />To select the noise loop, you just turn the front knob, and an associated light signals the selected loop. Unfortunately, the loops aren't visually marked on the machine otherwise, so unless you memorize where each loop is, it's kind of meaningless.<br /><br />Most annoying is that even though you can charge this while using it, the very dumb decision to put the charging port on the bottom of the unit means that you have to flip the machine over onto its back to charge it while using it. This particular design decision is really dumb. Also, the included cable is white but the unit is black, which just looks odd.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this device, but it does work as promised, in a basic, minimal way, which is why I think it deserves two stars. [SEP] Bought this to try to get a better sleep. It really helped a lot. The soothing music relaxed me so I can easily go to sleep without thinking much else. Will use it every night for sure. [SEP] It’s a cheaper sound machine, so small. Easy to bring with you in your travel. [SEP] This little round sound machine stands upright on two legs and takes up very little space on a desk, a nightstand, or in a piece of luggage. It is 3 1/2 inches in diameter and about 1 3/4 inches deep. It has a USB charger, and once charged, will run as a stand alone machine. You could run it plugged in if you lay it on its face or tilted it on it's side, but the charger provided will not plug into the upright machine because the legs sit too low for that. It's quite stable both on its side and on its face, though, so it's not a major deal. The operation of the sound machine is super easy. Hold the power button for three seconds to turn it on (or off), turn the front dial to choose one of six sounds (brook, thunder, white noise, wave, wind, or bonfire). Use the + and - buttons to adjust the volume, and use the button with the picture of a light bulb to turn the night light function on. The choices are one light, three lights, or six lights, and the fourth push of that button turns the night light off. The lights fade in and out in as if they are ""breathing."" The night light, even with all six lights on, is not actually bright enough to function like a night light in the traditional sense--even in total darkness, it does not light up the surroundings enough to be able to see anything except the lights themselves. I think it's purpose is more to give something rhythmic to focus on while falling asleep. The sound machine can be left on continuously, or you can set a timer for increments of 20 minutes ranging from 20-120 minutes. when setting the timer, the number of lit lights, 1-6, multiplied by 20 lets you know what length of time you've set. For a basic, easy to use, lightweight, portable, stand alone sound machine that can be used at home, at work, or while traveling, this little sound machine fits the bill perfectly. 5 stars. [SEP] Unlike a lot of sound machines, this one is rechargeable and can operate without a cord. That's a good thing because the charging port is located underneath the unit and the unit cannot stand up when the supplied USB-C charging cord is attached. The vendor really should have supplied a right-angle cable to fix this. At any rate, the sounds supplied with this unit are pretty good. There are 6 of them - forest, thunder, white noise, waves, wind, and campfire. Unfortunately, they're fairly repetitive on a pretty short cycle and you hear the pause as the cycle repeats. This is somewhat annoying. Other sound machines either blend the cycles or randomize them. There is a timer function that can be set in 20 minute increments up to 2 hours or you can run the unit continuously. There is a volume control but I couldn't tell how many volume levels it has. It goes from very soft to quite loud. The lights on the front can either be turned off or set to illuminate either 1,3,or 6 of them. When on, the lights ""breathe"" - go on or off. I don't want moving lights when I'm trying to sleep so I recommend turning them off.<br /><br />So I rate this sound machine as just ok. The sounds are nice but the cycles are too short. The best features are the rechargeability and the very compact size, which makes it great for travel.",3,True

Labeled ""Compostable in Industrial Facilities"" and that you should ""check locally as these do not exist in many communities."" It probably goes without saying that these are not suitable for backyard composting. The bonus is that these are made from renewable sources. [SEP] The true test of a disposable fork is using it with a tough cut of steak. These have held up well without any of the prongs breaking off. It is nice to know that they are compostable so these can be added in with the compost pile. Great forks (never thought I’d use those words). [SEP] Sometimes we often need a fork and don’t want to have to wash one up.<br /><br />Weighing the disposable factor against the use of water and soap for ONE fork is sometimes stressful.<br /><br />These forks eliminate that. 100% compostable and disposable.<br /><br />These are more like the “salad” size fork, but could be for smaller kids who can’t yet manage a bigger fork.<br /><br />Durable and better for the environment.<br /><br />Pretty happy with these and I know they’ll last a long time in my house. In the event I need to get more – I’ll definitely get these!<br /><br />FYI: The bigger fork is from a different set. These are the forks on the right. [SEP] These forks are amazing. I love that there is no plastic in them and that they are compostable . I’m not a big green person but I will do anything that I can to lower my footprint if possible.<br /><br />These forks are an amazing quality. I was concerned about the strength of the fork but I promise they are better than many of the plastic forks that I have used in the past. I am very pleased with them! [SEP] These forks came in a package with 150 in them.  Nothing was wrong with any of them.  They are sturdy and perfectly white.  Overall, I wouldn't know that they were biodegradable or made from plant based material, which is great.  They help the environment and work well. [SEP] Taking my lunch to work each day right now.  Real silverware is great, but then I have to bring it back home and clean it.  These compostable forks are just what I need for my daily lunches, which include assorted small entrees and veggies.<br /><br />These don't feel cheap or flimsy like some disposable flatware.  And the 150 pack will last me quite awhile. [SEP] These biodegradable forks are durable, strong and great for the environment. I like the feel of them and they seem as strong -- if not stronger -- than many traditional disposable cutlery pieces I've purchased in the past.<br /><br />This pack of 150 forks should last a while and are priced very reasonably. They can give you peace of mind that you're not wrecking the environment.<br /><br />And, even if you're not ""green"" minded, they are still a good value and definitely worth of five stars. [SEP] In an effort to be more green while also maintaining sanity with a newborn, I got a pack of these forks. We're really happy with the quality and they've held up well while we've used them - much better than some of the cheap, take-out forks. They're fairly small (short), but are perfectly usable for us. Really appreciate that they're biodegradable, so we can feel a little less guilt about using disposables. I feel these are a good value for the money, especially knowing they're a greener alternative. [SEP] These forks seem like they would be flimsy- but they are on the sturdy side. I wish they were bigger, though. [SEP] I love that these are compostable.  We love having these on hand for quick meals or when we do not need to dirty any dishes.  I do not like the waste they provide though, so knowing these are compostable is great.  They are a sturdy fork and great.",3,True

Like some others, I ordered this to try without looking at its ingredients and percentages... which seems to be a must lately with supplements.<br /><br />On top of this, this is one of the worst gummies I  have ever tasted. While not coated in sugar like some, it is larger and flat and not as chewy or tasty as any of the others. While the artificial taste of others may not be ideal, it is preferable to all of the sugar and lack of taste in these.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this as a supplement, but if you like weird consistency gummies and sugar you might like these. I am rating these one star. As always, your preferences and tastes may vary... [SEP] These gummies have a very pleasant peach flavor.<br />I don't consider this a stand-alone collagen supplement because two of these gummies contains 99mg of collagen and though there are no hard and fast rules regarding collagen dosage, it's recommended that 1.2grams  - 15 grams, (or 1200mg-15,000 mg) per day be taken for benefits to skin, hair, nails and joints. This gummy supplement is good to have on hand when you've decided that if you're going to eat sweets occasionally, it's going to have at least some healthy benefit. I used to eat a LOT of regular gummy candy and now I use gummy supplements for treats, instead. I realized that I was never going to completely give up sugar, but if I can combine it with vitamins or collagen every time - the benefits add up day after day. It's helped me lose some weight because I can only eat a couple of D3 gummies, a few collagen,  a few B vitamins, etc., but it satisfies my sweet tooth and I can tell by the way I look and feel that it's beneficial to me. I take regular supplements, but when I crave sugar I go for the gummies and this is one of the better flavors I've tried. [SEP] They taste nice but you're getting more than 5 times as much sugar as collagen.<br /><br />Get collagen powder and put it in a morning smoothie. If you want a gumdrop, just get the real thing. [SEP] These gummies come sealed and are fresh and squishy.  I actually like the taste and look forward to eating the 2 gummie serving each day.

Silicone Body Scrubbers Brush for Shower-2 in 1 Exfoliating Body Brush Bath Loofah Sponge Face Cleansing Brush Facial Cleanser Mat For Mens Women Exfoliator Massage (Blue),[],[],,3.1,83,1626,"This is a great body scrubber. It's gentle enough to use every time you shower, but it exfoliates really well too. There is a cellulose sponge inside and you can easily remove it and put in a new one when it  is used up. There are a few different textures on the silicone part if you need a different experience. I bet you could run the silicone outer piece through the dishwasher to sanitize it if you think you need to. [SEP] While I really like this design in some ways, the sponge is somewhat difficult to remove and replace because it is dense and likewise never seems to dry out because it is so dense. The sponge appears to be made from cellulose. The idea is that you squirt liquid soap onto the side with holes that lead down to the sponge. This creates a reservoir of soap that can be released when you squeeze the sponge. The soft silicone bristles feel nice on the skin. There is a slit in the bottom of the silicone casing where you can pull the sponge out. I initially tried hanging this bath brush in an airy spot with the sponge inside, but the sponge hadn't dried at all after 24 hours. I pulled the sponge out and put it in an airy spot, but it still took two days to dry out. So, if you use this every day, it's never going to dry out and will probably start to mold.<br /><br />I like the size as it is easy for me to hold while using. The side that doesn't have holes has projections that are a little stiffer and rougher, presumably get rid of dead skin or stubborn dirt. There is a loop for hanging or to put over your wrist when using it. The scrubber can be used without the sponge by squirting the soap on the bristles, but the scrubber doesn't hold its shape well without the interior sponge and so is more difficult to hold. I'm thinking of trying to find a softer, easier to squeeze sponge that might fit in this. The main body of the scrubber is 5"" long by 3"" wide by 1.75"" deep. Made in China. [SEP] Too large for average soap [SEP] The strap is on the opposite side of the opening.  If u hang it, the soap would just fall out. If I were to design this,  I'd have the strap on the same side as the opening and maybe one snap or zipper to keep the soap in it. I just cut the useless strap off because it just got in the way. [SEP] I like the thought of this a lot more than I actually like the product. Its really large so normal soap just falls out. I'm going to add a snap to the bottom and hopefully that keeps the soap in. [SEP] I bought this initially to try out as a replacement for the puff ball scrubbies.  I love it.  It is durable (unlike the mesh puff balls) and easy to use.  It is also good for people who are only able to use one hand for their grooming. When I wear it out, I'll definitely get another. [SEP] It takes awhile to get it into a lathering situation. and then I must be buying the wrong size soap or something but it's always falling out. [SEP] I love how it feels on my skin. And makes my soap last longer. It’s like a solid bar soap dispenser. Good product [SEP] I got this for my 7 yr old daughter. We have some other silicone wash product and she likes this one. I don't think it suds up well just like the other silicone product but she likes the feel of it and it's soft. so far it's easy to keep clean and no residual smell. Both my 3 and 7 yr old have used it and I might consider buying another one for their bathroom [SEP] This scrubber is amazing! I like the silicone material as well as the exfoliating nubs. It does a great job at giving me a deep clean feeling. I like the slot for soap and love how easy it is to suds up. The loop is great for hanging it up and it stays clean too. I like that I don't have to worry about porous surfaces and bacteria etc. All in all, I would highly recommend this!",3,True

[SEP] Used in conjunction with another weight-loss muscle-building regimen, and use these with another vitamin supplement too. Would say these were effective, and was far easier on the stomach. Only bad thing was when the bottle was empty. Need to order more. They taste like candy! [SEP] These gummies smell pretty nice.  Pretty fruity.  The gummy itself is maybe a mid-firm gummy - so they are nice and chewy.  They are shaped like little gum drops - cute!  They taste nice too - like a mild candy meaning the sweetness is not overpowering - it just tastes very, very nice.  I wish these came in snack form. : )  There is no taste of Vinegar at all - which is great as ACV is so good for you but Vinegar literally causes a gag reflex with me.  So this is a great way to get my daily dose of ACV!<br /><br />They are sort of sicky and moist.  Not a deal breaker - maybe that is the added green tea.<br /><br />Also love that they are clearly marked Vegan friendly. That is what I look for.  If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.  Thanks! : ) [SEP] All of these gummies seem to be stuck to each other. Possibly that came from overheating during shipping? They also have a gelatinous mouth feel to them; that might be the wrong word, but I have to be more careful to chew these thoroughly than other gummies, otherwise I'll be swallowing three unchewed chunks. I do like the taste; it's inoffensive, a bit faint, but what's there is good.<br /><br />I was really hoping to like these more, as I love the idea of green tea being added not only for flavor but for extra benefits, but the texture is really disappointing.<br /><br />Came well sealed. [SEP] These actually taste really good.  They smell like vinegar but don't taste like it.  As far as effectiveness, I'm still on the fence.  I've been taking for two weeks and don't see immediate results of taking these, but I also suffer from an iron deficiency and started taking iron at the same time. I'm hoping to see the effects of both as my body gets caught back up!  Will definitely get more. [SEP] Great flavor and value! I keep these on deck [SEP] These gummies taste kind of like strawberry and they’re very sweet. I use to put 1/2 tsp of apple cider vinegar in my water to help me lose weight and it has helped a lot but it tastes awful. These gummies have solved that plus more with the green tea. I’ve noticed I’m more alert after taking this. Really happy with this product! [SEP] I loved the taste & texture but I also got some extra energy & had no cravings throughout my day. I’m ordering more right now! I found 4 gummies a day work best for me. [SEP] I'm usually quite skeptical of ads for products like these. However after reading so many positive reviews and hating the taste of ACV, I decided to order some through Amazon. They taste amazing and in two weeks I've already seen an noticeable difference in my dry skin and rosacea as well as my metabolism. I highly recommend these. They're a little pricey to some, but you truly get what you pay for. [SEP] Goid flavor, hands down my favorite way to take in acv and the green tea is a great match.",3,True

A friend turned me on to the pain relief of Turmeric Curcumin  with Black Pepper. I've been using it for two years now it has the right combination. I now walk 2 miles without any pain at all. I take one a day. [SEP] I have been aking turmeric curcumin with bioperine for several years... along the way, I have been trying all different brands, and am not loyal to a specific brand.<br /><br />This product is comparable to other brands out there with the MGs and capsule size. I really like that these are made with organic ingredients and no fillers. They do smell strongly of turmeric in the bottle but im happy to say they don't taste like anything or do not burp up any taste. They are gentle on my stomach when I take them in the morning on an empty stomach and are easy to swallow.<br /><br />Not sure why they are packaged in a plastic bag, to me that is wasteful. Love the name by the way! 120 capsules of good quality turmeric curcumin with bioperine for under $20 is a great value! [SEP] The brand seems to have changed names twice since I've been using it and the new packaging is the same bottle they have always used but now it is also placed in a sealed heavy plastic bag...very, very wasteful and such a poor use of plastic for a company putting out 'organic' items especially. They already had a seal on the bottle and the cap is wrapped in a plastic band so the bag is truly wasteful. Also, I believe the mg in each bottle has changed at least twice...I believe 3 times...just seems sketchy since it was not advertised to have changed, I only knew by reading the package.  That said, it seems to work perfectly well, I just may start looking for another brand that gives me more confidence and less waste. [SEP] I love the massive amount of time turmeric in these capsules! Turmeric is a wonderful, all natural, anti-inflammatory, joint pain fighting machine! Most brands that I’ve looked at have under 1000 mg per serving. But I was looking for a product that packed a bit more of a punch and this product was the winner! Each serving of 3 veggie capsules contains over 2000 mg of turmeric as well as black pepper for maximum absorption. It’s organic and each bottle contains a months worth of capsules. [SEP] I'm a bit confused.  I've decided to take just 2 (at 1,500 mg) of the Gods Greens Organic Tumeric Capsules because I'm not sure what's the correct dosage for me.  I had been taking a different brand of Tumeric of 2,100 mg for 3 capsules, but now have started only with the 2 GGs capsules.  (According to the GG bottle - 2,250 mg total for 3 capsules....a lot more!)  The literature here also mentions that this GG Tumeric is 1,100 mg per serving, see what I mean?  Doing some research, the consensus seems to be an average of 1,200 to 1,800 mg per day, or another opinion at about 500 to 2,000 mg per day....what to do?  This question arose because I've also started taking a homeopathic natural skin supplement formula that includes 300 mg of Tumeric per day.  All of them include the black pepper for better absorption.  I just don't want to overdose, so I'm sticking somewhere with the average.  Anyway, I think Tumeric is a very good way to help with osteoarthritis, high cholesterol, itchy skin, and it also helps the liver, and has good anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.  So far I'm pleased, and am hoping that my inside and outside will reap the benefits.  4 stars because of my questions.  This Company appears to be one of the better ones, as they don't use any fillers in their product.  Thank you for that. [SEP] These turmeric capsules came in a bag that offered information about the company that produces them. to me this show that this company cares about producing a high quality product and wants you to know exactly what type of ingredients they are using in their products. These even have a 1 year money back guarantee if you are not happy with the product. I am very happy with this product. they are a great quality. I do not get any gross taste or after taste in my mouth when taking these capsules. I would recommend these. [SEP] So I am the average middle aged over-weight white guy.  I have an Indian friend who swears that Tumeric is worth its weight in gold.  She puts it in and on everything.  I swear she sprinkles it around the house like fairy dust.  One time she even cut her finger open and she sprinkled Tumeric on it. I still wasn't a believer.  I tend to put it on a few things like scrambled eggs and that spicy chicken.  So I figured one day what the hell, I'll try these little suckers out since I tend to take a handful of vitamins every day whether they do anything or not.  It makes me feel like I'm leading a healthy lifestyle with minimal effort.<br /><br />So I added these to my daily regimen and then one of my other friends came over and saw, then she ordered and started taking them at night before she goes to bed.  She swears that they help her fall asleep almost immediately at night.  She takes them with niacin and said it knocks her out like Chris Rock. I just like taking pills so I take them with my multivitamins, red rice yeast, vitamin e, niacin, and Vitamin b12.  Now I just need to get my picture on the cover of the Rollin' Stone. [SEP] I can absolutely feel the difference in my shoulder when I take these pills. They are a little large, but are easy to swallow. You should definitely take it with a bit of food if you have a sensitive stomach. They do not leave an after taste like some turmeric supplements. I would recommend this brand. [SEP] Helps with inflammation; easy to swallow and seems to help calm your stomach [SEP] If you're looking for an organic turmeric supplement, look no further.<br />We keep turmeric in our house and have added this to our vitamin cabinet.

Water Flosser and Electric Toothbrush Combo - ZoCCee 2in1 Oral Irrigator/Sonic Toothbrush - Suit for Home and Travel,[],[],,4.0,56,15892,"I love that this is suited for traveling coz I am crazy about my teeth. The brush head and electric toothbrush feature are just ok, I guess I can’t complain. The water flossing is easy to use but needs time to get use to specially if a kid is using it - it could be really messy. Now the plaque remover is the least usable one. If you don’t know what you’re doing you’ll end up chipping your teeth or gums, can easily cause sensitivity if not careful, I avoid this tool because of this.<br />Overall it’s decent, not the best kind but if you’re wanting something easy to pack for a long trip this will be it! [SEP] The toothbrush charged very fast. My teeth felt squeaky clean after using the brush and floss. The different heads all store in the little bag provided. Battery lasted a long time [SEP] Lasted less than 4 months;  usb charger port died.  Real shame;  love the portability and use of a water glass as the reservoir.  Rest of unit also pretty sturdy but really disappointed it only lasted 3 .5 months [SEP] We use water irrigators (water flossers) every day and when we travel, we miss using them as they are too bulky to carry. I recently got a travel irrigator which I loved and did not think it could be topped but, while I wouldn’t say that this tops it, I’d say it’s comparable but different.<br /><br />The key feature(s) to this unit is that it combines irrigation with brushing and periodontal care (more on that later) in one very small product, the size of a standard electric toothbrush. The other product that I like is single-purpose, just irrigation. Unlike this unit, it does not have the capability to brush or be used as a periodontal pick. On the other hand, that unit is stronger and includes a built-in camera for checking your work as well as UV lighting to sterilize the tips and water reservoir. While both are great, I think that on my shorter trips I will take this, and when I am on a longer trip and have more luggage room, I’ll take the other (which means also taking my toothbrush).<br /><br />This product draws the water from whatever reservoir you use so it can be an 8 oz cup or a gallon jug. How much water you use is up to you. The other unit has a relatively small reservoir and I usually need to refill it once in order to get a good cleaning. This product knows when you choose an irrigation tip or the toothbrush or periodontal tip and the options on the handle change accordingly. On the brush and the periodontal tip, your choices are High or Low and when you use the irrigator you have the choice of Normal, Soft, Pulse, and DIY.<br /><br />As mentioned, the irrigator is not quite as strong as my other portable, but it is certainly strong enough.<br />The toothbrush has the High and Low settings, no timer as my toothbrush has, and the periodontal tip is also high and low.<br /><br />A word about the periodontal tip; it works, and it works well. It will remove plaque quickly and effectively. However, I don’t necessarily recommend that you use it if you do not have a strong and steady hand; this can rip the hell out of your gums if you slip and with the vibration, that’s a very good possibility. If you are able to control it, it’s something I’ve not seen on other units and it’s great. But it can also be dangerous; use it with caution.<br /><br />Although it looks short in some of the pictures, the hose that you clip onto any reservoir is long enough to allow you to move around as you floss.<br /><br />This also comes with a soft carrying bag to carry the tips and hose with you.<br /><br />If I had received this before or when I received the other unit (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09KLM695X - SORRY, as of 1/1/2022 this product is no longer available), I would have named them both “2021 products of the year”. Which you choose will be dictated by your priorities but they are both great products.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Review of: Oral Irrigator & Toothbrushes & Electric Periodontal Probe Combo - ZoCCee 3in1 [SEP] I got this for my husband because he has been needing a new toothbrush since his electric one is getting pretty old and funky.<br />This is pretty cool because he can use it as a toothbrush, but also has multiple heads to change off and be able to water pick as well. He is really bad at flossing, so the water pick option is something he actually likes and uses more. Says it makes his teeth feel more fresh and clean after brushing. Squirts away and excess gunk stuck between his teeth or gum lines. It's also easy to throw in the travel bag and take on the go. Is nice to be able to brush and floss at work or vacation. [SEP] Nice toothbrush, softer vibration than my sonicare had which I like. Like the all in one brush + waterpik feature. Don't have to have two units on countertop. Do wish it had a stand. Came with two water floss attachments but only one toothbrush. Need to research how to order replacement brushes. Nice traveling bag comes with it. [SEP] This has a great little carrying case for when you travel, just pack it up and go. This is also great that is three tools in one, electric toothbrush, dental probe and water pic. Great idea that you use your own glass for the water, just make sure when you get through with the water pic you flush the hose out and clear the water pic of water. This will keep it nice and clean and sanitary. The only thing that I really don't use is the dental probe, I'm afraid I might damage my gums'. Great tool to take care of your teeth with! [SEP] I like this travel toothbrush for the flosser feature. You don’t need a cup to actually use the flosser, you can put the end of the flosser in your cuffed hands under running water and it picks up the water and you can floss. The bristles on the brush are soft, softer than my Phillips electric toothbrush bristles but it still gives a good clean. My teeth felt clean after using it. It comes with a pouch for storage.<br /><br />The only con would be getting replacement brush heads. It didn’t seem like an easy task to find them at my first search. [SEP] It’s an electric toothbrush, it worked fine for weeks then came apart. Now there’s no way to put it back together. [SEP] I was intrigued by this kit, which promises to be “portable” while also offering the unusual combination of both oral irrigation (Waterpik type function) and brush mode.<br /><br />What you get in the kit is a rechargeable handle, two irrigator heads, a toothbrush head, and a periodontal probe, a short charging cable, and a rubber hose that connects the handle to a water supply for irrigator mode. There’s also a cheap soft-sided carry bag.<br /><br />The function of the handle changes depending on whether a toothbrush head is attached or an irrigator is attached. For toothbrush mode, you have Low and High settings. For irrigation, you have a a few different settings (Normal, Soft, Pulse and DIY).<br /><br />The handle is pretty chunky, but no more so than a low end Sonicare toothbrush.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />** Both toothbrush and irrigator modes<br />** Toothbrush mode works fine<br />** Irrigator tools are small and can be packed for travel<br /><br />What could be better:<br />** For irrigator mode, you need to run the rubber hose to a glass of water. The hose isn’t that long, and the first time I tried it, I accidentally pulled the glass to the ground.<br />** The handle is a bit too clunky to be attractive as a portable toothbrush<br />** The toothbrush head uses a non-standard connection to the handle, and it isn’t clear where you will get replacements.<br /><br />I didn’t try the periodontal probe. I mentioned it to my dental hygienist, and her response was: “Put something like that, vibrating rapidly, near your teeth? You’d be crazy! But I’m sure the dentist will like the extra business when you chip a tooth or damage your gums…”<br /><br />On the whole, I’d say that if having a portable version of an irrigator is what you’re looking for, this may fill the bill. But if the brush is your main interest, look elsewhere—the handle is chunkier than I’d like, and the brush heads are non-standard.",3,True

[SEP] Our bottle arrived with a leak and over 1/3 missing.  We contacted the the buyer who said they would replace but we never received it.  The product we received works well. [SEP] My husband bought this to clean aluminum trailer. Was not impressed [SEP] Cleaned my oxidized aluminum trailer great. First it on, let it set for a few minutes, wash it off. When you wash it off, wash well or it will streak. [SEP] does brighten up aluminum but you need to make a strong batch for it to clean and brighten! [SEP] Follow directions and rinse well your wheels will look new. I followed with White Diamond polish for aluminum wheels all I can say is WOW!! [SEP] Spray on, wait 4-5 mins, pressure wash off. [SEP] Great at cleaning aluminum. It will eat clear coat off paint and aluminum so be very careful. It cleaned our projects very well. [SEP] The most impressive product I’ve ever used for anything. Let me try to be helpful, I had a 2 gallon yard sprayer and I mixed 1/4 of a gallon to 2 gallons of water and it was more than potent enough to do what I needed to do. The pontoons on my boat were stained really really dark, I sprayed a little on the front quarter to test it and when I came back out five minutes later there were white lines straight down it and I got worried. I rinsed it with water, reapplied, and when I came back out it looked much better. I rinsed that off and I reapplied a third time which takes all of 20 seconds, when I came out the third time it was completely clean and shiny. I thought there’s no way it’s that simple, but it was. I sprayed all of the aluminum on my pontoon boat, rinsed it all and repeated three times and the results were absolutely amazing. I would highly recommend applying multiple applications for best result.  I’m not going to lie, this stuff got on me during the application process due to some windy conditions, it tingled a little bit, but it didn’t hurt anything at all. It doesn’t seem to be hurting my grass where my boat is sitting, but the aluminum is insanely clean and shiny. Of course you do need to come back with a polish after this process is done. I highly highly recommend this product. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:73d800649d12fd2f4be4633707bc654d]] Acid cleaner works fast. Rinse off hard pressure water 20 seconds after spraying on.",3,True
Spa Massager with Hot Bubbles,[],[],,3.5,28,19929,"Picked this up for the madre and she loved it! Lately her feet have been hurting and she's getting up there in age. Don't tell her that... So this was the perfect little gift for her that me and my grandma can 'borrow' at times too. Compared to the older ones my mom would use, this one is much more lighter. Having temperature control with massaging, is just perfect! It's gotta be a thing with everyone where that foot massage water just gets cold after a while. With temperatures dropping that also means, foot bath times drop considerably. This massager fixes that with a temperature control! If you start with warm or hot water, there's no wait time. My lazy self just starts with cold and give it some time to warm up which is also an awesome feature. The jets and massaging feature is a really cool touch and really I've been loving it just as much as my mom. Even my grandma finds great novelty with it so get it! [SEP] As a person who works a lot on their feet all day, I was greatly looking forward to having this motorized foot spa for my aching feet. I will say it has nice heating function, but the bubbles are so minimal and the motor on the massagers barely work or agitate. For the price I really would think it would be better quality and have better function but unfortunately it seems to have fallen flat.<br /><br />I really like that it comes with accessories and some Epsom salt but I feel putting the Epsom salt in there might be a bad idea and could clog up the unit itself. For me in this particular case I'm better off getting a tub of heated water and adding Epsom salt to it.<br /><br />I really will say I like how it folds up making it easy to store, so that's a really great feature.<br /><br />If you're looking for a functional and reliable heated foot soaking massager I would definitely shop around first. [SEP] This footbath was surprisingly impressive. I was concerned with the collapsing body that it would maybe be flimsy, but the unit is durable and structurally sound. The body does indeed collapse for easy storage, but the walls are thick so it stays firmly when set up. First time set up and usage was simple, just fill with water and turn the unit on. I used already warm water from the tap and the heating feature worked well. The jet and massage features were a nice touch and the remote is a nice feature so you do not have to bend down to change settings (nice for those with mobility issues). Design wise, the bath was big enough but the added features made for a strange almost divide in the footbath which was awkward for the rest of my family as their feet were larger. They mentioned it was not annoying enough to outweigh the benefits from the warming and massage features. It comes with a carrying handle but I would not recommend using it after the bath is filled, as it can become fairly heavy. All in all, I am extremely happy with the footbath and look forward to using it more [SEP] [[VIDEOID:29445873499496fee62fdd247ed607c0]] Set up was a breeze. I put hot water to begin with so it didn't have to work too hard to get up to temperature. The foot massagers were nice and gentle. It comes with Epsom salt but I wonder if I could add essential oils to it later? I love that it folds to a much smaller size for easier storage. These days I regularly walk 20000 steps so I feel the need for reprieve at the end of the day. Having this foot spa is a nice luxury. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:5be7b1289c76fd0f67eae63f79c8d949]] This is the best foor spa I've ever used in the comfort of my home.  I think the massagers in the bottom work great.  There's three different settings to choose from or you can turn them off. I really like the bubbles.  It will heat up your water but I'd let it heat to your desired temp before putting your feet in. Definitely give it little stir to make it heated evenly.  Make sure to fill it with hot water so it doesn't take too long to heat up.<br />I used it with the included Epsom salt and it was fine. I only used 1 gallon of water so I only used an ounce of the salt. I generally don't love lavender scent but this isn't bad at all.<br />I don't think the remote is the smartest idea but it is nice not having to bend over it while you're using it to change settings.  If you lose the remote there is a button on the bottom that allows you to still use it with limited functionality.<br />But really the only thing I don't like is that there isn't a drain. It was a pain to get all the water out when I was finished. [SEP] This is a nice foot spa and it gave a good and relaxing soak. It comes with a wireless remote so you don’t have to bend down to adjust settings while relaxing. It also comes with some Epsom salts (lavender) and pedicure tools which was a nice addition. The foot spa worked well and kept the water nice and warm. I filled it to start with hot water and there was no issue with it keeping the temperature. It does recommend using warm water to make it quicker to get to temp and in my case there was no issue keeping it hot! The only downside I had was with the rollers on the bottom. These work well but using them it moves your feet around way too much. You can’t have it just roll under your feet and massage it, instead it pushes them around and you have to keep moving back on top of the rollers. This takes away from the nice experience and I found I turned them off half way through. It was still great and relaxing overall though. In the end it was nice to collapse it and put it away, taking up much less space because it collapses down. I can’t wait to use this each week! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:8331cc87ee546238bf9d23c9bd164992]] For a long time I wanted a collapsible bucket to clean my feet, so when I saw this option I was very motivated to experiment.<br />Points to highlight:<br />1. the product was completely to my liking.<br />2. The design is adequate.<br />3. Easy to use<br />4. The rollers work very well and are relaxing.<br />5. The factor of having a control helps you control the functions without having to move down to set it.<br />6. you can completely close the bucket, since it has a removable lid.<br />7. offers 3 modes of rotation or levels... I could go on.<br />It is comfortable to use  and relaxes me. In addition, the rollers help me to loosen the dirt while you are soaking with the salt that this spa kit includes.<br />For me it was helpful and everything worked properly. The additional tools it comes with are sharp, care must be taken when using them, I have skills using these types of accessories and still, I got hurt.<br />Watch out! It is convenient to store it because you can keep it foldable.<br />It also comes with a handle in case you want to move it around.<br />I liked it and am grateful to have it. 🤗 [SEP] The collapsable design is very nice, so I can put it away because I am using it once a week. For the foot spa, it is so relaxing. I filled it with hot water, and it kept the temperature the same for the whole time, which is the only problem with a traditional bucket when the temperature goes down very quickly. The roller massager is an extra feature, I like to have it roll and pause. The bubbling function is very interesting, I am very ticklish, and I am surprised I still handle it and like it. It comes with a remote, it is the only way to control the setting. The problem is the infrared sensor location, you have to lean forward to use the “remote”. Another concern is the cleaning and drying process, it is not easy to dry at all. Other than that, it is a great foot spa. [SEP] Very nice device, very relaxing feeling, I love the massaging and heat features. Really helps me relax and relieve my stress. It is also collapsible and has a remote to control it. I like it! [SEP] The best thing about this is the heating function.  In theory, this is nice but it just doesn't work for me.  I feel pulling it up and collapsing it over and over will eventually fail.  The massagers I found to be a bit too rough on my sensitive feet.  The back of my legs resting on the back of the bucket was uncomfortable.  I'm short though so if you have longer legs, you may not have this problem.  The remote is nice to have.",3,True

They are easy to chew gummies. Try these! [SEP] These gummies have a nice flavor. I was intrigued by the ingredients and the supposed benefits, as it’s a new concept to me. I’ve been taking them for over a week now, and I have noticed a slight difference with my mental sharpness. I have a million and one things going on as a teacher and parenting a toddler, so it can be overwhelming at times. I’ll take any boost I can get, so these are probably going to be a regular purchase for me going forward. [SEP] I was so bummed. I take other Pink Stork gunmies and they all taste pretty close to their stated flavor.

I used to feel badly for our guests, but then I started keeping a basket with sleeping masks on the nightstand. The masks are always new, but for frequent visitors, I keep their chosen masks in a  labeled Ziploc baggie for their next visit. The masks have always been adult sized, so now I am happy to have one that will fit my preteen niece.  This is a thin mask, but it's very soft. It has a soft, fuzzy fleece fabric which is the same on both sides. The elastic strap isn't adjustable. I did try it on and it did fit snuggly on my large head, but it wasn't tight. It does block out the majority of the light. The dalmatian design is sweet. I think these sleeping masks would make a nice gift. [SEP] My 7yo loves this mask! Her room faces east; so even with double curtains, the sun still peaks in most mornings. Since she's had this mask, she's enjoying sleeping in! Not to mention, it's adorable. We'd both recommend it!!! [SEP] My 6-year-old loves wearing a sleep mask to bed. This one is so cute and comfortable she loves it. The material is really soft and it stays on all night long. The fact that it's Disney makes it that more special and loved. [SEP] This sleep mask is one of the most adorable ones I've ever seen. It has a 3D effect because the floppy ears are attached separately to the mask and jut out. It's really cute and would be appreciated by dog lovers as well as fans of the Disney movie. The price is a little high for this type of thing but otherwise it's a fun sleep mask, especially for children. Now if only they made a cat version based on ""the Aristocats"" [SEP] I love the design and the softness. [SEP] This sleep mask has the markings just like the dalmatian pup. The ears are 3-D and fold over the face mask but are secured with loops of thread. The inside of the ears are both pink while one is black on the outside and the other is white. Everything on the mask is either embroidered on or a different colored fabric which makes it that much more durable than sticker types or appliqués. The eyes and nose have been embroidered on. They are tightly stitched and a vivid black color. The inside and the outside of the face are as soft white fabric. The strap for the eye mask is black and has good stretch.<br /><br />This is a really sweet sleep mask and could fit a younger kid or an adult. I personally wear it with no problem for fit. My kids recognized the character right away as it has been very well done and looks just like the puppy. Definitely a fun but practical sleep mask. I also machine wash on gentle. [SEP] This eyemask is very cute, and would make a nice gift for a child/person with a small head. While this stayed on my head all night, I felt like it was very tight on my eyes and I couldn't fall asleep with it on. I did put it back on in the morning when I was tired and wanted to sleep in, and it was useful for when I was already tired. I will really only use this for when I wake up and want to sleep in. [SEP] I have several high windows in my home that don't facilitate good sleep lighting conditions during the day. This mask has worked so well for me when I need to rest. It's soft, comfortable, and blocks out the light I need to sleep comfortably. The elastic doesn't pull on my hair or become tangled while I sleep. Plus, the design is adorable! It looks like it will clean well with a simple toss in the washer. If there are any issues with washing or drying, I will be sure to update the review. [SEP] This is so very cute!

As mentioned earlier, the single temperature indicator will change colors respective to the heat level.<br />Also displayed on the battery bank is the battery status indicator lights: Flashing (0 - 10%), Low (10 - 35%), Mid (35 - 70%), High (70 - 100%). These setting are indicated via the three blue lights (0/blinking lights, and 1 - 3 steady lights for the four instances).<br />The use of graphene allows for a relatively thin heating pad. This enables a lightweight device, that is conforming to the body’s curves. It fits comfortably, with excellent, consistent contact.<br />These are all noteworthy features. However, the highlight component is the battery capacity. The battery capacity is rated at 3000mAh. Indeed, to my knowledge, it is the highest capacity battery for the product genre. This generous capacity provides up to 6 hours of operating time. According to the manual, it takes 3 - 4 hours to fully charge a depleted battery.<br />At the current cost of $28, it seems very reasonably priced, especially considering the battery specs. Factoring in the various features and quality of design, materials and construction, it’s a very good value.<br />The significant other gives this device a strong favorable nod. Thus, based on these initial impressions, it earns a well deserved 4.5+ star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] This is a very nice portable heating pad for abdominal cramps and pain. The size is very convenient and you are able to wear the heating pad under a sweater or shirt. The pad has a pocket to hold the battery and so the heating pad is very portable. The pad can be adjusted for different sizes and to make the heating pad more snug around abdomen. The battery charges up quickly and seems to have a good battery life. The pad heated up quickly and the 3 stages allow you to adjust the temperature to a comfortable setting.<br />Pros: Adjustable size<br />  Wearable/Portable<br />  Warms up fast<br />  Battery compart for easy travel<br />Cons: Nothing to report [SEP] Some of these charging ones don’t really get hot enough. This one I actually got to keep me warm at outdoor sports events. This is going to work perfectly. [SEP] I have had many heating pads and I really love having them on hand to use for any pain. This one is great due to the flexibility of being able to walk around with it on. No need to be plugged in and immobile. The battery charged pretty quickly and easily tucks into the pouch. The material is comfortable and doesn’t irritate my skin. It heats up very nicely and does exactly what it’s made for. It’s adjustable to fit your body and can be used just about anywhere on the body. So if you are looking for a great portable heating pad, don’t look any further. [SEP] The first thing I like about this heating pad is that it is very lightweight. It is not big and bulky nor heavy. You can use for cramps or for back pain. The area of heat disbursement is not too great either. It does not cover the whole abdominal area. Just the lower left and right quadrants but can be moved to cover other areas if needed. There is a portable charger that you insert into a little pocket and connect to the heating pad. Then there is one button you push to turn on and change the heat setting so it is very easy to use. You can change the heat setting to 3 different levels. The heat setting at the hottest level is not too hot that it burns the skin. There are 3 different colors to tell you what heat seething you are on and also a battery indicator light. This feels very nice and soothing.",3,True

Otherwise,  solid product from Amazon. [SEP] Pretty standard Tupperware. This is a great bulk option if you find that folks aren’t bringing back your borrowed containers. I just wish there was more than one size. [SEP] These are used all over hour house. From kitchen to the craft room, and many places in between. My husband even uses them for stuff in the garage and his electronics. They're sturdy and hold a lot. I also love that you can see through them easily. [SEP] These containers are very similar to Glad or Ziploc products.  While they are reusable, they definitely feel like the kind of product that ends up being thrown away after a few uses.  If you want to decrease your plastic use or help the environment, glass bento type boxes are probably the way to go.  That said, these are very convenient.  They have two separate sections for food.  They seal well.  I did have some issues with the lids warping in the dishwasher.  Overall, for the price, a decent product.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, please click YES below.  Thank you! [SEP] These crack very easily in the freezer. Most of mine have ended up in the recycling bin. [SEP] Great for freezing food, just don’t drop them when they are frozen haha. So far I like them and the fact that they don’t leak. [SEP] I used these in combination with these (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9ES1Z9?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) hanging storage ""shelves"" in the awkward space behind my shower fixtures. They work great for the purpose and for perfectly on each shelf. [SEP] The Solimo brand hasn't let me down yet, and these containers are nice and sturdy.  They're perfect for giving leftover food to guests or to food in the fridge or pantry.  They hand-wash well, and are re-usable.  The lids also stay on nice and tight.  I have never tilted them upside down to test their leak-proofing, but they haven't leaked on me yet. [SEP] Great value, another great Amazon product [SEP] I received divided storage containers that have two compartments—one side 16 ounces (large enough for 2 cups of liquid) and the other side 8 ounces (one cup of liquid).  They are very similar to the reusable storage containers made by the major brands but more affordable.  The lids fit tightly and have a lift-tab to help in removing the lids easily.  They are dishwasher, microwave, and freezer safe—which is very convenient for advance meal prep, storage, and then you can eat right out of the same container, dirtying the minimum number of dishes.  These are packaged in sets of 3 and come 18 in total (6 sets of 3 divided containers, each with a lid).  The divided compartments are particularly convenient for advance meal prep—I can store a casserole on the large side and a biscuit, side dish, or dessert on the small size.  I can freeze a bunch of them ahead of time, take them one at a time out of the freezer in the morning for that day’s lunch at work, let them thaw during the morning, and then heat them in the microwave at work for lunch, then toss them in the dishwasher when I get home at night.  A great way to save money eating the healthy food that pack myself instead of buying lunch every day.

Gophra 15 Stage Shower Filter with 1 Cartridge Replacement (1+1) Remove Impurity from Water,"['easily use for anyone', 'amazing', 'high quality and favorable.', 'IMPROTED']",[],,4.5,40,12,"I live in Florida where hard water is definitely an issue. I just purchased my house last September, and recently retired, and I am trying to be careful on spending money. Many of my neighbors have been installing whole house water systems and although I do think at sometime in the future I will look into it, this filter has helped me at least in the shower. I can tell the water is better since I installed it (yes, installation was super easy for me) and my hair feels so much softer and I see less spots on the shower glass doors. For the money, this is a great shower filter and I highly recommend it. [SEP] I don't like putting this on my showerhose. It adds extra weight, and that would seem to be detrimental to the shower hose. I like the ones that are built inside the shower head. To me, this is less strain on the hose. But, I like the job they do in the shower. [SEP] This filter is working fairly well in our shower.  Hubs isn't tall so it didn't affect him, but I am tall and it comes to just a an inch or so above my head.  I can still take a shower but the shower spray is not as diffuse as before.  Installing the filter was basically a no-brainer.  Take off shower head, install filter apparatus (even plumbing tape is included), put shower head back on.  We don't have a hard water problem here, but I like knowing a lot of chemicals are being filtered out.  I don't know how long these filters will last but I will be ordering more just to have on hand. [SEP] I installed this in my shower as we have very hard water to the point that it will etch the glass of the shower and no amount of cleaning it can get it clean. I installed the shower head water softener and noticed a BIG difference very quickly. I had to use less soap and shampoo and my skin felt cleaner and less dry after a shower. The glass shower enclosure also looks better as now I can clean the glass and not have the hard water stains. [SEP] I have a shower filter by one of the more prominent makers.  The problem was it restricted water flow a lot, and the filter replacements cost as much as this whole assembly.  I couldn't believe the filtering tech going on here. Fifteen stages , really, and designed in an order to filter out the bad stuff and finish up the purification in the end.  It probably doesn't filter our fluorine, bus that is something that some people like and others do not.  It generally needs a reverse osmosis filter to remove it anyway.<br /><br />Like my other shower filter, I thought this (especially with so many stages) would slow my waterflow in the shower to a trickle.  It did not do that the flow although slightly restriced was nothing like my other filter.  This one lasts longer too 4-6 months per filter cartridge and you get too.  I didn't price them, but since the device and two filters cost more than one filter replacement from my old shower filter, I figured I could not go wrong here.  The water even tasted good when I rinse my mouth (I usually brush my teeth and shave while showering).  I love it, recommended.  Frankly if they can get this much water flow for a shower filter, why not use these types for those passive filter pitchers I have in my fridge.  It might take a bit longer to filter through, but the result would be worth it. [SEP] For those on the fence with filtering water in your shower, you should consider as your skin is the largest organ in your body that does absorb all the containment’s you shower with on a daily basis. This bundle comes with everything u need except for one small item, vaseline.<br />Bundle comes with silver plastic screw chamber, two filters, 2 screen washers, water tape, instruction booklet. I usually add some Vaseline to the inner ring washers to protect it from the hard water and prolong its life. I love the multistage filtration that this filter provides. Upon using for a week I felt the difference on my skin not being as dry and my hair being more manageable.<br />Overtime I hope the plastic chamber holds up and the silver shine finish doesn’t fade away. That would be my only concern at this time. [SEP] Nice small shower filter. Super easy installation. We plugged this into our Air bnb shower to help reduce the chlorine smell during showers. Works great for reducing chlorine, though I am not sure that a filter this small will last very long. With the whole family using the same shower, I expect we will need to change the filter cartridge in a month.",3,True
"Daarcin 3 Sizes 60pcs Mixed Resealable Foil Pouch Smell Proof Bags,Mylar Ziplock Food Bags for Daily Life Storage",[],[],,4.6,31,2139,"We had an infestation of pantry moths in our pantry and had to throw out a lot of dried food like crackers, cereals, some dried figs and items that are high in carbohydrates.  The rotten little monsters could smell what I had in zip-loc bags and burrowed right through them to the food.  Besides waging serious war with the moths, I've placed a lot of food items in these smell-proof bags in the hopes if there are any moths left that we didn't eradicate that they will not be able to smell the food through the bags and thus burrow into them.  So far it seems to be working but we also having found any moths stuck to the fly strips we hung up in there either so that's a good sign we might have gotten them all.  These bags seem well made and should last a long time. [SEP] At first I thought the Daarcin pouches were really cool until I started working with them in a well lit area. The foil reflects light very harshly and brightly into your eyes. Front side or back, it doesn’t matter, you are going to get beams of light in your face. They do seal very well and are quite tough but I like my retina too much to get more of these. If you don’t have sensitive eyeballs then they are quality bags. [SEP] Great for sealing good or crafts supplies. [SEP] These bags are Heavy Duty -- I put them to good use immediately!! They all stay together in one big storage envelope until needed -- they are good looking, zip closed securely, and the silvery backing showcases the contents very well. They are strong and keep their flat shape as long as you don't over-stuff them.<br />They are worth the expensse because I think they will last me a good long time, used or unused.<br />They are so flat that I am able to put the ones I have filled-- into my file cabinet where I can easily find them when I need them.<br />And although I have not yet used them for food I feel secure in the fact that whatever I put inside (dried beans, dry rice, dried herbs) will be protected and air won't be able to get in. [SEP] u get 3 different sized bags in this package of 60.  I measured the bags at home, but they are a little smaller in capacity than the actual bag size.<br />12"" x 8""<br />8"" x 5.75""<br />6"" x 4""<br />one side is see-through and the other side is a bright, shiny, silver color.  they do a great job sealing in the freshness... and they r smell proof.  I put some spices in the smallest sized bag.  I also use this size for M&Ms on the go or if I haven't finished a slightly larger bag.  u could also store AAA batteries nicely in the bag.  the photo provided above is the medium sized bag... I figured everyone knows what a package of Ramen Noodles looks like so u could kinda measure the size of the amount of storage u r actually getting.  the largest bag could hold a pound of pasta in it if u wanted to junk the cardboard box.  I always keep my pasta in the fridge to prevent the bugs from coming alive inside the box... its always funny to me that my boyfriend didnt know what the plastic window of the front of the box was for... A. to see what shape it is and B. (the most important thing) to make sure its not full of BUGS when u purchase it!!!  I really dont like taking up the space with the box, so I will be keeping a large bag in my fridge for pasta storage.  I hope this was helpful. [SEP] The order comes with bags in three different sizes for variety of use. The back part of the pouch is like silver reflective/like foil and the front is clear so you can visibly see the content inside. They are pretty thin but are somewhat heavy duty and does not break easily as compared to zip lock bags, especially when packaging food. I usually resort to these bages to pack dried snacks and tea leaves. They secure completely and sealed tight to protect the content inside. I like that I can share with my friends and it looks store bought. [SEP] These Daarcin 3 Sizes 60pcs mixed resalable foil pouch zip locks bags are nice quality and are very well made. I am using these to store dry nuts and also to organize my Jewelry, so far they are holding very well. The sealing strip is really tight and they can be reused several times. I love the clear window design so I can see what’s inside without opening it. Three different sizes fulfill the different needs. They are very useful bags for any storing needs. [SEP] These Mylar bags work great for keeping your favorite herbs and spices blend fresh. It also minimizes the smell of the finest greens in the bag out of scent of prying noses. The are also fairly durable and can take a beating as wel as multiple open and close cycles!",3,True

They fit most of my shoes, and really make a difference in keeping me walking straight, with good posture.  So far, I am having less knee pain, and I can see some improvement in lower back discomfort.  Standing for any length of time was always a trial for me, and I can see improvement there as well.  Glad I tried these. [SEP] After going to the store and getting on a Dr Scholls kiosk, I saw that the CF340's would be perfect for me.<br />Since putting them into my shoes, I've noticed less lower back pain.<br />I also suffer from knee pain so I'm hoping that these inserts will help with that also since I am on my feet almost the whole time I'm working.<br />One thing I did learn when using inserts is to take out the shoe inserts before putting any other insert into the shoe.  This way your foot won't be lifted so high up that your toes are scraping the top of the shoe.  Since learning that little trick, I love Dr Scholls inserts.<br />So much comfort on the bottom of my feet and it's really helped me with some of my body aches I've been having.<br />I like getting the double pack.  Makes it so much easier putting a pair of inserts in both my shoes so I don't have to keep switching them from shoe to shoe every time I switch shoes to wear. [SEP] These are OK but not as good as promised.  These particular ones have kind of high arches and even though they're soft and squishy they don't really protect your feet that much if you're on them all day.  Of course as someone with diabetes my feet aren't all that great anyway so maybe for more normal people they help better. [SEP] Very useful for foot pain, I've used Dr. Scholl's throughout m life with the occasional foot pain issues.  These orthotics saves one money and can bring relief for common problems.<br /><br />Visit the Dr. Scholl's kiosk to get the recommendation based on how you weight bare.  I've had problems with plantar fasciitis over the years when I haven't stretched and stayed limber.  I'm long legged, good arches, and skinny; however, weight can be a major cause of foot pain.  Even a little weight loss can significantly reduce the force on the feet.  I've also had inflammation at my metatarsal heads from wearing poor shoes- worn out sandals and working in the yard.<br /><br />I like these in my work shoes because they give my foot added arch support and cushion- heel and metatarsals. [SEP] Great insoles. Exactly what I needed! [SEP] Bought these for my husband. He loves them. They make standing and walking much more comfortable. [SEP] Did not resolve my plantar facsciitis issues, disappointed but not surprised. [SEP] I was starting to get bunions on my big toe and have always had foot pain - I wear heels to work.  I ended up getting these and they have taken away my foot pain completely and fit in the bottom of my shoes without anyone noticing.  I need to get a few more pairs for my shoes at home, because I don't like transferring them out of my work shoes... [SEP] These orthotics are great.  I have purchased many orthotics over the years including ones from foot doctors, but these are the best.  My foot pain went away after using them for 2 days.  You have to chose the correct one for your foot situation first. [SEP] I decided to try these orthotics to relieve foot pain I've experienced for years.  These are fairly large, but luckily fit my boots perfectly.  They stay in place pretty well, I do have to adjust them in the show every couple of days.  I have found I no longer have arch pain in my feet, so I am very pleased with these orthotics.",3,True

It is not cluttered with stevia or other additives.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I am thrilled to have this without lots of extra flavors and enhancers added.  I only wish it was a little fuller. [SEP] The directions say to dissolve in hot water first and then top with cool to drink.  It is more specific in the measurements and the size of your mug.  I added a scoop to a teacup and then added a splash of water – just enough to dissolve.  It fizzed up a LOT and at first, I was worried it would overcome my teacup but it did not.  You may want to use a bigger vessel just in case.  It fizzed and foamed for a bit as I stirred.  Once it was half as foamy, I added cold water and drank it right down.  It dissolved fully.  It was actually PACKED with flavor so next time I really will prepare in a larger cup or mug and add more water too.  It was actually a very pleasant flavor and I could easily drink this as a drink to actually drink and enjoy.  Very pleasant.

"Root Vitality Liposomal Vitamin C Capsules - VIT C - High Dose - 1450mg - 120 Pills, Ascorbic Acid, Antioxidant, Vegan Collagen Supplement, Non GMO, 2 Month Supply",[],[],,4.6,143,2143,"I have purchased a lot of bottles of Liposomal Vitamin C but of other brands because of Covid-19. My whole family takes liposomal vitamin C instead of regular vitamin C for one main reason. Liposomal vitamin C stays in your system much longer and is not excreted or used up nearly as quickly as regular ascorbic acid type vitamin C, which is what most people take. The liposomal type is best because it will stay in your system to continue giving protection from viruses. I learned of liposomal from watching health oriented Youtube videos. This brand is every bit as good as the other brands I've taken and and you need no less that 1500 mg each day, and we take even more. This type of vitamin C costs more, but it's definitely worth the extra money. Easily 5 stars and more. [SEP] This time of year and during a pandemic, Vitamin C is Vital. This has kept me healthy so far. [SEP] I'm happy with this product. It's working well for night cramps, and I've had no unpleasant issues at all.<br />I take C, liposomal, because I heard about it and was told that it works better. I think this is true. I take a lot of headache medication, and can get quite a few migraines. I tend to bruise easily which is really bad. As I get older, I don't want to see any bruising. This supplement type, liposomal, seems to make a huge difference in bruising. I do notice a slip when I no longer take it. I haven't settled on a brand as I'm new to this but I've noticed good results and rapid results with this product. It's a competitive price as well. It can be very expensive. 5 stars. [SEP] Vitamin C is famous for many things, including cancer-fighting, immune-system building, healing, anti-viral, anti-Covid and so on. And yet, high doses can not only go right through you, they often upset the digestive system as well.<br /><br />Researchers now know that the best form of Vitamin C to take is ""liposomal"" -- that is, combined with a fat so your body can absorb it. This Root Vitality product combines each cap of 1450 mg of Vitamin C with (non-GMO) sunflower oil & lecithin. In our experience, that means you get a healthy dose of C that doesn't upset your stomach or cause extra bathroom trips.<br /><br />These days, with the Covid virus around, as well as all the usual flu and cold bugs, we make it a point to take high-quality Vitamin C every day, and we prefer this liposomal form for ultimate absorption.<br /><br />Recommended. [SEP] These vitamins have no smell really as well as no taste - so that is great!  They are also clearly marked Vegan on the bottle.  This Vegan LOVES that!  They are on the larger side of pills but I, personally, had no trouble swallowing them.  If larger pills are an issue for you try drinking it with a lot of water to make it go down easier.<br /><br />They are a higher dose than most vitamin C's out there. Usually I do 250 to 500 mgs daily - with more (during normal times) in flu and cold season to boost immunity.  These are 725 mgs each.  The dosage says to take two - but I will just take the one at 725 most days - unless I need to really boost in my immunity.  The good thing about vitamin C it is like the only vitamin you can't OD on as any excess your body easily urinates out.  So no worries you will get too much either way.<br /><br />These are a very easy way to get your vitamin C! : )  Plus they are liposomal - that means your body more efficiently uses and absorbs them.  You gotta love that!<br /><br />If you thought my review was helpful - why not click the ""Helpful"" button.

They seem to do what they're supposed to do. Not sure how to judge vitamins. Good, I guess. [SEP] Product as described. Did not really notice any difference. I feel good, and have not been sick, so I guess it works. Thanks [SEP] I've heard great things about liposomal technology, so I decided to give it a try.  I'm no health expert, so my information is really based on the little I've read about it.  Apparently, vitamin C taken in larger doses cannot be absorbed as well by the cells.  When this happens, much of what's ingested can easily get flushed through our system and down the toilet (yellow pee, anyone?).<br /><br />If what I'm reading is correct, liposomes wrap around the vitamin C, so that they can be absorbed by the cells much more easily.  When this happens, the vitamin C better does what it's supposed to do - boost the immune system, give you better skin, and fight tiredness and fatigue.  I imagine during this era of concern over Covid-19, it wouldn't hurt to find better ways to boost one's immune system.<br /><br />One thing that makes me wonder about this particular product, though, is this: If liposomes are like a kind of nano technology that encapsulates the vitamin C, what exactly is meant, then, when it says that these specific capsules do not contain genetically modified organisms?  I may just have ""liposome technology"" and ""genetically modified organisms"" mixed up all together, so I probably just don't know what is meant by ""genetically modified,"" and why this particular brand, being not GMO, would be superior to its rivals on its use of liposome technology.  Nevertheless, I still have this question.<br /><br />So another question for this specific product is, does it work?  Well, I don't know. I suppose I may not know the answer to that question until many months later, if I paid close attention to my skin, level of fatigue, and immune system.  Is my urine still yellow?  I take other vitamins other than this one, so I can't use this as a marker, either.  What I think, though, is that if liposomes seem to be as great as they are supposed to be, it probably wouldn't hurt to use it as a means of boosting my vitamin C absorption.<br /><br />Finally, a word on the labeling - white font on a yellow label makes for a *really* hard read, especially if one does not have great eyesight.  I strained even with my glasses on, so I might encourage the makers to use another font color over their yellow label, in order to see the words more clearly. [SEP] I have not use it yet, will update my experience with this product when I get a chance to use.  What I do like about it very much is, the packaging and label states NO ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS, NO PRESERVATIVES, ETC ETC, meaning no harmful added fillers, which is my major concern when buying vitamins these days.",3,True

The problem is these are like plastic grocery bags in terms of thickness. You need to be very careful as these year fairly easily. I do like the goal here though and that is why feel the product should still be supported. [SEP] These are nicely done compostable bags. The material is thick enough to deal with an acceptable load (e.g., full, but not overstuffed full) without breaking. They are sized fine for a 13 gallon container. It would have been nice to have an extra inch or so of length for an even better fit, but as-is I'm finding them to fit without any significant issue provided they are placed carefully when initially put into the can.<br /><br />If you were to compare these to conventional plastic bags with regard to strength, ability to stretch and puncture resistance, these would clearly come up short. But they are not plastic bags, they are compostable bags. On that basis, they are very well done, with enough strength to be useful but still retain the ability to break down.<br /><br />They come on a single roll with perforations between each bag. I've not had any problems tearing off the bags without damaging them. There are no ties, either provided separately or built into the top of the bag. Again, that's not a con since these are compostable rather than traditional bags.<br /><br />Very helpful to have when dealing with compostable material or even run-of-the-mill trash.  Well worth considering if you need a compostable bag in a larger size. [SEP] These are wonderful trash bags!  They have a rubbery feel to them and are very stretchy.  They easily fit over our standard size kitchen garbage can with no fighting necessary to get it stretched over the top rims.  They don't come with wire ties and aren't designed with flaps to tie so if you over fill it you really have to mash the trash down to get enough bag to tie together or buy some wire ties separately. [SEP] They tear very easily, and without drawstrings you can only fill them 3/4 of the way up before it becomes impossible to tie together. The sides often puncture inside the trash can, over something as soft as a pizza box. If they made the bags thicker, and perhaps added a drawstring, they might be valuable as kitchen bags, but they are simply too brittle as they are now. [SEP] Not as durable as the ones we were buying that were out of stock [SEP] I have used the smaller size and liked them, so I decided to give these bags a try.<br />The larger size scared me a little, as I was afraid they may not be able to handle the strain of a larger load.  I have yet to break one, but I have definitely been a little more careful than usual.<br />If the biodegradable and compostable features of these bags is important to you, get these bags.<br />If you're the type to stuff as much as you can get in your trash bags, pass (especially if you have wet garbage). [SEP] Most compost bags are between 1-3 gallons.  Our composter is about a mile from the house, so tiny bags are a pain because we tend to leave them outside where they get invaded by ants before we feel like taking them out to the compost pile.  And anyone who composts knows those bags (unless pure paper) don't ever really break down in the composter.  With these large bags, we can put about a week's worth of compost in a large 13-gallon stainless steel trash can before having to trek it out to the compost heap.  I have tried several brands, this is a keeper. I need a compostable bag that holds up for at least a week. These bags did not leak, tear, smell, or break down. I like the small box it comes in that fits small kitchen draws.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] I wanted these bags because they say they are compostable but they tear when I. Put one in the trash can [SEP] They are good bags but not as strong as I wanted them. [SEP] They work great but they will leak after about a day if there are any liquids in it so when you use them, USE THEM! But they seem to break down pretty well in my compost bin",3,True

[SEP] These are listed as being made from bamboo charcoal mesh. I'd never heard of that before, so I was a little worried, but it turns out these feel like every other soft-ish loofah I've ever used. The charcoal doesn't make gray suds and leaves no color transfer.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have noted, these loofahs are huge. They're also very, very dense.

I don’t like the taste well enough to just mix with milk, but in my vanilla yogurt, frozen blackberries, splash of apple juice smoothies, it is just fine.<br /><br />As far as pain relief, I haven’t noticed any at all. I have an autoimmune arthritis, which the reason I tried this, but haven’t had any reduction in pain. This probably takes time to work, like glucosamine does. I intend to keep using it and will update. [SEP] Great Flavor [SEP] I add this to my coffee in the morning, very good but a bit sweet for my liking. I will update my review with results when I'm finished with the powder :) [SEP] I discovered collagen powder a few months ago when my friend heard about it online. It is rumored to have really crazy good effects on joint pain and digestion concerns. It does so much more than that!<br /><br />I am a 27 year old female with connective tissue disease that causes hypermobility in the joints. I have the least severe type of the disorder which means most people just start taking narcotics to help with the joint pain stemming from the joints coming out of socket frequently. I didn't want to be in my 20s and strapped to a narcotic pain med for the rest of my life. I worked through the pain, went to physical therapy, did yoga etc. It all helped, but I still found myself taking muscle relaxers on the regular to help out which turned my stomach into a nightmare of it's own.<br /><br />I started collagen powder and the first week I was disappointed, like anyone with a chronic problem I wanted to start feeling better immediately! Week two I noticed less stomach problems. Like significantly. I could eat food without fearing the wrath of my digestive tract. Week three I noticed my hair was softer, fluffier, and felt like it was snapping less. Week four I realized I grew my nails out for the first time in my whole life. Week five I didn't have to ice my hands after teaching and writing on the board. Week six I was running without knee pain and woke up the next day without needing a muscle relaxer.<br /><br />I don't think an over the counter product has ever made such a difference in my life. This powder specifically has a great taste and is easy to mix in to my morning coffee without thinking about it. If you have joint pain, stomach issues, brittle hair/nails, or skin issues...try it. It blows biotin out of the park I promise you! [SEP] my favorite, except price bounces all over the place.  like the one with protein peptides best!  mixes well. need only 1/2 scoop!  has only collagen 1,3,5 i think, the right combo bc you are not supposed to put all types in one mix.  no taste! [SEP] Collagen supplements help by giving your body amino acids which help replenish the body’s collagen supply.  It’s no mystery that as we age we lose collagen, so by supplementing with Collagen we are able to help repair ligament and tendon injuries (which was my primary interest) as well as helps give you stronger nails, thicker hair improved circulation and wound healing.  The lists of the benefits of Collagen goes on and on.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across the 『Neocell Super Collagen Powder』, which comes in a plastic  jar. Inside, you'd see this coffee creamer powder like texture & this particular one was vanilla. The recommended daily use is a scoopful (scoop provided for easy measurement).<br /><br />My main motivation to try this Collagen powder is 1. For my hair & nails - they've been cracking at the tips, 2. For my joint pains: suffering from chronic lower back & knee pains. Through my own research, collagen, provides several benefits as we age:<br /><br /> * Improve Skin Health<br />* Helps Relieve Joint Pain<br />* Could Prevent Bone Loss<br />* Promotes Heart Health<br />* Hair and Nails Health*<br />* Promotes Gut health<br />* Brain Health<br /><br />Trouble is we lose collagen as we age, so taking collagen supplements help replenish the much needed nutrients. Taking this can not be easier, not only it looks like your regular coffee creamer, you can use it like a regular coffee creamer - just add a scoop to your cup of coffee or tea & start reaping the aforementioned health benefits<br /><br />The VERDICT<br /><br />I've been taking for about two weeks, and I see my hair shinier & more importantly for me, my nail fingertips don't crack anymore.<br /><br />😋💓💞💯🔥👍 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED💪👍💪💯💞💕 [SEP] Nothing [SEP] I have been drinking this with my coffee every morning for the last 2 weeks and have seen no changes yet, but the French Vanilla makes my plain coffee taste delicious. Hopefully some visible changes in my skin will start showing up soon, as I would like to see my skin and hair look a little fresher. [SEP] I have tried many collagen powders. Including the popular vital brand powder. The great thing about this collagen besides it’s known benefits that actually make a huge difference, you only need one scoop and it’s flavorless fine powder dissolves easily and is trace less! Add this to your juice coffee tea etc! Super crucial for our joints, healthy hair skin and nails! Definitely try this collagen if you’re looking into starting or changing. [SEP] Stevia was not listed as an ingredient, and I’m not sure that it was the ingredient that caused dizziness, confusion and passing out, but I must be reimbursed nonetheless. Not a good product for me at all. I’m going to the doctor to see if any permanent damage has been done!",3,True

Before I drank it, it was nicely chilled. Sadly this did not help the overall experience. I know it has a lot of good for you ingredients, but sadly I couldn't stand this beverage at all!<br />It says zero calories, zero sweetener, zero carbs, zero sugar, but sadly I have to say horrible flavor!<br /><br />To me this is a complete miss. I struggled drinking one can of this and now I have 11 more in my fridge. I wish this would have been better. Now I wish I would have gotten the variety pack to see if any of the other flavors would have been better but I didn't. [SEP] I got a free sample of the Dragonfruit flavor. It tastes like how a Band-Aid smells. I can't think of how else to describe it. I didn't realize it was a healthy drink when I popped the can open and just thought it was another brand of LaCroix'esque sparkling waters. After the first foul tasting sip I looked at the can to see exactly what I was drinking. After seeing that it claims to be good for you, I decided to give it another go. I couldn't get past sip number 2. Truly one of the worst tasting beverages I've tasted. [SEP] We can't taste anything in this drink.  It tastes just like Seltzer water to me.  Hubs thinks it tastes bitter.  I just can't see buy cans of seltzer water despite them looking chic and interesting in the lunch room.  When someone asks if they can taste it they're going to say they don't taste anything. [SEP] I have Type II diabetes, so am always looking for ways to cut my blood sugar levels. I was offered this product for free as part of the Amazon Vine program, so I did not really pay any attention to how much it actually sold for. Once I got to the point of writing a review I ended up having to take it into consideration though.<br /><br />This product is basically just 99% carbonated water with a few amino acids and chromium thrown in. If you have any half-decent diet or take a decent daily multivitamin you are already getting hundreds of times the amount of aminos and chromium that these cans contain and more than you actually need, so it really is not adding anything that you are not already getting.<br /><br />The rest is just carbonated water, which has an extremely nice taste and texture to it, but is cheap and easy to find at your local grocery store. I can buy 12 oz cans of carbonated water (flavored or unflavored) at Safeway for less than 25 cents each per can. Yet this product sells for more than $2 per can, which is absolutely ridiculous. The Safeway water tastes just as good and comes in a wide variety of flavors. I'm sure that big box stores sell carbonated water for even cheaper than this. While this product tastes o.k., there is nothing ""magic"" in it and absolutely nothing that would justify paying 8x as much for it as you could find elsewhere. [SEP] this product is fabulous. There are three flavors.  A lime, mango, and a dragon fruit. That is my favorite. It has all natural flavors, curbs that midday hunger and carb spike. Oh and it tastes great. [SEP] I have been looking for some new drink to incorporate into my daily diet because my doctor recently told me I have Pre-Diabetes and need to control my blood sugar levels.<br />So I tried this...............but I could not even finish one can of it......nasty taste IMO....still looking for a new drink... [SEP] Being a keto fanatic, I naturally fell in love with this zero carb beverage. I've always enjoyed lightly carbonated drinks, and this stuff hits the spot. Its refreshing, its nicely flavored (not at all overpowering), and it makes me feel good. As far as the health benefits go, I'm not sure how the Chromium actually affects the blood sugar levels, but from what is stated on the can, it normalizes blood sugar spikes, which is great! [SEP] Liked the taste of the dragon fruit water. A little sweet for my taste but my friends like it! [SEP] I like the taste! [SEP] The drink is just okay and I can consume it with some foods but with others it makes them taste odd and ruins my meal<br />There is a metallic taste that is unpleasant, especially with cruciferous vegetables. In particular, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and cauliflower. Also green beans almondine - although I don't know if it was the vegetable or the rather complex sauce that bothered me.<br />I tried drinking a can AFTER a meal and was only able to consume about half before that metallic flavor rrejpelled me.  It reminded of the taste the exposed base metal of a silver-plated spoon where the silver has worn away.",3,True
"Notebook Black, A5 Journal, Large Hardback, 296pp | 80gsm | Black 8.4 x 5.7 inches",[],[],,4.7,44,237,"This is a typical hardcover journal. It is nicely bound and has a ribbon bookmark so that one can locate the page of where they left off. It is also ruled. The only thing I do not like is that the date is on the right side of the odd pages. There is a date and page header on each page. On the left side of the book, these are located on the left. However, on the right side they are located on the right.  I would expect the date to always be on the left, no matter whether it is an odd or even page. It also would have been nice if they numbered the pages automatically since one is unlikely to remove pages from this nicely bound book.<br /><br />Other than this, this is a nice journal that is built to last. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:9d1bdfa498f7e797c9925b70552e31f9]] I love journaling and I am a stickler for paper feel. I was hoping the pages of this nicely bound hardcover journal would have a smoother and softer feel, but it is more like sketchbook or book paper with a rough and scratchy feel. It's just okay, but not my favorite.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much 😊 ** [SEP] This notebook is very well made and the quality shows in every aspect of the design. The cover is made from a denim-like material, the pages are nice and thick, and I love writing in it! I have been using mine for a writer's notebook, but it can be used for anything. I love that the pages have a place for the date, but it isn't obtrusive. [SEP] If you want a permanent or semi-permanent journal for any reason, but you don't want it to be covered in butterflies or skulls, this is a very nice, sturdy journal.  The paper is an ivory color, tending toward a bit yellow, and the markings are a medium rusty brown.  There is ""Date  Page""  at the top of each page, which you can use or ignore, depending on how you want to use the journal.  It is lined, and the top and bottom lines are a little bit darker than the ones between, with tiny marks that can be used for paragraph or column/tab guides.<br /><br />The book doesn't lie completely flat when you open it, but it's still easy enough to write, but you might need to anchor the page with your wrist as you write.  The paper is matte so it accepts a variety of inks.<br /><br />This isn't the type of journal where you can rip out a page or two and expect it to go unnoticed, so if you use this to write nefarious plans that you don't want seen or reveal that you sneaked out 4 times this week, you're gonna have to swallow the whole book.<br /><br />The ribbon is a nice touch, but not quite nice enough.  It's quite thin, but it's also not quite long enough.  I want a ribbon I can pull out of the book and mark my new place without having to open to the old page, and this isn't long enough.  Still, it's a nice, sturdy book.  Whether it is a good value, you'll have to judge for yourself.  There is no current price listed at the time this review is being written. [SEP] A nice sturdy journal. Comes in nice packaging. [SEP] Very nice well made journal. I have already started writing in it and look forward to using it more. [SEP] This is a quality notebook.  The cover has a good feel to it - maybe a bit slick but not TOO slick.<br />The paper feels ok.<br />The pages lay FLAT.  Very easy to write on.<br />I wrote with pencil and then erased.  The paper seemed undamaged.<br /><br />This was well packed. [SEP] The binding is starting to come out and I don't even use it everyday. I have used less than 30 pages (front and back sides). It is the perfect size notebook for documenting meeting notes. [SEP] good size [SEP] This is a basic notebook. The cover texture is a little rough, but the pages look good and will work well for journaling. The bookmark feels pretty cheap. If you're looking for a notebook with a lot of pages and no frills, this might be a good option.",3,True
"Snore Stopper, Snore Care Set of 3 Nose Vents, Dilator Set Snore Solution for Comfortable Good Sleep and Ease Breathing, Includes Travel Case and Reusable Nose Filters for Man Women Pollen Allergies.",[],[],,3.0,42,8195,"I snore and so does my husband. I cant figure out how to keep these in place with my mouth shut. I snored the one time when I had them in. They were in place because I was absolutely wiped and fell soundly asleep but my mouth opened and i started snoring and woke myself up.  Haven't been able to get them to stay in since. Awkward and not comfortable. [SEP] I got these for my mom as she tends to snore very loudly and snores so hard that she wakes up choking often. She and my dad sleep in different rooms because of it. She used these for one night and while she said they are very comfortable and didn't impede her breathing at all, my dad said it made no difference in her snoring. I guess this may help for people whose snoring results from a deviated septum or something similar, but for people whose snoring is due to airway obstruction in the throat, it does nothing at all. [SEP] Items arrived today defective. Would return and request replacement if I had not tried them in my nose. Thought one of the other sizes would work.<br />*See pictures [SEP] I've used breathe-right strips in the past to help get better airflow through my nose while sleeping.  They work well but the cost becomes a burden since they're disposable.  Decided to try a nasal dilator and got this.  I see the potential and it work somewhat, but it needs improvement.<br />The first issue is the little tab that holds the two dilators together.  It's super short and keeps me from being able to insert the pieces far enough into my nostrils.  I ended up cutting the strip and separating the dilators, which helped a bit.  The second problem is that the tubes need to be a little longer for my nose.  They don't reach quite far enough into my nose to completely open up the airways.  Thirdly, I find the blue filter inserts to be counter productive.  They reduce airflow, which is already the issue they seek to fix.  I got rid of them immediately.  The last thing is that these don't always stay in my nose overnight.  The extra-big ends that remain outside of the nostrils keep them from getting a good tight seal for me.<br />Despite the above complaints, these still help.  They might work better for someone with a smaller nose.  Ideally the tubes would come with plenty of length and could be trimmed to size to fit the users nose more suitably.  These are okay, but could be better. [SEP] really seen no improvement [SEP] These arent meant for those with large noses for sure.  I cant keep any size in since there isnt enough space between the two.  But in any case they just pop right out even if I just have one in.  Not sure how they think this will work.<br />Sorry thumbs down  :( [SEP] Seems great. Do not buy them for your girlfriend and then expect that she'll wear them. She's not, gonna continue just to snore like a wild boar.",3,True
Mood Light Garden Deco Ball (Light up Orb),[],[],,3.0,25,21904,"I bought these for my daughter's new pool. I thought they would set a romantic mood. They are not bright and they must be turned on and off. I have also read they leak though ours haven't. But they were cheap so I though they would be fun for a Summer or two. [SEP] Much smaller in person.. Expensive item for that size!!  Picture is misleading .. I would not buy these again ... [SEP] These lights look really nice floating in your pool at night; however it is difficult to determine how to turn them off. Instead of an up-for-on and down-for-off switch you push one button in and out, sounds simple I know, BUT that same button also controls whether it stays on one color or changes to other colors AND controls the speed of the changing colors (slow or fast). So receiving the package in the daytime hours I took them out to look at them, turned one on, was pleased but then thought I had turned it off by pushing the button enough times to go through its cycle of settings but I had not, so when I took them out to look at them again later that evening found that the Ball was still changing colors (and had been for hours). The color was lighter because obviously the battery had worn down. Again, I take responsibility for the battery running down, had I not left it on but I just feel all things considered an off/on should just be an off/on. [SEP] these suck [SEP] Colorful.  It is floating n my solar fountain. [SEP] The ad made it seem as if you were getting a few deco balls but I only received on so not happy that I purchases something and go what I wasn't expecting [SEP] cheap and didn't work [SEP] The photo looks more intense colors n the real thing [SEP] I bought this ball to bring as a prop to a photo shoot.

"Crutcheze Odor Destroying Spray - Medical, pet, Shoe, Active wear Deodorizer",[],[],,3.9,17,762,"This stuff actually works. I use it to spray my gym sneakers and it neutralizes the scent. It has very little scent itself, too. [SEP] When the puppy has an oops, I usually use a product with enzymes in it to break down the odors and any oops that needs to be removed. This I have been putting on the patio, where both go to potty to remove that odor, too. I have been using this all over the place. It takes a while to dry,  but it works. [SEP] I can't smell this but for just a micro second after spraying it.  It initially has a little bit of a bleach smell but then nothing.  I sprayed some in my daughter's really stinky running shoes and it helped a lot.  I could use this in a gallon size since we have pets and stinky tennis shoes.  It seems to work as advertised so unless it stops working I think it deserves 5 stars. [SEP] This product claims to instantly remove smells - however the directions state that the item must sit soaked for 1.5 hours prior to towel then air drying. That doesn't seem very instant to me. It removed some smell, but not all of the smell in my shoes, and in exchange the product itself smells like bandaids...so now instead of my shoes smelling of feet, they smell lightly of feet mixed with the stronger scent of bandaids. I am not a fan of that. Because it states to test on a small area of fabrics first I was worried about using it on any of my work shirts at risk of losing my ability to wear the shirts as professional dress, so I cannot comment on whether it works better on BO than it does on foot odor, but considering I've used odor eliminating products that kill the germs causing the smells and work in minutes rather than the hours of working and drying this product takes, I do not think I will use this product again, particularly as I prefer the fresh scent my other odor eliminators leave behind over the stale bandaids of this product. [SEP] My child can clear a room with her stinky shoes.  It's a known fact that she has to leave her trainers outside.  This spray really helps cut down/out the sweat scent.  When you first spay it there is a bit of a chemical smell but it went away after a few minutes and didn't remain in the shoes.  Overall, ANY product that can help with those shoes gets 5 stars. [SEP] This Odor-Destroying Spray (by Crutcheze) comes in a 6-oz spray bottle.<br />There was no outer seal on my bottle.<br />When I removed the cap, there was no inner seal.<br />There was no sealant/plastic cap over the spray opening.<br /><br />The bottle is 7-1/4 inches tall, with a circumference of 5-5/8"" - easy for me to hold (I have small size hands).<br /><br />The bottle delivers a fine mist spray as I press the spray pump, with a moderate chlorine smell.<br />This bottle works best when held upright. When I held this upside down to spray into my shoes, it did not deliver much spray.<br /><br />I have very comfortable, but old, shoes and gloves that I love to wear while out gardening; these items are well-worn, and do not smell good.<br />I took out the insoles of those shoes, then sprayed inside of the shoes, and on the insoles.<br />I sprayed inside the gloves.<br />We sprayed the kids' shoes and their backpacks.<br />We left them outside the house to air out.<br /><br />The gloves did not have the smell they used to have.<br />The kids' shoes did not smell as bad as before.<br />My shoes still smelled a bit; although the odor was not as potent as before. The smell that remained came from deep inside the shoe, at the toe area, where the spray did not get into. With what I had left in the bottle, I removed the cap and poured the liquid down into that area. After leaving the shoes outside for a couple more days, the smell was was still present, but I am fine with the improvement.<br /><br />The product got used up quickly.<br /><br />Overall, this product does work in greatly reducing the heavy odors in my shoes.<br /><br />note: the bottle says that it, ""..instantly eliminates odors..."", but the description says that it ""...does not mask difficult odors....""",3,True

There are so many sounds and modes to choose from.  (We prefer fan noise or rain.) The instructions are very easy to understand and the touch nightlight is a nice feature.  Highly recommend! [SEP] I love the white noise and the ability to put the light on! My 7 year old and 4 year old learned to use to with ease before I got to it! [SEP] Exactly what I was looking for. My only complaint is that there's a lot of sound options so you have to really spend some time figuring out what works best for you. And if you're trying to do it in a hurry while getting a child to sleep that's annoying. God forbid trying to explain to your husband which exact sound you need it on, if you can't get up to turn it on. I recommend spending time playing around with it long before you actually need to use it. I really like it though. The night light is helpful and calming. [SEP] I live in a big city and have a lot of outside noise that often makes it way in.  It seemed like a soothing distraction noise would be a good solution to ease me to sleep. The small disc is very cute and has a great look to it but once I turned it on I found the sound quality to be very poor and the selection of sounds just sounded like noises that I find more irritating than the ones outside. [SEP] This is a nice sound machine. Has good volume control and sounds. The noise options are soothing and relaxing. Easy to use and operate for anybody. [SEP] I love the large amount of sounds that this machine offers, but for some reason they put the speaker on the bottom. If the speaker is exposed, the sound quality is good (not outstanding, but not bad). The sound gets muffled when the machine is upright because it’s bouncing off of whatever surface it’s sitting on. I also wish it was easier to find a specific sound, instead of cycling through all of them.<br /><br />Other than that, this works well! It is very easy to use. The light is very bright, though you have the option to turn it off as well. It is small enough to pack for trips as well. [SEP] The sound machine is an okay machine but it's limited with sounds and lights. It does an adequate job but you may want something more than what you are given here. Should be a nice gift for that special person in your life that has been wanting a white noise sound machine.<br /><br />Katiebabs [SEP] We've tried a number of these things and this one isn't bad. It's not the most UI friendly one, but it's not bad, either. We do love the design and it looks sharp sitting next to the crib. We like the different noise options, but we do wish the sound quality were a tad better. The baby certainly doesn't care, though, so overall we're satisfied.",3,True
DetraPel Fabric & Upholstery Protector - 5oz (150ml) - As Seen on Shark Tank,[],[],,3.9,65,1094,"Not to mention myself. I have spilled mugs of coffee on my couch. The dogs have dribbled all over and Lord only knows what my husband has done. I sprayed the sofa with this to prevent stains. I haven't seen a stain yet. [SEP] I couldn’t get this to spray nicely. It started to spray in a stream, not a mist. [SEP] I put this on my sofa, I ran out halfway through because you need to apply two coats. The liquid is white and the bottle is white, so I didn't realize it was almost empty. At a glance it looked like the bottle was still full, then I realized it was opaque. A lot more must come out with the sprayer than I realized!<br /><br />Honestly, I have not noticed much dirt and water-repelling qualities. I still have to use my Bissel Green Machine to clean up spills. It helps the liquid pool up without totally soaking into the upholstery, but it's not 100% waterproof. However, in exchange for that, it's not stiff like ScotchGuard or anything. With the small quantity I would use it on something like dining room chairs. It took too much product to cover an entire sectional.<br /><br />I wouldn't view this as a stain prevention method, but rather something that buys you time to clean it up with a stronger product. [SEP] this product did not work on anything I tried it on. [SEP] I sprayed the back, seat and arms of a old chair that I recently had re-upholstered and didn't want stains to get on the new fabric.  This product sprays easily and I layed  it on pretty heavy and used up the can.  It didn't chain the color of the fabric and it smells fine.  I don't know at this time how well my fabric will protected from food drops and animal dirt.  It seems so far to be a good product. [SEP] I used this on an off-white bench cushion we have in our home.  The directions are clear and easy to follow.  So far whenever we've gotten dirt or anything else on the cushion we've been able to just brush it off.  There is no smell and it's non-toxic. [SEP] This DetraPel Fabric & Upholstery Protector is a safer solution than other brands that have unnecessary toxins. It’s safe to use indoors and dries clear on fabrics. I sprayed this on our dining room chairs. Only time will tell how well it friend stains. I took away one star because of the price for a 5oz can. I think this should be sold at a lower price.  Overall, I like this item and recommend it. [SEP] This keeps dirt off really well. It was an easy spay. It has kept my couch clean. Great stocking stuffer. [SEP] I tried this on a hat and it seems to work well. I thought it would be great in the rain. I think I may try it on a jacket of mine. Anyway, it’s easy to use, doesn’t have any unwanted smell to it and is supposed to last about 9 to 12 months. Pretty awesome if it does!😁<br />  I’m definitely glad I tried it and would recommend it. [SEP] This stuff is great!  Much better than kiwi or other brands.  It still has that same smell but nowhere near as strong.  No staining, goes on easy.  Great stuff",3,True

"OHOCO Wool Dryer Balls, Organic Natural Wool for Laundry, Fabric Softening - Anti Static, Baby Safe, No Lint, Odorless and Reusable 6 Pack Gray",[],[],,4.3,103,1498,"This is an easy switch to make both for the planet and for your wallet. I have had a set of dryer balls (a different brand) for 3+ years and they are still going strong. These don’t feel like they are wrapped quite as tightly as my old set, but I fully expect them to last over a year. They don’t leave any fuzz behind on my clothes and they don’t have any weird chemicals. This is a very affordable option to substitute for dryer sheets. [SEP] I've heard about wool balls for drying, but those, that my friend gave me, didn't work well - the clothes became even more static with them. These are felted style and have truly anti static properties. The balls are big and, since my loads are mostly small, three of them enough for me. I wish there would be a bag for those, that are not in use, but I will figure out how to keep them all in place. [SEP] Beautifully packaged and just as depicted. I've used dryer wool balls in the past and have lost them as years have gone on... These are constructed well and are much larger than others I've used in the past. I use them with a couple drops of essential oils to keep our laundry smelling fresh without the chemicals. Great product! [SEP] these are great wool balls. worked fantastically with our down and poly down like winter vest light jackets and heavy jackets. they work much quicker than you think so put your dryer on less time, less heat to start. (you will get extreme static if on for too long, and a shock) glad we shopped around and chose these. happy we purchased from this company. [SEP] These dryer balls are much larger than I expected, about the size of a tennis ball. Others I've seen have been about half that size. I've never used them before this and I find them to do the job as described. I am a faithful dryer sheet user just to eliminate static cling. When I used the balls without dryer sheets, I still did get static cling so that's the only down side to not using dryer sheets. There's a suggestion to use essential oils for scented drying, but I'm not too keen on oils coming in contact with my cloths. I'm going to try something a little different with diluting liquid fabric softener and spraying on the balls before use. [SEP] I used these dryer balls on a few different loads of laundry. A load of whites, darks, and towels. I used 3-4 balls per load (depending on the load size). With every single load, the static cling was off the charts. I needed to run each load through a 20-minute refresher cycle using a Bounty dryer sheet to get rid of all the static, rendering the purpose of these balls completely counterproductive. I would not recommend these. [SEP] I was super excited to try these dryer balls because I love the idea of not having to throw away countless fabric softener sheets while using something that is much better for the environment.  My excitement was short-lived however because right out of the package these smelled awful.  I left them out of the plastic for a few days hoping that the smell would dissipate but they still smell like a stinky sheep.  So much so that I cannot bring myself to throw them in with a clean load of laundry for fear that my clothes will smell the exact same way and we will all smell like we've been rolling around in the barnyard.<br /><br />I really wanted to love these but I just can't get past the smell.  It seems that the other reviews are very positive so perhaps I just received a bad batch?? [SEP] I didn't realize you needed to use all 6 wool balls for a large load so all this time I had been using wool balls incorrectly and wondering why they didn't work. So glad that this one came with instructions that explained that to me. No static on my clothes after drying which is my main reason for using these! I liked that it came with a seemingly hand written thank you for purchasing from the seller. Highly recommend. [SEP] Great product!! Love these dryer balls. Will buy again when I need more",3,True

It is soft, yet it cleans away any dirt, oil, or peeling, without causing any irritation. Those who use Retin-A know that the vigorous brush cleanings can only be done a couple of times a week or else your skin gets really sore and painful. This little cleaning brush does not cause that and gives a great cleaning for everyday. And, it really gets into the creases around the nose and does great for cleaning out your pores.<br />I use a micellar gel cleanser with this and usually go through two 90 second sessions on the nights I don't use Retin-A, and one very light pressure session on the nights I do. I then apply my skincare or my Retin-A. About once a week I use my regular cleansing brush to do a deep clean, but only for a minute or two.<br />I really love this little flower sonic cleansing brush. It is not harsh, it gives a great cleaning, it feels good, and it helps wash away the peelies from using Retin-A. Highly recommend. [SEP] This easy to hold facial cleanser is amazing. You can put a small amount of soap for face on it and turn it on. It gives your face a cleaning massage to get deep into pores. It's made durable and made out of a high quality silicone material. It makes a great gift for anyone that likes to keep their skin looking younger and more vibrant. It has an excellent battery life , It comes with an included usb charging cable. I've charged it once in the month that I've had it. It's a great value for the money. [SEP] This is a really nice little face washer for a person who needs a very gentle washer, but it doesn't do much exfoliating because the bristles are all very fine and soft. It is exactly as described and pictured and it is working very well so far. With this kind of item, it either matches the photos or it doesn't, and this one looks exactly like the photos, and then it either works or it doesn't, and this one works well enough, but the little balls under the surface don't really seem to do anything other than massage. I suppose they feel nice, but they don't increase the face washing ability of this, so I'm not really sure why they are there. More vibration settings are needed as well as some thicker bristles either on the other side of the unit or on the edge along the top or bottom of the main pad, to make this work better. The listing is accurate and we are satisfied with the performance of this item as a backup unit, but it isn't good enough to be the main one that I use or that anyone else is using. Power consumption is as stated and it is easy to use and easy to work with and we've had no problems with it after quite a while of use. We all basically reached the same conclusion that it needs a better design as to variation of bristles and then more vibration settings. It is very easy to hold, so that was good and that is why it gets four instead of three stars. Many are too hard to hold. This is easy to hold when it is wet and it doesn't become too slippery to keep in my hand. Good luck in your search. [SEP] As someone who once owned a fancy, high-end cleaning brush, I can honestly say this product is light years better. It is so gentle, but effective. I noticed a difference after the first use. It's a cinch to clean and the bristles clean without ever irritating. If you are looking for a facial brush, I highly recommend this even over better-known brands. It's truly a life changing beauty product. [SEP] I use this to remove my make up and wash my face every night before bed. Love it. [SEP] This face brush works really well, my face always feels clean and soft ,very relaxing, and loosens up some tension in my face when I use it.The quality seems to be good for now,I don’t have any complaints,the design is also cute and adorable.A really great product for the price! [SEP] So this is super soft and super cute and the massager part is awesome, but the cleaning power I'm still skeptical of.  I was hoping that the massing function enhanced the scrubbing power, but it definitely doesn't.  It is simply a face massager and doesn't enhance the power of the silicone bristles cleaning power.  If you're looking for a brush that deep cleans, I don't think this is it.  The silicone is soft and gentle and really does clean nicely, but not the deep clean that a rotating brush provides.  Overall I found the massaging function kind of useless for daily cleaning and more useful for special days I just wanted a little more pampering. If you're going for a massage, this is your brush. If you're going for deep clean, this ain't it. [SEP] This is a massaging silicone facial brush that not only vibrates but there's also 4 magnetic beads that rotate in the center which makes it different than most silicone vibrating brushes. It is waterproof to an extent and it recharges with its proprietary USB charging cord. I do wish it was a standard micro USB or a USB-C cord instead. The device is easy to hold and because of the cute flower design, a ""petal"" can easily reach the sides of nose, above my upper lip area, temple areas and chin. The device will automatically turn off in 90 seconds and when you turn it back on, it goes back to the mode where you left off. There are 4 modes and I like to use the first 2 modes (gentle or deep cleaning both with magnetic bead massage). I noticed that my face felt soft & smooth after use. I do find the power button which doubles as the mode button is really small and could be difficult to press. To plug the charging cord in, there is a tiny slit in the silicone that covers the opening and I did find that I had to gently wiggle the plug around to find the correct spot internally to actually plug into the device (instead of jamming it in and risk damaging it). Device also comes with a drawstring storage / travel bag which was a nice surprise. [SEP] Perfect for my needs except how often it has to be charged compared to my other Ultrasonic Rechargeable Face Brush. Much easier to use and hold though. Guess it's a trade off. [SEP] Amazing skincare tool.  My face always feels so clean and soft after using this.",3,True

Massage is a key step to increase blood circulation, naturally lift lax skin, increase collagen production and help products penetrate deeper. This massager has three different modes with three intensity levels for each. The cleansing mode warms skin and helps open pores for deep cleaning.

The transmission mode uses red light to brighten skin, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, encourage collagen production and increase product penetration. Use this mode after applying your entire skincare routine. Each cycle runs for four minutes before the auto-shutoff is engaged.

Thank you so much 😊 ** [SEP] Okay, okay.  This is super weird and I won't even use a nose spray medicine ... but gosh darn it- I use this thing.<br /><br />I used to get serious sinus infections once a year.  There was no side-stepping those awful weeks.  They were horrible- so bad that my teeth wouldn't align correctly.  My sinus infections were SO bad, I decided to try this contraption.<br /><br />I feel weird saying this, but I LOVE IT.  It is amazing.  Once you get past the feeling that you are drowning in your shower (because that where I use it- it's quite messy), it becomes easier.  Watch the cheesy videos by the company. Oddly, it helps you get the hang of this thing.<br /><br />I swear by it so much, I bought some for the older kids.  True story: I've been using these thingies for four years now. No sinus infections.  Not one.  I use it about once a month and once a week during the drastic change in weather. [SEP] This really works to clear out your sinus.  Instantly you can feel the difference and its much easier to breath and more comfortable.  If you have some stick boogers that you just can't blow out this will flush it all out and give you a relaxed feeling with easier breathing.  Its good that it doesn't hurt or leave a smell in your nose.  I recommend using warm water which seems to work better.  The first time you use it it's kind of scary, thinking you're going to drown, but just relax and gently squeeze and let the water flow out your other nostril.  Don't tense up just relax.  There is one thing I don't like, that is that it makes a big mess.  since you hold your head up straight the water trickles out your nose and down your chin.  It's best to use this in the shower that way you don't have to worry about spilling salt water all over the place. [SEP] Generally speaking, I've been happy with my neti pot, but it's not something I can take with me when we travel or camp.  This looked as if it might be a good alternative, and I  believe that it is.  Being plastic, it's not going to break.  I didn't realize that I was going to love that I can close the nasal applicator tip and shake it up to make sure I dissolve the salt, but I do.  Having used a neti pot for a very long time, I was also surprised by how much easier and more comfortable it is not to have to lean way over in order to have the solution flow through my nasal passages – I'd just gotten used to doing it.  Being able to squeeze the bottle also allows for changing how fast it flows in.  Being able to see how much is still in the bottle, so that I can stop halfway, and switch sides is also extremely helpful!  The only thing it doesn't have, which I wish it did, is a stand to hold the bottle upside down when drying it.<br /><br />The salt packets are hard to empty, as the slit for opening them is badly placed:  lengthwise, and in the middle, so they just tear down the middle, leaving a pocket on both sides which is hard to empty by pouring (as a nurse, I'm not going to stick it in the bottle and shake it, for sanitary reasons).<br /><br />This is definitely a keeper!<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading my review.

Look straight into the mirror and tip the nozzle into your nostril with your breath held(so it doesn’t go down your throat) the solution naturally comes out the other nostril. It doesn’t taste like anything other than maybe a slightly salty water.  Cleans you out and helps with allergies and post nasal drip. I used it and was amazed at how easy it was and how clean my sinuses felt afterwards. Really great to have on hand and use a couple times with week. I definitely will continue using it and recommend if anyone needs a Neti pot type thing. [SEP] This works great for helping clear my nasal passages from allergens and colds. I like that I can use this on my kids and myself. Its gentle and doesn't irritate and it's super easy to use. I like that its reusable and easy to clean. All in all, I would highly recommend this! [SEP] My husband loves his neti pot and will tell everyone about the benefits of one.  Over the years,  he has tested several bends and has made his own blend.  He found that this didn't bother his nose nose and holes keep.the congestion an stuffiness at bay. [SEP] This works great for helping clear my nasal passages from allergens and colds.

Men's Multivitamin | 180 Caplets | Once Daily Multi | Gluten Free & Non-GMO Supplement for Men | by CELLFUEL,[],[],,4.3,26,768,"I have a huge supply of misc. vitamins.  I take one of these daily along with one other brand mini vitamin.  These will let you know when you take them.  Quickly after taking one, your urine will be neon yellow.<br /><br />I like the list of ingredients and have zero complaints about this product.<br /><br />I am happy to have these and will continue to use them. [SEP] Like most multivitamins, the CELLFUEL Performance Men's Multivitamin supplement provides a basic level of vitamins and minerals. But it also comes with various other amino acids, herbs, and other ingredients specifically for men. That makes it more comprehensive than the standard ""one-a-day."" Granted, since these specialty ingredients are lumped together in various blends, it's hard to know whether the amounts are significant. That said, I think the ingredients are fine, except for perhaps, the Guarana (which is the primary component of the Energy Blend). I'm not a fan of Guarana due to its inherently high caffeine content. Time will tell if that becomes an issue, but for now, I like this multivitamin formula and think the price point is fair. I rate it 4.5 stars overall. [SEP] So far I'm very pleased with this multi-vitamin.  It's probably the most comprehensive I've ever used.  It has just about everything I could imagine, though I will never understand why it contains 1,000-3,000% of recommended daily allowance.<br /><br />The pills are average size and I had no difficulty getting them down.  They have a slightly earthy aroma, but my no means is it overwhelming.  I do recommend drinking plenty of water.  The first day I used them I didn't drink enough and ended up with a bit of an upset stomach.  I drank plenty of water the next day and no problem.  Probably best taken with meals.<br /><br />I recommend this one! [SEP] Cellfuel Men's Multivitamin | 180 Caplets<br /><br />The caplet is about the same size as the Kirkland 600 mg calcium = 10 mcg vit D3  tablet (item 389194).<br /><br />I like that the formulation includes both vitamins and minerals and a whole lot extras (amino acids, plant extracts). It does require two caplets per serving. However, if one doesn't need the concentrations stated on the % daily value chart (on the bottle label), then a person can choose to just take one caplet per serving (one caplet per day).<br /><br />The caplets don't have any stinky smell or awful taste. [SEP] This is a GOOD (not great, but GOOD) multivitamin with a strong ingredient profile. In general, I am conservative with multivitamins, given that my diet is pretty strong and diverse. I break these in half, and only use a half a pill per day (but you will still see a strong change in urine color an hour or so after using!). You can check the ingredient profile and compare with other multivitamins, and you'll see this one exceeds some of the other cheap multis on the market. That said, the SMELL is pretty atrocious, and if you leave it in your hand for even a second or two you'll have a smell on your hand that is pretty annoying -- I have to wash my hands every time I take one. The pill itself is fine and easy to swallow, but the smell is the only reason I couldn't award this 5 stars. It's a good value for the price, but the smell is a real drag! [SEP] My husband likes this men's multivitamin very much and takes the prescribed two a day. (The bottle gives you three months' worth.) He considers it a ""background vitamin,"" that supplies a balance of everything. He takes separate, larger amounts of certain vitamins and supplements like C and saw palmetto and knew it was a good idea to get more of a full spectrum, too. This multi provides that.<br /><br />It also provides a little energy boost that he really appreciates. This is a very complete supplement and he will buy it again. He's very impressed. [SEP] It is difficult for an average person to confirm that a supplement contains what's claimed on the bottle so there's no way for me to determine if this supplement contains exactly what's described without sending the capsules to a laboratory, but after taking it for a couple of days i can say that there's definitely a beneficial effect on my energy levels, mood and concentration.<br /><br />I ordered this and another supplement because i was feeling slightly down in concentration, mood and energy, i've tried other supplements (mushrooms and spices) and multivitamins (Centrum, GMC and others) and while you get a boost from those i can say this one gave me more than an energy boost, i feel like my mood and concentration improved as well.<br /><br />It is probably one of the most complete multivitamin supplements i've ever taken, with plenty of vitamins i've never heard before but surely are making me feel better, energized and goal-focused.<br /><br />90 days of everything you need for $16.95 make this an awesome value for knowing you're giving your body the vitamins and minerals your body needs to function properly.<br /><br />Two capsules a day at the same intake works great for me because i take it and forget it for another 24 hours, i take it with my breakfast and i'm ready for the day, for some reason this energy/mood boost feels steadier compared to say, an energy drink which has a crash and usually a mood drop after. [SEP] My husband had been looking for a good multivitamin with a good mix of the essentials so this was a great buy. It has all the things needed to get you through the day and the pills aren't super big horse pills or hard on your stomach. So far he has had no issues after taking them and feel energetic throughout the day now. Hopefully continued use will keep him energized and help replenish all the nutrients he is missing. [SEP] The Cellfuel Multivitamin was ordered for my daily use in my wellness program.<br /><br />Many years ago it was suggested by my doctor that I use a multivitamin every day.  I have generally used the name-brand vitamins that one can purchase in a local grocery store or pharmacy.  However, when I saw these advertised with a much higher potency than the generic store brands, I decided to order these.  By the way, consult your doctor about using higher potency vitamins before using them.<br /><br />The vitamin caplets are easier to take than some of the larger ""horse pills"" I have taken in the past, and do not make me have a ""gag"" effect like some do.<br /><br />I cannot comment on the effect of these higher potency vitamins since I am not a scientist.  All I know is that they provide me with the vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids that I need.  In addition, these caplets do not contain any of the negative aspects of some other vitamin pills such as gluten, wheat, yeast, lactose, sweeteners, or preservatives.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  I like this vitamin product.  They provide me with the various vitamins and other supplements that I need in my continued quest for good health.  I would order this product again.",3,True

If I could remove the insert, it would hold a few more.<br /><br />LOVES<br />- Love the the design and that there is a different embossing on the top and bottom so I can tell which end is up<br /><br />- Love that it is small enough to be portable<br /><br />- The clasp is super sturdy, so it will not come undone in my purse<br /><br />DISLIKES<br />- I wish the insert were removable<br /><br />In summary, this case is really sturdy and super attractive. It will only hold a few horse-sized pills but it is great for those who have smaller pills to carry. Also the clasp is very sturdy.  The current price of $9.99 is competitive for this. [SEP] This is a nice little pill box at a reasonable price. Much nicer than the translucent plastic ones that are so common. Even so, I definitely wouldn't call this an upscale product.  Not sure how long it's going to last, especially since it bounces around in my purse. Right now, it stays closed.  I would suggest keeping it in a makeup bag so that it doesn't got a lot of hard wear.  Three compartments that can keep medications or supplements separate.  Very cute. [SEP] Small size is great. It has a very retro look, reminds me of something my grandmother had. Fits in the palm of your hand. It latches closed tightly so no worries of pills in the bottom of the purse. [SEP] Excellent pill case, with metal exterior and credible plastic internal compartment.  I found the textures on the top and bottom of the case to be quite attractive.  The manufacturing displays quality, with impeccable construction, with excellent materials.<br />The clasp shows the inherent design and construction quality.  There is a space created to allow free motion of the clasping mechanism.<br />I won't wax poetic about a pill case, but this is a well designed and attractive product.  Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.  It ably serves the intended function, with quality design and materials. [SEP] I needed a way to carry a couple meds around without bottles of clattering pills. This box is lovely and elegant, and does the job perfectly. It's not very big - you can fit a couple of doses of things in it, but not much more than that - but it doesn't clatter nearly as much as some other pill carriers I've used before, and it looks quite pretty and delicate, but it stays closed perfectly! I threw it in a tote bag and carried that around for a week before I needed to find some tylenol at work, and it was perfectly sealed up as it should be, no loose pills. Very happy with this! [SEP] Holds 10 pills with room to spare yet takes up little space in my purse. Love it [SEP] [[VIDEOID:c88404ff4e543139357eb1b7e8c8466b]] I really wanted to like this Small Pill Box, I have been looking for a cute little pill box like this for a while. Unfortunately mine doesn’t stay closed. As you can see in the video I don’t even have to push the lever on the front to open it, it just pops right open.  Maybe mine is defective… but I can only review what I get! Also worth noting the outside is not metal or anything like that, it’s entirely plastic. Based on the one I received I would not recommend [SEP] Love the compartments so I can take a variety of medications on the go! Perfect and pretty too!

"NutrastanXP Neem Seed Oil Supplement, 500mg (60 Vegetarian Capsules)",[],[],,4.2,25,315,"Neem oil is great for hair and skin. It helps strengthen strands and improves elasticity. It encourages hair growth and can prevent unnecessary shedding. It is also good for fighting wrinkles. The capsules are filled with oil. You can easily puncture them with a thumbtack or sewing needle and add them to either hair or skin products. Another great use is to add some to your favorite clay mask to make it dry down slower. I think this is a great buy.<br /><br />Thanks so much for reading this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] So far so good with these capsules. I've had no bad side effects and some good so that works well. They seem to do wonders for the hair and skin. They are said to have antibiotic type effects as well which is always a plus. These are rich in antioxidants and the capsules are vegetarian. Since you are supposed to take one capsule twice a day this is only a one month supply so that's something to consider when deciding if you are going to start a regimen that includes this exact brand of Neem Seed Oil Supplement. It's a good supplement to use and seems to work so it may be worth it. [SEP] I like many others was a little taken back when I opened the bottle to see that there was a baggie inside holding the vitamins. That was odd.<br /><br />the pills themselves are banded together, just like in the description. So that wasn't a big deal for me. I haven't noticed a difference but I have had no side effects either. There is no bad after taste and they are easy to swallow. [SEP] So I have been taking this for a couple of weeks, and I am not sure if I notice anything or not. It's hard to tell with some supplements. I have have no reactions or side effects from these, so that's a great thing! [SEP] These do what they say they do. They are very easy to swallow. I have had no problems with them. [SEP] One of the member of our family decided to donate plasma on a weekly basis and needed something to help the immune system to stay strong. I have a lot at my disposal immune supporting supplements and decided to give it a try to a Neem Seed Oil. Personally, I couldn't take it more than two time - had some stomach reaction to it. But the other family member is taking it on a daily basis and feels just fine. Working in the Adult Home and being around elder and often sick people is not so good, when your own immune system is weakened by weekly plasma draw, but thanks to herbal immune supplements, including Neem Seed Oil, everyone is well in our family [SEP] I got these because I read that this helps with hair growth & since I have Hashimoto's this is something I need. It's defiantly helping with thickening & growth. Also my hairs a ton shinier. I've had no side effects at all. The only thing that may bother some people (not me personally) is they're in the bottle in a little plastic ZipLock bag. These look pretty hand crafted. Great product though!!!!! [SEP] This is a neem seed oil supplement in capsule form. The capsules are made without gelatin using a banding solution as well as ethyl alcohol, titanium dioxide, and a coloring compound. Neem seed oil is a powerful and versatile seed oil with many uses, and this supplement is fine for those seeking a vegetarian friendly capsule form, though not as pure or economical as just getting a bottle of the liquid oil that hasn't been encapsulated. [SEP] These Neem Seed Oil capsules had truly lessened some of my auto-immune symptoms.  I was so excited about the results until I started notice a distinct ODOR in my breath, perspiration, and overall ""body odor.""  It is hard to describe the smell, but it was NOT pleasant.  I was actually emitting an unpleasant odor that I was able to smell myself.  The odor started within a day or two after adding this Need Seed Oil to my supplement regimen.  After I discontinued the Neem Seed Oil, the odor dissipated within a couple of days.  I did a little research and came to find that Neem Seed Oil is known to have a strong ""garlic-like"" odor.  Well, it is just too unpleasant for me.  I would love to continue these capsules because I was noticing a difference in my overall well-being; but I can not tolerate the ""body odor"" it gives me.",3,True
"Soothing Mushroom Tea with Reishi and Chaga Mushroom for Relaxation, Stress Support and Sleep - 20 Servings Per Box - Dual Extracted Mushrooms, Magnesium and L-theanine",[],[],,4.1,63,1923,"The tea itself tastes a lot better than the Lion's Mane version I reviewed separately. It has the color of a cup of coffee and a somewhat pleasant taste. However, I cannot drink this tea. My tongue broke out in blisters when I drank it and it made my throat feel sore. I don't think that's a good thing. [SEP] tastes and looks like roast coffee (or a chicory blended coffee).  Very subtle fragrance profile.  Unclear how much placebo effect is manifested in these types of products and hard to compare it to impact other teas (blue lotus, or Pukka night time) for me.  All have been equally helpful in mellowing down ( I tend to have calls till 11 pm on most days).  At over a $1.5 per serving, will be part of the rotation if I see a significant improvement over my other teas.  After a week of use, seems promising.  But need to see if the body adapts and the effect just peters away.  Blue lotus has been so far the best for me. [SEP] This Freshcap Unwind instant drink mix tastes very good.  It's slightly sweet and no where near being too sweet.  Some people may want to add a little more sweetener to it.  I mixed up a tube in some boiling water and it completely dissolved leaving no mushroom sediment at the bottom of my cup.  It nearly has the color of coffee and when I added a little cream to it it looked exactly like coffee and even sort of mimics the taste of coffee but without the caffeine.  The product page says it contains 1000 mg of dual mix (I guess that means Reishi and Chaga) but it doesn't say per serving.  Nor does it say anything on the box about how many mgs you are getting per serving.  I'm assuming that you get 1000 mg of Reishi and Chaga per tube.  I looked at a couple of bottles of mushroom capsules I have and the label said two capsules delivered 1000 mg and so I guess one tube also contains 1000 mg.  Overall I think this is a good product, especially useful right before bedtime to promote a better night's sleep, and it tastes good too. [SEP] Its easy to use and it taste good. It has a nice relaxing feeling to it too. [SEP] These sachets make a delightful hot cuppa before bed. The flavor reminds me of Dandy Blend, and it's just as easy to use. Just empty a sachet into a mug of hot water, stir it up a bit, and enjoy. Not only is it delicious. It works. Every night I've had a cup of Unwind before bed, I have slept wonderfully. I've fallen asleep quickly, slept deeply, and woken up feeling refreshed in the morning. [SEP] I couldn't drink this on its own.  The flavor wasn't great.  I did, however, add a package to my morning smoothie and obviously it was a lot more palatable that way. [SEP] This mushroom tea is so soothing and causes me nothing but peace! I pamper myself with this magnificent hot tea before bedtime and before long my anxieties have vanished from sight and I’m counting sheep. This tea relaxes the soul! [SEP] First, I rarely write long reviews, unless I really like a product or can’t stand one. I wasn’t given anything for this review and is just my honest experience. I gave this 5 stars, because it works for me. It would be a better value, if it was a 30 day supply, instead of a 20 days. I still give it 5 stars, because I have insomnia and it helps. I didn’t expect too much, but have a subscription for freshcaps Thrive 6, which has helped with my memory, which has been foggy. So I figured it was worth a try and wasn’t disappointed.<br /><br />The first time I tried this, it definitely relaxed me and I actually slept 10-12 hours that night. I rarely sleep 6 hours and it was a complete shock. I didn’t wake multiple times. Although, I hadn’t slept well the nights prior and was why I ordered, but that is nothing new. Amazon was able to get it here quicker. So I went with them to try this product. I expected sleep, but not that much, but not complaining. I actually woke up refreshed. It hasn’t happened like that since, but I have been sleeping better. I do take other supplements with mushrooms, changed my diet and am more active. All of which could be factors that helped  too, but I hadn’t had sleep like that in a long time. The only new thing was this product. The taste isn’t bad at all. I figured I would hate the taste, but wanted the benefits. I was able to get both. I mix it with 8oz of almond milk in a small blender. I put it in a blender, because it can clump up, but not with the blender. I have added mud/wtr with it a few times. It is definitely worth a try, even with the price. I will order again, but won’t take daily. I would recommend it for a stressful day, when you just need to relax and unwind. I already take many of the mushrooms in it, but the magnesium and botanicals definitely helped.<br /><br />Mushrooms are high in antioxidants and help. If you want a calming mushroom that has a 60 day supply and is cheaper. I would recommend their Reshi caps or you can buy canister and make it like you would this product. The bottles and canisters come with a 60 day supply(60 capsules or a canister with 60 grams). The thrive 6 has Reishi, lions mane, Chaga and 3 other mushrooms. You may want to buy off amazon for a one time try. If you buy directly off the site. You will pay more, unless you subscribe. You can cancel anytime, but prime has a quicker delivery.<br /><br />I wrote this review to help others decide. You may not have the same reaction as I did with sleep, but everything in it helps aid relaxation. I don’t like taking melatonin and this is a great alternative. Everything in it has benefits. Just do some research on the ingredients. Look into the benefits of mushrooms, because they have helped me. Hoping this can help others decide if it is right for them. The Freshcap site has more information on these mushrooms and this product. You may want to check their site for benefits of each one before you order. I hope this helped. [SEP] For “relaxation” this did nothing for me. Nothing more than drinking any warm drink. The taste was meh. Taste is subjective, though. I had one mug-ful and then never thought “oh I want to drink that again.” [SEP] I actually consume mushrooms every day; Often as food and as daily supplements (bulk powder or in capsule form).  I appreciate the potential health benefits, and the taste. Two of the mushrooms I take are included in this 'tea preparation'. As noted in the product details, Reishi and Cordyceps are often consumed for their relaxing feature, and mellowing out one's mood.  They're also noted for positively affecting immune systems and cognitive/neurological systems.<br />The significant other was dealing with taxes, and was obviously stressed out. Between dealing with clients and accountants/taxes, I could see she was more stressed than usual. So, I followed the directions and prepared a cup of this ""Unwind"" tea.  I took a sip, and it has a nice taste, and I recognize the usual mushroom earthiness.  But, it has more than a mushroom flavor. There's hints of Chamomile, Passion Flower and Peppermint. Overall, it has a very welcoming taste, and she said it's an enjoyable tea.<br />There's only 5 calories per serving, with 0g sugar and no added sugars. It uses organic monk fruit extract as the alternative sweetener.  So, that's another positive for this product.<br />The contents of the packet dissolved nicely, and didn't leave any grit on the bottom of the mug.  I did add some almond milk, which gave it more a smoothness (she likes her tea and coffee with almond milk).  After the cup of this mushroom tea, she said she felt better and not as stressed out. And, said she'd like another one, after she finishes with her last appointment.  So, it passes the taste test and seemed to calm her stressed out state.<br />Based on these initial impressions, this product earns a 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",3,True

This putty is no different except that I thought it was going to be so hard for me to use. It is actually not as hard as I expected it to be and is perfect for building strength in my hands. It is a bit oily but that is typical of the putty I used at my therapist office as well. I do feel, however, that the current price of $19.99 is very expensive for this small size.<br /><br />Note that this is good to keep an autistic child occupied. I have a friend with a severely autistic child (now adult), who uses these type of items to keep him busy and he is really into stuff like this. [SEP] This is a very stiff putty especially at first use, but it is supposed to be that way. It works well, stays relatively clean, and can be used for lots of different activities. It does not mix well with upholstery however, so keep that in mind! [SEP] You know the stuff you used to play with as a kid? Silly putty? It comes in a plastic container shaped like an egg? Yeah, this is the same feeling material! At first I thought that it was going to be too hard for me (I got the medium one), but the more you play with it, the softer it gets. At first I thought this was a bit oily, but that goes away after using it and mixing it up. My hands were not left feeling oily at all. I use this as a way to help manage my anxiety.

It is slightly oily at first but it does not leave any residue on hands or materials.  My son enjoys pulling this apart and using it for stress relief.  I deducted stars because although this is fun and seems like a good quality, in my opinion this is very overpriced.  At the time of this review the price was about $15.  I could pick up Silly Putty at my local dollar store, use that instead, and save a lot of money. [SEP] Very effective therapy putty, great for when you’re having trouble with your hands or are going through hand rehabilitation, I opted for the soft version and it still has enough firmness to work all parts of your hands without overdoing them, it’s also not sticky so you won’t be a mess afterwards, it’s also a good stress reliever or use for fidgety people [SEP] This is a good and adequate amount of putty, especially if using in both hands. It comes in a very simple plastic container, I switched it to a resealable plastic baggie because I was afraid it would dry out easily in the container it came in.<br />The red is very brightly colored and is pretty, but is much firmer than I expected. I can barely work it with one hand.<br />The putty is also quite greasy, and leaves an oiliness to your hands after working with it.<br />Overall, is about average for putty [SEP] This works well and feels good in the hand.

The flavor was better than I expected and I like that the drink was fizzy. I really feel like when I take this I am able to buckle down and concentrate a lot better. My husband started taking it and feels a difference as well. We will definitely continue to use this product.

With the long hours at the hospital and little sleep, I was feeling terrible, foggy, and not focused. This product reversed that quite effectively. I use it daily!! [SEP] This product really works. I’ve been using it for several months now and have definitely seen a lot of change in my mental clarity. [SEP] Not at all what they claim in their propaganda.

Heated Eyelash Curler four positions fast temperature rise Rechargeable Electric Eyelash Curler for Women Quick Heating Adjustable 4 Temperature Safety Control,[],[],,3.3,43,801,"This does work fairly well and after a bit of fiddling (my problem not the curler’s) I got it working well. It’s still an extra step I don’t always do just because of the extra time — getting set up, using it and putting it away — but when I want to go all out, this does a great job. It’s easy to use and does work. [SEP] I got this for the sole purpose of curling my faux lashes but at first I couldn't figure out how to adjust the heat- which turns out unless it is fully charged, you cannot. Then once it was charged and fully up to 90 degrees it still took me a full 5 minutes to get even a slight extra bend in one of my lashes. Who has that kind of time? Not me. Also, the instructions are in broken English. So for these reasons I am only giving it 3 stars. [SEP] I read about how a HEATED eyelash curler is actually BETTER for your lashes and could not wait to get my hands on one! This product is great! It heats up fast and doesn't hurt or burn your eyes (which was my biggest concern). It works best after you've applied mascara, which also help to protect lashes and aids in molding/curling lashes. THE BEST PART...I didn't bend, break or lose any eyelashes (like I normally do, when using the average/ not heated lash curler). I highly recommend this product! [SEP] This is my second eyelash curler and I really have no complaints. I like the bright red color. The eyelash curler heats up quickly. There are different heat options. I do recommend applying mascara before using the eyelash curler. It's the same thing I'd do if using a manual lash curler, right? I tried using the lash curler without mascara but it doesn't hold. Most heated lash curlers I've used require the application of mascara. That said, it's very easy to use. I've never burned myself. I haven't damaged my lashes and I'm saving money (and my natural lashes) by adding a bit of heated curl. I also recommend cleaning after each use. I use the lash brush provided. It gets off the goopy mascara and prevents clumps when using again. This is rechargeable. It holds a charge well, too. My daughter liked my original curler, so I ordered one for her. We both like the look of our lashes. Add mascara, then curl. Done right and you should be batting fabulous lashes. [SEP] Maybe I am just not comprehending the directions but I cannot seem to get this into any of the other ""4 modes."" Mine has stayed on 65 degrees since I turned it on. I have charged it, I have pressed every button, I have let it sit for 20 minutes before touching it and just can't get it to work! it is super cute looking and comes with a nice little pink case to store it. I had high hopes but it doesn't curl my lashes at all. [SEP] heats up but barely curls my eyelashes, not worth it. [SEP] My wife's review of this product.  It heats up quickly and helps elongate your lashes.  It doesn't make a tight curl.  Overall, she likes it. [SEP] I don't think this thing works. I used it for a while and it didn't do anything to my eyelashes. It actually feels like it s burning my hair. [SEP] Such a great product!!!! I totally love this heated eyelash curler so much! Comes with usb charging cord, and such a cute little pink velvet drawstring bag to keep it in! Love 💗 [SEP] I read the other reviews on how to use it and tried different ways also saw some YouTube videos and my eyelashes didn’t curl at all.

I’ve been discovering all sorts of new beauty and health tools - mostly good - and was especially excited to see this might help my hair. I didn’t really know what I was getting into here. Thankfully, I read the instruction manual before starting and saw the warning about using this if you have metallic implants. I messaged Eternal Clear and received a speedy response that it was safe to use this as long as I stayed 1.5” away from my metal rods. Yay!<br /><br />So I had already noted that everything arrived safely, neatly boxed and sealed. I was worried the bulbs were defective at first because they didn’t light up right away. I wasn’t even sure if they were supposed to, but I persisted and eventually they all lit up. I don’t know if it was a coincidence, but one finally lit up when I moved my hand closer toward it. They all seemed to light up much easier after the first time. The electric buzzing and smell is kind of scary, but as soon as I was told I could proceed, I plucked up the courage to try this on the lowest setting. I’m not even sure it was a setting because there’s a pretty wide range between on and where the dots indicating intensity start. I’m slowly working on getting used to the sounds, smells, and feel first. I found the dial easy to turn. I’m proceeding cautiously but optimistically. [SEP] I received this set undamaged and in good working order. I tried the different heads included, and have to say that it definitely works as intended. You are using electricity, so please follow all safety guidelines and do not use it for things it was not intended. Much like a tens unit, this unit sends current into the skin. At its lowest settings, you merely feel a slight pleasant vibration. I lack the courage to try it at its highest setting because it would surely give a pretty significant jolt. In between those extremes, there are several settings that create a good working base for a variety of uses. For instance, it gives instructions on aging or delicate skin, when applying serums, and when trying to alleviate pain.<br /><br />The booklet is pretty clear on its warnings, suggestions, and instructions. The box it came in has a magnetic closure, dense foam to cradle the different FRAGILE glass heads, and the unit itself. It will take some experimentation with to find the optimum level of comfort and efficacy. [SEP] Eternal Clear High Frequency Facial Machine<br />| Skin Therapy Wand w/ Neon | Portable<br />Handheld High Frequency Facial Wand | with<br />4 Neon Powered Glass Tubes for Skin and<br />Scalp<br /><br />My wife and daughter were very interested in trying a high frequency skin therapy machine.<br />There are quite a few on the market, all ranging from very expensive, to super cheap. However,<br />this one had good reviews and the price was fair. So, they decided to try it. They were very<br />impressed with the results.<br />My daughter is an athlete and sometimes her skin will break out. With this machine, she can<br />target her break outs, and eliminate them much quicker than with most acne treatments. My wife<br />has fine lines that she wanted to work on, and this machine definitely made her skin look<br />smoother than before she used it.<br />They both think that with continuous use, they will see even better results over time. Therefore,<br />based on its performance and its price, this is definitely worth the money. Five stars!

It doesn't hurt, but doesn't seem to do much either. If I hadn't gotten this as a freebie, I would return this. [SEP] My daughter has cystic acne and I’m battling hair loss so after researching the benefits of high frequency we both agreed that this device is conducive to our needs.<br /><br />Studies have proven that high frequency has shown remarkable results for the issues we’re dealing with so we both added this device to our beauty regimen & we’re glad we did!<br /><br />This Eternal Clear High Frequency Therapy Wand treats both the skin as well as the scalp. It comes with four different wands that easily attach and detach just by placing it in and pulling it out. It’s easy to hold and the turn dial button simply adjusts the frequency. It’s recommended that you use it up to 3-4 sessions per week.<br /><br />We’ve only been using it for two weeks now so we haven’t notice a significant difference. However, my daughter’s skin does look visibly clearer. Her dark spots are definitely less noticeable & her skin has a healthy glow which can also be contributed to a combination of her facial serums as well.<br /><br />I’m currently using the comb and haven’t seen a reduction of hair loss or thickness as of yet. The glass comb feels tingly but soothing to my scalp and It glides easily throughout my hair. Neither of us has experienced any pain, discomfort or irritation.<br /><br />As we’re both in the early stages of usage, we’ll continue to use this device in hopes of achieving optimal results. As for now, we’re both enjoying the ease of using this EternalClear Therapy High Frequency Kit! [SEP] I stumbled upon this kit and wanted to try it increase blood circulation to my scalp. I am a novice so after carefully reading the instructions, the device was fairly simple to operate but the instructions did not explain which tool is used for what area of your face. Lucky for me, the hair tool is obvious but I had to look at the product description on the Amazon listing to educate myself on the other 3 tools.<br /><br />The wand handle is a little bulky but inserting the glass tools into it is very easy. The rotary knob to turn device on/off and to control the intensity is located at the base of the wand. The intensity is indicated by a series of dots going from smallest to largest making it a guessing game in determining the level of intensity. Instead, I wish the intensity was labeled by number to better gauge what works best for each user. Perhaps if level 4 didn’t give me good result, i’ll know with some level of certainty that I need to turn it up to level 5 or 6. Again, I am a novice so perhaps this is standard for these kinds of devices.<br /><br />I have used it a few times and I have enjoyed the experience but I haven’t notice any change in my hair as of yet. Not sure if I should increase the intensity or what intensity I used during my last treatment but i’ll continue to use and monitor my progress. Overall, great device with numerous applications and benefits. [SEP] Update: I lowered my review to 3 stars. I think there are other devices on the market for less money that work better. I literally have to fiddle around with the wand in the device to get it to work consistently. It doesn't matter which wand I choose, they all do not work instantly with the device. I have to push and wiggle it around and turn up the device to high before it finally activates the wand. For $75 I think that's unacceptable. It does eventually work and provides the same benefits as other high frequency devices. It just doesn't function consistently on the first try. That's annoying.<br /><br />I had a different high frequency device before this one that broke after about 5 years of use. I really loved that device so I was excited to try this one. It is 25 bucks more than my previous one so I thought it would be even better. I'm not disappointed with the performance, but I will say that I have to turn it up a lot higher to get the electricity to the wands than my previous model and the knob to adjust the settings is REALLY stiff and hard to turn. Overall I don't like it quite as much as my cheaper model, however I swear by high frequency. It kills the bacteria that causes acne. It helps your skin absorb your skincare products and it helps reduce fine lines and wrinkles. I love high frequency!!! [SEP] I was so scared to use this because electricity is not my friend. I am always getting electrocuted so you can imagine how I felt about this machine. So I tried it on hubby first because yup, he is my guinea pig. After watching a few videos on how to use it, I learned that you can use something slippery to help the wand slide better on the face. I used a moisturizing aloe gel. You can use it directly on the face or with a mesh in between the face and the wand. And you have to place your finger on the wand and then turn it on to ground it and do the same before turning it off. I used it directly on Hubby's face and he said he felt a small tingle that was not uncomfortable. While using it, it does let out a strange scent that I later learned is called 'OZONE' which is normal. Now let me tell you, hubby has very oily skin, but when I finished the treatment, his face was so smooth and soft to the touch that I could not stop touching his face, and the few lines that he had seemed to have been erased. I finally used it on myself when I broke out during that time of the month and the few bumps that I had disappeared by the next day. I highly recommend this machine because it's great for a weekly beauty routine and it's such a great price. [SEP] I cannot get the smell of the neon out of my nose.<br /><br />first. you have to keep your finger toughing the glass rod at all times or else you will shock yourself hard depending on the level you use.<br /><br />second.. this smells so bad to have right up in your face, it's honestly the hugest turn-off of using this product. I have only used it once. it sits under my sink because I hate how nasty it smells.<br /><br />thirdly, I saw an ad for this kind of product on ticktock and the woman doing it didn't have the product on. if she donned one she would have been touching it or else would have winched from the shock that does happen the second your finger slips, then there was no light on the inside of the tube.<br /><br />this neon tubing is very sciency there's a light and some electrical current inside that you can see going on when it's turned on.<br /><br />fourthly I will say this product does work. I noticed the skin under my eyes was less droopy and dark. but the part that shocked me the most is how beautiful my hair was after running the comb wand through my hair and on my scalp. it gave my messy curls a volume without static flyaways, brushed out curls with bounce, and shaped nicely I did also notice my hair was very soft after, which to me was a pleasant surprise! I wholeheartedly live the results of this product.<br /><br />I just wish that after it was done I didn't have to smell it in my nose all day/,",3,True

Unfortunately, that arrived cracked but it still works. The pill is cut by a razor-like blade in the middle of the plastic cap. The pill has to be balanced on the tray below. Its use is somewhat successful.<br /><br />The two single-day pill boxes open easily and are portable for travel. They do what they are supposed to do, which is hold pills. However, my boyfriend and I wish these were clear so that the pills can be seen. This is the only negative with the cases. Also, the case covers are held on by a thin piece of plastic that will eventually fall off with lots of use.<br /><br />The current price of $9.99 is on the expensive side for this set but still competitive. There are better pill cases on the market. However, the cutter is what makes this set worth it to me if only it were not pre-cracked. [SEP] I loved this little pillbox and pill splitter set that came from Amazon.  The two pillboxes are for morning and night, and are of opaque plastic, so no one can look at the medications that you take.  The pill splitter is wonderful, splitting the pills perfectly, without crunching them into dust.<br /><br />My only possible gripe is that the two pill boxes are not attached in any way, and one could get morning and evening mixed up. But that's a tiny complaint, and is overshadowed by the quality of the rest of it.<br /><br />P.S.:  This is a small sized set of pill boxes.  If you take many medications or vitamins, Amazon has many other pillboxes that will serve you better than this one. [SEP] I ordered this set of 2 pill boxes (and pill cutter), so I could fill our boxes for 4 weeks (1 month) instead of the 3 weeks I have been doing.  Such a pain to drag everything out, even though we don't take that many.  There are two of us, and our other boxes are larger and clear, and I had to use a felt marking pen to write who belongs to whom.  These new boxes are good because of the different colors.  Until I change out the old 3 wk. boxes for the new, there is a slight style difference that I hope will not be a distribution problem.  These new boxes work vertically (right side opening) instead of the usual horizontal (open in front) design.  Confusing, because most boxes are the horizontal style = the 4 stars.  As for the pill cutter, it works great, nice clean split! [SEP] These are a really nice value for the price -- two pill cases and a pill cutter. I liked that these had space for only one set of pills per day and can always use an extra case, so thought they'd be perfect for me. And I can see a lot of instances in which these might work well for someone.<br /><br />First, unlike most pill containers, there's braille on each day of these so those with vision problems can easily distinguish one day from another. The letters of the week on each slot are very large, so in theory, they're easy to read. I also like that I can carry one smaller row of pills rather than typical cases, which are much larger and made for twice a day pills.<br /><br />The problem is that the cases aren't see through, so it's hard to know whether or not the days are filled just from glancing at it. I didn't realize how often I glance at the pill case to see if it needs to be refilled. And while the letters ARE large and there's braille to distinguish each day, the letters are the same color as the case itself, which I still find hard to see.<br /><br />The addition of a pill cutter was just a bonus for me, but these are always nice to have on hand. [SEP] It looks tiny in my hand, but there’s plenty of space for all my pills! I have 3 big capsules plus 2 small ones, they fit in easily. The quality is beyond my expectation, great product!",3,True

It's just not powerful enough for my needs but if you have thinner or short hair it might work well for you. [SEP] The Ionic Hair Dryer in black and gold is nice and sleek.

I have long hair past my shoulder and having a powerful hair dryer is very important to me. It took me about 9mins to dry my hair.

[SEP] [[VIDEOID:f310037fe9f7e4560202c12cd59831bd]] The order comes with one ionic hair dryer. The hair dryer is in black and gold color. There are three (3) different type of attachments that you can snap onto the device. The attachments are to be used for different uses. There is a wide-tooth comb, diffuser, and styling concentrator.<br /><br />The hair dryer has a nice grip but it is pretty heavy. If you are using the hair dryer to dry long and thick hair like mine which takes a long time, it will start to weigh heavier over time. It comes with a black travel bag but I wouldn't take this hair dryer to travel with.<br /><br />The hair dryer has two settings you can control for temperature and wind speed. There is a LED screen that shows what setting you are on (fan icon shows the wind speed and the degree shows the temperature). You control them but using the + or - button. However, you cannot use both functions at the same time. There is a set temperature if you are trying to control the wind speed and vice versa. I did not feel the temperature nor the wind speed change much even if I increased or decreased the settings, and the range is pretty big. I never had a good experience using it because it ends up taking forever compared to a normal and more afforable hair dryer I use. Though it had good functions I was pretty disappointed with the hair dryer. [SEP] This blow-dryer is adorable and so modern looking. I love it, it's easy to turn up the heat and intensity. It comes with three attachments, but I'm just planning on using the main one most of the time. For storage it comes with a really nice and large velvet dust bag. Instead of just buttons there are different levels represented by numbers. My only con is its in Celsius no option for Fahrenheit. That's my only con and considering my old blow-dryer didn't have a temperature display that's not a huge problem. [SEP] This is a really nice hair dryer. Compact enough for travel and you don't have to sacrifice power. The controls for setting heat and fan speed are easy to customize, once you get the hang of it and what you set it to becomes the default setting for the next use when you turn on, which was convenient.  The cord is sufficiently long, I would consider it ""professional"" length. It came with a travel bag, which I probably won't be able to find when I go to travel, but a nice touch. I wasn't impressed with the quality of the barrel brush that was included, but I'm also exceedingly picky about my hair brushes.  The instructions to change from the standard nozzle that comes already attached to the dryer to one of the other two choices, the diffuser or smoothing, are impossible to decipher.  Basically the attachments snap on and off. Pull to remove, pop back on until it snaps to install desired attachment.<br />The only feature I feel is missing on this is a loop at the bottom of the handle/grip to hang this dryer from a hook. I will have to figure out a way to store this when not in use because I'm a neat freak and nothing gets left on my vanity top when I've finished drying/styling my hair, which is daily, thus the 4star rating. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:3b85ff538f2fce07059a9b386550f24b]] Edit 5/25/22:<br />This hair dryer was honestly the best hair dryer I used in my entire life, until it wasn’t. It just won’t continue running. The first hair dryer I received started only blowing cold air, even though it was on the hot air setting. But before that happened, the lcd display screen had started wigging out and blinking like crazy. The numbers would be randomly, and partially, missing. The seller sent a replacement promptly and assured me this was nothing they had experienced before. The replacement worked during first use, but the numbers were wigging out and blinking. It went completely rogue on the second use. It decided to stop blowing any air at all (cold or hot), after a few seconds of use, with the lcd screen still showing numbers like it was on and running. If I unplug the hair dryer and wait awhile, it will run again for about 15 seconds and then do the same thing; no air but still displaying numbers (wigging out and blinking). I’ve reached out to support again but haven’t heard back yet. As much as I loved this hair dryer, when it did run, I have to advise you to look somewhere else. This one has serious electrical issues.<br /><br />Original:<br />The ENISECA 1875 Watt Negative Ionic Hair<br />Dryer is the best hair dryer I have ever used… in my life. Hands down, a curly girl’s dream dryer. Where to start….<br /><br />First off, it’s a bit different in that you hear it blowing (quite loud) and you feel some air (kind of) but it’s like almost nothing but heat comes out. I’ve been using old school dryers with the huge toothy diffusers forever and didn’t know this technology existed!<br /><br />There is a handy LCD screen on the side to tell you if you are in hot or cool mode and at what temperature it is set. Unfortunately, it shows only Celsius with no option to change to Fahrenheit. It starts at 50C by default every time you turn it on. I took it to 75C and my hair was nearly completely dry in 3 minutes time. It goes to 99C but I wasn’t using heat protectant so wasn’t feeling that brave.<br /><br />The instructions leave a little to be desired. While they definitely make a noble attempt at thorough, a lot was lost in translation. Literally. Some really rough translation from Chinese to English is going on in there. With the dryer in your hand (plugged in to put it in use), and doing your best with directions, you can figure it out pretty quick. The first seven pages of the twelve page booklet are safety warnings. Plus, there’s a short maintenance/troubleshooting section on the last page. There’s no support contact info. If you have issues beyond the provided troubleshooting, you’ll have to reach out through Amazon.<br /><br />Function: It’s worth noting, the air speed does not change. The temp does. The air speed on my dryer was constant and only the degree of temperature changed with the +/- buttons. The instructions imply temp, as well as ‘wind’ speed, change with +/- buttons. So I don’t know if mine is faulty by not changing air speed or not. Either way, my dryer performed like a rockstar and I wouldn’t change a thing … except maybe being able to see Fahrenheit as opposed to Celsius. LoL<br /><br />There’s a cool setting and heat setting as well as a large range of heat. Press and hold the power button three seconds to turn it on/off. The hair dryer starts automatically at 50 degrees Celsius by default. You will tap the plus button to increase temperature and minus button to decrease temperature as needed. Tapping the power button twice, quick clicks, while it’s in use will switch to cool mode and the LCD will read 99C with the fan emblem. Tapping the power button again one time switches back to heat and back to the 50C default. Note: You’ll know you are in cool mode by the little fan emblem on the LCD screen. Video attached for reference.<br /><br />I absolutely love that it is push button and not a slide lever. Often times I couldn’t turn my old dryer off without grabbing a hand towel for traction. Hair product on the hands made them too slippery for the slide lever. That’s no longer an issue with this dryer! Also, this dryer is incredibly lightweight and fairly compact compared to traditional hair dryers that aren’t specifically compact for  travel . It has a very classy look in matte black with gold trim.<br /><br />It arrived with a large storage bag, a gold colored 1 inch round brush, and three attachments: the diffuser, a smoothing nozzle (already attached  upon arrival), and a third nozzle with really short teeth which is not described in the manual. You change out the nozzles by simply popping them off and on. They have a tight grip so don’t be afraid. You’ll think you are going to break something, but you won’t.<br /><br />About the noise … yeah, it is loud. Quite loud in my opinion. I’d say it’s twice as loud as my old hair dryer. It is definitely NOT the low noise variety as advertised. But, I’ll follow that with, the noise level is definitely not worth overlooking this dryer. My curls are crazy bouncy and not one frizzy, belligerent hair is out of place.<br /><br />The heat…. It is definitely hot. Depending on the setting you choose , hotter than hot!! If you were not using heat protectant already, you will definitely want it with this one. At just 75C, it was nearly too hot for my hand that was scrunching the hair as it dried.<br /><br />Overall, I’m giving this hair dryer 5 stars but would give 10 if I could. There’s only one other product I’ve found in the last five years that I’ve been this excited about and I found it here on Amazon too! But that’s in another review, and non-hair related. I highly recommend you grab some heat protectant and this dryer, especially if you are a curly girl/guy, and you will be as excessively pleased as I am. [SEP] Pictures only for now, will update with product review very soon!<br /><br />Super cute hair dryer with accessories & carrying bag!<br />Hopefully it will work as good as it looks because it looks super sleek!<br /><br />Update:<br />Used this the night before last to blow dry my daughters THICK hair, it smelled a little weird (hopefully just to using for the first time, not like a fire or anything just an smell that wasn’t there before using it, nothing bothersome or anything like that.. I just have a really good sense of smell)!<br />Anyway, we didn’t use the included brush yet, my daughter grabbed her wet brush & later I grabbed a different lightweight paddle brush that I actually got off here & finished with that. It took awhile due to my daughter having literally the thickest head of hair I have ever felt in anyone in my life (my hair used to be thick, but when I get hers in a ponytail I don’t think my fingers can touch if I put them around it, it’s thick thick!<br />Even though she kept trying to lay her head on me because we laid in bed while drying it, or complained most of the time we finally got it as dry as she would let me. The turntable nozzle was a nice use to direct the air where it needed to go (didn’t even try it without that to be honest) & her hair was SUPER smooth once done. She asked why her hair can’t always look like that, she is 13 so she has had her hair blown dry quite a few times but we mainly just let it air dry! It was super easy to change the temp (I do wish they were in Fahrenheit, not Celsius because we just don’t use that type of measurement much in the US)!<br />I would like to use it a few more times before saying I completely recommend, but for now it is a nice addition & I am glad we have it to try & hopefully fall utterly in love with in the next few uses :)",3,True
Paper Drinking Straw Disposable - 125 Biodegradable Drinking Straws - Thick Paper Straws for Hot Cocoa Soft Drink - Pretty White with Red Stars Party Supplies Compostable Straws Drinking Paper,[],[],,3.3,15,1522,"Finding alternate “straw” options can be overwhelming. Do you want disposable or reusable.<br /><br />In the disposable case, there are only a few choices. Paper is one of them.<br /><br />These are a bit less reliable than other paper straws I’ve used, and they cannot be used for a lengthy period of time weather in soda or tea.<br /><br />They might work temporarily, but they might need to be replaced if using for a lengthy amount of time. [SEP] Could these straws be any cuter? Photos don't do them justice.<br />So much better than plastic. We use various brands of paper straws, and have since I first saw the turtle YouTube video a few years ago. We're used to them now. Yes, they do take some getting used to. Not only is it a different feel, but you usually can't come back to your beverage hours and hours later without some slight meltdown.<br />Worth the minor inconvenience.<br />And did I mention cute? [SEP] These paper straws stand up well to liquids without getting soggy, though they make carbonated beverages fizz a bit for the first few sips. I would like to see them in a slightly larger size than the current 5-millimeter inside diameter. [SEP] Pros:<br />Compostable straws that hold up to  both hot and cold beverages sounds is a great idea.<br />Since they are disposable, you don't need to clean them after each use.<br />They seem sturdy.<br />Cons:<br />There are no provisions for bending the straw without it kinking at the bend point.<br />The straws are not individually wrapped.<br />The manufacturer""s box came with seals on both ends that had already been cut. This gives me an insecure feeling about possible contamination.  At least two other reviewers reported the exact same problem. [SEP] I am not happy to see an open box, as in there was a thank you sticker sealing this and it was cut open. Also the packing... why would you put paper straws in a thin bag? Some of the straws were crushed. I also received red straws with white stars, not white straws with red stars. Me and my girls used them and they get mushier quicker than other paper straws that we have. They might be fine for a quick drink but if left in liquid for a couple hours, they start to fall apart. [SEP] I really like the idea of biodegradable drinking straws because plastic ones are currently not recyclable.<br />They are strong as plastic ones and do not soften for hours even though they are made of paper.<br />As paper they do not have sharp ends like plastic ones, so they are physically safer.<br /><br />It is not so good for drinking plain water at room temperature because you can slightly taste the starch from the paper. You won't notice it if water is flavored or cold/hot.<br /><br />What is not good is the packaging. Safety seals were broken on both ends upon receipt. They are not taking the shipping and handling well. At first I was not sure if someone had repackaged the straws. The seller is excellent and will replace the damaged goods, but that does not insure you will get a good one because my second one came with good seals but with a broken box with straws exposed. I would not go through this hassle until they improve packaging.",3,True
"Etana — Vitamin C Gummies — with Rosehip Extract & Beta Carotene — Immune Support Gummy Supplement - 60 ct. — Gelatin-Free, Vegan, No Artificial Colors or Flavors",[],[],,3.8,30,267,"These gummy vitamin C supplements are great. I love that they include bioflavonoids. I do dislike the amount of vitamin c per gummy, but that is pretty standard. You'll have to take 4 of these to equal one pack of emergen-C. They taste great and are a good option for kids. [SEP] These Vitamin C gummies taste great and they are much easier to take than those nasty, giant pills.<br /><br />Each gummie has 10 calories and 125 mg of Vitamin C. The recommended serving is two gummies daily. The gummies are vegan and do not contain gelatin.<br /><br />One other note: They were delivered on a hot Texas day when the temperature was about 400 degrees (okay, that is a slight exaggeration) and they were not melted or clumped together.<br /><br />This is an easy and delicious way to get some extra Vitamin C. [SEP] Love that it is Vegan and clearly marked as such on the bottle.  Love that!<br /><br />They look like little candies - but they are not too sweet, not too candy-like.  They are slightly tart.  They are a nice soft chewy gummy - reminiscent of a fruit chew candy (that sort of looks like these).<br /><br />They are fun to take.  You can also keep the bottle in your purse or at your desk.  Then you can have a little treat while boosting your immunity - especially in flu and cold season (in normal times anyway).  If you thought my review was helpful - why not click the ""Helpful"" button. Thanks! : ) [SEP] These are delightful little vitamin C gummies. Their sweet/tart flavor is so delicious that my roommate and I have taken to having our nightly dose as dessert. As a vegetarian, I appreciate that these are among the gummy vitamins I can actually eat since they are made with pectin rather than gelatin. It’s also nice that these are naturally colored and flavored. These don’t stick to my teeth, and they are even more enjoyable than I remember orange slice candy being as a child. I’m definitely hooked. [SEP] This is a tasty, easy way to get your daily dose of Vitamin C. No weird smell or flavor, just citrus, easy to chew and swallow. Should probably have a child proof cap! [SEP] It says it contains rosehip and beta carotene but I don’t see any in the supplement facts this made me dissatisfied as I love to have those on my vitamins. I work in the hospital with high risk patients having different comorbidities and especially with Covid-9 everywhere. The amount of vitamins it contains is too low for me with only 250mg per two gummies. I usually take 1000mg of vitamin C in the morning and at night aside from other supplemental vitamins. It tastes and looks like the candy I was used to during my childhood days and it can be addicting. Be sure to keep this out of children as they would think of this as such. Price point is expensive for me especially that it doesn’t contain that much vitamin C. [SEP] This is a great alternative for people who hate taking pills. Not only it’s easier but taste so good! Will definitely use them from now on. [SEP] Now that the fall is approaching and there would be more viruses in the air, it is of utmost importance to have immunity to fight these airborne microorganisms. I got this vitamin c gummies for the same purpose. They come in a bottle of 60 gummies with a serving recommendation of 2 gummies per day. Each gummy supplies 125 mg of vitamin C. You can taste the flavor of orange In the gummies. I also like that these gummies don’t have gelatin in them. Since they are in gummy form, the kids would love them and they are good for adults too. [SEP] My kids loves these it is their favorite. [SEP] Very tasty & informative. I really liked the labeling. Also, as soon as you rip the seal it smells like a bowl of fresh oranges.",3,True
"High Level Elderberry Immunogummies | Ultra Premium Immune Support Gummies Herbal Supplements with Vitamin C and Zinc | Gluten Free, Pectin, Vegetarian, 100% Natural Flavor and Colors | 90 Gummies",[],[],,4.7,51,898,"I love elderberry products and these gummies seem to help with fighting off colds and illness. My family takes them at the first sign of a cold and it really helps to keep the symptoms at bay. They also include vitamin C and zinc so you get a nice dose of protection. Easy to chew and tastes good too. [SEP] The vitamin C in these gummies is ascorbic acid and scientific research says that's not really vitamin C.  I think the best ingredient in these gummies is the zinc.  Zinc is a good at helping the immune system to fight off cold viruses.  These gummies taste great and I could eat the entire bottle in one sitting if I didn't exercise control, but I'm not too keen on the vitamin C source. [SEP] I have tried two different elderberry based gummies in the past few months. This one from High Level is, well, a higher level gummy. There is significantly less added sugars and less not-so-good additives in this formulation.<br /><br />The flavor is not the best but the gummies are indeed edible. They have a sort of ""dry"" feel to them versus any other gummy you may be familiar with. However, if you are not super sensitive to the feel of your gummies, you'll be just fine.<br /><br />I can't speak to the effectiveness of these other than to say that I have come close to catching a bug this winter only to have it quickly leave my system. I do take other supplements as well, so I can't conclude that this elderberry supplement was the one factor. All said, it could very well have contributed to my well-being.<br /><br />Give it a try for sure I say. [SEP] Everything was perfect [SEP] I work at a hospital and feel like I am getting sick every other day. I'm really excited to have a little extra boost my immune system with these and hopefully cut down on those sick days. these taste really good not exactly like candy gummies but completely enjoyable so I know I will be consistent about taking them since they taste good. [SEP] This vitamin tastes wonderful, and has done so much for my sinuses.  My nose has never been so clear since I can remember!  I'm usually using kleenex like crazy but have not been using much at all since I started taking these gummies.  So grateful I started taking these!! [SEP] My kids love these the flavor and texture is great.  These do a great job of keeping my kids healthy during sickly times at school!  I only gave it 4 stars because I think they are a little high priced compared to similar products. [SEP] I’m obsessed with these tasty gummies!! I’m a flight attendant and always trying to avoid getting sick from all the germs on airplanes. I started taking these every time I have a trip, and I swear they work to really boost my immunity! Also, they’re so delicious, it’s like eating candy. Addicting!! [SEP] These are excellent in both taste and effectiveness.  I was twice exposed to people with the flu and I doubled up on these and nary a sniffle.<br />In fact, my upper respiratory system feels better than it has for years during a rather wet winter. [SEP] My habit is always to wait at least a few weeks before reviewing anything. That way, readers of my comments know I am not just excited about a package coming in the mail but have also tested its usefulness.<br /><br />I struggle with severe allergies year-round. Elderberry has helped me fight back. I believe in natural remedies with Elderberry firmly at the top of the list. I usually buy a capsule or a liquid. The gummies are a nice alternative if you don’t enjoy the taste of the liquid Elderberry option.  Plus, vegetarian and filled with natural ingredients.  Easy to chew and flavorful.  Been making my kids take them during flu season and they love the taste.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.",3,True
Morning Drink Multi-Vitamin with Biotin for Hair Skin and Nails - 32 Fl Oz,[],[],,2.9,34,678,"I have been taking this liquid vitamin daily and at first the taste is not great at all. You eventually get used to the taste after a few days. I have already noticed an increase in my energy level since taking this! [SEP] I had just finished my first bottle of Vegan Morning multi-vitamin the day before and opened a new bottle.  Right after taking the dose I felt my face burning - looked in the mirror and it was bright red.  Then my arms also started burning and turned red.  It was scary!  I drank a good 6 glasses of water to dilute the reaction.  Funny thing, I noticed that the seal was raised up when I opened the bottle, and the liquid was a different color.  My husband had emailed the company yesterday and still have received no response.  The bottle says unconditionally guaranteed.  I do not recommend this product. [SEP] Despite being chock-full of vitamins, the flavor of this is too foul.  Both my wife and my daughter tried to fight the flavor but found it to be impossible to swallow because it just tasted awful.  They both wholeheartedly do not recommend this...absorbency is likely decent, if you can get past the taste. [SEP] I really like the ingredient list on this because it includes many/most of the things I try to actively ensure I take like b12 etc...in the form that I tolerate best. Many use inferior forms of b12 like cyanocobalamin but the methyl is far better tolerated and doesn't give me headaches like the other. The flavor is okay - tolerable. Not great. This claims high absorption and while I don't feel much different, it is fairly easy on the stomach and frankly, a lot easier than taking a bunch of pills. Make sure you shake it and keep refrigerated. I've added this to my list and would be inclined to buy again in the future. [SEP] I could only get one dose of this down and I will never recommend it. It smelled and tasted like rotten old vomit. After taking it my whole body seemed to flush and heat up. I started sweating even and after a little bit it was like the stuff was seeping out of my pores. This stuff is not good and should not be taken in my opinion. [SEP] First thing I do in the morning is drink my multi-vitamin. I can tell in few minutes that my body absorbed it. Highly recommended. [SEP] Pretty good product,  just taste is not the best,  I put in my orange juice for taking it<br />No adverse reactions as I read in other reviews [SEP] So I totally did feel a difference after taking this. The Niacin was very Strong and definitely NOT anti-flush.. so be ready for that or start with a lower does. Be sure to check the ingredients since some are extremely high in content, which kind of confused me.. if it’s already stronger than pills due to better absorbency, why add such high amounts of certain vitamins?!<br />But nevertheless, it did make me feel better.<br />The taste was Okay.. honestly not that great, but do-able...on the citrusy side of things with a thick consistency and a little chalky. I would recommend orange juice as a chaser. I also do want to stress that one should definitely eat a meal before taking this product to avoid a very upset stomach. [SEP] I have the flavor 3 stars, because it is not good. However, it is not bad either. It tastes just like a regular chewable vitamin, but more intense because it is a liquid. I believe liquid vitamins are the best way to go, this one is filled with good ingredients, vitamins and minerals. [SEP] Great flavor and vitamin profile. The only problem is that when I shake the bottle before use, the liquid gets into the grooves of the screw on cap and when I open it leaks the bright orange liquid all over everything. This wastes the product and also makes it difficult to take at work and just annoying to take in the morning when you know you’ll have to clean the mess up. Won’t repurchase for this reason unfortunately.",3,True
Reizen Prism Bed Spectacles,"['watch tv from your back!', 'Read without bending', 'Perfect for reading while riding (not driving!) in a car', 'Perfect for air planes!']","['Lazy glasses for bed reading, Air plane rides and much much more!']",27.0,3.9,107,3699,"These work great for both reading and watching TV while lying flat. They are sturdy and comfortable, and make a great gift that is actually useful. [SEP] I am surprised at how heavy and well made they are.  They really do what they state.  It is very easy now to lay in bed and watch tv without causing pain in my neck.  I didn't really like reading with them, because I need reading glasses, so trying to wear two pair of glasses at the same time is just not comfortable for me.  My husband liked them so much, that even though he doesn't have a neck injury, he wants a pair, just because he said it was so comfortable watching tv laying flat on your back. [SEP] WONDERFUL [SEP] OK [SEP] I bought a $6.00 pair of prisms from another seller and, although those worked, the image is not as clear as the one with these Reizens and the $6.00 pair were flimsy. The Reizens are solid and not at all flimsy; the only downside is they are a little bit heavy and I start to really notice the weight on the bridge of my nose if I'm reading for extended periods of time. For a medium price and much better quality than others I've seen, I'd buy these again. These were just what I needed so I could read while laying down and not have to prop up on multiple pillows.<br />*Also, these were extremely useful for my father who had back surgery. [SEP] bought these for my mother who is having corneal replacement surgery & has to lie completely flat on er back for most of the time - with these glasses she can be flat  on her back in bed & still see TV - of course she complains that her feet are in the way - I offer to cut them off - but alas she decided a better option was to seperate her feet - Duh. Mother's what are you going to do with them<br /><br />But really - to be able to see forward when lying flat is a great aide - one problem - they don't fit over your glasses - so if you cannot see without glasses - if everything is blurry witout tem - then these prism glasses will be of no help<br /><br />If they made these as ""clip ons"" for regular glasses (like clip on sun glasses)- that would be the ticket [SEP] Sturdy, well made.  A little heavy but that's due to it's  durable built.  Better than others I've bought. [SEP] I did some improvement to it (glue cloth blinder under to avoid irritating annoying TV  light from bottom),  it is great to fall a sleep,  I use almost every night. [SEP] I use these every night watching tv in bed. It has helped the pain in my neck and I highly recommend. [SEP] These things are just great and should be considered ,along with Ice Cream and the Light Bulb as one of the worlds top inventions.

Alpine Plug&Go Disposable Foam Ear Plugs – Sleeping/Study/Work earplugs - Reduce Snoring and Improve Sleep - Free Key case - Anti-Irritation Coating and Universal fit,[],[],,3.4,41,1363,"I realize that the seller, in all honesty, advertises these earplugs as being disposable. That is, the seller recommends that the buyer use these ear plugs once only, and then throw them away. This is a fairly expensive way to use earplugs, and also rather inconvenient, because it means you need to keep regularly purchasing more of them. Personally, I have found, as is the case for other foam ear plugs I have used over the years, that these ear plugs can be washed and reused multiple times before they start to crack. Only then, in my opinion, is it truly necessary to discard them. I have attached a photo to show what it looks like when they crack.<br /><br />I make it a point, when washing these ear plugs with soap and water, to rinse them well, then pat and squeeze them thoroughly with a towel and let them air dry for at least 24 hours before using them again.<br /><br />Unlike other similar quality earplugs I own, when I wash these, they expand and get bigger. Fortunately, though, they don't seem to fit any tighter or more uncomfortably because of that expansion. I have attached a photo with a picture of one of these earplugs when new side-by-side with one that has been washed, as well as two other brands of earplugs I use that do not expand at all when washed and last a whole lot longer than these do over time.<br /><br />These aren't the least expensive ear plugs I have ever purchased, but they are reasonably priced for what is on offer. [SEP] These are really winners!<br />I keep them right by my nightstand for the times when hubby wants to watch TV and I want to go to sleep.<br />Highly recommended. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:b1fe859bd11b981aee27aa8c05bb948]] These are standard sized, disposable, foam ear plugs. They're not any different than others. What sets this apart is the little keychain that holds two at a time. That's pretty cool. The nice thing is, they're standard size, so after you use these up, replacement ear plugs will likely fit in here too. [SEP] Protecting your hearing is very important. These ear plugs are easy to use and they do a good job. The plastic travel case is a great idea and I attached it to a zipper on my rifle case. [SEP] For $10 you get a set of 10 ear plugs - 5 pairs.<br />As per manufacturer, they reduce noise by up to 35 dB. Apparently it can be used as ear plugs for swimming, or work, sleep - I have tried them when working with them using chainsaw. I believe that they stand up to the claim - I usually use over the head ear muffs, and reduction in noise seems similar. The only downside is proper placement - with ear muffs, it is one and done, those plugs are bit more complicated - you gotta kneed them, then place in your ear canal and let them expand to properly seal it. If done properly, it works, if in a hurry - it might not.<br />The coolest part? Keychain holder! it fits one pair - beats taking them out and putting them in your pocket...I can almost guarantee you will lose them. Plus they will not get squished or dirty. [SEP] As someone who is quite sensitive to noise, I’ve tried a lot of ear plugs over the years, and I quite like these Alpine Plug & Go foamies because they are effective and non-irritating. The slow rise foam seals well and blocks noise effectively. The plugs are short and soft enough that they are comfortable for a side-sleeper to wear to bed. The included case is sturdy and doesn’t pop open in my bag. The one downside is that this is pretty pricey for just 10 ear plugs and a case; my usual favorite Howard Leight Laser Lite ear plugs are much cheaper per pair so I won’t be switching to Alpines for daily use. [SEP] I live in the suburbs and work late at nights. These earplugs are handy when I go to sleep to block out noises from the family (cell phone, TV, video games), nearby lawnmowers, car horns, etc., and while they do a good job of blocking out certain frequencies, there are certain, annoying, sounds that still make it through, such as the sound of a cellphone ringing.<br /><br />They feel nice -- like you would expect. Just give them a little squeeze and they expand into your ear canal. The carrying case is nice, but let's be real, it's not free like the package suggests. At this price for 10 earplugs, you're definitely paying for that handy little carrying case. So, if the case is that important to you, I'd definitely recommend these. However, if you're on a budget and just looking for some earplugs that cancel out noise and don't need a fancy little carrying case, you might want to look further. [SEP] I got these because my husband snores like crazy and sometimes I would like to get a full nights sleep. Out of the package they look super nice and come with a nice carrying case that you can put on a key chain for trips. They somewhat cancel noise out but I have used other brands that work much better. I do have smaller ears but I cannot get these to fit right in my ear. I will roll them between my fingers for a good minute to get them to shrink up before putting them in my ear but they expand before I can insert them. Once I finally do get them somewhat set, I can still hear everything pretty well. They cancel a bit of the noise but they really don't work as well as I thought they would. [SEP] To me these are pretty standard earplugs, and work pretty well in reducing noise. The best part of the package, however, is a little holder with keychain attachment that works really well for keeping these handy and protected while traveling, or just near your bedside -- I sleep with earplugs, and can't tell you how many kinds of these things I've dropped/lost over the years, so the holder is a great addition. [SEP] They fit tightly and don't swell uncomfortably. I like the keychain holder.",3,True

Conzory Hypoallergenic Stain Remover for Sensitive Skin (Pack of 2),[],[],,3.3,10,1100,"I use a lot of stain removers. I have a puppy, an older dog and older husband and myself. We are all stain collectors. For me, just fixing a mug of coffee will result in coffee on my clothing. A nice amount. And if we go out to eat, I will surely get something that falls on me from the transportation with a spoon or fork. My husband always spills his food. The dogs leave stains all over the furniture and the floor - especially the puppy. He is about all done with going in the house, but I don't trust him to always go in the back to go potty. So, we have stain removers and use them darn near every wash. [SEP] This stain remover is different than other ones I've used. Its like a deodorant stick style dispenser. I used it on paint and fruit stains so far and it worked very well. It could be used for a large variety of different stains and its easy to apply- rub it on and let it sit for 15 minutes, and then wash in warm/hot water. My kids always get all types of stains on their clothes, especially white, so this comes in handy. A couple minutes after you apply it, you could see the stain remover interact with the stain. The scent is not overpowering and has a fresh smell. I love that it's for sensitive skin, biodegradable, and natural, doesn't contain chemicals. [SEP] I was really hoping this stain remover would work. It claims to be great for difficult stains. I tried it on a variety of stains and it did not even lighten any of them beyond how much I could have gotten out just rinsing with water and laundry detergent. So yes, this was gentle and did not bother my skin, but it is pretty worthless if it can't get out stains.

It does a good job removing, or at least lightening stains, although some stains still need multiple washes, even when treated with this stick.",3,True
Oopee Toilet Room Spray - Odor Eliminator For Strong Odor Room Fresheners - Toilet Spray For Poop Odor Eliminator - Air Fresheners For Home Room Fresheners - Travel Size Bathroom Spray - Blossom Scent,[],[],,4.3,94,1175,"This works like it’s major competition. It smells nice and does it’s job eliminating odor before you go. It is a good value with the two pack . [SEP] This is an OK performing toilet anti-odor spray. The scent is rather weak compared with other similar sprays I've used, but it is reasonably strong. It's a generic floral scent -- not all that different from a general air freshener type of scent, but not bad. It's certainly better than the odor it helps mitigate.<br /><br />As with other similar sprays, you need to use it before the toilet is used for maximum effectiveness. It has limited benefits if used after the toilet is used. A fair amount is needed (4 or 5 sprays) for good results.<br /><br />Compared with other similar products this is not as potent, and just an average value at best. Three stars. [SEP] Good price [SEP] I like the scent, however, I don't really think this spray works as well as the 'other' brands out there. [SEP] Perfect for those epic times after devouring 2 giant burritos. [SEP] i use it for kitchen and bathroom the scent almost eliminates odor quickly. works well for me and i really like it. thanks [SEP] This is about the worst thing I've ever received from Amazon. The product puts out a highly-perfumed, overwhelming scent that gives you an instant headache if you're sensitive to synthetic perfumes. And that's with just one spray. Worse, it takes forever to get rid of the scent. I would rather smell the bathroom odor. [SEP] These OOPEE Travel Toilet Room Fresheners are great for home use or on the go. They are compact ad portable, and have a very pleasant scent. The smell doesn't have that chemical scent to it like some room fresheners. I would buy from OOPEE again.<br /><br />Katiebabs [SEP] Works well [SEP] To me this doesn't have a scent..

The first two I tried on ripped immediately in between my fingers but the third did not. I put the third through its paces. I dug through dirt with it, gave it a good soapy wash, tugged and pulled on it and it didn’t tear. My fingers however felt overly compressed and sore afterward. [SEP] These are trash. The first two I put on ripped at the cuff, and so did the next two, and the next two. Literally threw these in the garbage. Don't waste your money. [SEP] Because I ended up receiving small gloves (which may be my fault)<br />and I can't get my hand in them, I can't speak much about them.<br />> Except to say they seem to be good quality.<br />> They don't stretch any<br />> They're the usual thickness one would expect.<br />> Small is - tip of middle finger to cuff = 9""<br />width across palm = 3 1/4""<br /><br />5 stars [SEP] To be fair, I should probably have ordered a larger sized glove. Still, when attempting to put this on, I didn't expect it to rip in multiple places rather than just refusing to go on. The gloves are very thin and lightweight, although that's more of an observation than a complaint.<br /><br />My wife, with smaller hands, was able to wear these without problem. I'd suggest buying one size bigger than you would normally use, as it's better to have gloves that are a bit loose than gloves which no longer provide protection. [SEP] Before you buy it, you have to know these are powder free, size S, and textured. First of all, I don't see them being textured. But they are not slippery due to their powder free nature. It may work for you.<br /><br />The size is really small even for size S. My wife usually get size S. But these are smaller than size S gloves she got. The real problem is that they don't stretch. You have to make sure the size fits you. I suggest you order one size larger.<br /><br />Compared with other gloves on the market, these are quite pricey. Make sure you need all the features in the description before you buy. [SEP] I thought these disposable gloves might be useful to wear while I ride the subway during the pandemic, but as other reviewers have noted, these size S items are small and flimsy and hence unusable.<br /><br />As I look at the product page, I don't see a sizing choice. My hands are not large -- I'm a short man, standing 5'7"" if I stand up straight -- but these gloves are a bear to get on.<br /><br />I tried them straight out of the box (which is another story I'll get to in a minute!), and both gloves ripped at the cuff as I tried to pull them on.<br /><br />I then tried applying body powder to my hands, and again the gloves ripped as I tried to get them on.<br /><br />After that I tried baby oil and then Vaseline and was able to get them most of the way on without ripping them, but still I couldn't get the fingers to fit correctly.<br /><br />But carrying gloves that also require oil or grease to wear is not practical for my on-the-go application.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the gloves don't come right out of the perforated window in the box the first time you use them. You have to open up the box at one of the end flaps and position the inner bag containing the gloves so you can access them properly through the window.<br /><br />The long and short of it is -- if Amazon offers the different sizes of these that are supposedly available, they MIGHT work for you if a proper sizing chart is provided on the ordering page.<br /><br />Until that time, you should probably give these a pass unless you have VERY small hands... [SEP] Please note the size is S here before you put order. I would say the quality here is good and fair enough to serve your purpose like preparing food, and all possible activities during this Covid-19 period. The S would be a good fit for children and teenagers, adult I would suggest at least M size otherwise you'll feel a little tight. Overall good product. [SEP] Those are very fine gloves for light-duty work. This is very fine for cooking, cleaning, painting, and other light-duty jobs. Unlike other gloves, my skin did not have any reaction while wearing them, but make sure you don't have a latex allergy before using them. I like my gloves very tight on my hand and size small fit me and my 10YO. Most people would want to order a size M or L. The cuff is long enough to cover the wrist for better coverage. Pretty useful to have them around, especially at this price, as everyday gloves.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] These gloves are true to size, maybe even a little on the small side.  I have small hands and the fit was a bit snug. I used them to chop onions and my finger poked through the tip on one hand before I could finish. I would recommend these for cooking or cleaning but definitely not for PPE. [SEP] 100 pack of small sized  disposable gloves. The gloves are quite thin but are more durable than expected as i have to really tug on them to put on properly and removing can be just as rough but I haven't torn them yet.

Women's Fleece Lined Leggings High Waist Soft Full Length Leggings Pants Black,['92% Polyester'],[],,3.1,28,11,"For positives, these are really nice, soft leggings. Super stretchy, high waisted and a deep rich black color. For negatives, they are too small for me. I am 5'7"" and weigh about 150 lbs and they do not fit comfortably (definitely too tight). I will be washing them and giving them to my daughter in law who is much thinner. I really liked these, just too bad they aren't a tad more stretchier. [SEP] I was a bit skeptical of the 'one size fits all' claim, but I thought I would try.  Lets start by saying that I am 5'6"" and wear a size 12.  I have long legs and more of a tummy than a butt issue.  I expected these to be a bit of a challenge to put on and I was right - it was like putting on pantyhose.  I did not these on, and I was impressed that the waist actually did reach my waist, and even slightly above.  I was even more impressed when I moved around and discovered that these did not even attempt to slide down.  The over all fit was, well let's just say 'snug'.  The only way I'd consider wearing these out of the house would be with a long, loose tunic (about like the mini dresses I wore as a teenager).  These leggings looked as though they had been spray painted on.<br /><br />These are nice leggings, although the fleece is not particularly fleece-y or thick, and appear to be well made out of quality material.  I would recommend these for somebody a size 10 or less. [SEP] These are listed as one size fits most. My thoughts on that were that that meant fits a lot of different sizes. Not. I wear a 14 and there way no way these were going on. I gave them to my oldest daughter, who wears an 8, and they barely fit. Not only were they difficult for her to get on in the first place, they kept sliding down, over time. The waistband doesn't hold them up very good and, with the thighs being so extremely tight, they kept wanting to work their way down. To be fair, they seem nice and warm. However, I wouldn't recommend these for anyone over a size 8 (AT MAX!) or, probably, under a size 6(?) maybe a 4 (?). Not my idea of ""one size fits most"".<br /><br />1 star - Awful! Want my money back!<br />2 stars - Bad but not horrendous.<br />3 stars - Decent/Good<br />4 stars - Really good!<br />5 stars - Excellent! Definitely recommend! [SEP] Well one size will fit most skinny people. I doubt thesewill accomodate plus sizes or curvy figures. That being said they are nicely made. The waist band is wide and textured. The insides are soft fleece while the exterior is smooth. They do stretch but not far. They are form fitting but comfortable. Instructions say to hand wash. Not in this lifetime. I laundered in a lingerie bag in cold water on the gentle cycle. Turned out fine. [SEP] I just dont care for them. They frare warm and soft but they wear like pantyhose. They kinda hard to get on and hang down kind of low in the ""crotch"" area and to me that's just not comfortable. I should mention they're 1 size fits all, I'm curvy(i.e. chubby lol but I'm working on it :) so maybe they would work better on someone smaller but for me I probably wont be wearing them much. [SEP] I was excited to get these pants and I wanted to like them but they are just not working for me for a lot of reasons.  The “one size fits all” is not true. I am only 5 feet tall and 120 pounds. I would normally wear a small and these are probably a large.<br /><br />They are advertised as high waisted and they are VERY high waisted. The waist band is about 6 inches high. I doubled it over and they are still very high-waisted.<br /><br />Not to be graphic, but I can grab a whole handful of excess fabric at the crotch. If I pull them up further to loose that excess fabric, they are even higher at the waist.<br /><br />I had to roll up the pant legs about 3 inches at the ankles.<br /><br />I am also not pleased about the fabric. It’s 88 percent polyester and 8 percent spandex—which should be okay normally, but these pants have no “control” feel to them at all. They don’t “hold you in” at all. They are also not smooth to the touch-they are more of a woven or knit fabric.<br /><br />Last but not least, there is no way I am going to hand wash or dry clean this type of garment as the tag instructs.  An evening gown yes—but yoga/work out pants—nope. If this can’t go in my washing machine, it’s not for me.<br /><br />On the positive side, the inside of the pants near your skin is like a jersey feel (they are advertised as fleece lined and they do have a bit of a warm fuzzy feel to them.). This is soft and would be nice in winter. But that can also be too warm if you are active.<br /><br />If my review was helpful please let Amazon know by clicking “helpful”. [SEP] The material for these felt good and they looked like they would be cute. Unfortunately, they are very, very small. The description claims now to worry if you have big thighs and that these would fit. Nope, nope, and never. At a size 16, my mom could barely get into them and even then they were tight.<br /><br />Stay away from these unless you're a smaller person. [SEP] These leggings seem pretty small right out of the package.  I'm 5'3"" and about 117 pounds so I had no problem getting them on.  Although this says it fits most, I suspect it does but the larger one is, the more difficult it may become.  The legs were longer than my legs but I just did some tucking at the bottom.  I do like the way they look.  They fit like a glove.  The crotch area does not embarrass me as it fits smoothly.  The waist is very high with a wide 4 inch band at the top. It stays up and is comfortable.  Obviously this is the type of leggings worn with a long top that goes over the waist and hips.  The fleece lining is black and feels very comfortable.  I like wearing these.  I like wearing these so much that I don't even mind that the instructions state to hand wash.  My rating is 4 stars because of the care needs as well as one size does not necessarily fit most.  I think it's important to share what body types work and don't work with these. [SEP] These are wonderful leggings! They are long and go up past my tummy, almost hiding my chubby rolls, which I definitely appreciate. I’ve worn it under dresses with boots and they looked great. It’s perfect for this time of year, when it starts getting chilly. I’ve bought these before and ruined them in the wash. Please be careful when washing these. I’ve learned to wash them on delicate and inside out so they don’t get all the lint stuck on them. I would definitely recommend.<br /><br />**If this review was helpful, please take a (literal) second and press the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you!* [SEP] As usual, ""One Size Fits All"" items do NOT fit all. These are made for an average-to-tall person with thin legs. I'm only 5'0 with muscular legs and a size 8. I had a hard time pulling them up over my thighs. The rise is also ridiculously long. The top reached the bottom of my bra - it felt like I was wearing maternity leggings. The ""stay put"" band squeezed my ribcage. There is no tag or any indicator of front vs back on these. I also feel like pants that don't have a seam down the center of the back, look odd on my butt. On the plus side, they are soft inside and weren't see through.",3,True

With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] I tend to avoid wearing gloves -- when I should wear them -- because they are clumsy.<br /><br />These gloves, however, leave me feeling more nimble. Dextrous.<br /><br />They are unlined, which I prefer.<br /><br />I'm not a huge consumer of household gloves. I've tried the typical Playtext and Ikea offerings. They are okay. But these feel more comfortable and better fitting. They seem to hold up well, too. [SEP] These are a PVC set of cleaning gloves.  This means that they can hold up to clorox and other harsh cleaning chemicals while you wear them to clean your home.  Being a thicker glove, they can hold up to more scrubbing action as compared to the thinner PVC gloves that are also on the market.<br /><br />These are advertised to be a Medium size, and I caution you to realize that this is a women's medium sized glove, and not a man's size.  For a man, this is very tight and I would suggest that the man orders a size larger than his normal size.<br /><br />Because these gloves are made from PVC, and because they are much thicker, I can see these being used for other projects beside cleaning.  For example, when working with paints, stains, glues, and anything else that you want to keep off of your hands - these are great.<br /><br />The gloves have a very fine lining of cotton that helps to improve comfort for longer wear-times.  The gloves also have a texture on the fingers and palm area to provide more grip.<br /><br />In summary - these are a great pair of PVC gloves with only a word of caution of choosing the correct size.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click on the helpful button that is below this review. [SEP] I used a pair of these gloves to work on a house remodeling project as I was working with chemicals and I am allergic to dust. I wore them for about 5 hours and they held up pretty well, protecting a significant portion of my forearm. Thet are thicker and other brands I have used, and the 3 pack is a good value for the price. The only drawback I noticed is the mostly smell the gloves had once I took them off, the moisture was purely from my hands sweating inside the glove after hours of labor. I washed the inside of the glove and let it air out and the smell went away, but it is an added imposition if your hands tend to sweat. [SEP] A lot better than the major brand gloves or something you might get in a 99 cent store. My wife really liked them. The flocked ones went on very easily the ones with out flocking were hard for me to put on. I needed a larger size. These overall are pretty good quality.  I think they will last a while. [SEP] These gloves fit perfectly!  I bought three pair and seems like the gloves will last forever! [SEP] You will find many uses for these  Pacific PPE gloves.  I have been using these gloves for cleaning inside the house and out, gardening and yard work to protect my hands from cuts, dirt and splinters.  They give you a good grip,  there is a texture on the fingers and the palm.  They should last you a long  time.  They are comfortable  and should fit most hand sizes.  My hands are small but they fit me good.  The flocked style gloves are made of cotton and PVC.  They are seamlessly weaved together providing an inside non-stick lining whereas the unlined ones do not have that liner. [SEP] I ordered these Pacific PPE 4 Pack Household Glove for general house cleaning and maintenance. I am a 30 year old man and usually wear a medium size glove in work gloves from home depot or harbor freight. These things must be in female sizing because these are TIGHT. Im able to get them on and work with them but I wish I had gotten a size larger, so men please size up at least once maybe twice. Other than that these gloves are very well made, the white and blue version is pretty good looking as gloves go, and the price is right.",3,True
"QIELIZI Pill Box and Pill Organizer with Lanyard,Large AM PM Medicine Pill Case 7 Day Travel Pills Box Daily Vitamin Container Fish Oil Holder (Colorful Flower Set)",[],[],,4.1,26,74,"This pill travel organizer is too cute! I love it! I only take 1 prescription pill, but I do take an assortment of vitamins and supplements. The slots in the primary case are large enough for the larger sized vitamins/supplements. It's geared for 7 days, and there are morning slots and evening ones. Technically, you could use this for 2 weeks if you combined your am/pm pills. The compartments open and close easily. The pill box fits nicely in the carrying case. Did I mention that it's really cute?? It also comes with a smaller pill case too. I've use one like this for overnight or weekend trips. The compartments can hold my large fish oil capsule! I keep my small case filled with one or two of my prescription tablets and then keep it in my purse. Then if I realize that I forgot to take it one day or if I forget to bring it with me when I go out of town, I'm alright. [SEP] The listing has no measurements and if they did, people may think twice. The carry case is 9 1/4"" x 5 1/2"" for starters. And it's a good thing it comes with a case because the tabs on the individual compartments are easy to bump and open. If you are using it for travel be sure to use the case or you could have pills all over by the time you reach your destination. Same problem with the small round extra pill holder. The button is easy to hit if you carry it in your purse or wherever.  The pill container will not be going on travels as I wanted. I may use it as a door stop. The case however is a great size for carrying my Galaxy tab. [SEP] I have to take my medicine throughout the day, so I always have medicine on me.  I love this pill organizer and the case which makes it great for on the go.  The case is adorable and I love the added pop it brings to my accessories.  It is easy to carry and the case closes with no issues. [SEP] Super cute and it opens easily without feeling like I am slowly breaking it each time I open and close. [SEP] This is larger than I expected. Perfect for travel. [SEP] This is WAY bigger than it looks. The little round pill case is like 2 inches in diameter, but the larger weekly organizer is like 10 inches long and 6 inches wide. It doesn't fit nicely in a purse (or anywhere really) so I keep it on my counter. That said, it's sturdy and pretty and the compartments work very well. [SEP] I used to use rubber bands and a zippered storage bag to keep my supplements safe and secure when traveling.  When I saw this travel organizer, I knew it would be perfect!  I actually use the organizer every day [not just when traveling]; but when I need my pills ""on the go,"" I just slip the organizer into the pretty pouch and securely slip it in my bag.  The pill organizer is well made with a lever latching system which makes each compartment simple to open.  The compartments conveniently stay open while you are filling them.  However, since I completely fill these containers, I have found that the little lever can actually crush the pills on top when closing.  Even though this organizer is large and each compartment is generous is width, the compartments are much more shallow than my previous organizer.  It is a challenge to fit all of my supplements into the compartments and close the lid.  If each compartment was just a little deeper, this would have been a five star review!  Although some reviewers have said the pouch looks ""cheap,"" I think it is attractive, functional and durable.  The manufactured PU ""leather"" will keep this pouch looking good for a long time.  I did not think I would have a lot of use for the pretty little matching round three-compartment container.  However, I have decided to keep it filled with several doses of OTC anti-inflammatory pain reliever and keep it in my purse.  It is great to know I always have a little on-hand. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:2b8c1c2319102d75010f71456d961afa]] Super-sized pill organizer and case<br /><br />It’s the perfect take along organizer; has easy to open sections, two for each day of the week.  It is almost 10” long, larger than some small purses. The sections are large enough to hold my pills.<br /><br />I’m using it for out next two-week trip.  I’m able to store two whole days of pills in each section, that’s how it will hold two weeks worth of pills.<br /><br />I love how easy it is to fill; just pop open each day with the little tab. The lid is on a hinge and pops open. Easy to fill one week of daily morning pills and then turn it to the other side for your evening pills. Each day is color coordinated with large easy-to-read lettering.<br /><br />The organizer easily slides into the case. Perfect way to make sure none of the tops open while traveling. It’s so secure, you can feel confident even when throwing it in a backpack.<br /><br />I just LOVE the little travel pill case. It’s about 2” wide and the lid pops open by pressing a small button. Inside, it is divided into three small sections. Perfect to carry aspirin, allergy pills, etc. very handy to grab when you need it.<br /><br />Great set; just understand that it is a super-sized pill case. And the design of the case is beautiful!

[SEP] Great product. [SEP] This smells SO good. I use it for shaving and it’s such a great value. It doesn’t leave a residue like a lot of the lower end baby oils and it’s a pretty large bottle. [SEP] What can you say about baby oil?  It's oily, smells nice and has aloe vera in it.  It's as good, if not better than other brands of baby oils I have used over the years.  I use baby oil mainly in the bath tub on those rare occasions that I have enough time, peace and quiet to take a long soak.

The price of these 4 large bottles is excellent - as of this review a pack of 4, 20 oz bottles only costs $8.92. [SEP] This oil has a mild scent to it. It's what I think of as a classic baby smell. I think it's lovely.<br /><br />I don't really use baby oil for my skin(other than for insect repellant), since I don't care for the oiliness it leaves behind, but I like to have it around.

I am usually tired, but taking this, I am not.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This seems to be working for me.  I am not sure why there is no flavor or color, but it is helping somewhat so I will finish the bottle. [SEP] I can't directly  say how good this  works since  am nursing, I didn’t  realize it's not for recommend  for anyone  nursing or pregnant. But I have been giving it to my  son who is a picky eater and my sister  takes it and she claims it's been helpful  to her stomach. I have also noticed  less constipation in my son.<br />For the benefits this gives the price is good. [SEP] I've been consuming fulvic and humic acids pretty much daily for the past couple of years in a shilajit form, which is dark, sometimes very thick and it never tastes good by itself.  So, when I saw Trace Minerals humic and fulvic acid on my list of items I could review I wanted to try it.  I've purchased several Trace Mineral product before, mainly their concentrated trace mineral drops and have found them to be very good quality.  I think this Trace Mineral Liquid Gut Health is a very good product and delivers some fulvic and humic acids that are so good for health and so rare to find in the basic American diet.  This is not as concentrated as what you get in shilajit, but it's a big bottle, one teaspoon is the daily dose, and it has no flavor.  It tastes like water.  I think this is a very good supplement though I don't know if it will help with gut health or not but is still a healthy supplement. Shilajit can be very expensive (a couple of hundred dollars depending on the quality) but it contains a LOT of trace minerals.  But for a much less expensive substitute I think the Trace Minerals is a good choice. [SEP] My husband is always looking for something to improve gut health.  This seems to be a really good product. Trace minerals are something everyone can use. Especially if they've been sick.  My husband has tried other similar products and he thinks the taste of this one is far superior.  I think we will be repeat buyers! [SEP] I have tried Trace Minerals tablets and they were awful tasting. However, this is a different solution, focusing on soil derived fulvic and humid acids. The result is an almost tasteless solution that delivers traces minerals and electrolytes without the awful taste of their soild sister product. How effective is it? Well, I can’t say that my gut problems are entirely resolved. But I think this stuff is moving me in the right direction. [SEP] I was worried this was going to have a bad flavor, but it is not bad at all.  It’s definitely something that I’d be able to drink every day.  It says if you drink it first thing (on an empty stomach) it has the most benefits.  I have a hard time being consistent with this and I haven’t seen any noticeable improvements, but I’m hopeful that it is helping. [SEP] This unflavored elixir does wonders for my metabolism! It gives my gut a heavy dose of probiotics, prebiotics and fatty acids. Not only has my gut health gotten better, but my fingernails and my hair follicles received a boost of good life. This has prevented me from enduring those sluggish days! [SEP] have a friend that swears by trace minerals and now I see why.  Took as directed, definitely is unflavored so it was easy to drink.  If you're looking for something to help keep you regular and help your digestion, this works great!!!! [SEP] I suffer from ulcerative colitis so I’m drawn to products for gut health. I have never tried humid and fulvic acid so I’m excited to give it a try. The bottle is huge and the dosage for adults is 1 tsp 3 times per day. This should last a while. The liquid is clear and it has no taste or smell. It’s like swallowing room temperature water. Not sure if it’s doing anything yet but it definitely hasn’t hurt anything. It’s so easy to take, I will keep taking it daily and update if I notice I feel better in any way. So far, so good! [SEP] Looking at the size of the bottle, I thought it would last longer than it did, but if you take it as directed it only lasts about two months.<br /><br />I took it with water and on its own and it has no flavor at all. Makes it very easy to take.<br /><br />I honestly didn't notice a difference when taking it. I was hoping it would help with my stomach issues and heartburn, but it didn't help at all.

There are six steamers in this package. Each tablet is the size of a hockey puck but half the size. I elevated this tablet in the shower and let the steam and water droplets hit it. It slowly dissolved and fizzed and leaked an electric pink color all over my tub that (thankfully) washed away with little effort.<br /><br />I have the nose of a bloodhound and I could barely detect any scent. I then decided to dissolve this in the bottom of my shower as if it were a bath bomb. I still barely detected a fragrance. Why anyone would use something like this is beyond me, especially when very little fragrance is present. I already wash my hair and soap up my body with very fragrant shampoo and bath soap, so there is no need for a steamer in my shower.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I spent several minutes dissolving this in the shower after I finished washing and there was still very little scent.  These are not for me. However, I do feel they would be more effective as bath bombs because they fizz and one will be closer to the action to get more of the scent.<br /><br />At the current price of $9.99 for six tablets, this comes to a slightly pricey $1.67 per steamer. [SEP] These are very good smelling and lasted longer than expected. The colors are very bright and each tablet is individual wrapped in plastic. They do list the ingredients and are not all natural but they never claim to be. Check the ingredient list before purchasing if you have any skin sensitivities. They come in a nice box that is a great gift. [SEP] They are easy to use and smell amazing. For those having problems, do not place them right under the water but on the side [SEP] I don't take baths very often enough to use bath bombs on a regular occurrence like my son does, but I do really like using shower steamers. These ones smell great, are super relaxing, and just what I need for a 15-20 minute shower. Will definitely buy more in the future! [SEP] Not having a bathtub in the house these shower steamers are fabulous. Made with essential oils they smell fabulous and before using them I actually just opened the box and had it sitting in the cupboard with the towels because they smell so great. They totally dissolve and even though they have what looks like little bits of paper in them it all dissolves easily and doesn't stain or mark our white shower floor. Love them! The Lavender and Lemon are my favorite - but all the scents are very pleasant and different enough that there should be a favorite for everyone. [SEP] These shower steamers do an okay job, as expected but EYEKESHE has better shower steamers out there. Overall, not a bad product or brand but you'll wish for more because these steams disappear fast while showering.<br /><br />Katiebabs [SEP] This is a review for: EYEKESHE Aromatherapy Shower Steamers Gifts for Women, Unique Gifts Shower Bombs with Pure Essence<br /><br />I was hoping this would really work well but when placed on the shower floor, I could barely smell anything. I ended up placing it on one of my caddy shelves midway up the shower and splashing water on it from time to time to get it bubbling. It does smell nice but it wasn't as strongly scented as I would have liked. I'll try another scent to see if the particular one I tried was a dud. [SEP] These shower steamers are fun and different, adding scent to the shower.  Each one is individually wrapped in clear plastic which is removed when ready to use.  It did take me a bit to get the 'hang' of using one. First I put it on the rim of the shower where I step in but it does not get wet there.  It would melt too quickly if placed simply on the shower floor.  I ended up putting it in my soap dish which has the advantage of being where it's easier to smell.  The scent is natural and not overwhelming.  I've used 1 steamer for 3 showers.  The scent is strongest with the first use.  The streamers are brightly colored and do drip down the side of the shower.  The color is easy to remove and does not stain.  My rating is 4 stars for these steamers add to my showering enjoyment although they are a bit messy as they 'melt.' [SEP] My wife is very happy with these invigorating scents. They aren’t over powering and hasn’t triggered a migraine. [SEP] I just love these steamers.  If you've never tried a shower steamer, you are missing out.  These are so therapeutic and relaxing to inhale while in a hot, steamy shower. They are a nice way to unwind and relax after a long day.  If you have that certain person that's just hard to buy for, these make a very creative and unique gift.  They are lovely to look at and last long enough for a good long steamy shower.",3,True

I thought they were pre-moistened disposable wipes. However, these are DRY wipes that have to be wet. They are very strong and remind me of an everlasting paper towel. The problem is that I use paper towels or wet wipes to clean that are more disposable and can be thrown away after the initial use. I feel bad throwing these away and am not too keen on rinsing out litter pan gravel, lots of dust, and floor debris down the drain in order to reuse these.<br /><br />As can be seen in my photos, I used this to clean up litter pan dust. For this test, I did rinse it out and reused it again. I actually felt guilty throwing away the one wipe I used because it really is not very disposable.<br /><br />Obviously these have a purpose in situations where one wants to use a wipe like a rag that gets reused over and over again. For those purposes, these are perfect. However, I have an aversion to rinsing dust, debris, and grease down the drain and prefer to use paper towels instead. Therefore, I might re-purpose these to wash my dishes instead of using the cloth Handi Wipes.<br /><br />I was thinking these might work in a kennel but who wants to wash the wipe and re-use it after picking up animal waste and stuff. <br /><br />Currently there is no price listed but I suspect these will be costly.<br /><br />UPDATE - I've been using these for six months now and each wipe lasts me two weeks. It will take me forever to use all 300. I use them to clean my sink and wipe down my countertops several times per day. As as a result, I raised my ranking from 3 to 5 stars simply because they last very long. [SEP] These FG Clean Wipes are great for cleaning so many things and have so many other uses, as well. They clean very well without harsh chemicals and without leaving any lint behind. They don't tear apart like paper towels, they are more like thin indestructible fiber cloths.<br />I've kept one in my oil box and have been using it for several days to clean my Essential Oil diffusers. Just washing them with soap and water doesn't get all of the residual oils out, but these cloths do. I'm sure that one cloth will last for quite a while. I'm also keeping one on my nail table to wipe my brushes clean when using poly gels and other liquids. If I get anything on it, I can shake it off in the trash and put it in my LED lamp, so the polish or polygel can cure and I can continue using it as long as possible. I've taped one to the inside of my new LED nail lamp, so that the bottom of it doesn't get dirty with polish or other nail enhancement liquids or gels. I've used a couple of them to do a quick clean of my refrigerator, inside and out.<br />I know I'm missing some things, but they're just so many uses for them. These are wonderful cloths and I absolutely recommend them! [SEP] As of this review I don't know how much these clean wipes costs.  I think they do a good job of cleaning and are about the same size as a full sized Kleenex but much stronger and can be used multiple times.  I think the idea is that they don't shed any fibers which is great for places where tiny fibers can interfere with sensitive equipment - electronics labs and the situations given on the product page. [SEP] These are durable, lint-free wipes. They become very soft when wet. They are great for cleaning and drying glass, computer screens. They are thin, but hold together well. In the home these have limited usefulness, but are great for home or work when lint-free cleaning is valuable. Note, these are definitely NOT biodegradable. [SEP] This is a review for FG Clean Wipes Non-Woven Polyester/Cellulose Cleanroom Wipes for General Cleaning.<br /><br />I found these wipes to be excellent for cleaning my glasses. They are also great for cleaning mirrors or small windows because they have no lint. Any quick shine need they can take care of. When I am having guests, I can shine up the bathroom faucets quickly and easily.<br /><br />Because these are so small, I keep a few in the car and when I realize that I can’t see through my glasses, I can clean them.<br /><br />Each piece is fairly small at 9x9, perfect for a lot of jobs. The wipes are strong and don’t want to tear but you can certainly cut them if you choose to. They are not real absorbent so not the best choice for picking up water, etc.<br /><br />These are definitely an asset to have in the home. [SEP] These 9"" cleanroom wipes serve nicely for spill control and general cleanup tasks. The polyester/cellulose composition provides excellent absorbency for cleaning solutions or solvents, and the wipes maintain good strength whether wet or dry. As with most cleanroom wipes, these are double-bagged at the factory to reduce contamination, but the bags are not as sturdy as those found on other brands I've used.<br /><br />The wipes' non-woven construction allows for moderate stretch on one axis and almost none in the perpendicular direction. The wipes generally produce very minimal lint in use, but their fibers can be loosened on rough surfaces, so you'll want to stick with woven products for the most demanding situations.<br /><br />Where these wipes come up a little short is their performance on optical surfaces. The wipes seem to contain a moderate level of water-soluble residue, which can result in slight haze or streaks being deposited on some surfaces (anti-reflective glass, for example). I have worked with other brands of non-woven poly/cell wipers that exhibited much better purity in this regard.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give these wipes a four-star rating. Their strength and absorbency are ideal for containing spills and for general cleaning, but they're not sufficiently residue-free for wiping optical surfaces. [SEP] These are very good wipes.  They are very unlike kitchen towels which are really multipurpose and can be used at so many different places in the house for cleaning purposes.  The kitchen towels are obviously recyclable paper and absorb water so easily.  These ones also absorb water  but a bit less so, plus if too wet they will leave water or fluid on the surface being cleaned.  Perhaps that true with any type of wipes but these are certainly less water absorbent as compared to kitchen towels.<br /><br />They don't get torn when in use and these can even be used to clean up and mop up the floor.  Obviously floor will need bigger wipes and these are not going to be good enough.  (these are 9x9 inches and 300 count which is actually quite a lot and will last for a very long time)<br /><br />The other good thing about these wipes is that they don't leave any lint or dust behind.  Kitchen towels usually leave some lint on the glass or other surfaces that are being cleaned, especially when use for the 2nd or the 3rd time.  But these are quite good to use and almost dust-free.<br /><br />These wipes are re-usable too.  Did notice that they pick up dirt easily and thereafter that dirt can almost get washed away with water.  Once these are dried again, you can use them again.<br /><br />Now on the flip side, these are made out of polyester and therefore not very environment friendly.  That is probably the only drawback of these wipes.  Not sure if any other recyclable material can be used to make such wipes that don't leave any lint or are tear-free.<br /><br />Overall very decent product. [SEP] at $21.95 they come out to about 7 cents a wipe.  it feels expensive in the beginning, but after Alexa does the math for u, u realize are they each worth 7 pennies a piece... yes they r.  they last... and last.  I used 1 with pledge to clean my glass dinning table (not cleaned in at least a month... dont judge... we dont use it), after I was done the wipe was still looking good so I moved on to my wet bar.  I folded it a bunch of times to keep the side I was using clean.  I then went into the kitchen with a new 1 and did all of my kitchen counter granite.  as kitchen size goes... its smaller, but not that small.  my granite is black and I didnt realize how much yucky stuff was lurking til I used a single wipe.  I then grabbed another and cleaned my entire toilet.  again great results.  ok lets recap... for 21 cents I cleaned my wet bar, dinning room table, kitchen counter, and my toilet... sign me up for another package of 300 please.  I did put the towel down for a few minutes after wiping the table and I will say that it dried rather fast, so if it isn't really dirty I think u could use 1 again... im not sure if u would want to keep a used 1 lying around, but I think u could.  the only thing I didnt love about the product was the packaging.  these 9"" x 9"" cloths are just lying on top of eachother in a super simple plastic wrapper that once it is open... its not cleanroom ready.  anything could get into the package.  I suppose if u were already inside a clean room when u opened them, it would remain clean, but it just feels like they should have added a ziplock edge to one side of the package.  just a side note... I tried to tear 1 with just water on it, and I wasnt able to... I wasnt using all of my strength, but by just pulling it only stretched the wipe out, it did not tear it.  they r pretty heavy duty and lint free when it comes to cleaning.  I hope this was helpful. [SEP] I received one bag of ""FG Clean Wipes"". There are 300 wipes in the bag.<br /><br />I seriously love these wipes. They are really multi-purpose.<br /><br />The wipes are really durable. They don't rip or tear in water or other liquids. They don't have any scent. They also don't leave behind lint.<br /><br />I'm enjoying making my own various kinds of wipes using them. I've made hand sanitizing wipes using Isopropyl Alcohol. Then I store them in a canister (as shown in my photo). I've also made cleaning wipes using original Pine-Sol and water.<br /><br />These wipes are great for scrubbing because they don't fall apart and after they are dirty I just throw them away. So that's  convenient.<br /><br />I could see myself purchasing these wipes again. I would also recommend them.",3,True

The ball is nice but the rest is 100% plastic.

Feels good on anywhere I can reach – legs, thighs, arms – especially the bottom of the feet. That may be my favorite.  Also good on neck – although you just have to watch to not get your hair too caught in the thing.

It’s so good, I bought another one for my bedroom to use while watching tv. If you’re having problems with lymphatic drainage, get this! [SEP] Pairs great with the massage oil.

[SEP] I like the flavor a lot, it's not cloying, familiar yet subtly different. I really thought I wouldn't like something called Rainbow Candy, but I do, and the name fits the taste. I also like that the company tells you to ***ONLY DRINK 1 CAN IN A 24 HR PERIOD***, because it has the caffeine equivalent of 2 cups of coffee, plus other supplements you probably shouldn't overdo. Seems to be a good energy booster, didn't give me any caffeine jitteryness, but whether you'll actually be able to get across the highway to the river and not get eaten by an alligator remains to be seen. [SEP] The flavor of this is great. I’m always on the hunt for caffeinated beverages. This has a sufficient amount of caffeine without going overboard. It’s also a good value.<br /><br />I didn’t like that it has artificial flavors and food coloring. I usually don’t buy products with those ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, it tastes good but if you’re a health nut you’ll want to pass. [SEP] This is not the best-tasting energy drink I've ever had, but it's a great picker-upper with some beneficial ingredients.<br /><br />It is nice that has zero calories and zero sugar, but whatever they are using to sweeten this drink leaves a very bland, bitter taste in my mouth and is very reminiscent of saccharin, if you've ever had that. If not, just imagine something much more bitter than Nutra-Sweet.<br /><br />The drink is supposed to be geared toward esports and gamers, and while it did help me wake up a little bit, I'm not so sure it helped my game or improved my focus as it claims. Still, it's a decent value at this price for six cans, and the benefits outweigh the negatives of the bitter taste. So, I'd still recommend it, especially if you're going to mix it with alcohol or drink it pretty quickly. As for sipping, I'd recommend something else. Four stars.

When I received the drinks, their surface wore a lot in the box, which made them look dirty (Likely the package suffered a lot in the shipping).<br /><br />The color of the drink is red, similar to the watermelon juice. It tastes very sweet, like cheap candy. I am curious how could it be so sweet with zero sugar.<br /><br />I do not have strange feeling (good or bad) after drinking one bottle. I do not feel sleepy, that's for sure. I guess the experience of drinking energy drink can be very different for different persons. [SEP] This energy drink taste great. [SEP] First time I try this brand of energy drink and pretty much everything was good only one issue I had and is my personal opinion and you may have a different one. let go with the good part. comes in a nice black can very colorful and with all the detail of what this contain (nutrition facts )  does give extra boost, I do take it after 1pm because at work after that hour I get sleepy and this help me go though the shift with energy. the only thing I don't like is the sugary flavor. is called rainbow candy and the oversweet kills me and I put some water in it. everything else is great. [SEP] Looking for caffeine even at 175mg this is probably one of the best bang for ur buck and wakes u up and gets u mocing [SEP] The XP Sports Boost Energy Drink tasted great and had didn't leave me feeling like crap when it wore off. With other energy drinks I've tried, they tended to give me a jittery boost of energy and left me afterward tired with an upset stomach. With ingredients such as L-Theanine and other natural extracts, this energy drink seems to do a good job of balancing energy and wellness. I got the rainbow candy flavor, which tasted like all the Skittle flavors combined. With the current price of a six-pack costing $12.99 and an individual cost of around $2.17, they're pretty comparable in cost to other energy drinks you would buy at a gas station or convenience store. Overall I was very impressed with these energy drinks, and I would consider repurchasing these. [SEP] This is the first carbonated drink I've seen with warning labels, and I wondered if I should just drink 2 cups of coffee instead.  However, I received these on the agreement that I would try them out and review.  The taste is odd, and was a bit unpleasant to me.  They certainly made it taste sweet for being sugar free, almost to excess.  My son tried it and thought it was OK.  I don't think either of us felt any energy gain, but we both had mild paranoia wondering about side effects.  I was stunned by how expensive these are (at least at the time of this review).

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't one of those that's so greasy you have to wash your pillowcase. It's creamy. It's just a little thicker than I usually use. It turned out fine, though. It worked great.<br /><br />Amazon's packaging didn't work quite as well as usual. It came through the mail in a padded envelope and the product box was smashed. If you wanted to give it as a gift, that might have been a problem. The jar containing the product (inside the box) came through fine though. It was in perfect condition. I didn't care about the box anyway, so that didn't matter. [SEP] Sumptuous, thick and creamy. Feels amazing. Smells Heavenly. I like to put this on some rough skin on my feet. Works very well to moisture dry skin. Very neat jar, also, thick glass with a plastic lid. I've never seen better skin cream.

The scent is pleasant and I will continue to use it, I will just continue to purchase another brand that I prefer. [SEP] I really love this night cream!  It is very light - way more so than my other night creams - so it feels nice and less goopy, which is great.  It smells nice and leaves my face feeling great.  Highly recommended.

There has not been any visible improvement. I still see all of the big pores, the dark spots, the fine lines. Nothing has improved. I think my olive/coconut oil blend hydrates better.<br /><br />However, it smells very good. It's not overpowering, and does not smell artificial. It spreads well once it warms up to the body, and my skin absorbed it extremely quickly. It does not feel greasy, and it is easily cleaned off by water.<br /><br />It seems to create a very long-lasting barrier, because even after a whole night of sleep, I can still feel it on my face the next morning when I wash my face.<br /><br />But again, I can't give it five stars, because I saw zero improvement in my skin. It's just another moisturizer for me. [SEP] Love this lotion.  Rose smelll is really natural and not too strong.  Immediately my skin feels and looks refreshed, without looking greasy at all.  I'm using it every nigt.

It's nice for someone who just wants light moisturizer. [SEP] Nice scent on this overnight cream think light rose.  Woke up with refreshed, soft skin after using for two nights in a row.

I really was expecting it to taste awful, lol<br /><br />It has some erythritol- 4.5 grams per 1 TBS serving. I missed this when looking at the ingredients because it is not listed in the ingredients. Just in the nutrition panel. I could do without it, but it doesnt overpower at all. I find that when products use non sugar sweeteners they go way overboard with the sweetness. This doesnt impart much sweetness or much of any strong flavor.<br /><br />1 TBS has 110 calories, so be mindful of how much you use. Hence why it is best added TO a smoothie (or whatever else you want).<br /><br />I like all the food based ingredients and I ""feel good"" adding this to my assortment of supplements I add to my daily smoothie. Nice way to boost my nutrition since I have not been consuming as much fresh food as I should (lack of availability, super high prices).<br /><br />I'd get this again 4.5 stars  (5 stars, since I like it more than 4) [SEP] It has a decent blend of vegetables and fruits to give it a very mellow flavor that makes it easier to add into more foods and drinks than others that are sweetened. It arrived quickly, was sealed well and has 43 Tablespoon-sized Servings in the ziplock bag; scoop not included.<br />  The ingredients are USDA Certified Organic and are then 3rd Party Tested for their Purity and Quantity. I think it’s a decent tasting and healthy mix so, I think the only issue I have would be that I like to know all I can about the supplements I take and this one has simply listed all of them in one bulk list, all without any listing of the specific amount of each ingredient. Here’s an example: I take a daily Broccoli supplement but, it this had each items amount listed, I may find that it has enough Broccoli in it to void the need for taking my other supplement. It’s essentially a multiple vitamin and if you’re one to take lots of supplements a day, it’s important to see everything that’s inside. [SEP] So yummy!! Mix it in to anything! It’s sooo good!!!! [SEP] I'm vegetarian and making smoothies is one of the easiest ways to get plenty of nutrients. So I'm always looking for ways to add even more nutrition to them. I work long hours so I do not always feel like cooking healthy meals.<br /><br />This mix is great in my opinion. I add a small scoop to my smoothies and I do not taste any funky flavor like so many similar products have. I honestly noticed no difference in taste from before I started using it and this is a big plus to me.<br /><br />Big fan so far! I feel like I'm eating a lot more veggies. [SEP] I often drink protein smoothies as a meal and like to add a green superfood powder. This one is certified organic, contains 30 different foods (others say organic buy don’t have USDA organic seal on label). There are 43 servings (1 tablespoon size) per bag. Unlike other similar products this comes in coated paper bag instead of a plastic jar or require refrigeration. Mixes easily into smoothies without any grit or strong grassy flavor that other products have. I would highly recommend this product. [SEP] I have a fructose intolerance that prevents me from eating a large amount of fruits and some veggies without extreme discomfort. I have discovered super food type powders as a way to get all the things I have been missing by having to cut so much out of my diet. I have tried many different powders with varied amounts of success. For me sometimes the good ingredients are less important than the unnecessary additives, and I will pick supplements based on what is not in them.<br /><br />FeelGood Organic Superfood Powder has no additives at all. The ingredients are just a list of actual organic foods. No need to go online and look up all of the things that I cannot pronounce. For me that is really important. I can use this powder in whatever I want without adding a bunch of things that I do not want or need to put in my body.<br /><br />I have used this powder in soups, stews, smoothies, blended coffee, casseroles, spaghetti sauce, lasagna, taco meat, and several rice dishes. So far I have not noticed any real difference in flavor, except for the coffee, so I add less to that type of drink. There is a slight, for lack of a better word, earthy(?) flavor. A bit like an all natural wheat grass tea maybe. I personally like the taste but, if it is too strong for you that is easily fixed by adjusting how much you add.<br /><br />I have tried other powders with a bit more nutritional value, but I really like this one. It blends in quickly and does not take over the flavor of what it is added to. It has a long list of amazing ingredients, and is less expensive than most of the others I have tried. My overall opinion of FeelGood Organic Superfood Powder is positive, and it is a product I will continue to use and recommend to others. [SEP] Recently I have been supplementing my water with this Superfood Mix and enjoy both the flavor and benefits.  Looking at the back label of ingredients is eye-catching. All fruits and vegetables that are organic and powdered down to be able to easily add to water to enhance the taste and the power of important foods.  You still need to eat healthy, but this is a nice product to fill in the gaps and assure that each day you are doing something positive.  Actually pretty easy.  Recommend! [SEP] Thanks for reading my review!<br /><br />This is a great idea for those of use who realize we aren't getting the proper nutritional value of vegetables per day. I just wished it tasted better but it is what it is.<br /><br />Of all the ways I've mixed this into my diet, blending it with lemonade seemed to be the best tasting mix. Having said that, there is no after-taste, so gulp it down and move on! [SEP] this is a good, versatile supplement. can use it in soup, smoothies, sauces, anything really! [SEP] My wife likes this in her smoothies.  I wish I could say it makes us feel twenty years younger or such but I cannot.  However, I believe using it is better than not using it.<br /><br />Five stars.",3,True
"NEENCE Hair Trimmer for Men, Hair Clippers for Men Zero Gapped Trimmers Professional Hair Clippers Mens Cordless Rechargeable LED T-Blade Trimmer Men's Clippers Haircut Kits Barber Grey",[],[],,4.3,247,2021,"I like this hair trimmer, it’s professional quality and better than any I’ve used before. My wife does my hair, she said it is very ergonomic and it work wonderfully. It is reasonably priced,  high quality and good value for money.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It’s light and works very well. - this thing still has plenty of power after just one full charge!<br />- Easy to clean. Remarkably so. I’ve owned a few trimmers, and none have opened as well as this one to clean out the hair.<br /><br />Cons:<br />USB cord is short. [SEP] This isn't a bad trimmer for the price. But I wouldn't describe this as ""professional"" by any stretch of the imagination. It's a beard/sideburn/hair trimmer made for the hipster crowd.<br /><br />The trimmer body is a cylinder that isn't very ergonomic in its design -- which a professional would definitely notice. The design is interesting and somewhat artistic in the darkish metal.<br /><br />The entire design of the trimmer is similar to the mercurial style known as ""steampunk"" in people who are familiar with that artistic genre. The metal parts made of dull metal mixed with shiny metal along with the etched artwork of a bearded man circa 1850 give it that touch. It would be a nice gift for that kind of hipster person on your list.<br /><br />It operates okay and has a few different interchangeable blades to adjust the trim length. It recharges via USB cable and has a blue LED display that goes to '99' when fully charged.<br /><br />There are a few things that make this less than a professional trimmer. First, the pin mechanism that moves the lower blade when the motor spins is exposed. This is to give it the intended style, but it also presents a hazard where hair can get caught in the exposed mechanism with a likely possibility of hair getting wound around it and yanked out. This is covered in every professional set of trimmers that I've seen and having it exposed would immediately put it into the category of ""personal"" rather than professional.<br /><br />The handle is made of a somewhat shiny metal, etched with the artwork, but it's a simple cylinder without any attempt to create a more natural fit for a hand -- in other words, not ergonomic for someone who would be holding it for long periods of time.<br /><br />The other thing is that the battery life is decent if you're using it once a day to trim up your Victorian era beard and moustache, but a professional might not like having to recharge it frequently depending on how much it's used. To its credit, though, this trimmer does have a display that will show when the battery is getting low, so that's a plus. It might just be attractive to a hipster barber/stylist.<br /><br />One small nit-pick is that the blade cover is extremely tight-fitting and takes more than a simple flick of the finger to remove. I suppose that will get easier as it's used more, but I have to pry it off using a comb because my fingers aren't hard enough to get it to pop off.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent value for the price, but definitely a novelty for the hipster crowd and not made for professional use. But because it works well enough and would make for a nice gift, it still gets a four-star rating. [SEP] Solid, cool looking trimmer.  Comes with 3 clip on blade/comb adjustments.  Rechargeable Li-On battery, it lasts for 2-3 hours- lit indicator.  single button. Strong cutting.  Trim the sideburns, trim the beard, eyebrows and cut designs in your hair if you want.  Nice gift for the guys. [SEP] I got the NEENCE Hair Clippers for Men for my husband.  He trims his own hair and now does my son's hair as well.<br /><br />The design on they body of the clippers is cool.  We have tried a few different clipper sets and this one looks the most interesting.  They have an old-school/barbershop feel to them.<br /><br />There are different comb lengths to choose from.  Each comb has the measurement imprinted on the comb.  I deducted one star as the last clipper set we got was color coded.  The color coding option makes it a lot easier to remember which combs you prefer.<br /><br />The clippers are easy to set up and use.  We are not sure how long they will last but they seem pretty sturdy.  However, besides the neat design on the main part of the clippers, there is not much to separate these from other sets. [SEP] I have been growing a beard for a few months and replaced my old clipper with this one.  I use it mainly for getting rid of hair that is outside my beard line...neck, around the ears and the upped cheeks.  It works fast and is sharp enough that the hairs are gone after one run across the skin.<br /><br />While it works great, as a side note, it looks cool, too.  I really like it and I would replace with the same brand if I somehow broke it (my last clipper rolled off a shelf and hit tile and broke, so I am capable of doing the same again.  LOL). [SEP] I have been using 0-gapped trimmers on my own head for about 25 years now, and this trimmer cuts closer and nicer than any I have used in that time.  I wasn't expecting much from this device given the design, the price, and the fact that there are so many other trimmers available on Amazon that look almost exactly the same.  However, I was really surprised by the closeness of the cut, the quality of the materials, and just how quiet it is.<br /><br />This trimmer has a nice wide head, which makes trimming a little faster than some of the narrower ones I have used in the past.  It also has some heft to it.  It is not heavy enough to be uncomfortable, but it definitely lets you know it is a well-made trimmer with a metal body.  It only comes with a few combs, but I don't use the combs and they are pretty up-front about that... so I really can't take any stars away for that.  The protective pieces and the included brush are nice, though.  It took me longer than it should have to figure out where the clear protective piece goes.  I probably looked pretty funny.  FYI - it goes under the trimming head and protects the spinning mechanism.  The included user manual is pretty minimal, so don't expect a lot of detailed info from it.  But this is a trimmer... there isn't a lot you need to know.<br /><br />Aside from the sparse user manual, this is a high-quality trimmer and I can't even believe the price for what you get.  Definitely worth it.  I would buy another one when needed, for sure, but I don't anticipate this one giving out for a very long time.  If you are looking for a 0-gapped trimmer and don't need a lot of combs, stop looking... this is the one. [SEP] You get a nice clean trim with these trimmers. Long battery life and one of the best thing i like about these trimmers are the fact they are wireless. [SEP] This product gives you a smooth shave. I enjoy it’s easy able to charge using it’s charging port and our Internet collectible attachments that come with it the box itself can be used as a storage Jean area or a storage if you don’t already have a bag for your type of shaver great gift & great buy. [SEP] My husband was tired of sharing his trimmer with the boys, so we decided it was time for them to have there own upstairs. We already have this one and love it so we decided to just get another one. This is a zero gapped trimmer that has 3 different lengths to choose from 1,2 or 3 mm. It charges using usb. Fully charged it will last for 180 minutes. It's small for travel and has a really cool design on it, that the boys love. It works great and we have had no problems with it. Great price for a long lasting trimmer. [SEP] This item is the Resuxi - JM-700AL. Resuxi is a great if not the greatest brand in hair clippers so it's a solid unit. But it's version 2 of hair clippers and they have a better version 3 out there with better LCD/water resistance.<br /><br />This is an improvement to some of the earlier designs. The main improvement is the LCD. The previous implementation was just a dot that was red/blue /green or not depending on the power. This one shows you % battery left as is seen on most $30+ clippers.<br /><br />Pros<br />=t blade design allowing for 0mm cuts<br />=USB charging to power it up. USB charging allows you to charge via solar power, power stations, power banks, car chargers, laptops, etc.<br />=comes with a brush. I don't know how many sets come with a brush<br />=1500 mAH battery is really good. Typically you see 600 or 900 mAh on these. That allows for a crazy amount of time usage as high as 5 hours. On other ones, you'd see 60 mins or 2 hours.<br />=includes oil which most sets do not include.<br />=comes in a nicer, more giftable box. You feel epic when you receive it.<br />=come with this plastic cover around the base of the blade that the older sets don't include<br /><br />Cons<br />=no water resistance. Version 3 has IPX4<br />=Version 3 of these clippers has a better LCD panel<br />=The power cord is specific to this set and if you lose one, it's hard to replace<br />=no power block to recharge with<br />=this version doesn't have USB-c charging",3,True

The instructions say to take with a meal, so I have been taking them with my lunch. The smell is a bit unpleasant at first, but you get used to it after a few days. Haven’t noticed any changes yet, but I am sure that will come within time. You can’t go wrong with the price compared to other probiotics!! [SEP] I have been taking this religiously for more than a week and so far I have noticed that is may be the reason for my regularity being more reliable. I can’t speak towards the aiding with any weight loss as yet nor do I know what this products targeted time frame is. For the price, it truly does bring value towards aiding with my digestive system. I would consider it an added bonus if I can shed a pound or two as well. It has not caused me any new discomforts due to use so that is always a good thing. No side effects for me! As with all things, everyone’s body make up is different so just because it works for some doesn’t always guarantee the same results for all. [SEP] Daily dose of probiotics that is the good bacteria that your body needs. Easy to swallow and has no noticeable taste.  Completely vegetarian and loaded with lactobacillus and bifidobacterium probiotic bacteria, this digestive formula will balance intestinal flora and improve health and well being. [SEP] Makes a difference [SEP] I use probiotics to keep my digestive system working and I've tried several different brands. What I like about this brand is that they are capsules that aren't too big to swallow. I also like that they are shelf stable so I can keep them by my toothpaste instead of in the refrigerator. The price is also reasonable.<br /><br />The drawback to these is that the concentration isn't as high as some of the other brands I've used and I can tell the difference in how fast it works on my bowels. I prefer the higher concentrations even if I have to pay a little more. [SEP] If you’re a person who doesn’t have regular bowel movements, or looking to add some much needed good bacteria to your regular digestion process, then this is the probiotic you need! I promise you after a day of taking these your irregularity will be regular! I love these! I use to go to the bathroom not even once a day, now after taking these I go everyday and I just feel better overall. Give them a try, I’m telling you, you’ll feel better instantly! [SEP] Didn’t lose any weight. I guess probiotics are ok - studies seem conflicting. Thought I’d give it a try. No unwanted side effects yet no benefits. Reasonably priced though if you believe in it or want to try. [SEP] My Dr. had suggested I try some probiotics so I gave these a shot. These were not the probiotics for me i guess. They had an almost opposite effect on my digestive tract. I know that supplements take time to work and work  differently on different people but had to stop taking these after two weeks. It's been a full week since I stopped taking them and am getting back to normal. [SEP] My doctor has been recommending getting on a Probiotic, but I was not sure where to start with the right one for me.  I thought these were gummies, but they are not.  They are a one pill a day capsule.  I have only taken it for 2 days, so we will see.  Seems to be priced nicely compared to some others I checked out. [SEP] The description makes it sound like they might be gummies, but they're not. They're reasonably sized capsules. These are a great value, as you only need one per day. Finding a quality probiotic for around $7 a month is unheard of. And these definitely are quality probiotics. I can tell they are helping my digestion. I suffer a lot of bloating and loose stools (sorry for TMI), and these have noticeably helped both of those things in just 4 days. I have only taken one other probiotic that helps me as much, and sadly those have been discontinued. Well, not ""sadly"" anymore, because now I've found these, and at a far cheaper price.

"Mushroom Supplement with Lions Mane, Reishi, Chaga, Maitake - Daily Immune Support and Nootropic Brain Support Formula - Made in USA - Natural Energy and Focus - 60 Capsules",[],[],,4.2,57,2148,"The mushrooms used in this blend offer a lot of health benefits but I selected it for review mainly for the Chaga mushroom content.  Chaga mushroom chunks and powder is very expensive but it has an absolutely amazing anti-viral capacity.  It's very potent and mixed with these other excellent mushroom powders makes a very good supplement. [SEP] I heard so many great things about adding mushroom supplements to a daily vitamin routine so I gave it a go this brand has been working well and I can tell I'm more focused at work. [SEP] This is a good mushroom blend that contains extracts of the fruiting body of various medicinal mushrooms. Lion's mane in particular may have nootropic benefits, and I have taken it at various times for that benefit.<br /><br />That the company claims to third-party test is good because a lot of mushroom supplements don't contain a lot of the fruiting body and therefore are pretty worthless.<br /><br />Finding information about this company was challenging since apparently ""Nature's Nutrition"" is the name of multiple companies. Their website is pretty boilerplate without going into many details about them, or how they test. [SEP] In general, I liked the components of this mushroom supplement. One mushroom is missing, in my opinion. I would have been happier if they included Coryceps mushroom powder in their mix. However, the mix of mushrooms in this supplement is impressive.<br />Also impressive, they note that much of the ingredients of the blend are extracts, so theoretically more potent than just mushroom powder.<br />Overall, an excellent assortment of mushroom powders (in extract form) in a capsule.<br />High recommendation. [SEP] I found this to be a palatable mushroom supplement; there was little taste or smell and no unpleasant side effects from this.<br />Honestly, I’m not sure what benefits I have or haven’t seen. Times are crazy for everyone and I know I’ve been dealing with a lot as well as working on adjusting my supplement routine! I do believe that I may experience a subtle but appreciated mental energy when taking this supplement. Nothing overwhelming or unsettling, just a nice efficiency to my mental and even emotional processes that had been a bit lacking. Not the sort of thing you’ll get from caffeine or standard “stimulants”. I [SEP] Great product, recommended. [SEP] Fast shipping. Too early to tell if it has any effects. [SEP] I got this for my husband, and he is excited to try it. he believes that Lion Mane and Reishi are very beneficial to us. He had been using a different brand, but since this one is more affordable, we want to give it a try. [SEP] The supplement itself is as described, and very helpful. I am very confused however, as to why in the world you would make the label covering the pill bottle that nasty dry sticky texture, like one of those glossy photos that makes people squeemish when they scratch it with their nails. Holding the bottle feels very strange and and I never thought I would have an issue with something like that. Makes my hand dry and it's just weird. Would be really nice if you could just use plastic like every other pill bottle in the entire world does. [SEP] I read how good mushrooms are for your brain. I decided to give these a try.  I have to admit to feeling a little “sharper” since taking them.  Is it the supplements or just a placebo effect? Who knows but I’ll keep taking them as long as I feel better.",3,True

In dim light I need stronger magnification, but for most uses, these are fine.  They are attractive and each pair has a carrying case, but the cases are a little tight.  I like this product because I like to stash reading glasses around the house, and these are reasonably enough priced that I can afford several pair.  All in all, highly recommended. [SEP] I love these reading glasses. They are really comfortable and crystal clear. I wasn’t sure if I’d like the metal side or not, but they haven’t been a problem at all. [SEP] One thing is certain, these are well made cheater glasses but not for me.  The frames, which are very nice and stylish, are too small for my head (6'4"" male).  They look super cute on my partner though, although she needs a slightly higher magnification than the 1.5 I use.<br /><br />I did notice that these seem to have a much closer depth of field for me.  Most Cheaters let me sit back from my monitor screens and be able to see out about 4 feet, these seem to be under 2.  Once things are within 20 inches or so, they are amazingly sharp and clear, but not until it gets that close.<br /><br />The price is great, 3 for $15 is about as good as it gets, and these are very well made for that price point.  I am actually fairly new to cheaters but finding that I definitely need them from time to time, so I am keeping these are emergency backups in the office, car, and home.  Can't beat the price, and I actually used them for some clay work I was doing because of their razor sharpness. [SEP] These glasses come in a nice, organized presentation with a case for each one. The frames are much better than you usually see in cheaters. They have solid screws and seem fairly sturdy. Of course, only time will tell if they live up to the first impressions. I love the colors in the set - blue, red and brown. I actually like the blue ones enough that I'm going have the lenses replaced with tinted sun glass lenses. [SEP] This is a great 3-pack of reading glasses.  I love that they come protective fabric cases (a neoprene-type material), as these are much more compact for storage/travel than bulky hard cases.  I also love that the frames are full-sized, so they work well for activities such as using a computer screen--I am wearing a pair for this purpose right now!  The frames are also thin and lightweight, but they are attractive in a simple way.  They set includes three different translucent frame colors.  All-in-all I am very happy with these and definitely would recommend! [SEP] I don't know why the description says there's four - I received a three-pack of reading glasses with a prescription of +1.50 in the colors of blue, red, and brown. All of them are in the wayfarer style with half of the stems being a see-through plastic, which is a cool stylistic touch. Each pair of glasses comes with a matching foam case which makes it easy to identify which is which. The lenses are on the thin side but so far they seem durable. I like the fact that there are three so that if I lose one I can use the other two as backups. [SEP] These are great glasses to stash around the house because almost everyone can wear them, and 1.50 can help almost everyone but are not too strong. It's fun to have three different color frames, in color-coordinated snug fitting protective cases. The frames are lightweight and comfortable. I don't expect them to survive being sat upon, for instance; the plastic feels like it would snap. But they seem like they are durable. I find that they are best for reading a book, or a computer, where you are not moving your head very much, because the focal point is fairly specific. Once you turn your head a little bit, the focal point changes. More expensive glasses don't seem to do this. All in all, they are great for an emergency or -- for instance -- in the bathroom in case you need to read some fine print on a medication bottle, etc. [SEP] These work and I like them a lot.  They're pretty weak strength, but my eyes are still strong except if tired, low light or really small print, and then, these are perfect for me.  I have good eyesight but age tries to tell me otherwise.  I try to rest my eyes frequently from all the screen work that has taken over all  of our lives.  I do eye exercises especially for convergence.  I eat well, exercise, no smoke and take some supplements including fish oil.  Take care of your car, it last; take care of your body, it last.  God willing! [SEP] NOTE:<br />Description title says: EFE Reading Glasses for Men and Women, 4 Pack Fashion Wayfarer Style Thin Eyewear with case +1.5<br />Picture shows:  THREE Pairs<br />You get THREE pairs NOT four!<br /><br />Now that I got that bit out of the way (the seller will likely change that at some point making the first part of my review moot), this is a decent trio of reading glasses.  They come in trim little soft cases that match the colors of the glasses rims.  Blue, red, & brown.  I keep a pair in my purse, one at my desk, and one on my reading table.<br /><br />For those who care, these are made in... you guessed it, China!<br /><br />Overall, I am really happy with these. [SEP] These are lightweight but durable, no noticeable distortion in the lenses. The foam cases are very nice, much more sturdy and protective than the usual thin bags that are provided with reading glasses. I like that they're colored to match the frames, so I can tell which pair is in the case from a quick glance.<br /><br />They fit fine; I guess I have a normal sized head.

I believe in creating detailed, complete reviews because, like you, I depend on them when I am shopping.  If you found my review HELPFUL - please click ⬇️ below!⭐️ [SEP] This product has a lot of B vitamins and caffeine that will surely keep you awake. If you have one of those days where you really need to be awake at night, this most definitely will be beneficial. And after taking, if you feel a heated flush on your face, that is from the niacinamide and is a normal side effect and goes away in minutes. [SEP] I would equate the energy boost of this product to that of a strong cold brew coffee.... There is a noticeable increase in “pep” upon taking, but - unfortunately for me- the increased energy was also accompanied by a pretty strong headache. As someone that suffers from migraines, I will likely avoid this product in the future. [SEP] I have tried two products by this brand - the other being a supplement that time releases energy ingredients around the time you should be waking up. I loved the idea there, but wasn't sure if I could totally correlate the effect - but I think it worked.<br /><br />I know that the Stay Up booster works - and works very well. It has given me a nice, subtle sustained energy that lasts several hours. My problem with most energy supplements is that they don't work at all or they work too quickly and crash and burn soon thereafter. This is a very nice median. I find it even more effective when I take two capsules instead of one. I can't recommend this since the directions imply differently.<br /><br />Great supplement for sure with a variety of great ingredients to help get through the day. [SEP] I needed something to keep me awake, focused and working hard, so I was excited to try this. I could see people getting confused about why the product is listed as ""Top Rated Ginseng"" because Ginseng isn't listed as an ingredient. But it does has Eleuthero root in it, which is Siberian Ginseng.<br /><br />While Ginseng is great, I think the most potent ingredient in this is B-12, and this has 1000 mcg in it. If you're sensitive to B-12, like I am, this will keep up up and burning the midnight oil. I would only suggest taking this if you plan to be awake for the next 12 hours. The first time I tried this, I tried to lay down for a nap after 6 hours, but my pulse was pumping and my mind was racing. In other words, this energy booster WILL keep you awake.<br /><br />I actually prefer taking ginseng without all the other stuff in it, but I would still recommend this. [SEP] I tried this for the first time yesterday... I have been pushing myself to the limit this past week. Non-stop work events, my kids going back to school, newborn babies, and my best friend is getting married in a few weeks... needless to say, I am exhausted. Yesterday, as I was running to help donate school supplies to low income kids, I thought I was going to pass out from exhaustion- my body ached, I could not stop yawning, and I had a small headache. 32 oz of water and this helped push me until the event ended, helped me pushed into my own kid's orientation, and into the night to help make favors until midnight. [SEP] Seems to be a good product.  I got a nice energy boost from it without any the usual jittery feeling that you get from consuming a lot of caffeine. [SEP] So I had to giggle about the name at first.  The tablet is quite easy to swallow. It does help with staying awake and focusing as I complete my finals this week. It doesn't give me shakes or stomach aches as some products do.  Nice balance. [SEP] This stay awake supplement is like No-Doze for the new millennium. Instead of just giving you a boost of caffeine (which you could get from drinking a cup of coffee), this product also adds some B vitamins to help prevent loss of the water soluble vitamins from the caffeine (caffeine can dehydrate you). Since there is such a large percentage of Vitamin B-12 in this product, I am not sure I would use it every day. I, personally, do not believe it is healthy to regularly take mega doses of vitamins (whether or not they are water soluble). The best recommendation I can give is that you should consult the medical practitioner of your choice before adding this supplement or any other to your daily regimen. I do like that this product uses Guarana seed extract, as I have used supplements with that ingredient in the past and I found that it will give you some pep and energy without the big crash, afterwards. I do like this product and recommend it with the reservations I have previously stated. [SEP] Tried with and again without food sick to stomach. Not for me",3,True
"POHAKU Dual Channel TENS Unit with 24 Modes, TENS Unit Muscle Stimulator for Pain Relief Therapy, Rechargeable TENS Machine EMS Unit Muscle Stimulator Electric Pulse Massager 12 Pads, Storage Bag",[],[],,4.5,318,877,"I had an expensive TENS unit the Dr prescribed via a medical supply company for years. I wasn't sure how well this would measure up after that one finally gave up after years and years of use but this one is AMAZING and even better!! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:fae867a93a2d423f97686f16afc25128]] This tense device comes with everything you need, including pads and a carrying case. I like that there are so many settings on it, there are three main modes and 8 different types within each mode.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it is almost too strong for me, but I'm a bit of a wuss. My husband loves how powerful this tens device is. [SEP] I've used a few tens units in the past and can state that this might be the most powerful one I've used though this power comes at the cost a shorter battery life. It worked for about 30 minutes out of the box though and when fully charged I got a few hours.<br /><br />This tens unit charges fairly quickly and provides muscle tension/pain relief so I definitely recommend this device.<br /><br />Just a reminder though that there are warnings online to not place the pads near your heart so I'd advise not using it on your torso or spinal cord. [SEP] Nice handheld tens unit. It came with 12 sticky pads to affix to the affected area. Everything connects easily. I didn’t have to use directions. It’s nice for arthritis and sciatica but does warn you where not to put it. It comes with an outlet plug attached to usb cord. Everything you need is there. Nice to not have to head to the chiropractor every time you need this! [SEP] I've used all of the settings and they are all pretty intense. When moving up to level two on any setting, it's just too much. I'd like to have a series of settings that are so light that I can't feel them, and would like to be able to increase in small steps to achieve the pain relief or relaxation I want. I'm not sure what to expect from this brand but it just seems too intense.<br /><br />The packaging is nice, full instructions are provided, and the pads, electrical connections, usb cable and charging function all work and are in very nice looking condition. The device works in all ways except for the fact that it is really a strong electrical delivery through the pads on the first level and too strong, uncomfortable when increased arrow up so two bars show on A or B.<br /><br />In ordering this product, I was looking for a competitive product for pain relief and muscle relaxation.  I have another tens unit that is different, with a  more subtle and useful levels of intensity, but it seemed to have fewer settings to chose from and less explanation of the uses of the settings than this unit.  I do have a point of reference. I am also trying to get a less expensive, functional unit other than the 4000 dollar trustim, that I can't afford and will not buy because it's too expensive but I know two people who say they like it and it works but it's too expensive.  I just can't imagine that the price makes any sense for that device, aside from a marketing plan.  I was hoping that this tens unit would offer a benefit for a good price. It's possible that this unit is just standard and is too strong or perhaps this particular product is just too strong or stronger than it should be.  3 stars. I would use this device with caution, due the intensity. [SEP] Not really sure how much pain is relieved by this device.  The signals it sends to the pain area are strong but my pain persisted despite the use of the device, maybe helped a bit [SEP] Me and my daughters use this all all of the time.  It was a little weird to learn to use at first and figure out the modes.  Works well! [SEP] It works great and is USB rechargeable, too.  Two channels.  Love it. [SEP] This is my first tens device and I'm pleasantly delighted.  It's  very a nice compact easy-to-use machine that is very effective.  I would recommend 👌. [SEP] This is a good product. I have owned other tens units and they do not compare.",3,True

Mountain Falls Ultra Sunscreen Lotion's non-greasy formula protects your skin from harmful UVA / UVB rays and prevents sunburn.""]",,4.1,23,79,"The Mountain Falls Ultra Sunscreen is a very affordable alternative to the big name brand sunscreens. The first thing I noticed about this sunscreen, is that the scent is pretty mild. It does have the typical smell that goes along with products containing sunscreen, but it's not very strong at all. In fact, it's barely noticeable when you first open the lid of it. It absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and doesn't leave any greasiness behind. It seems to do a good job of protecting, as long as you remember to reapply it regularly.  Every year, I cringe at the prices of sunscreen out there. This is a non-cringe worthy, comparable product. [SEP] We really like this mountain falls 30 Spf sun screen.<br />Made in USA.<br />Love the scent. Its fresh and clean. Seems to go in the skin, is not greasy. and  My skin does not feel dry after using this,<br />as other SPF have left my skin feeling.<br />Apply 15 mins before going out in the sun.<br />If swimming,  reapply after 80 mins.<br /><br />We live on a river in California, and its hot and sunny here. I live on a river.<br />I put this on 3 children .One is a red head, blue eyes, One child has platinum blonde hair, and fair.<br />The children had on  tee shirts ,but using this they did not<br />Get Sunburned around the neck or arms being in the river. A bit red yes, but Not sunburned.<br /><br />You can get sunburned through the window while driving.<br />I put sunscreen on my hands for years, and have very little brown spots on my hands for my age. [SEP] Although I haven't used Coppertone for years, this certainly is the smell that I remember from way back when. Those days before an SPF was listed on the bottle, the days when there were billboards with the little girl with the tan line as the dog tugged on her bathing suit bottom.<br />For Nostalgia alone, I would like this product. The fact that it feels much better going on than I remember the old ones to be, is a big plus.<br />It has an SPF of 30, and since I usually use it around a pool, the fact that it's water resistant is also very nice.<br />Just remember to put it on as the label suggests, applying at 15 minutes before sun exposure, and reapplying after swimming or at least every 2 hours. [SEP] I put this sunscreen on yesterday and liked it.  Features to appreciate about it:<br /><br />* non-greasy<br /><br />* squeezes easily - container is easy to use<br /><br />* applies smoothly - I put it on my arms as I was driving and sun comes in window and makes sun spots on my arm<br /><br />* has pleasant scent - scent reminds me of other popular skin products for tanning but with a fresh note<br /><br />* comes out whitish in color<br /><br />* like the 30 SPF<br /><br />* feels good on<br /><br />* like the size and shape of container - easy to pack and grab<br /><br />So far am happy with this product.  Will report back as I continue to use it if I have additional comments. [SEP] Very effective sunscreen lotion that protects your skin from harmful UVA / UVB rays and saves you from being sunburned. I love that it is non-greasy and water prooof for about 80 minutes which is plenty of time. Also, it is enriched with Vitamin E to hydrate your skin. [SEP] This sunscreen was pretty thick and took a bit extra to rub it in all the way, but it worked great for our vacation in Hawaii with no sunburns to be found. Despite being thick to rub in, afterwards, it didn't have that sticky sunscreen coating that some other sunscreens have. [SEP] I think this is a great option for sunscreen - it goes on easily without being really greasy the way that some sunscreens are, although it does have that really strong sunscreen smell. Personally, I think SPF 30 is a great option, because it provides decent protection and still lets you get a little sun. [SEP] Excellent lotion! Mountain Falls sunscreen SPF 30 kept me from burning all day long when I wore it last week on my beach vacation. It is non-greasy and blends so well into the skin without any white residue. It is moisturizing and stays on the skin during dips into the ocean and pool. I recommend it, and I will buy it again! It was a pleasant surprise to find such a high quality sunscreen at this price point! [SEP] great price [SEP] This sunscreen seems to work very well. I tend to burn rather easily and so I use sunscreen often. I have never burned while using this product. It goes on easily, is well absorbed and lasts while in the water. I have taken my grandkids swimming several times and have used this sunscreen on all of us and the kids haven't had a sunburn, either. I have reapplied it after about an hour to an hour and a half.<br /><br />At $5 for a good size bottle is an excellent price. I will be ordering this again when I run out of this bottle.",3,True
"Stainless Steel Scouring Pad Set, 4 Stainless Steel Scourers with 4 Cleaning Sponges, for Dish Washing, Kitchen Cleaning, Cooking Utensil, Cookers, Tableware, Kitchenware, Household Ware (8 Packs)",[],[],,4.1,60,286,"The sponges are what you would expect to buy at a dollar store. The steel wool should hold up for many months - the sponges I expect will last a month. [SEP] These sponges and steel wool aren't any better quality than a brand you'd be able to find in store for a fraction of the price. Steel wool isn't bad, but the sponges definitely won't last long. They're the very light and soft type of sponges that fall apart easily if you do a lot of hand washing. [SEP] This product is pretty disposable. I will work for some cleaning, but not for very long. It is pretty equivalent to a sponge from the dollar store. [SEP] Th scouring pads are basically the same pads I usually buy. I use them till they fall apart which takes about couple of months, and I wash dishes very often. New, these seem fine. Scrub well, leave dishes and surfaces clean. It works for me. [SEP] The stainless steel scouring pads are OK but the yellow and green sponges are the same kind of cheap sponges you'd find in a dollar store - good for light cleaning but liable to fall apart after long usage -they definitely don't have the quality of Scotch 3M sponges, which I prefer. It's convenient, however, to have both these items sold as one set as I normally use both when I'm cleaning pots and pans - the softer one reserved for lighter, easier to remove stains and the more abrasive steel pads for hardened grease or difficult to remove encrusted food remnants.  So both have their use, it's just that one part of the set seems better made and more durable than the other. [SEP] These scrubbers are great for all your dish washing needs.  The sponge scrubber combo is perfect for most hand washed dishes.  Really gets the baked on food loosened and removed.  The sponge side works great for more delicate jobs.  If you have really baked on stubborn dishes the steel scrubber makes quick easy work of the mess.  So far these have held up really well. [SEP] This set includes 4 sponges and 4 stainless steel scrubbers.  The sponges have a scratchless, scrubbing side that work well, but the sponge fell apart after 4 uses  :-( .  The stainless steel scrubbers also work well, I just hope they don't rust.  The rust is why I stopped using these type of scrubbers, it was ecky, so they were limited to one time use.<br />If you can't get out to the store due to Co-Vid 19, these are ok, and the price is reasonable $7.99.  This is the type of cleaning products you find at $1 outlets (one of my favorite haunts), [SEP] The stainless steel scrubbies are good. The sponges are absolute rubbish. They start disintegrating partway through the first batch of dishes you use them on. While the convenience of a set with both scrubbies and sponges would be nice if both worked, the aggravation of cheap sponges falling apart is worse than having no sponge at all. [SEP] Okay sponges and scouring pads for your pots and pans, and whatever else you need. They do the job, but doesn't have a wow factor behind it.<br /><br />Katiebabs [SEP] I really like the steel wool in this set.  It makes cleaning my cast iron super quick and easy.  No soaking is required.<br /><br />Foam sponges are pretty bad, not durable at all.  The green part started to fall apart after a week.  Like the steel wool though.",3,True

[SEP] I received this product in exchange for my honest review as part of the Amazon Vine Program. Seller the X Gold Health Store lists this as ""Vitamin D3 + K Complex Supplement: Vitamin D3 5000 IU with Vitamin K2 MK7, MK4 and K1- Premium Vitamin D with 3 Types of Vitamin K Formula to Support Heart, Immune, and Bone Health - 60 Vegan Capsules"". I believe in good quality nutritional supplements, especially Vitamin D3 which is proven so important for bone health and other body health as I age. This is a MADE IN USA product which I insist upon for purity and quality. These are a good value and though the capsules are big, they wash down ok.<br /><br />I recommend never beginning any supplement without first checking with your medical provider, especially as these incorporate Vitamin K Complex which affects blood clotting and other things. I make no claims of efficacy of health usefulness but do insist everyone check with their medical provider before beginning ANY new medication or supplement due to the risks associated with combining one's own meds with any new med/supplement. Health problems are legion! Be wise, CHECK FIRST!<br /><br />I Recommend these X Gold Health Vitamin D3 + K Complex Supplement 60 capsules as a good value supplement, MADE IN USA. [SEP] This is a good formula that combines Vitamin D3 with multiple forms of Vitamin K.<br /><br />Typically, Vitamin D and K2 are paired together, since both are important for bone health and calcium regulation in the body (to make sure calcium ends up in the bones and not inside your arteries).<br /><br />However, this formula also contains K1, which helps with blood clotting. So, if you are on blood thinners, K1 might impact this. Nonetheless, K1 is still an essential nutrient and is present in green, leafy vegetables, so the amount here will not impact those who aren't on blood thinners as a life-saving necessity.<br /><br />Be sure to take this pill with some type of fat or with a meal since both vitamins are fat-soluble. Also, this formula contains black pepper extract, which may increase the absorption of both vitamins. Be aware that black pepper extract can interact with certain drugs. [SEP] I love this Vit D and K [SEP] These capsules are neutral in smell - do not smell like anything at all.  Great.  The taste is very neutral as well - really Great!  They were also very easy to swallow.  The package is marked ""Vegan Friendly"" - I like that but am not sure why they do not just mark them Vegan then...<br /><br />My big problem with this product is the VERY wasteful packaging.  The bottle is easily 3/4's empty. : (  I am not sure why it is such a ginormous bottle - what an absolute waste of plastic. : (  Really bad in that regard.  They should loose 2 stars for the extreme waste of plastic...  If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.  Thanks! : ) [SEP] The X Gold Health D3 and Vitamin K supplement capsules are easy to swallow and contain a potent list of appropriate ingredients.  Vitamin D3 is especially good to take during the winter months as exposure to the natural vitamin D of the sun is significantly limited.  Vitamin K is important to me as it maximizes the body's ability to utilize the calcium in the bloodstream to strengthen and fortify teeth and bones.  The Piperine (black pepper) is an important part of these capsule's formula as it enhances the bio-availability of the D3 and Vitamin K.  So, if immune support, heart and bone health are priorities for you then the X Gold Health is a fine product to choose. [SEP] My doctor recommended that I regularly take vitamin D3 and K complex because I was currently experiencing pain in my back and arms. Since I have been taking this supplement I feel much better even in my mood after all nobody likes to feel pain, I really liked this vitamin D3 + K Complex everything I need in a single bottle, and besides noticing the good quality and good price. In short, now I have stronger bones, a better mood, and more disposition for my beautiful days with my family. I will continue taking my health and one of the most precious things I have. Thank you [SEP] This is a high dosage vitamin D capsule, with vitamin K included to help in the calcium absorption process.  As someone who has had low vitamin D in the past, I started taking supplements a couple of years ago - especially in the winter months when I spend far less time outside in the sun.  The product is vegan, plant-based, and contains Vitamin K which works hand-in-hand with the vitamin D to improve efficacy.  The capsules are pretty standard sized capsules with no smell, taste, or after taste.  Additionally, I have not had any gastric distress either.  If you have no problems taking typical sized capsules you should have no problem with these.  There is a 60 day supply included (1 capsule/day).  The container is a bit large for 60 so it looks kind of empty once you remove the protective cover (not sure why they have such an oversized container unless they have a standard size but offer larger quantities?).  In any case it seems to be a little wasteful as far as plastic usage goes, but it doesn’t affect the product itself.  Check with your doctor before taking Vitamin K products - especially if you have clotting issues, or are on a blood thinner of some kind.  Overall a pretty good product at a reasonable price, especially if you want to add vitamin K to your regimen in addition to the vitamin D. [SEP] My latest lab work showed I am deficient in Vitamin D, even though I was supplementing AND getting plenty of sunshine.  This capsule contains just what I want: vitamin D and Vitamin K complex (Vitamin K2 MK7, MK4 and K1) for good absorption.  I just repurchased and will get new labs done next month, and report back if my vitamin D levels improved. [SEP] I know from my Dr. that I need to be on a D supplement. K2, your body may need to help with the D.  Together, D, and K work as a team.  Giving with what's going on in the world and knowing I need additional D, Taking one of these supplements is a no brainer.  However, I'm unsure of the K1 and may switch supplements to one without when these are gone.<br />With supplements, you should have an idea of what you're taking along with your physician's input.<br /><br />These Pills are easy to swallow and have no smell or after taste.",3,True

Reading mixed reviews about effectiveness and durability, I bought the cheapest one ($29.99) with the highest rating. I’ve only used it a few times so I can’t comment on durability. But, the first time I dry shaved. I didn’t want to test the “waterproof” claim but it worked well. The next time I jumped in the shower with it using plain water. It cut a bit closer. Tonight I thought I’d try it in the shower with my beard shaving soap and see if it got gooped up and didn’t work well. It worked fabulously. After a few laps around my head I’d simply hold it up to he shower head to blast it clean.

[SEP] I'm not sure if these were supposed to be that small but it's as if they were supposed to be for a child's shoe. They are way too small for my foot so I couldn't even test them out! They seem like they would be a bit too thick inside of your shoe too. [SEP] Too thick to be used with pumps [SEP] These are ultra tiny shoe inserts.  I wear a size 9 (to 9 & 1/2) and these Stop before reaching the base of my big toe.  They are not wide enough for my shoes.  These are probably designed for, at most, a US women's size 6 shoe.<br /><br />The gel itself is nice and comfortable but sadly not usable by anyone in my family unless cutting down to fit into children's shoes. [SEP] I love these inserts!! They are easy to transfer to different pairs of shoes.  There is a small ""bump"" on the arch part of the insert and I love the way it feels after wearing shoes for a few hours.  Plus I didn't have to adjust the inserts, just put in my shoes. [SEP] These are comfy not amazing but they'll provide better relief than nothing. I feel like they're a lot slimmer than other inserts I've seen and also on the thin side. [SEP] These gel anti-slip inserts are good quality.  They provide comfort.  I highly recommend these.  They are perfect. [SEP] Product was excellent.",3,True

There are just so many places to put a bucket or roll of these wipes/towels, wet or dry.<br />These are not the thickest, but if you need a paper towel/wipe, you'll be glad you have them in reach. They are pretty expensive, so I only get them if they are on a good sale, but I would definitely recommend them! [SEP] These are your basic paper towels that you would find in most places. There are a lot of paper towels in one roll. They help dry hands well but if you are wiping up big spills you will need to use a good amount of paper towels to clean up the spill. The center pull is nice with or without a dispenser. You don't have to worry about the roll unraveling. If you have a business these paper towels are a good pick up.

This ball has a vibrating  press button that is removable it uses a battery (it doesn't  come with one) thou my baby is not fond of the vibration so I took it out. We have been using it and he has been doing excellent  at bedtime, I like it.<br />I will suggest  removing  the vibrating  button if you are not using it, because  it's heavy and if you have more than one kid using it as a play throw ball you don't want the vibrating  button  hitting  your kids it's painful. [SEP] This is a soft vibrating pillow covered in a Minky-like fabric, but not as luxuries as some Minky fabric I have encountered. Still, it does feel nice and huggable--a nice comforting pillow for sure.<br /><br />This is a cool vibrating pillow for adults, but I don't consider it safe for children, because the batteries are not secured in a screw-closed battery compartment. The vibrator is a round plastic disc shape which can be removed from the pillow by unzipping a zipper. A curious child like my grandson would have that vibrator out of that pillow in one minute flat. Then the battery compartment is not child safe. Children's toys have a screw-on cover over the battery compartment, but this one does not. Hence, I absolutely do not recommend this product for children<br /><br />Fine for adults. Not suitable for children. Because it is marketed to both, I can only give it 3 stars. [SEP] Review for: Special Supplies Vibrating Ball Pillow Sensory Pressure Activated for Kids and Adults, Plush Minky Soft Cover with Textured<br /><br />Without the vibrating button inside this pillow, it is just a soft, retro looking, roundish pillow. It is exactly the right size to put on your lap and use as a desk for a tablet. That alone makes it handy. Add the vibration device and it opens up another world of interest. If you hold the pillow up to your body and squeeze just right, the vibration happens. There is a very soothing feeling that comes about when feeling that significant vibration happening near your heart. I can see why it is attractive to kids with special needs. In fact, my kids fight over it, they all love using it and they are about as normal is it gets.<br /><br />I like the design of the button. It is quite large so is easy to activate from outside the pillow. It uses 2 AA batteries and then has an on/off button. The best part is that you still have to press to activate so just because it is in the on position, it is not running all the time and eating batteries. [SEP] it’s soft and fluffy. I work with special needs and I believe they will benefit from it. The whole sensory thing is amazing. The only way to have it vibrate though is if the individual constantly squeezes the pillow. The zipper at the bottom of it is already coming undone and so are the stitches. [SEP] So, I got this for my almost two year old who is going through an early terrible two stage. The vibration soothes him. He lays on it and hangs out.<br /><br />We got two actually. One blue. One purple. Both true to color.<br /><br />We love these but there are cons… the vibration is generated by the user pressing on a button. The button is located in a zippered “compartment” in the pillow, easily removable. The button doesn’t have an options though. It’s just a vibrating button that only works when pressed. For us, it works great because my son only likes laying on it but he is unable to hug it and make it vibrate. I mean, he’s only 2 so, makes sense. My 4 year old does NOT like the vibration so she turns it off and just uses it as a pillow, which is great too.<br /><br />Side note: the vibrating button is easy to press outside the pillow too. My son has put himself to sleep just pressing the button. It is a little intense by itself but it works for him.<br /><br />I like it. If we were able to change the vibration settings, intensity, or have it stay on, it’s be that much better.<br /><br />Hope this helps! [SEP] First off, My kids LOVE this. I originally got it for my almost 2 year old. He’s going through an early terrible two phase and vibration generally calms him so this was perfect. He lays on it and hangs out. He loves it.<br /><br />The only thing I don’t like about this is that the vibrating feature is based on the user pushing a button. Imagine the buzzer from the game taboo. It’s basically that but instead of a buzz, it’s vibration. So you need to hold the button down to feel it. My son lays on it so it works but he is too little to squeeze it and it stay vibrating.<br /><br />If there was a vibrating intensity options and a stay on feature, this would be perfect. The pillow itself is very soft snd comforting.<br /><br />Hope this helps :) [SEP] [[VIDEOID:4ff00df13749254e903979865354fd1f]] This ball is soft and has a good tactile feel<br />The ball is advertised as something you can travel with, but it is pretty large and could only fit in a large bag.<br />I let some of my students with sensory integration problems hug the ball and I could some student do not like the vibrations. Luckily the vibrations cam be removed or turned off. AA batteries are not included. I think whether the child will like this sensory object is case by case. [SEP] The Special Supplies Vibrating Ball Pillow came at exactly the right time.  My four year old was having a meltdown over something and just then the doorbell rang.  As soon as I opened the package my son grabbed and hugged the pillow, activated the vibrator, and stopped crying.  For that reason alone I love this.<br /><br />It's a nice fluffy pillow, easily held by a child or adult.  The material is soft and comfortable.  There is a zippered compartment which holds the vibrating button.  I wanted to give five stars, but the vibrating button needs to be pressed at all times to work.  I really wish this was not the case and that if you press it once it would stay on.  Instead, you have to continuously hold down the button.  If this feature was fixed I would give this five stars. [SEP] This plush pillow, with mild vibration feature, is exactly as depicted and described in the product details.  After removal from the vacuum sealed packaging, the pillow resumes it's functional state as a plush round pillow.  The material that covers the pillow has a nice softness, with great tactile texture/feel.<br />There are no instructions or user manual included with the product.  However, and thankfully, it's simple to figure out. There's a zipper that conceals the vibration device. You remove it and install two AA batteries. Then return it to the compartment and close the zippered opening. (Wish they had a nicer method, which would hide the zipper pull.  Maybe using velcro or snaps would have been a better option.)<br />Pressing the 'hidden' vibration button or squeezing the pillow in the right position will activate the vibration feature. It's a gentle vibration, and is quiet.<br />The significant other's friend and children are visiting today, and the kids love the pillow.  The little girl like hugging it. The little boy wanted to sit on it. haha.  Anyway, it's a big hit with the kids.  The significant other and her friend both thought it was a nice product, especially to occupy the kids.<br />So, overall favorable impressions. Thus it garners a 4 - 4.25 star rating. [SEP] The pillow comes in a vacuum sealed package, which creates it's own fun.  A child (and adult) might find the reviving, reflating of the pillow to be amusing and interesting to watch.  Once it's expanded to it's full fluffy functional state, its a very nice plush round pillow, with a soft textured material covering.<br />There are no instructions/user manual included, but the process is very easy and intuitive. You open a zipper to reveal a compartment that houses the vibration device. Remove it and insert two AA batteries (not included).  Replace it back into the compartment, being sure to have the 'button' facing the outside.  Then a press of the button through the outside, or a considerable squeeze will activate the vibration.  The vibration is mild, but noticeable. The significant other sat on the sofa, and held this on her tummy while she watched tv. She said she likes it, and thinks kids will really like it.  But, she noted that the zipper pull needs to have a better method of hiding it.<br />So, overall, it matches the pictures and descriptions in the product details. It's a comfortable and comforting product, with good plushness and nice, soft textured material. It earns a 4 - 4.25 star rating.",3,True

This version didn't offer any significantly different benefits in terms of probiotic activity for me, but it does come with one big plus: they taste great!<br /><br />I normally use pills for probiotics since the chews I've tried were not all that appealing in terms of taste. These are much different -- they are round balls about the same size as a typical malted milk ball. It has a waxy coating so it does not melt in your hand. The dark chocolate taste is excellent. It does not have the same texture as actual chocolate (it's a bit more grainy), but it is very tasty.<br /><br />Probiotics are great to keep everything running smoothly in your gut, and this is the best tasting option I've come across. The only downside is that the cost per dose is higher than many of the capsule-based probiotics. Still, it's a great way to encourage probiotic usage since taking one can be considered a treat rather than a chore, and easily earns this 5-stars. [SEP] These Digestive Advantage Probiotic Bites in Dark Chocolate are addictive!  Ideally, you'd eat one of these after a meal or daily, as a supplement to your diet, to improve your gut flora and overall digestive health.  I am an avid fan of pro-biotics, and also enjoy kombucha, yogurt, kefir, etc... which are delish, but not quite as simple to eat or as convenient as popping a chocolate into your mouth as you do with these bites.  These Digestive Advantage Bites are the size of giant malt-balls, and are about 90% chocolate in my estimation- straight to the center of the bite, where you then encounter a small circle of chewier and slightly grainy textured probiotic/ chocolate mix, that is only slightly noticeable as being different from the rest of the chocolate, and which does not taste all that different from the rest of the bite either. The only reason i noticed was the texture, which is not unpleasant.<br /><br />I had a hard time eating these just as a supplement, and ended up snarfing a bunch just at once, and they disappeared over a few days (actually, it wasn't just me- my family discovered them quickly), ...cuz it's chocolate- and a very melty high quality chocolate at that (these have a thin waxy coating which prevents them melting in your hand), and these are completely delish. If you don't already take probiotics, I highly recommend you try some form, because it truly makes you feel better inside over a longer term- less stomach issues and better digestion means your body runs more efficiently. These delicious Probiotic Bites are a great way to get the benefits of probiotics, without the nastiness of swallowing pills, and in a form that you can carry with you easily. Also, my kids will eat these in a heartbeat. [SEP] Not only does this have a great effect on your digestive system, but they are really delicious little bites! these taste like dark chocolate. They do not have a medicine taste at all, it really just tastes like candy. I have noticed my tummy feels much better after taking these for three weeks. [SEP] This one a day probiotic literally tastes like a piece of chocolate.  No medicinal taste at all. You can chew it, let it dissolve, or some combination thereof.  The amount of probiotics and the bio-availability are listed as verified on the site - after a month of use, I can say that they seem to work, and at the very least, they are a great after meal treat.  I have to remind myself to stop at one!!!<br /><br />I have already ordered my next month's supply...<br /><br />For taste and purported effect, I recommend this product.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay [SEP] Wife loves these. Wonderful chocolate flavor. However, they were melted when I got them and had to buy them from CVS. [SEP] My 9 yo daughter took these both during and after taking an antibiotic.  She found the taste and texture to be quite enjoyable.  No way of knowing if they were really effective or not as she was doing it as more of a preventative rather than to address ongoing symptoms. [SEP] These are pretty delicious, which is also their only con... I eat far more that the recommended dosage.<br /><br />I really appreciate the thought that went into making this product. Schiff put attention to the fact that most probiotics never survive the trip to where they need to be. [SEP] First off, these were a happy surprise. They taste amazingly like a yummy for my tummy candy. I have been taking probiotics supplement capsules daily for years. I was scared at first that would have that chocolate, medicine, chalky taste- nope! They taste excellent!  Probiotic properties- like other probiotics- its the &#34;good bacteria&#34; the stomach needs to help digest our food and maintain a healthy balance of energy and fuel. Probiotics boosts the immune system, prevent and treat urinary tract infections, improve digestive function, healing inflammatory bowel conditions, and help fight food-borne illnesses.<br /><br />Why did I remove 2 stars? There is no probiotic info listed in the Nutrition Facts... its listed as an ingredient, but I have no clue how many mgs or live cells I am taking nor if its enough to be beneficial. For all I know, i am taking chocolate with Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, and Potassium thrown in with a small itty bitty amount of probiotic somewhere in there but not enough to be listed as a supplement? (See Picture). I researched BC 30.... there is very little research out there other than that it survives in the stomach better.  Is it beneficial? I have no clue. Will adding a small amount of probiotics to chocolate do much for me? After taking it for a several weeks, I’m still not so sure. I feel that adding a vitamin to a food that is inherently unhealthy may be counterproductive.<br /><br />Update 6/24/17- After going through the entire package, there was no difference. After returning to my typical brand, I noticed a significant difference completely- much cleaner, more regular feeling overall. I am removing the remaining stars. [SEP] I like these probiotic bites. They taste good and I have seen a difference. I do think they are a bit hard to initially bite into but other than that I have been pleased with them. [SEP] Tastes ok, but  dusty.

Bob's Red Mill Organic Chia Seeds 12 Ounce Bundle with Swivel Measuring Spoons by Westkitch,[],[],,4.3,27,2109,"These chia seeds are very good quality, with a nice, fresh taste to them and a good crunch. I use a lot of Bob's Red Mill's products, and have always been satisfied with their quality and performance. This is no exception.<br /><br />Chia seeds can be used in numerous ways, and have an excellent nutritional profile. I've been using these mainly as an egg substitute with very good results. Just soak 1 tablespoon of chia seeds in 3 tablespoons of water for 10 min (longer is better) and use it in place of eggs in baked goods. In addition to acting as a binding agent, the seeds provide a very gentle crunch that I find very appealing.<br /><br />The only quibble I have is that the included set of measuring spoons is pretty cheaply made. It's not a reflection on the chia seeds themselves, but it's odd that such a cheap set would be included.<br /><br />That aside, zero complaints. The chia seeds are fresh, tasty, packaged well, and one of those good-for-you foods that actually is appealing to use. Five stars. [SEP] Bob's red mill chia seeds are great! I love these for a morning keto 'cereal' or as a dessert pudding. The company is known for high-quality ingredients, and these are on par. The spoon set is uselsss. They're really hard to turn for use, and they don't come apart, so you have to wash all of them, even if you didn't use them. [SEP] These chia seeds are great, exactly what I would expect from Bob's Red Mill, as I am a big fan of a variety of their products. But, the price on this set it way beyond what I would expect for this product. It comes with a nice measuring spoon set, which is nice and good to have, but that does not make this price worth it. In terms of the chia seeds, they are great. I love that they are organic. I have used them in a few different recipes and I really love them. Great product, price needs some consideration. [SEP] I have come to know Bob's Red Mill products as quality made and fresh.<br />The same applies to organic chia seeds. As an added bonus, they come with a measuring spoon.<br />Chia seeds come with many benefits, that I am not gonna bore you with (Omega-3 acids anyone?).<br />In addition to multiple uses - in shakes, meals, salads, or even deserts (yes, deserts - there is a recipe for blueberry chia jam on the back of the bag), plus you can find many more online.<br />Or you can grow your own chia head/pet - remember those commercials?<br /><br />PROS:<br />- organic.<br />- comes with measuring spoon as an added bonus.<br />- resealable package.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- none that I can find.<br /><br />Overall - if you are looking for quality, organic chia seeds - look no further. [SEP] I make chia pudding as a dessert with this for a clean meal with fiber. [SEP] I have tried other products from Bob's Red Mill and trust the quality of their product line. If you are shopping for chia seeds, you already know their many uses and attributes. You can be assured this brand would be a fine choice. The included set of measuring spoons is a fun bonus, though as others have mentioned the swivel part is quite stiff. The only drawback on this product is the price. With the spoons, these seeds are almost 20 bucks a pound. Other chia seeds sell for about 4.50 a pound. I could buy my own stainless steel measuring spoons and twice as many chia seeds for about the cost of this package. [SEP] These chia seeds and measuring spoon set would make a great gift. The spoons I was actually impressed with, and I've been using these instead of the ones I had owned previously. The chia seeds themselves taste great, and I love using these in homemade breads, yogurts, and salads. I love that these are so versatile and that they taste great. [SEP] These chia seeds make a really delicious quick and easy overnight vegan chia pudding.  I love how the bag re-seals to keep them fresh and prevent a chia spill in my cabinet.  These little seeds add great nutrients to my morning.  I don’t love the measuring spoon that came with it, you can’t detach the spoons for cleaning so you have to wash all of them every time but you can never have too many measuring spoons.

"Evridwear Bath Pouf Ball Sponge Shower Bath Mesh Fluffy Full Body Scrub for Foaming Washing Cleansing Spa Exfoliating with 3 Levels Soft to Heavy, one Pack of 3 Colors/Levels",[],[],,4.6,55,360,"I love what EvridWear has done here!  3 pouf balls, each with a different exfoliating level: white (light), blue (moderate), dark blue (heavy).  You get to try each pouf  all and choose your favorite. ! I love the white pouf, my husband likes the dark blue.  The variety isn't the only awesome detail.  These poufs are VERY well  made. They're incredibly  strong and durable, with  tight bonding that ensures the pouf won't quickly stretch out or fall apart.  Each does a great job washing /exfoliating skin (all skin types!)  and produce a nice lather with soap or body wash.  I have terribly dry, sensitive skin and these poufs do not irritate or scratch my skin in any way.  All 3 are comfortable to use.  They even have small rope so the pouf can be hung up when not in use. The colors are nice as well.  I love the plastic zipper bag the poufs come in.  It serves as an excellent storage bag to hold the poufs until they're used. I was seriously shocked at the price. For as high quality and well made as these poufs are, I would have expected them to cost far more!  There's a pouf for everyone's preference. I just LOVE that EvridWear thought to do the 3 different levels. What a fantastic idea !  EvridWear even offers a 60 day quality guarantee. Your skin is going to look AND feel great  thanks to these poufs! Definitely recommended! [SEP] This is a really NICE set.  Really nice price as well.  MUCH better quality than what you find in dollar stores or pharmacies and the like.  Nice!<br /><br />The gray is the roughest of the three and to me reminds me of those kitchen scrubber sponges that come in a little holder shaped like an animal.  It is the roughest bath pouf I have ever felt - but it is not too bad at all and not too rough at all - just a bit more rigid in design.  The beige is the softest of the three - VERY soft - the softest bath pouf I have ever felt - you almost want to curl up with it.  But it still works great in the bath.  The blue is like your standard bath pouf in consistency - although what seems to be a very good quality one at that.  They were packaged VERY nicely too.  This way I can throw the other two into the closet in their pouch.<br /><br />Personally I can't imagine using all three at once because of space - but it may work if you have a different one for each family member or something.  I am just going to use one at a time.  Maybe softest for now in Winter to be gentle on skin that is already taking a beating.  Then use the gray in the Summer to scrub away grime and sweat.  If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.  Thanks! : ) [SEP] Smaller than the regular I usually get. They work great and really leave your skin feeling clean.  The exfoliation was suprising.  Came in a pack of three in a nice bag.  Would make a nice gift. [SEP] These bath/shower poofs are perfect for holding large quantities of soaps, sudsing up really nicely, and giving your body a fantastic scrub! They are soft, not scratchy, and really make showering much easier than using a traditional wash cloth. I like that it comes in a 3 pack which means I can toss them when they get gross and have a back up. Highly recommended! [SEP] I love bath poofs but they always seem to be falling apart and I have to replace them frequently. This set is interesting in that there are ""strengths"" - soft, medium and hard. Even the hard one is not rough on your skin, so perhaps you will use them based on your level of ""dirty"" - for me, I like the soft one the best but they are all good. [SEP] I use body washes ever evening, so I go through quite a few loofahs. This pack has been so great! All three sponges are soft, and even though they each have different textures for exfoliation, they are still gentle for sensitive skin. They are thick and durable. They've all held up well to daily use without falling apart like cheaper brands. Since there were three in the pack, this is a fantastic value. I truly think these are worth the investment. [SEP] These are great to have on hand.  Both my husband and I both use these and I like having them so we can change them up every few weeks and not let them sit too long.  I do not personally care about the different levels of softness, but others may really love that option.  They seem to be around the same price as the store, if not a tad higher.  You are getting three though which is great. [SEP] It works [SEP] I really like this set of bath pouf ball sponge. It has a compact mesh, and the material is good for the skin. Just add body wash on it and can make many foam. Pretty good! [SEP] These shower mesh balls are incredible. I liked that it came it secured bag. I used the ""soft"" mesh ball and it felt amazing. With only water running through it, the mesh felt very soft. It is not your typical mesh ball you get from Walmart.",3,True

[SEP] [[VIDEOID:f3a106e39bc9ce5fd71bc543ad0e593]] I am struggling with how to review this product for 2 reasons: 1) one of the rollers appears to have been used already - see my pictures; and 2) the product was not sealed with tape to give confidence that the product was sterile.<br /><br />As for how this product works, I think it’s a great tool to soften calluses and eliminate dead skin from your feet. I used the roller that appeared unused (after cleaning with alcohol) and it worked great to address dry skin on the bottom of my feet. It comes with a charger and fully charges in a few hours. This comes with 3 rollers and is compact for easy storage.<br /><br />The instructions provided are also written in broken English and really do not make sense (see my pictures).<br /><br />In terms of effectiveness, I would give this 4 stars. In terms of written instructions, a rating of a 2 and confidence of receiving a sterile product at a 1.<br /><br />The packaging needs to be wrapped to ensure sterilization and the instructions need to be corrected - then this product is one I could recommend. [SEP] This little tool is great for those of use who can't afford pedicures on a regular basis. It came with each head individually packaged. I did see other reviews where there products appeared to be used. That was not the case with this one thankfully. This electric foot file comes in handy to help get all that ugly dry skin off your heels and other parts of your foot. It comes with three different heads that have varying levels of coarseness. You choose which works best for you. I do wish the heads were labeled. While it is easy to tell which head is the smoothest the other two are harder to tell apart just by looking at them. To turn this on you have to hold down the power button for several seconds before it will power on. It has two speeds settings and you simply push the power button once to change the power setting and one more time to power off. I would suggest you use after your shower, or have soaked your feet. I think it works better this way when the skin is softer. I did try using dry once and I felt like it hurt a little. It comes with a power cable and I plug in after each use, so I haven't exactly tested out the full battery life. It would be better if this came with some kind of bag or case, in order to easily keep all the pieces together. I will have to purchase one separately. Not a bad product. It does what I need so I can wear sandals with out being embarrassed. [SEP] Easy to put together, lightweight, and cute rose gold color. Comes with 2 extra heads for different filing comfort levels. USB charger cord included (no base). Read instructions to understand how it operates. Long press to turn on, change modes and turn off. Great self care accessory during quarantine! [SEP] WHAT I DIS LIKE ABOUT THIS  IS IT MAKE YOUR FEET BLEED  WHAT I LIKE TAKE MOST OF DEAD SKIN OFF AND MAKE FEET KINDA SMOOTH [SEP] Actually got this for the bf.. with his work boots on his feet more than off, his feet are in pretty rough shape. Super dry, super calloused..<br />The second he tried it he looked at me and said why have I never got one of these. I love this.<br />And now, he’s always using it. So I’d say 5 stars for sure, and maaaan am I thankful too.<br />The battery life on this thing is great. He uses it regularly and has only thrown it on the charger a maybe once. [SEP] This works pretty well. I did it while feet were dry and outcome wasn’t as good as soaking and doing doing feet. It has three different ones you can use on the tool and also has a charger. So far, so good. [SEP] I grew up dancing and so my feet have always been calloused and covered in dry skin. I used this the morning after doing a foot mask and the dead skin just melted away! Be careful not to push down while you use it because that will stop the stone from spinning and I imagine that could burn out the motor, but honestly, pressure is not needed for it to work!. There is also a slower speed option I would guess it is if you want a more gentle exfoliation. All in all though, this is a great product. [SEP] I love this to smooth my cracked heels. It was easy to use and I love that it comes with extra foot file heads. The grinder is lightweight and rechargeable. The foot files are rough enough to smooth out my heels. I used it dry and with water. Worked well with both. [SEP] I love it.!! Everything is great and does a good job!  Thank you so much!",3,True
"Omega 3 Fish Oil Supplement 3600mg High DHA & EPA Natural Fatty Acids, Pure and Tested Wild-Caught Fish, Triple Strength Brain, Heart, and Joint Support, Burpless Subtle Lemon Flavor, 60 Softgels",[],[],,4.1,63,1741,"I always hate this.  A bottle should be at least a months amount. This is only 20 days worth - 60 tablets with a 3 per day serving.  They also give me fishy burps after taking them.  And they are horse pills, so hard to swallow for me.<br /><br />Other than that, there is nothing wrong with these.  It is good to take omega 3 oils for your heart. [SEP] These fish oil supplement pills are big but narrow so they are still easy to swallow.  I noticed a tiny bit of an aftertaste but nothing offensive or overwhelming even when I've taken them on an empty stomach.  It's difficult to quantify how effective they are as a supplement without getting ""before and after"" bloodwork but I can say I felt fine while taking them and--again--didn't notice any bad burps or aftertaste. [SEP] These are fish oil capsules in the dosage of 1600 per capsule. They are large but go down easy. The dosage amount shown on the bottle is actually based on two capsules.<br /><br />I’m not sure why it says “lemon” as they don’t taste anything like lemon to me and smell just awful.<br /><br />This is fish oil and I’ve taken it for years so I expected nothing less. If you don’t take it currently and want to try it, don’t be fooled by the lemon stuff - nope no lemon to be found here. It’s fish oil. It doesn’t leave a long time bad taste and is good for the heart!<br /><br />I take 2 every morning.<br />These work as expected.<br />Good value overall. [SEP] Really like these, no bitter after taste and easy to swallow [SEP] I like these fish oil supplements.  I find the lemon flavoring makes them easier for me to take, and I don't burp up fish smell with these.  Be aware that for 3600 mg you need to take 3 of these supplements, which makes the bottle last for 20 days.  I just take one a day.  The product information says these supplements are from wild caught fish and tested for purity.  The pills are large but easy to swallow, I will reorder these as they are easier for me to take. [SEP] These are actually ginormous, like almost comically huge. They're flavored to be like lemon!<br /><br />It's instructed to take 3 a day but I find that a little excessive and hard to palette. I'm actually fine with 1 a day. I'm perfectly happy with adjusting to less to suit my day to day.<br /><br />I find these pills to be HUGE but that's okay if you're willing to do it or willing to lessen your intake! [SEP] I eat well . feel good and body energetic [SEP] How many fish burps are one too many? One!  I hate seafood, all of it, and have had several good experiences with Omegas since my doctor said I should start taking it. No fish burps at all.  Not so with this brand.<br /><br />Both my husband and I have experienced them.  I stopped taking these after the first one -- the gross-out factor for me is over the top. He's still using them but only with meals since he doesn't want any more fish burps than he can help.<br /><br />It may be a good supplement, but not for a fish-hater. Even if I liked seafood, I wouldn't want it in a supplement I take in the morning. I've gone back to a brand that hasn't let me down. [SEP] Product: Built By Nature Omega 3 Fish Oil Supplement 3600mg High DHA & EPA Natural Fatty Acids, Pure and Tested Wild-Caught Fish, Triple Strength Brain, Heart, and Joint Support, Burpless Subtle Lemon Flavor, 60 Softgels<br /><br />I really wanted to like these, and I had great hopes for them. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out that way.<br /><br />First, these are NOT burpless. I was burping them up 1 out of 3 times taking them. That’s bad enough, but it is not an uncommon experience with fish oil supplements. The taste was just horrible, even for fish oil. Maybe it was the lemon flavoring, I don’t know. It was just worse than other fish oil I”ve burped up. I ended up not being able to finish the bottle, which is very unusual for me. I’ll usually go ahead with a moderately bad flavor. The expiration date for my bottle was good for about a year, so freshness shouldn’t have been the problem. This was with taking only 1 as a dose. I can’t imagine what it would have been like taking the recommended 3 per dose.<br /><br />That 3 softgel dose is also higher than most fish oil supplements,which tend to be only 2. This means the bottle only lasts for 20 days, not a full month. It also means taking 3 large pills, which these are. I could swallow them, but they might be hard for anyone who has any difficulty swallowing pills.<br /><br />The bottom line is these just didn’t work for me. [SEP] Couldn’t swallow’",3,True

I love how the containers stack together easily to keep a clean cabinet. Comes in a set of 30 which I will actually be using at the neck family gathering to store leftovers for guests to take home instead of using zip lock bags. Easy to clean and store away. I've been using these for a while and they were a lifesaver in college. Glad I can get these in bulk here. Highly recommended! As a warning, if you do microwave pasta, the sauce may stain if it's tomato based. I usually have designated o es just for that reason. Other than that, it's perfect to freeze and reheat your meals in. [SEP] I generally like to use my bento box and glass containers, but I do like these Amazon Brand - Solimo Plastic Food Storage Containers with Lids. The feel of the storage container is comparable to brand name containers. The lid stays secure. They are a decent size. The plastic isn't 'bendy'. It can be re-used a few times. Even though it does indicate that it is BPA-free, I do like to stay to a limit on re-use and the container seems durable enough for at least 5 re-uses. I should also add that I generally do not re-heat in the container so if one re-heats on a separate plate (which I prefer), it extends the use. It is also has a pretty good price point in that it is around 90 cents per container. It is worth a look if you like containers like this style. [SEP] These are a reasonably priced option for food storage containers and freezing.<br />This size is perfect for a serving or two of soup or salad. I've been using them a lot to freeze the bounty of summer gardens. I haven't had any problems with leaking. The lids snap on securely.<br />They wash in the top rack of the dishwasher.<br /><br />This this summer has been pretty hot. When I take my dog to the dog park, I fill up one of these containers with water before I leave. It doesn't leak in the car and he has fresh drinking water which he needs after running around with all his buddies. [SEP] These storage containers are smaller than I expected, but they still work well for bringing food to work or school in a lunch bag. They work well for salads, pasta, rice and small quantities of other leftovers. The lids fit securely but go on and off easily. The containers are easy to clean since they are dishwasher safe on the top shelf. This item comes with a total of thirty containers, in six sets of five. [SEP] Ideales para congelar productos en la nevera, no se quiebran fácilmente, el tamaño es ideal, super recomendadas! [SEP] Same quality as major brands but at a much cheaper price! Purchased to use as freezer containers and they're perfect! [SEP] Great little containers! Easy to use, clean, and has a good seal. The lids are just a bit flimsy but still work well 5 stars! [SEP] Will warp and stain if microwaved with anything with tomato sauce. [SEP] This is my second set.  I send food to my elderly mom continually. I didn't expect these to last forever for the price, but I was impressed with how long they lasted.  Eventually you may get a crack in the lids, but you get a lot of use before that happens. [SEP] The first thing my wife did was check the lids and comment ""These are the type that don't last long.""  She's right.  These are more like the Ziploc brand than the Glad brand.  In my experience the Glad containers are just a bit more sturdy with lids that last longer without breaking.<br /><br />That said, these are a good value - even more so if you do Subscribe & Save.  The size is good and, for the price, they'll last as long as I'd expect.",3,True
"Keto IV Electrolyte Drops + High Potassium | No Leak Dropper Bottle | 500mg Potassium + Magnesium, Sodium & Zinc | Hint of Raspberry | 30 Servings",[],[],,3.9,202,815,"I have been trying to build up my system with minerals in my water, but not too long ago, I had a bout with the runs- the kind that leave you feeling rather exhausted after a day of running to the bathroom.  I noticed that I was feeling very ill and weak the next day or two, then it dawned on me.  I thought I would try this..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This stuff is thickened in a bottle which has a twist of raspberry flavoring added.  It is not sweet, just has a raspberry essence.  There is no sweetener, and the dropper has measuring lines on it.<br /><br />HOW TO USE THIS?<br />I was so run down when I got thinking about it, I remembered- you can easily get dehydrated when having ""the runs"".  I immediately got out this electrolyte mixture and put a small amount of this (like.25) into a very large glass of water.  I drank it down as gradually as I could and then through the day I added more water.<br /><br />By the end of the morning, I was feeling TONS better.  This really did help me rehydrate and feel better after being wiped out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is not hard to take, has just a bit of raspberry flavor, but does help me to rehydrate when I really need help.  I experienced relief greatly after having a bout with ""the runs""  I plan to use a little bit now and then to continue to rehydrate this winter.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  I love that this helped me through a rough patch when I needed hydration.  I am torn between five and four stars for review.  I am VERY glad there is not heavy sweetener in this like so many things have.  I also am kind of unclear on ingredients or this company.  I also experienced good from it so far, so I am leaving it at FOUR STARS, but REALLY IT IS FOUR AND A HALF. [SEP] If you are going out and sweating or working. You add the liquid to your water and this will help replenish electrolyte drops. If you have issues with leg cramps, this can help with that too. [SEP] I got this because it says that it's flavored, portable, and figured it would be good to add into my water bottle during hot  yoga. It tastes GROSS and you need a comedic amount of drops if you have a large water bottle.  It's not that I am not used to the taste of stevia, it just has a bad berry flavor. The bottle also isn't portable, it's pretty big. Probably because you need so many drops to make it work. If it leaks then you've got another mess on your hands.<br /><br />Stick with Nuun tablets. They taste a lot better, one does the job, and they are in a portable container that can't spill.<br /><br />This is bitter and I'd use it if I were sick or something, but it's really a slight degree away from Pedialyte. [SEP] I have to have electrolytes when playing tennis. I play very competitively, especially during the summer months when it's very hot here in the Deep South. If I don't have an electrolyte drink available during a match I start getting the shakes and afterwards I am prone to muscle cramping which hurts like you-know-what. I have tasted these electrolyte drops and they taste fine in water, but I haven't been able to test it out on a hot court since it's still winter. But, looking at the ingredients list it seems to have everything I need and more. I especially like the extra potassium it contains.  And I usually have to add a little NaCl to it since I sweat so much of it out while playing but I probably won't have to because it contains 125mg of sodium per serving.  I'm really looking forward to using this electrolyte come this Spring and Summer. [SEP] So gross.  Tastes like cough syrup.  It smelled amazing and I was really looking forward to trying it, but man it is nasty.  Leaves a really bad after taste as well (I think from the sweetener).  My husband who loves all flavors of juice wouldnt even use this product. [SEP] On a ketogenic diet, you drink a lot of water and you lose a lot of water so you constantly have to replenish your electrolytes. This solution contains the perfect balance of minerals that you need and they're in a concentrated form so you can easily carry the bottle with you in your gym bag or purse. The dropper has measurements marked on it so you can tell how much you're taking. You just add it to plain or sparkling water. It tastes a little salty, but that's to be expected - salt is good on Keto. It replaces 4 individual supplements I was taking and I like that it's portable. It would also be very useful for anyone who is doing heavy workouts, sports or work outdoors in hot weather. Highly recommended. [SEP] Although I try to follow a keto diet, it ends up being more of a low card eating lifestyle. I do, however, have low blood pressure and tend to have pretty large dips after intense workouts. I find that adding this to some water immediately after a work out really helps me to avoid that dizzy blood pressure crash after. I have to rate this product with four stars versus five though - because the taste is dreadful. If there was a way to make this product tasteless that would be great! The taste of this product reminds me of the smell of infant liquid vitamins (yuck) as it is overly sweet and has a metallic taste. As such, I can deal with chugging this down quickly in 8oz of water for the restorative post workout effects. [SEP] Taste strange and upsets my stomach, which usually nothing ever does. [SEP] I like it, it's simple and easy to add to my water bottle. I am constantly concerned with my mineral and electrolyte levels because I have body aches and migraines, cluster and other headaches. It's a lifelong problem, but I can do somethings to improve my situation, one is to drink plenty of water and stay hydrated by drinking water that is purified and enhanced. I love these drops. The water tastes fresh and clean. I shake the container and put five  drops in my water carafe. [SEP] I really like Keto IV. The flavor is perfect. The thickness I’d just right. Keto IV is very sheer! The Keto drink mix I used previous was very gritty. I tried heating Iran’s blending it, but I couldn’t get rid of the grittiness! Keto IV has very little grit. I would notice except I was looking for it! You will be glad you tried it.",3,True

It has 12 electrode pads. It also comes with cables, a drawstring bag, and instructions.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this AVCOO 4 Channel TENS Unit for Pain Relief to family and friends. [SEP] My old tens unit had just basic settings and intensities.  Plus all pads had to be the same setting.<br />This tens unit is so different and so much better.  First of all it's so much lighter.  Easier to carry around so you can have it working even when I'm driving or working.<br />I can also use 8 pads at one time if I need to.  I may hurt at times but the most pads I need are 4 to cover my sore areas.<br />I'm still learning what all the pictures on the device actually mean.  The best way to learn is by just trying them all out to see what mode is best for you for a certain area and what intensity works the best.<br />My first encounter with a stims unit or called tens unit is at a chiropractors office.  I would feel so good after going through a session.<br />After that I had to have one and purchased my first tens unit about 15 yrs ago.  Haven't been without one since.<br />These are so good with helping with my tension headaches.  I place the pads on my upper back/shoulder blade area.  It really helps loosen the muscles and relieving my headaches.<br />They're also great with lower back pain.  Pads placed on the lower back on each side of my spine and within about 90 mins I am feeling so much better.<br />Driving also makes my back hurt.  I can have the pads on and running while I'm driving which really helps me sit for longer periods so I can drive longer distances.<br />For any muscle ache on any part of your body, minus the chest area, and the relief is priceless.<br />If you've never tried a tens unit, you really should try one out and see how good it feels after using one.<br />I like this unit.  Comes with more pads than other units. [SEP] I did consult with my doctor and made sure it was okay to use the TENS unit. Read all the directions well before using it. I use it on my shoulder area the most. Sometimes lower back. It has a lot of different setting as to the rotation of the pulses. It can be very mild up to way to intense. I seems to like around level 10 or 11 in massage mode. Lot of pain relief in a tiny package. The sticky pads can be used by the same person a number of times if returned to plastic sheets between uses. [SEP] I haven’t been able to figure it all out. I usually can get the two channels to work.  Please don’t start it up high or even medium. It is really powerful. [SEP] For the price, this thing works great!  It is so strong!  Like I am used to setting TENS to their highest setting for relief but I was unable to do that with this thing.  It is powerful.  I like that it has 4 ports as most have two although I only use two most of the time on two areas like shoulders and lower back.  The four ports could be helpful for someone who wants to work one leg totally, though - so great to have.<br /><br />The charge lasts forever too.  In fact, it arrived fully charged and ready to go!  The pads seem a little cheap, though.  Like I can see the circles on the sticky part.  But they work just fine.  And again pads are replaced anyway.  The machine works so well.  I really like it and I am one with constant tension and tightness in my shoulders and shoulder blades and pain sometimes in my lower back.

The first 16 modes are TENS > the last 8 EMS.<br />The size (5"" T - 2 1/2"" W) allows for a larger, easier to view screen (3 1/4"" T - 1 3/4"" W)<br />which allows for the 6 main mode icons also much larger.<br /><br />EACH button is for ONE CHOICE (not multiple commands)<br />>>> There's no joy button to have to figure out how it works. (Thank You!)<br />> The power button and separate screen lock button are on the side. (like a cell ph)<br />> One (center) button chooses back and forth between channel A & B<br />> One button 'M' is the mode = and continually pressing it moves you one mode number<br />at a time = through all 24 modes of the six main mode icons. Then starts over.<br />> One button ""T"" -  each press is 10 min (up to 90 min)<br />> One button '+"" for more intensity = 20 levels<br />> One button ""-"" for less intensity = 20 levels<br />>>> I found this getting intense at level 6, don't think I could go very much more.<br /><br />And to boot - this is a richer / classier design which is handsome on all sides<br />including the back which is all black with the company name.<br /><br />Includes - 4 channel unit<br />Six sets of electrodes<br />Four snap leads - each include Velcro band<br />Charging cable (no wall plug)<br />Storage bag = kinda tight fit for all pieces.<br />Instructions.<br /><br />PS = these electrodes & leads fit and work with two other TENS units I have.<br />I'd give this unit more than five star if I could. [SEP] I got this unit to replace the other one I have that worked alright but had the plug in leads that came loose easily. These leads snap on tightly and are very secure.  The small pads are larger than most and stick securely and are very strongly conductive.  The modes allow for multiple options for stimulation relief and there is an EMS mode if you want more muscle strengthening than just pain relief.  I have used it since I received it. It took about three hours to gain a full charge.  The unit has the feel off quality to it, and is about the size of a cell phone. It comes with a nice pouch and each lead has a cord strap attached to it.  I am impressed with how it works and how it appears.  I believe that I will be getting another for my daughter for Christmas. IT was delivered quickly and very well packaged by a very reliable seller. [SEP] This by far is the easiest device to use!  A must have fir muscular pain!  Wish I’d found this one years ago! [SEP] Easy to use and product works great! Helpful in relieving pain. [SEP] I suffer from chronic widespread pain and this has been a game changer for pain relief!! I love all the different settings and that there are 4 channels that you can use at the same time with different settings. My only complaint is that the electrode pads lose their stickiness after 2-3 uses. I ordered different pads to use that last longer since I use it so often.",3,True

"Aneercare Reusable Menstrual Pads,Cloth Menstrual Pads, Washable, Super Absorbent, Suitable for People with Medium Traffic (4 Medium Size + 2 Small Size + 1 Waterproof Mini Bag)",[],[],,4.2,36,572,"Overall I am impressed with the effectiveness of these s they are intended. Silky waterproof like material on one side, and soft fleecy material on the other. They are meant for ""low flow""-- which I am really only most comfortable with using it for very light days, so please keep that in mind. I always wear a liner for various reasons. I am using these for that purpose. They do not leak, there is no odor that I have notices, and the material is so soft and comfortable. My lady bits like the fleecy feel. When done I toss it in the wash or hand wash depending on what I feel like.<br /><br />While the liners stayed put in a manner that kept me covered,  do notice some shifting. I am larger in size, so underwear is larger.. and it seems that these were quite loose. I think a second button snap right along the first to make more narrow, and/or a second set to also help keep it in place. Right now it is one snap, loose fit. It may not be limited to these, this may be the norm? This is my first experience with reusable cloths. I really like the idea, and while I am not ready to fully swap out, I can comfortable using these in place of my daily liner. Or paired with a resuable menstrual cup. But for flow? I am not there yet in terms of confidence. [SEP] These Aneercare washable menstrual pads are okay overall. I haven’t tried any other reusable pads like this so I can’t compare. So far I have used them as a pad after the 1st and 2nd day of my cycle when it is lighter. I was too nervous to use when I first started this month because I had to work all 16 hours t and didn’t want to risk having a huge mess on my hands. I find them to be comfortable and and they don’t make any crinkly noise while wearing. They have washed well so far. I always do a nice hand wash before putting in the washing machine.  I dried them also and wonder if the plastics button will warp eventually [SEP] These are not really a substitute for a pad, but if you have lighter days with very little flow, these are perfect liners. They also work great if you have a cup or tampon but sometimes get some leaks. Reusable and washable, these are so much friendlier for the environment than disposable liners, so I highly recommend them for that. [SEP] Great to have in your stash especially if you have daughters! After the whole toilet paper shortage last Spring, I decided to get these to have on hand. Soft and well made. [SEP] They are quite absorbent and I love that they do not get stained [SEP] I wanted to use these pads as backup protection when I'm wearing a menstrual cup, and for that purpose they are almost okay, but they aren't very comfortable. They slide around a lot because they only have one snap and the outer fabric is slick. The inner fleece fabric is fairly hydrophobic. Liquid beads on the top and slides to the edges. When it does get absorbed, the top of the fleece stays wet rather than wicking moisture away from your skin, which isn't comfortable. There are also no washing instructions in the box. We used cloth diapers for both of our kids and these pads are pretty much just tiny cloth diapers, so I wash these how I washed those, but care instructions would be nice. Overall I'm disappointed and I would not recommend this product. [SEP] These are very soft and comfortable to wear all day long. They aren't the bulky kind and that really helps. Love using these for running and gym workouts. They stay in place. And can also be used as panty liners. The material is soft and satin/silk like on the end away from your body and the charcoal layer is close to your body. Good absorption and odor eliminator. Washes super easy by hand. If you're using just as panty liners, they can be washed easily in a linen bag on a gentle cycle with other delicates in a small load and dried on low heat in the dryer. Otherwise, they're best hand washed. There are 4 medium sized ones that correspond in size to regular sized pads and 2 small ones for lighter days that correspond to panty liner size. Come with a convenient bag to carry a clean one with you and to store a used one when you change. Or to simply carry a bunch of clean ones for travel. Environmentally safe, safe for your body and saves you money too. [SEP] This are so pretty, it's almost hard to use them for their intended purpose. They have a snap to fasten around your panties but that doesn't keep them from sliding back and forth so they don't stay in place all that well. You will want to cut off the tags because they are irritating. These are fairly absorbent and work for medium to light days. For heavy flow, you may want a cup or something as well--or be prepared to change them often. [SEP] I've been using cloth pads for years!! I have tampons and disposables for when I go out and will be gone a while just purely out of convenience but I'm a stay at home mom and homeschooler of 2 so I'm at home a lot!! ANY cloth pads are sooo much softer than disposable and I try to limit exposure to as much chemicals as possible. I DO find for me that when I walk a lot the pad scoots to my backside and I need to pull it up ever so often. That being said it may be the way I walk because it's all cloth pads, not just these. That's also why I don't wear them places like grocery stores because I can't just stick my hands down my pants to tug on it while I'm walking around a store.<br />These are fairly absorbent but I have noticed I need to change them more often during my heavy time than some of my other brands. I still really like these and especially for the price you can't beat it!! I bought some handmade ones on etsy one time and they were $15 EACH! This is a MUCH better deal honestly! [SEP] These reusable sanitary pads need something more than one snap to secure them. There is one snap to secure the pad around the crotch of the panties. It isn't enough.  Additionally, I would feel more secure if the pads had some kind of waterproof layer. Changing pads in public and having to carry a soaked pad until you get home is problematic for me. Blood has an odor and it won't be long before it's noticed by others while either wearing one of these pads or carrying a soiled one home.  I do think they would make a nice addition to wear under a disposable sanitary pad to protect your underpants from staining. But for me they aren't enough to wear alone.",3,True

[SEP] ok [SEP] I am about to hit 40 and lack of collagen is starting to show on my skin and joints. I take this supplement daily. These are capsules, no smell and easy to swallow. I used to take powder drink collagen but the flavor was horrible and I found myself cheating just because I was dreading tasting it. This is much easier and works better for me. Additional Vitamins are always a bonus. Good for immunity and skin. [SEP] My wife loves to spend an afternoon giving herself a manicure, using those gel UV light kits. As a result, they may look great for a long time, however her nails have been taking the brunt of that manicure lifestyle, and become very brittle and weak. I have gotten her powder collagen before, and she seems not to mind it by mixing it into her coffee, but oftentimes forgets it as well because it's not like it adds flavor that is pleasant enough for her to remember to always take it. She and I do take vitamins, and have some medications as well, so taking collagen in a pill form is a lot easier for us to remember, because we just put it in our weekly pill container. After taking the 28 day supply, my wife did let me know that she was happy with how her nails had began to recover. The strength of her nails had improved quite a bit, as they were almost paper thin at one point. I remember her constantly complaining that she had just broken a nail, but the collagen did a good job of strengthening her nails. This also may be anecdotal, but she did notice an improvement in her skin as well. All in all, I would say that they do work, and taking it in pill form as opposed to a powder that you mix into your drink of choice, is a superior method of delivery, in my opinion. My wife liked it a lot, and I think she's going to make me buy some more. It's also worth mentioning that there are some vitamin added benefits to this collagen pill as well, such as vitamin C & D which are necessary and imperative for improved immune system health. It is rather expensive for a 28 day supply, but perhaps worth it if you're looking to regenerate some damaged nails or skin.

"Aimyoo 4x4x1.6 inch Small White Collapsible Gift Box with Lid 5 Pack, Little Magnetic Favor Box Empty Hard Cardboard Jewelry Box",[],[],,3.0,46,179,"There are five super sturdy, tiny boxes in this set that will hold a small bar of soap or some jewelry. The front flap magnetically closes.<br /><br />Box setup is simple. Just unfold the one piece into the shape shown in less than a couple of seconds. There are no ugly creases; just a sturdy box. The four corners can be sealed shut by removing the paper over the adhesive. When I have done that in the past, I find that the adhesive is not strong enough to stick well.<br /><br />The reason I rated these two stars is because the corners that are sealed (not the ones I can seal) come undone as can be seen in my photo. This means I have to glue the corners that are supposed to arrive sealed already.<br /><br />The current price of $12.99 is way too expensive for a box that is coming apart at the seams. If the boxes were not coming apart, I would have rated them 4 stars. [SEP] Pro:<br />Magnetic closure works well<br />Well made<br />Great value<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cannot think of any !! [SEP] I like the size of these boxes. They are small - the interior dimensions are 3.5 inches by 4 inches, and it's about 1.5 inches deep. It's a good size for items such as jewelry or other similar items. However, the build quality is so poor that these are pretty useless as gift boxes.<br /><br />It folds together like most gift boxes, with the sides held in by adhesive pads. However, the cut accuracy is poor, so the sides don't meet up well with the top (or each other). The magnetic flap will not hold shut. The carboard is thin and doesn't have a substantial feel. Instead of having a box that dresses up what's inside, this box cheapens the contents since it looks and feels so poorly made. And won't even stay shut!<br /><br />The cost is way out of range for such a poorly made gift box. It's not something I would recommend. One star. [SEP] Small and perfect box size for friends if you're looking for something simple. [SEP] I did not have the same issue with the magnet others have described. It took a little finesse, but I was able to get them to affix properly. overall, they are a good deal. I would recommend them. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:67067b97d932c053447c8129baf5b942]] These are very sturdy little gift boxes.  About the size for jewelry or a watch.  They fold flat for storage, and assemble easily by flipping the lid (which is attached) around and pressing the magnet hidden under the lid to its mate on the box.  My only complaint is that the magnet take several attempts to get it to “stick”.  But then it finally does.  This is the type of box that could easily be re-used several times since it is so sturdy.  They are glossy white.<br /><br />At $12.99 for the set of 5, they average $2.60 for each box.  That’s not the least expensive box; however, it’s a fair price given how sturdy these boxes are.<br /><br />I made a video to show you how to assemble the box and that it’s a little tricky to get the magnet to stick.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope that my review helped you! [SEP] These boxes are easy to assemble and they’re sturdy. The adhesive and the magnet are not strong enough. The box won’t stay intact. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:5d28cc2c6c0f5c238f325def1b45ef5c]] It actually easy to assemble. It’s even sturdy. To be able to close it make sure you bend the part wherr the magnetic thing is on or the flap an extra minute and hold it close for a minute as well so it will close. [SEP] Do not waste your money! Believe me. Magnets did not work on all boxes. One box would stick sometimes but the other 4 boxes would not even work at all. It was like there was no magnet at all. [SEP] These are cute little boxes that are great to hold party favors for a baby shower or the like, just keep an eye on the size. They are small. That said, they're sturdy, easy to assemble, and looked nice after I put them together.  I really like this type of gift box and would absolutely consider them again in the future.",3,True

[SEP] This is a 7 oz bag of USDA Certified Organic maca root. It looks and smells like I expected. It smells and tastes pretty fresh to me. [SEP] This Maca root power was very fine and easy to use in my smoothies.  It adds a slighty nutty pleanant taste to my smoothie.  It was easy to mix in the blender leaving no lumps or clumps,  I enjoyed the extra energy and not having to have a second cup of coffee midday. [SEP] I love that there is a simple, single ingredient, product that tastes good and has good nutrition without a bunch of ""added"" nutrients.<br /><br />I am constantly looking for simple ingredients that can be added to a smoothie or shake to add nutrition.  This one is high in calcium and iron and tastes great. [SEP] The product tastes and smells like it’s supposed to.

It smells and tastes very fresh and similar to maca root powders I’ve used.  I like that it’s organic and grown sustainably in Peru. Maca is great mixed in my morning smoothies for energy and endurance during the day.  I recommend it. [SEP] I consume Maca daily, usually in my morning coffee. Sometimes, it will be added to baking recipes, adding a protein and nutritionally boost. It also adds a savory flavor note.<br />Based on my experience with maca, this appears to be very good quality. I am impressed and appreciate that the product label displays USDA Organic. This certification indicates the purity and quality of the maca. In fact, the label also states: "" We source our products from indigenous regions to maintain sustainability and ensure that potency, quality and purity are uncompromised."" This statement, along with the USDA Organic certification demonstrates that commitment, checking off quality concern boxes for me.<br />This maca has the familiar fragrance and appearance of quality maca. I added it to a bread recipe, and it it created the welcome aroma while baking. The odd thing, is it has less of an earthiness taste when added to a bread recipe than when added to a cup of coffee (possibly due to quantity of maca concentration in the respective usage).<br />This maca powder fully satisfies expectations, earning a 4.75 - 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.

He is a picky eater and I have to find creative ways of including more nutrients in his diet.<br />Maca root is rich in iron, iodine, potassium, calcium, amino acids, and of course vitamins and minerals. So it's perfect to include in my son's diet!

These gummies are a tasty and effective way to improve your gut health. 5 billion cfus. Recommended. [SEP] My son totally killed his other gummy probiotic supplement so now he's on to this one. It's good too. It's sweetened with malitol so it's not always dependably good tasting but this one is. That's also useful because the kid has way too many gummy supplements with sugar. [SEP] These taste good and work well.  Took after a round of antibiotics and restored the natural balance in my digestive system.  Just what I needed. [SEP] New Roots Probiotic Health Gummies are vegan, gluten-free, non-gmo, and sugar free. I really like seeing more nutritional supplements rising to the occasion to meet that level of quality. I was excited about trying New Roots Probiotics but unfortunately, these gummies have an odd smell and a strange texture. They are sweet but they are not a true gummy. The texture is slightly pasty and I am not fond of the mystery flavor either. Regrettably, I won’t be able to finish the bottle. These gummies aren’t suited for my taste so I won’t be able to attest to their effectiveness either. [SEP] I'm faithfully taking 2 each day.  I feel fine.  The taste is fine; I'm not looking for a gourmet experience.  The texture is a little different from the product I've been taking, but that's fine also.  I think it's very important to take a probiotic daily supplement.  A few years ago, I got lazy and didn't take my probiotic supplement for several months.  When I was prescribed an antibiotic,  I developed a yeast infection which probably would have been prevented by a probiotic supplement.  I notice that there's only one strain of probiotic, Bacillus coagulans, while other products I've used have a combination of various probiotics.  But am not a scientist so can't form an opinion on that. I like that they're sugar free, and gluten free. [SEP] Chances are you won't be taking these probiotic gummies for flavor, so the taste being alright works for us.<br />The probiotic is bacillus coagulans and directions are to take one or two per day.  Taking two a day has this jar lasting for just one month, and it is expensive for a probiotic.  There are other choices at a better pricing option. [SEP] These Daily Probiotic Gummies can get the job done. The gummies are tasty and they haven't caused me any problems. [SEP] This is a good basic family probiotic containing the best, world-wide, well-studied probiotic, Bacillus coagulans.  It is vegan and sugar free with natural colors and flavors.  Great for digestion and immune system function.  Made in Canada and accredited laboratory tested.<br /><br />The instructions are a little unclear as the side information says children 3 or up take 1 gummy/day and adults take 1-2.  The.  supplement facts say a serving size is 1 gummy/day for 2-3 years and 2 gummies for children over 4.  Basically, I think that children and adults over 4 can take 1-2 gummies at their discretion.  Obviously, it will be a better value if everyone in a family only takes one.  The flavors of strawberry and orange are delicious.  I recommend this product. [SEP] These have an odd taste for a gummy; not bad, but not my favorite. I appreciate it being sugar free, so maybe that has something to do with the taste. I like taking these to help give my gut a little boost and to help keep me regular. They work! [SEP] Hi, it's Glamorous Gem, hope you all are having a wonderful day<br /><br />Anyway, I'm an avid user of Vitafusion gummies, but it's good to take a look from others from time to time. These had similar attributes so I decided to try.<br /><br />These of course have a more solid color, but it's quite dull. They also have a light smell, almost like sugary cereal.<br /><br />As for the taste, they taste quite bland. It's a bit chalky as well as pasty. It's not the most appealing considering it's more chewy as well. I don't really like the taste, but I do like the benefits it gives. It hasn't made my stomache upset using it or anything.<br /><br />Though, I still comparably like my other gummies compared to these because of how they taste. Otherwise, they still perform decent. Also, wish they were a bit smaller in sizing. 3/5<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews. Thanks for 📚 😊",3,True

Handy and Comfortable Mask Holder,[],[],,3.9,8,227,"There are four black lanyards in this package. The loop is too small to get my head through. If I extend the pushbutton adjuster to the very end so that there is no loop (meaning the inclusion of the mask on the ends will create the loop), it is still too small. Also, I cannot get any of the clasps to open to attach the masks. I squeezed and squeezed and they barely budged. This is complete garbage and that is where I put this--in the trash. [SEP] I like these face mask lanyards. They are perfect to attach your face masks to. You attach one end to each side of your face masks. Then when you don’t use your face mask, like for example if you are taking a break to eat or you are at a restaurant, you can then take it down and just hang it around your neck using this lanyard. No more leaving it on the desk, putting it over your thigh or anything like that. So much easier and better. Especially when you are out for dinner I always struggle on what to do with it and this is the solution. Or when you are driving in your car and you just need to put it away for a bit, this is the solution. These can also be used as ear extenders / ear savers meaning  the face mask is attached to the lanyard and around the head, relieving the pressure on the ears.<br /><br />I like it because it makes it easy to put the face mask safely away but close by and you don’t have to put them down anywhere but instead they hang around your neck. In this pack you get 4 of them for just $16. These are definitely some of the more expensive ones out there and not sure why they are more expensive, because of the “design”?  I always keep some around since it is easy to misplace them and I just keep them on the various cloth masks I have in the car and so on so having a few of the on hand is very handy.

[SEP] This is a flexible device that works great at several occasional tasks...<br />* I use it to trim my beard down if I have let it go too long.  It helps my foil razor shave better to pre-trim with this trimmer if I go a week or more without a shave.  Then my foil razor will do the rest.<br />* Nose hair trimmer is quick and effective.  Just move it around in your nose and any stragglers are clipped off in a few seconds.<br />* Ear hair trimming is also quick and effective with the same attachment.  Just run it over any emerging ear hair you see and it will disappear quick and easy.<br />* I also use it occasionally between haircuts to trim the hair on the back of my neck and re-establish a clean hair line until my next haircut.<br /><br />It is small enough to leave around on your bathroom counter so that it is available if you notice a straggling nose or ear hair that needs to be addressed.<br /><br />It is very easy to swap out the attachments.<br /><br />It is easy to clean with the cleaning brush or running the attachment under the water -- I don't let the main unit get wet even though it claims some level of water resistance.<br /><br />Operation is super easy with just a simple on/off switch -- no complicated controls or speeds to fuss over.<br /><br />Charging is easy and the charge lasts plenty long -- wish they provided a USB wall charger so I didn't have to provide my own USB power source.

This nose and Ear Hair Trimmer can effectively and comfortably remove unwanted hair from your nose, ears, eyebrows, beard and face. Cuts evenly & cleanly through. It works perfectly fine. [SEP] I ordered this for my husband... and he loves it. It is light, comfortable to hold, and easy to charge and to change tips. It has all of the power and comfort (no pulled nose-hairs) of his previous favorite nose hair trimmer... and many added features.<br /><br />The other tip is a hair shaving attachment and there is also an included charge cable and a brush to help clean the tips. The USB charge cable does make it convenient as there are so many USB chargers around the house. Charging is relatively fast, but normal use as a nose hair trimmer does not take much of the battery time.<br /><br />Cleaning is easy, just remove the tip and rinse it... use the brush if there is anything stuck.<br /><br />The big pluses are the power, easy of use, the built-in battery with charging, and the cost. It is only about 3 dollars more than I paid for my favorite name-brand one from 5yrs ago. We recommend this... and we will post any updates if issues are encountered. [SEP] It works well and as advertised!<br /><br />Shipped quickly and it a well-padded envelope.<br /><br />Rechargeable and the battery lasts a long time. Great for travel use.<br /><br />What else can I say? It works as advertised and as you would expect.<br /><br />It's also water proof and cleans easily.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this! [SEP] This is a very nice nose and hair trimmer. It’s very easy to use and easy to clean comes with detachable heads one for the nose and one for the hair trimmer. I feel it’s very reasonably priced I like that it’s a combination of the two I would definitely recommend it is very reasonably priced [SEP] My dad was in need of a nose trimmer.

The trimmer is easy to use. It's awesome that it's not only a nose trimmer but can be used to trim other body parts. The best part is that this trimmer is so economical. [SEP] This trimmer does a good job on nose and ear hair. It works fast and I didn't feel any tugging or discomfort as I used it, although it did tickle a little as I used it in my nose. The heads come off with a twist and are easy to install. The hair trimmer has an adjustable guard so it can be used on multiple areas if you're so inclined.  Included are a USB charging cord and a cleaning brush. This is a good instrument at a good price. It works well and I recommend it.",3,True

I use this before weight training and light cardio. It mixes ok. [SEP] I have been doing a lot of physical work and I get sore from the heavy lifting, this helps. This also replenishes my endurance so I can do more work. The taste isn't bad and you will need to blend to get the best mix. I mix up a glass and take a nice sip throughout the working. [SEP] I drank this yesterday as directed on the side of the container and I seemed to have more energy than I thought I would at my evening tennis practice.  I had worked out pretty hard using the tennis ball machine earlier that day and was kind of dragging before tennis practice time.  I drank a full 8 oz of water with one scoopful of Gen One Nutrition-Intramino Intra-Workout BCAA Amino Acids Powder and I really did feel pretty good and played well at practice.  I wasn't even very tired when I got home and our coach had us doing conditioning drills.  The flavor was sort of coconut-like and sweet.  I wish it was not so sweet but it seems that most of these type powders just load up on sweetness.  It dissolved well in water and I didn't see any clumps.  I like this but will have to add some lemon juice to it next time to tone down the sweet. [SEP] My son loved the taste of this and the ingredients. He's used other BCAA products but they didn't taste as good to him. This was last year, at 17 he preferred a lot of sweet, but now he prefers something less fake tasting. And likes taking BCAA in capsule form [SEP] I'm big on BCAAs, but not so much as intra-workout or pre-workout supplments, as much as POST-workout.<br /><br />For those who promote use during workouts, the belief is that they reduce fatigue during exercise by limiting the entry of tryptophan (the stuff in your Thanksgiving turkey) into your brain. Your body uses tryptophan to make serotonin, which may contribute to fatigue (that's why you feel so sleepy after that big dinner).<br /><br />Honestly, there isn't that much research on the pre-workout or intra-workout effects of BCAAs. HOWEVER, they can help reduce muscle damage and soreness. It is generally accepted that BCAAs may relieve soreness, strain, and inflammation caused by exercise. BCAAs can also stimulate the synthesis of protein in your muscles, which promotes muscle-building. They also suppress the breakdown of muscle protein (and thus, muscle loss). Finally, it is understood that intense exercise can result in reduced immunity, which may be due to a decrease in the amino acid glutamine. Glutamine is a fuel for immune cells. Since BCAAs can be converted into glutamine in muscle, they can help promote the immune system.<br /><br />From my personal research, I have found that the consumption of BCAAs anywhere from 30 minutes to 3-4 hours POST workout can really have a discernible impact on recovery. And THAT is why and when we use them in my house. I drink them after a hard swim. My kids drink them after super-tough track, football, or swimming practices or tough workouts in the gym.<br /><br />So from the perspective of BCAAs, this product seems to have it together. BUT, the ""Blue Hawaiian"" flavor is.... strange and kind of disgusting. I thought it would be like the drink (rum, blue Curacao, pineapple juice, cream of coconut). The only thing I can really taste is the coconut, which pretty much tastes like chugging suntan oil after a tough workout. This really needed more citrus flavoring, as well, to balance the taste. The kids definitely do not like this one, and will only use it as a mix-in for smoothies, where the coconut flavor actually adds something. Mix it with a banana, some OJ, some pineapple juice or slices, and some ice, and it's tolerable. [SEP] My husband loves this... He actually likes the taste of the Razz Mojito over the Blue Hawaiian. He also likes the energy he gets before and during his workout. If he has a long workout, a few drinks of this and he is pushing himself through the hour and sometimes even a little over. Personally, I did not like the taste and it was a little too much energy for me... I preferred the Blue Hawaiian over the Razz Mojito though... but I am a fan of coconut. [SEP] The Gen One powder has excellent ingredients that include the BCAA amino acids and Glutamine.  I think these help energize me for exercise and catalyze recovery.  I use about half the scoop in a glass or bottle of water and find that to be sufficient.  Even if not working out, I will add it to my water in the morning or afternoon.  I think this is a beneficial powder.  It dissolves nicely.<br /><br />The Blue Hawaiian flavor is not very appealing to me.  I think I prefer the natural fruity flavors.  I honestly almost gag on this if I put a full scoop in. I would avoid it. [SEP] I put this in my post-workout smoothie along with other ingredients. Obviously the other flavors camouflage any taste that this has but I have sampled it alone and it's not bad at all. It's a great source of branched chain amino acids and I've not experienced any indigestion or stomach upset since I've started using this product. [SEP] Intramino is a good balance of aminos with a noticeable effect during my workouts. Mixes well with water however I do not like the blue coconut flavor. It leaves a bad aftertaste and a dry mouth. [SEP] My husband is a big fan of Amino Acids/BCAA and since he was running low on his supply, I thought we'd try something different. Personally, I'm not a fan of supplements to begin with, other than the occasional protein shake, so this was a no go for me (plus it gave me some tummy problems, perhaps because I'm not used to it). Hubs is satisfied with it, however, and is happily going through the rest of this tub.<br /><br />1 star deduction because we both found the flavor description of ""Blue Hawaiian"" to be somewhat misleading. I mean, to be fair, what exactly is the taste of Blue Hawaiian?? We kind of expected something along the lines of the Berry Blue Hawaiian Punch (not that either of us have had that since we were children but still, blue fruit punch is kind of what we were thinking). What we got was just a coconut flavored beverage, which isn't bad, but completely threw us for a loop. It would make much more sense to simply label this as ""coconut flavored"".",3,True

[SEP] Review for: ULTRA CLARITY Eyeglass Lens Cleaning Wipes 30-Pack, Moist Towelettes, Glasses, Phone & Electronic Screens, Optic Surfaces, Ideal Even on Coated Surfaces, Silicone-Free, Safe Professional Grade Formula<br /><br />I have tried a lot of different wipes and these do a good job if you have a microfiber cloth to finish drying the screen or lens with. I have found that few wipes can really do the job without being wiped to eliminate smears. These are very handy to have around, particularly when traveling or in the car where you don’t have a spray bottle of cleaner. [SEP] These turned out to be very useful. I normally use the spray bottle. What's nice about the wipes is that they are just slightly moist. You clean your glasses with these wipes, and there is no need to dry them afterwards. Just absolutely perfect.  You can put a couple of these in your handbag. Men can put a couple in their pocket. [SEP] i cook everyday so sometimes my glasses is oily after cooking but this wipe cleans it without leaving any oil mark/residue. Very happy with the wipe and will get more when i used it all. THANKS [SEP] These moist towelettes are great to have when you are away from home.  I think these moistened wipes do a better job of cleaning my glasses than microfiber cloth that seems to swirl around smears and oils.  These moistened wipes remove fingerprints, smudges, lint, and grease spatters from cooking.  The wipes leave my glasses pristine!  They are sufficient for cleaning two pairs of glasses and a phone screen before they dry out.  I will likely order these again to have on hand when my supply runs out.  I will stash some in our camping trailer and in our luggage for when we travel. [SEP] This lens wipes work extremely well. Each one is decently wet. The sheet is also large, so you can easily wipe 2-4 glasses with one packet. I wish the packaging was eco-friendly, but other than that, I don’t have any complaints. It doesn’t smear stuff around. It leaves a few droplets on your lenses, but it dries perfectly. [SEP] Do not clean well.  Leaves film on lens.  Will not order again [SEP] These individually packed glasses cleaning wipes are well suited for use in the car or travel. They do an excellent job of cleaning the lenses without leaving any residual.

They have textured palm and finger surface and sort of ruffle on the edge, very cute. They fit well and do not come off even when are not tight on the wrist. They are waterproof but after using my palms and fingers were covered in powdery and slightly grainy white substance. It washes off easily, and I guess it's prevalent in rubber gloves. This was the only drawback that I noticed while using them. They are sturdy and protect from hot water. They definitely have many uses in them. Scrub your house in style! [SEP] I think these latex-free gloves are every bit as good as name brand latex gloves. They are also prettier with the lace imprint going around the bottom of the gloves. I have worn regular latex gloves a lot, especially when making my hand made soaps but I will be wearing these from now on. I don't think I'm allergic to latex but I used to get some horrible zits after going to the dentist so maybe I am. These latex-free gloves feel flexible yet seem durable to last a good while. You get 4 pairs in this pack. [SEP] These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs.

The 2 Blue Gloves have a Flocked furry coating inside and feel really nice on a Cold day.<br />  These gloves are Latex-Free too. I think these are well worth referring to anyone in need.<br />  Enjoy! [SEP] I wasn't sure initially if these were more the latex like gloves that my mother introduced me to years ago for dishes or if they were more a thicker, industrial type. This is more like the light house cleaning type. They are a good quality product… but a slightly better quality. Great for gardening, dishwashing, and cleaning. We have been using another brand of reusable gloves to clean for years and years… they were a staple until I discovered this. We like having gloves to protect our hands from the variety of harsh chemicals we use to clean… especially when we clean our toilets or drains. [SEP] I would have given this a 5 star review if the first pair of lined blue gloves I opened had opposing thumbs.  What was in the package were 2 gloves, both for the right hand.  The second pair of lined blue gloves I opened was correct with a glove for each hand.  I've attached a picture of the first pair along with the second pair for comparison.  The other 2 pairs of gloves are unlined and are white with pink fingertips.  These gloves are sized as medium and fit my hands well.  I would consider my hands small so I was a bit surprised by the fit.  I like that these gloves come individually packaged so there's no need to open them until needed.  I like the rich blue color of the lined gloves.  The palms of the gloves are embossed which assists in gripping.  I really didn't notice it on the blue gloves but this embossing stands out on the white gloves.  It's fairly easy to feel items being handled through the gloves.  I like how these protect my hands and am rating at 4 stars. [SEP] Finally, a pair of cleaning gloves that for my small hands!! These gloves come in different sizes, so I chose the medium and they are perfect.  It's so nice to have a snug fit.  The gloves themselves are a heavier vinyl and shouldn't get punctured easily.  The finger tips are textured for better gripping and at the opening, the gloves have a scalloped edge with lace detail embossing for a more feminine look.<br />Should protect my hands nicely.  Very pleased with this product. [SEP] These gloves in a medium fit me as expected. I am an average-sized woman (5’ 4 ½”) with average-sized hands. The large fit is a bit loose for me, although wearable for jobs that don’t require manual dexterity, and it will be snug on my husband. Two pair of these gloves do have flocking and two pair are unlined.<br /><br />I use these gloves for crafting when I’m doing glass etching, dyeing, etc., where I need to protect my hands. I also use them for cleaning jobs where I use toxic chemicals. With some tasks, I was using two layers of disposable nitrile gloves, but these are a much better and sturdier solution. Not to mention reusable. I was looking for utilitarian gloves for tasks like this where I really need to protect my hands, wrists, and forearms. These have nice long sleeves, so they will protect more of my clothing and skin. Very pleased with these gloves.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

[SEP] Because I have arthritis which causes lots of aches and pains and turmeric is a potentiator to one of my organic supplements I take.  I have tried many different brands of turmeric, some plain and some with bioperine.  When I saw this product, I realized it also contained ginger extract along with the turmeric and bioperine so I was excited to try this.  Each capsule contains 500mg organic turmeric, 100mcg organic ginger extract, 50mcg turmeric 95% curcuminoids and 5mg bioperine.  The best part, for me, was the fact that only one capsule equals a daily dose!  I have tried some that required you to take up to 3 capsules to be considered a daily dose.  The capsule is large but it is easy to swallow.  If you leave it in your mouth too long you can sort of taste the spicy pepper and/or ginger but it does not linger.  I've been out of this for a while now and need to order some more as I can feel a difference when I don't take my daily dose of turmeric (seems like I've been reaching for some nsaids a bit too often lately).<br /><br />The description of this product is as follows:<br />""THE ANTIOXIDANT AID – Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, may help reduce and neutralize free radicals as a powerful antioxidant.

I was dubious, but I tried it. That was my introduction to how much turmeric can knock down aches and pains. It worked better than Tylenol and hydrocodone. And it had a lot fewer side effects.<br /><br />Since then, turmeric has been one of my go-to supplements for pain relief and it has helped me to fight inflammation for the several years. I’m expecting this brand to perform as better than the others that I’ve used since it’s a purified extract of the operational ingredient, and I will come back and amend this review if it doesn’t.<br /><br />As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart.

Since I started taking this biotin two months ago exactly, my hair feels fuller, it's shiny, and I don't see much shedding. I think it has grown an inch in two months, which is normal growth, but from the pictures, it does seem a lot longer (they're in reverse chronological order, taken at one-month intervals).  My nails haven't grown longer and break about the same as before, so I don't see any improvement there. My skin has been fine.  I drink plenty of water and aside from a couple of pimples, it doesn't seem to break out any more than usual. I'm going to keep taking it until I run out but honestly, I don't know if this is really helping.  It might not be doing much because perhaps I was not biotin-deficient to begin with. I don't mind taking it in water and this two-pack was a great deal, plus I got the free bottle from the manufacturer, so it's affordable and definitely worth a shot. [SEP] I have used pure Biotin long enough to know the side effects. This tastes great and doesn't require that you take it with food, which makes me question how much Biotin are you really getting.  As much as I hate having to eat food when taking pure Biotin, I'd rather stick with the real stuff. [SEP] I already take too many pills and capsules, nice i have a liquid I can add to my water cup. [SEP] Have tried many products that say they do this and that and this is the first one that actually does what it says...I will be a lifetime buyer [SEP] I have been using this product for over a year now with great success. In my most recent shipment, the dropper was broken at the tip. Unfortunately, this renders the entire bottle useless as the broken piece is likely in the bottle. I do not want to take the chance of swallowing the glass. Such a shame to have to throw out a brand new bottle. [SEP] The taste was good and was easy to swallow. I had to stop the drops. I broke out severely. I don’t recommend if you have sensitive skin like mine. It caused my acne to flare up.

The price is somewhat high for the amount you get, but it seems to work. Overall it's ok but I still prefer Airborne, which is a better value. [SEP] With the Covid 19 pandemic, flu season and cold weather, I've been looking for ways to bolster my health.  Zinc is supposed to be just one of the ways to help the immune system and these ImmunoSwift lozenges are an easy way for me to increase my Zinc intake. They dissolve quickly and have a minty taste. It is important to me that these are vegan and sugar free.  I've been taking them when my throat is itchy and I feel a bit under the weather.  I haven't had a sudden burst of health, but I am happy to continue taking them to keep myself at my current healthy level. [SEP] I like using zinc to help ward off colds and flus.  I find that the regular lozenges that are like hard candy are difficult for me…I always end up chewing on them, which is not the way to get the full benefit from them.  These lozenges are the quick dissolving powdery variety (kind of like an antacid).  It’s much quicker and easier to dissolve them on my tongue without swallowing them whole.  The taste is a very pleasant minty taste, which also helps.<br /><br />The ImmunoSwift tablets only have 8 mg of zinc per table vs the 11 mg in my usual variety, and are priced higher.  The L-Carnosine in the ingredient list is supposed to also enhance the effect of the zinc, so that may be reflected in the higher price.  If you’d like to try a zinc supplement and want something that dissolves quickly and easily, this is definitely worth a try. [SEP] As we are getting close to cold and flu season, we like to keep extra lozenges on hand for sore throats.<br />These zinc ones are great! They have a good flavor and dissolve easily in your mouth. They aren't sticky like some lozenges, but more chalky. They really do work for a sore throat. Plus, you are getting zinc in your system to help with your overall immune health. They are on the expensive side for such a small amount of lozenges. Other than the cost, this is a great item to keep on hand. [SEP] I haven't tried this zinc pills and I don't think I will. The reason is the way it is packaged, they don't have any information on the pills, no name, no date of expiration or anything... pretty scary. [SEP] Works pretty good. [SEP] I tried the oral product for canker soars from this company and they were great so I thought I'd give these a try too.  So far so good!  With everything going on this year you can't be too careful and they have all the key immunity boosters I was looking for. [SEP] Pros:<br />+  Tastes minty & refreshing.<br />+  Dissolves easily in your mouth.<br />+  Safe and good quality product.  According to their website:<br />  ""Our branded, clinically-supported zinc ingredient has been exclusively made by the same Japanese<br />  pharmaceutical company for over 30 years.""<br />  ""ImmunoSwift contains a top quality Japanese active ingredient that supports your immune system so<br />  that you can get back to living your best.""<br />  ""Made in the USA""<br />+  I feel healthier and better protected after taking this lozenge.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-  I definitely hope that this company continues to manufacture this high quality product, but I wish the price was a little more consumer friendly. [SEP] I like these a lot. Gives me a nice boost when needed from my throat issues. Nice minty lifesaver flavor. I must say these are more like a mint than a lozenge. I find myself chewing them way too soon, no big deal because I am getting my Zinc, but I wish they had a longer lasting throat soothing effect from a lozenge. [SEP] I would like a larger package.

"Omega 3-6-9 Gummies + DHA, Supports Brain, Joint, Heart, Eyes and Immune System Function for Men & Women - Vegan, No Fish, Gluten-Free",[],[],,3.8,33,3865,"Our pediatrician recommended that our children take Omega 3 supplements.  We have tried several different brands, and the kids say these have the BEST taste.  They say they taste like candy.  It is much easier to get them to take these since they love the taste. [SEP] My kids focus and mood are much improved when they take Omega 3s. (We are vegetarian and find these supplements beneficial). These are vegan, no fish oil and no heavy metals, especially important for kids. The serving is supposed to be 3 a day, and at that dose these are pretty expensive and honestly with their flavor it's hard to stomach eating that many. Fortunately, we find one a day is plenty. They taste kind of lemony, or kind of orangey, and also like algae. The algae smell and flavor is there, and it's not entirely pleasant. While my kids prefer gummies to tablets, these are not their favorite. They'll eat them, but they aren't excited about them. That said, these are pretty much the same as every other Omega 3 gummy on the market, we have yet to find one that tastes good.... so maybe that's just the nature of Omega 3s. [SEP] These gummy vitamins are a tasty treat. They taste like lemon curd - very intensely citrusy and very sticky (I don’t mind this but I know some people hate that). I personally think they taste great and don’t get much of a fishy/oil taste coming through. I also haven’t experienced any weird aftertastes. So, no complaints there.<br /><br />I am confused about the serving size because the back of the bottle (as shown in the product pictures too) says the serving size is 3 gummies, but also says that there are 30 servings in the bottle… but there are only 60 gummies. I think this may be a typo and the serving size should be 2 gummies (the other product picture also talks about improving your health with two gummies a day) but that seems like a pretty important thing to get right on the packaging for a supplement.<br /><br />Given the serving size issue and the relatively high price, I have taken off one star. [SEP] These gummies have a slightly unpleasant odor, by it does not cast over into the taste. The gummies are packed two flavors per container and three gummies are the daily dose. The flavors are citrus, but quite artificial and a bit harsh. The ingredients are listed on the label, but not country of manufacture. The listed 800 number only got me to a sales pitch for other offers. The idea is great, but the lack of information is an issue. [SEP] I like to take this type of vitamin for all of the health benefits. This is the first time I’ve tried a gummy form and I now prefer it much more than a pill. The pill sometimes left a nasty after taste where these do not. These aren’t the best tasting gummies I’ve ever tried but they’re not bad. A little bitter . A serving size is 3 but I took only 2 so that the bottle would last a full month. I wish they’d add a few more to the bottle so that they could last the whole month. Overall not a  bad price for these and I’d purchase again! [SEP] These are ok. Not the best tasting but they’re ok. These are chewables. A serving size is 3 gummies, so this is a 20 day supply. I would pass on these next time. [SEP] I need dha in my diet a few times a week and these sweet gummies have been an easy way to do that. Nothing bad to report. [SEP] I was thrilled to find this gummy supplement on Amazon last week, especially because the price was awesome and it contains Omega 3s, 6s, and 9s. I looked at a lot of different products, being careful to weed out the ones with labels stating they are made with fish oil powder (because ""fish burps"" are so unpleasant). My kiddo has high cholesterol, and I read many different reviews of this product that said it tastes great, so I had high hopes. However, I can only assume other reviewers must have received a different product than what I got, because these things taste just disgusting. Disclaimer: This was my first experience with an Omega-3 gummy supplement; maybe they all taste this bad, or worse? Anyway, reviews that say these gummies taste like ""lemon curd"" or ""candy"" are INCREDIBLY misleading, at best. The worst lemon curd or candy I've ever tasted was tons better-tasting than this stuff. These gummies taste, well, like fish oil, which is precisely what I was trying to avoid by purchasing a gummy supplement.<br /><br />I'd like to say that these are a good value for the money, but I can't even do that because there's no way I can even chew these without wanting to retch - much less give them to my teenage daughter - and they aren't eligible for return (I'll be more careful to check that little detail on future purchases). So even though the price was right, I still lost money - meaning they weren't a good value for me personally. I was looking forward to seeing if these would help to lower cholesterol/triglycerides, and I hope they do (but I won't be finding out for myself). Best of luck to anyone else who purchases these! [SEP] Review Result:<br />[Buy Today, Get it Someday, or Skip Past Any day]<br />Buy Today, the ol' Omega fatty acids.  These are a well known and sought health aid.  The best way to eat all supplements in my book is gummies.  I hate pills.  These taste good and aid my health.  This is easy recommendation.  I'm glad I have these. [SEP] Finally found a way to get omega 3 with no fishy flavor or that burp you get with other pills that is horrible. This taste very nice and are easy to take. 3 gummys a day and you'll be getting all the vitamins you need. I always have my omega low because I don't eat fish and this is a very good supplement to replace that. In my last CBC  the doctor told me that my omega when up and I'm happy with that. I finish the first container and I will buy more of this to keep my system ready.",3,True

Hydration Supplement with Sodium, Potassium, No Caffeine, 500 mg Electrolytes, 15 Servings, Reduce Muscle Cramps, Increase Energy & Endurance (22 oz, Mandarin)",[],[],,4.2,24,723,"This is just an average hydration supplement in my eyes. First of it comes at 160 calories for one serving, which I think is rather high. Most energy workout boosters come at like 50 calories or less but this one has quite a bit of sugar in it. It does have a good amount of electrolytes so that is nice, you can basically make your own quick version of Gatorade of sorts. Again a lot of calories though. The electrolytes are mostly sodium and potassium, both important for muscle function and many other functions inside the human body.<br /><br />I tend to dilute it more than instructed since it is pretty sweet. The taste is not bad but among the energy boosters I have tried this is not my favorite, it is ok. I have had no negative reactions to this but didn't really feel any energy boosting effects from this at all since they do claim some energy boosting effects calling it an energy blend.<br /><br />All in all this is just ok. You do get a massive amount for the $20 though so you can make a lot of home made ""Gatorade"" with this really. I won't reorder this though. [SEP] I would love to give this higher stars but my body says 1.<br />This powder has messed my with GI Tract and I spend more time in the bathroom because of it.<br />Even at a half dose I have issues.<br /><br />Beyond that - the flavor is very sweet but not bad.<br />When mixing with a blender bottle it takes awhile longer than I would expect but does eventually all get blended together.<br />When drinking it feels a little thick but not bad.<br />As far as results go.<br />With a half dose my body felt more hydrated but not energized. My head actually felt fuzzy - it was harder to concentrate.<br />With a full dose and a heavy exercise- my results were slightly better as far as my workout stats on my Apple Watch but not by much - not like the type of results I see when using a preworkout.<br />My muscles didn’t seem to feel more hydrated<br />I got this package in March 2020 and it doesn’t expire until 2022 so it lasts awhile.<br /><br />** Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review.<br />I hope the information that I've provided helps to make your decision a little easier.<br />If you found this review helpful, please click the ‘Helpful’ button below. [SEP] Eeasy to use. Tastes good and works great. Use it daily at work [SEP] Has a nice taste whether you drink it alone mixed with water or mixed into a smoothie.  I find it refreshing to drink as you are working out but I would say that it refreshes me just as much as a regular BCAA would. BCAA causes me to urinate a bit more (losing workout groove) and this one doesn't make me go to the bathroom as much.  There is lots of hydration which means that my muscles aren't as sore at the end of a workout -- compared with if I just drank water. [SEP] I am not an athlete, but I use a lot of hydration drinks. I don't like the taste of some of them because to me, they have an underlying flavor that I think is kind of gross! This is one of the good ones, it dissolved very quickly into water just stirring with a spoon and it tastes a lot like lemonade. I've been using a full scoop in a 64 ounce water bottle with some powdered ice, I think it's delicious! [SEP] It reminded me a lot of Crystal Lite. It tastes very thin for lack of a better terminology. I am still a Gatorade powder fan. It has some good ingredients but lacks in flavor and consistency. [SEP] Doesn't dissolve well in cold water, they recommend using warm or at the very least room temperature water which after a workout is not what I want. I've tried pre-dissolving and then chilling the drink but it separates. The flavor isn't all that great and I prefer to drink my water not chew it. I do like that there is no caffeine, I'm overly sensitive to caffeine and can not handle taking caffeine in after about 10 a.m. if I want to sleep before 10 p.m. I do feel more hydrated after drinking this but that could just be all the water I have to drink after this to get the taste out of my mouth. [SEP] works well for pre workout and intra workout hydration and energy. id recommend it!",3,True
Non-Dairy MCT Oil Creamer by Live Relentless Nutrition — Keto MCT Coffee Creamer Derived from 100% Coconut Oil in Single Use Packets,[],[],,3.2,41,669,"Initially the vanilla flavor is a little jarring and astringent. Maybe tastes a bit on the phony side. But I got used to it and now it's nice to have little sweetness in my coffee. The portion in each of these pouches is perfect. And each one has 7g of MCT's in it. 80 calories, 7 g fat, 4 g carbs and 4 g sugar alcohols which cancel the carbs out. Must be working because I haven't got put of ketosis after using (keto test strip w/urine)  and have lost 8 lbs. That's rad!! [SEP] when I make a mug of coffee, if I don't use powdered MCT oil, then I use this handy dandy convenient single serve MCT oil. I still get my kick for my coffee. It is an oil, and it doesn't emulsify that easily, but I just stir and drink and ignore any oil sitting on the top of my coffee. [SEP] It's just like pouring a little oil into your coffee.  It floats on the top in circles of oil.  This has a little bit of creamer effect but not much and I think it's awfully expensive.  As of this review one box of these non-dairy MCT Oil Creamers costs $27.00.  I'm not on a ketogenic diet, but if I was I think I'd buy a bottle of MCT oil and add it and just drink my coffee black.  It's o.k. but nothing to write home about. [SEP] I did like this and its about 1 dollar a serving which is decent. There are other brands however that you can get a whole container with more then 30 scoops for the same or less money.<br />These are easy to carry with you however if you travel or need to take it with you and dont want to carry a large container [SEP] French Vanilla is my favorite for coffee creamers, so making the MCT Oil with this taste is nice. I have to say that I can taste more Lecithin flavor than Coconut Oil, which I use daily, but I still like it because I love the good energy from it. Just like many things for me when it comes to being healthy; if I don’t initially like it, but I love what it does for me, I tend to get used to it and eventually end up loving it.<br />  It adds another dollar to your morning coffee but, if you have it at home, it’s actually saving multiple dollars if you’d gone to a coffee joint. Perfect! [SEP] Oh my. Not a good look OR flavor. Occasionally I put a teaspoon of pure solid coconut oil in my coffee (it liquefies instantly) and though I can see a tiny amount of oil on the surface it doesn't bother me; it's hardly noticeable, It tastes really good and I think it's healthy. But this leaves a regular oil slick on the surface of your coffee and it just tastes like some sort of unidentifiable oil. They should have called this ""creamer"" the Valdez Solution; Save the environment, drink the oil slick one cup at a time! I do not recommend this. [SEP] I love using MCT oil in my coffee, and I loved the idea of this creamer.  I love it even more since it is flavored!  It is easy to use.  I did have some issues with blending at times, but I just use a drink mixer and it is perfect. [SEP] Purchased this for travel .. to replace packing MCT oil, jar of Ghee, sweetener, etc.  I’m happy with the product. Obviously you pay for the packaging and convenience but it’s well worth the price to have this option when traveling [SEP] This was my first foray into a keto creamer and I like it pretty well.  I was expecting something that actually seemed like creamer, but this really just feels more like putting oil in your coffee at first.  I have found with repeated uses, however, that it does accomplish what creamer does to a degree.  It makes the coffee a little smoother and less pungent.  It also adds a bit of sweetness, and I'm grateful it's not overly sweet.  One packet seems about as sweet as perhaps a half packet of stevia.  The french vanilla flavor I got is also pleasant.  Ultimately you won't mistake this for heavy cream in your coffee, but it's a pretty decent substitute if you want a non-dairy option that's good for keto. [SEP] I use MCT oil in my coffee so I thought that a packable MCT creamer would be wonderful for traveling. WRONG, WRONG, WRONG.  This concoction has an odor to it that completely ruins the coffee !  It also has stevia in it. If I had wanted to add a sweetener, I could easily have used a packet myself!",3,True

"Body Brush with Two Sides Design for Wet or Dry Brushing - HOUSAILEI Back Scrubber for Shower Features Soft and Stiff Bristles to Help Exfoliate and Scrub the Skin Pretty Well,Sturdy Bath Brush",[],[],,3.8,31,210,"I tried several brushes over the last several months and love the KOZIS Wooden Bath Brush (Amazon item # B08HR2GBHC) the best. However, this one is very good too.<br /><br />The brush head side is ample for good coverage. The bristles are of medium softness. The massaging side is not useful to me because I have no desire to use that. In fact, I do not even understand why anyone would use that. <br /><br />The brush is hefty and is one solid piece, which is fabulous as the head cannot fall off the handle like some other brushes I tried previously. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower. In addition, a self-stick hook is supplied if needed but I did not use it.<br /><br />Besides the massaging brush head that I find useless, the only negative to me is that the brush handle is about two inches shorter than I would like. Many brushes have a longer handle and a longer handle is best when trying to reach my back. Nevertheless, this is still very functional and it is very well made.<br /><br />Overall, I like this brush even though it comes in second to the KOZIS I love. The current price of $11.99 is about right for a two-sided wooden brush. [SEP] I’ve used this for a month now. The wood has stayed fine in my shower with no peeling or warping. No bristles have fallen out. My problem is that the bristles are SUPER HARD AND SCRATCHY! Like, serious ouchie. And they haven’t softened with a month of daily use. Also, the plastic side is worthless. And that’s the only part that has discolored. I can’t really recommend, so order with caution! [SEP] This brush has a long enough handle to reach my back easily. I like that it has a hole in the handle with a rope so that I can hang it. The sticky hook that comes with the brush actually does a good job of sticking to the tile in my shower.<br /><br />I love the side of the brush that has regular bristles. The other side has some knobby things that I don’t care for. The bristle side is not only great for washing my back but also for dealing with an itch at other times.<br /><br />The brush comes in a box and has a cellophane wrap around it, making it suitable to gift wrap. [SEP] The soft bristle brush on this shower brush is very effective, and works as expected. The wooden handle is crafted nicely, with no sharp edges or 'thorns' (small splintery aspects). In general, with manufactured well with no unexpected surprises.<br />The surprise comes from the other brush side.  From the product details: ""One side is very soft and holds soap well, and the other side of the natural bristles is perfect for a deep scrub,especially in the exfoliation."" Well, the natural bristles are somewhat stiff, but actually work well with scrubbing the back. Especially compared to the reverse side. This is supposed to be the softer bristle side. Instead of bristles, there's a widely spaced pattern of nubs (plastic, nylon, silicone?) that are not natural bristles. These nubs are attached to a flexible base, so they bend with contact and pressure. The nubs are not soft, by any definition. As mentioned, the base is flexible, and allows these nubs to rub along the skin.<br />I found this shower brush to be incongruent with the product details description.<br />If the hard nub side was not on a flexible base, it could serve as a decent back scratcher. As is, i feel it's ineffective and a design fail.<br />Another issue: the pictures show an exaggerated view of the size of the brush.<br />So, one side, with natural bristles, is an effective, functional shower brush. The other side is a fail. Based on these impressions and consideration, this shower brush earns a 3.25 star rating, and a cautious recommendation. [SEP] a nice length brush. I been using it to scrub away dead skin cells.  it does it job well. the brushes are medium to hard bristles, depending on how sensitive your skin is.<br />depending on your needs, this brush is for you. [SEP] Very well made, the bristles are attached tightly. There's also a good amount of firmness on the bristle so it scrubs well. Overall I'm happy it's worth the purchase price. Thank you Amazon Vine. [SEP] You can use this wet or dry. I prefer dry. I use the soft bristle side on my arms and legs and back to help relieve my stress and promote blood circulation. The rubber side I use to massage and press into sore muscle spots. Effective and simple. Wooden handle is nice, no splinters. [SEP] I use this is the shower in place of a loofah or washcloth and it works great. Gently exfoliating and feels fantastic. So far, it's holding up well and I've been using it for a few months. Would recommend! [SEP] #1 Don't believe what you think you see.  The first two photos on the web page make the scrubber head look ridiculously large, it isn't.  It's a normal sized brush head, same as the other brush I use.  The specifications say that the brush is 15"" long, it isn't.  It's more like 13 3/4"".  It also talks about bristles on both nice, not true.  I'm dinging it one star for the misinformation.  The brush itself is great.  Two sides, one with bristles, one with flexible rubber type protrusions.  The bristles are fairly stiff, which I like for scrubbing in the shower.  The other side feels good dry.  I use it on my lower back kind of like a massager.  Don't pay a lot of attention to the web page info.  It's a very nice shower brush and I recommend it despite the misinformation.

Elderberry Gummies with Zinc Vitamin C,[],[],,4.1,29,2137,"These are very good elderberry gummies. These deliver 100 mg elderberry/2gummies, has 90 mg of vitamin C and 7.5 mg of zinc citrate. Taking two of these is a good way to start the day by giving your immune system a jump start against cold and flu viruses. I've been trying to accumulate a lot elderberry supplements because elderberry is a very powerful anti-viral. The gummies taste very good - sweet and tart and the texture is good.  These are a great preventative if taken every day. [SEP] These have a great taste but after about 20-30 minutes I have the nasties belches. Can't say if they are working but I am still taking them. [SEP] These gummies taste good, but they deliver fairly low doses of Vitamin C, Zinc and Elderberry. I would recommend something more powerful when you really want to boost your immunity, but these could be good to take between other, stronger supplements. Or they could be good for children.<br /><br />They are tasty and easy to chew. [SEP] Well they're not sour, they're actually a bit sweet.  Given the ingredients that shouldn't be a surprise though.<br />Comparing the amounts of zinc, elderberry and vitamin C to a tablet form of supplement I have, the zinc and C are higher concentrations, but elderberry is lower and I don't know why they have to add additional artificial flavoring of it.<br />If you have trouble with capsules and tablets then this may be an okay option for you. [SEP] Here’s a fairly simple elderberry gummy with 100 milligrams of elderberry with added sugar and artificial elderberry flavor.  In addition, the gummies contain a minimal amount of vitamin C and zinc to help reduce the period of infection of a respiratory infection.<br /><br />A serving of this gummy, two pieces, may be attractive to children encouraging them to take the supplement.  It is not particularly sweet and has little flavor.  However, it's easy to administer (no spoons or liquids) and easy to consume. [SEP] I’ve taken elderberry for yearS. I thought I’d try something different with it including zinc & vitamin C. After receiving it I was hesitant to take them as they include artificial elderberry flavor. I have never seen an elderberry gummy with artificial anything in it. To be quite frank, after this bottle is empty I will not be getting more. [SEP] More and more Im finding myself buying vitamin gummies! I love candy, but Im not eating ground up cow bones and hooves. No seriously. Thats what gelatin is. Look it up. NASTY! So Ive recently discovered gummies, because the better ones (like these) are gelatin free. So i get a piece of candy, I get vitamins (in this case Vitamin C and Zinc) and I get a healthy candy snack.<br />Taste wise, these are a 5 out of 5. These are great tasting gummies.<br /><br />These are NOT organic. NOT NON-GMO (EXTREMELY important) and they DO have sugar. Both of which make these not as good a value as others on here that ARE NON-gmo and organic. Honestly, as a person striving to be 100% GMO free, (Im 95% there) I wish I had spotted the lack of organic labeling prior to the purchase as I wouldn't have got them. I know what is in GMO. I own an organic farm. Do some research. Make sure the website isn't sponsored or owned by the giant parent company or you'll only get ""their side"" and of course they are going to sugar coat it; (pun intended) Other than that they are pretty good, and we all need extra zinc and Vitamin C in these 2021 times.<br /><br />If you found this review helpful please click the HELPFUL review button! It makes me smile. [SEP] You get a 30 day supply (60 gummies at 2 per serving) in this bottle.  Currently, at the time of this review, it is $12.99 and there is a coupon for a BOGO offer so 2 bottles for $12.99.  Typically, a 30 day supply of gummies like this from my local chain pharmacy (their generic brand) is $16.99 when BOGO is going on.<br /><br />These are easy to chew and didn't get stuck in my teeth.  Decent taste and have the same listed amount of ingredients and percentages of what you are intaking as my normal daily that I take. [SEP] What's not to like about gummies? They are like candy, right? Except that they are EXPENSIVE so you want them to be more than candy. unfortunately, these have really low amounts of supplements in them. I'm not sure there is enough here to do you any good at all. Since the recommended dosage is 2, this is a 30 day supply. [SEP] Got these for an elderly family member who has GI issues. Was pleasantly surprised at how good they taste and easy it was for them to swallow without feeling their throat irritate etc.<br />Decided to get myself some and I like that it taste great. I tend to find other gummies have the little grainy sugar feeling but these do not!",3,True
"Vitamin C Facial Skincare Set with Toner and Moisturizing Serum - Organic, Holistic, Healthy",[],[],,4.6,13,1581,"This is a perfect little set to become familiar with this ethical and organic brand.<br />It's even made in small batches, in order to ensure that you get a fresh product that hasn't been sitting around in some warehouse forever.<br />The toner is refreshing, and preps your skin for the vitamin C serum. Both have a pleasing fragrance, especially the serum which is citrusy.<br />Wonderful natural ingredients like berries and aloe vera.<br />Afterwards, skin feels clean and not bogged down by chemicals. It even helped calm down a rosacea flare up.<br />Skin care you can feel good about, in every way. [SEP] This is a nice overall skincare set with the serum being the better half of it for many reasons.<br /><br />I'll start with the scent. I really, really like the scent of the serum. It's a lemon type of smell that works well for me. It absorbs pretty well and is drawn in for the most part by the accompanying toner.<br /><br />The toner isn't my favorite. It doesn't absorb very well on my skin and I find that my face is shiny about 2-3 hours after applying. I thought at first maybe the serum was the contributing factor, but found that when I used just the toner there was no difference. However, with just using the serum, I did not have the same issue.<br /><br />All said though, there are some great ingredients in both of these products. I think that other than the greasy feeling, I like what it did for my skin tone and consistency. I would recommend it with reservation. [SEP] From the female of the family. I like this two-bottle facial skin toner and healing set. It’s “made from earth” organic, holistic and healthy. I use it on my face and neck and rub any excess into the backs of my hands. There’s a bonus as well, a delicious vanilla lip balm I really enjoy.<br /><br />While the toner features organic apple cider, you’ll be pleased to know, there’s virtually no odor and no sting to it. In fact, it also contains apple juice, tea tree oil, willow bark, and more.<br /><br />Once done with that, I put a few drops of the serum to my fingertips and then apply to my skin, patting it here and there before gently massaging it in. In addition to healing Vitamin C, I get aloe vera, rose hip, cranberry, raspberry, blueberry, ginger, bilberry, orange, lemon and other essential oils.<br /><br />There’s no fragrance added, but the serum smells fresh simply because of the organic natural ingredients. Love it!<br /><br />This set is not inexpensive, but then, our precious faces are worth it, right ladies? [SEP] The facial skincare set also sent me a lip balm as a gift. To my surprise, the toner and serum smell quite special, totally different from all skincare products I've used before. I can feel this kind of unique fragrance is from nature. It's like applying some juice and apple cider vinegar on my face. My acne gets better today perhaps because I also used the aloe grown in my garden yesterday. Serum made from nature often works efficiently for me.<br /><br />It reminds me of a Chinese middle-aged lady I met a couple of years ago. She made skincare serum with fermented fruits by herself. Her skin looked smooth and glowing, so I should also try these real natural things. [SEP] Toner and serum is refreshing after a facial cleansing. Toner tighten pores while the serum moisturizes. Smells a little medicinal but overall product is good.",3,True
"Sound Machine with Night Light, White Noise Machine for Sleeping Adults Baby Kids, 16 Soothing Sounds for Sleeping, Powered by USB, White Noise Maker for Bedroom Home White",[],[],,4.5,42,1773,"There are some good things and less good about this, but the review comes with the caveat that sleep preferences are so individual that it's tough to say how much one's view should hold for someone else. But that said:<br /><br />1) Size:  the footprint is nice. It doesn't take up a lot of space; I'd call it medium size maybe leaning toward small. I've definitely seen many that were bigger, so you don't need a lot of space to use this<br /><br />2) lighting:  I'd prefer a dimmer light personally, thought the breath function and colors are nice. If you have this right near the bed, it's a bit too bright I'd say, but if it's obstructed or you're  not facing it than it isn't bad at all.<br /><br />3) volume:  volume control is good--I'm not sure why you'd want it loud (I guess if you have a lot of street noise), but it can get a decent volume on it<br /><br />4) sounds:  this was the more problematic issue for us. We just didn't find many of the sounds pleasurable or soothing. Some would have soothing parts, but then a loud surge of sound would appear, which would seem to defeat the purpose. We've heard others that were just more tranquil, soothing. some of that can be somewhat ameliorated by the volume control obviously, but still wasn't what we were expecting. There are a good number and variety, but honestly we'd only use 3, possibly 4. On the other hand, if you're looking for ""drown-out"" sound, you might find that less of an issue<br /><br />5) timer is good and works well. Never understood ones that came without them, so this is a good, I'd say required, touch<br /><br />It's a useful, solid product, but not quite as all-around useful as its numbers of lights/sounds might indicate. At least for us.  No concerns over quality--feels well constructed and responsive [SEP] The best part of this sound machine is that an Alexa-type voice speaks to you as you set the timer: ""15 minutes."" Press button. ""30 Minutes."" ""60 minutes"" etc. It has a soft foreign accent that I can't place but it's cute. Most sound machines don't have a human voice saying anything. I guess it's needed because there are no light buttons to tell you which setting you're choosing.<br /><br />Except for this, I felt this device feels cheaply made. The casing feels cheap (hard, brittle plastic) and the buttons on the interface are not sensitive to touch. You have to press really hard sometimes to get it to change settings. The volume control is also confusing - there are actually two volume controls - one to raise the volume, one to lower. I was pressing one volume control (the loud one) thinking that I could lower it but I was mistaken - you have to press the ""low volume"" button.<br /><br />On the positive side, the night light works well - the colors are neon bright and you can keep a steady color going all night long OR cycle through the different colors. The timer like I said has a human voice, which is kind of cool. The weak parts are the button responsiveness and some of the sounds. The lullaby function is good and the sound is sharp and clear. The Nature sounds are relatively good - the best are the chirping bird sounds and thunderstorm but the ""water"" sounds (i.e., ocean, babbling brook) sound muffled and are not particularly sharp. The ""white noise"" is also kind of indistinct and the ""fetal heartbeat"" sound is just plain crude - not so much a heartbeat but like someone else noted, it's like banging drums.<br /><br />So...it's a serviceable device but I would not pay too much for this. There are so many better ones out there. [SEP] Overall, this is a pretty good white noise machine. It's very compact, which is a plus since I don't have a lot of bedside table area available. This has a smaller footprint than my last white noise machine, making it also a handy item if you want to take it while traveling.<br /><br />Setup is simple, and there's a good selection of sounds to choose from. I stick with the white noise, but it's nice to have options just to experiment with them to see which work the best. The variety also makes this useful not only for adults, but for infants/children to help them sleep. The sound volume has a good range, and the light feature is also a nice touch, even though it's not something I get much use out of.<br /><br />The main con is the control panel. It's hard to see which control is which, especially in dim light. I would prefer a more traditional button system with nice, clear text labels as to function. Or, better yet, some type of simple remote where the buttons light up. Granted, that would increase the price but the layout presently used can be really frustrating to use.<br /><br />One star down for the control system but otherwise, a very nice compact sound machine. [SEP] I'd never even heard of white noise machines before I became a parent, and now I'm practically a white noise hoarder. I have one in each of my kids rooms, a portable one for travel and one that gets left at Grandma's house in case I forget mine. Plus a couple extras, you know, in case one breaks. It's bad. I have a problem. But they're just so stinkin' soothing and they cover every squeak of the floor in my 100 year old house so I can sneak into my sleeping kids rooms without waking them up. Of all the white noise machines I've had, this one has the least annoying ""bonus"" sounds of all of them. I usually just use the various white noise settings, but on this one the nature sounds and music are actually really nice! I'm impressed! I wish there was a way to have it rotate through all the songs instead of play ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" 500 times in a row, but other than that there's really nothing about this that I don't like. The light is soft and you can select the color of light you prefer or have it fade through the whole rainbow. A rechargeable battery would really knock this out of the park so I could have the option to use it without being plugged in, but it's not something I really need I guess. I would definitely recommend this to any new parent! [SEP] I sure could have used this sound machine when my son was a baby.  The sound quality is clear and authentic.  The sounds are so soothing, gentle, and pleasant.  I don’t feel like the sounds are repetitive.  I am listening to the lullaby one while typing this review, and I am ready to nod off.  It is a compact sized at only 5 inches in diameter and 1.5 inches tall.  It is made of high grade plastic.  It is powered by an USB plug.  There is no option for batteries usage, though.  There are 8 sets of controls including the on/off switch, and they are located on the top of machine.  It is very easy to change the settings by using a light touch.<br /><br />A nifty feature is that the color of the machine changes with the touch of a button.  Very muted and relaxing.  There is an option for on/off light.  The timer can be set at 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes.  Everything gets shut off quietly when the time is up.  Although I pretty much have dozed off by then.  I would definitely recommend this sound machine. [SEP] Works well. We fall asleep immediately without waking up to our cats during the night. [SEP] The white noise sound machine is controlled by the top plastic gray circular piece. There is an included quick start guide with the set that shows all of the buttons and what they do. The symbols are very universal and quickly recognizable. However, it’s certainly always handy to have the resource. It’s also small enough that it could be placed underneath the sound machine to always have on hand.<br /><br />The white noise machine comes with a cord but it does not come with a wall adapter. So it is important to have one of those or some sort of other outlet.<br /><br />The touch type buttons on the top of the sound machine are immediately responsive. This has not always been my experience with touch buttons so that’s very important to me.<br /><br />There are six nature sounds, four lullabies and  six white noises to choose from. There is one lullaby in particular I really like that doesn’t get irritating like some others do, but that’s just personal preference. There is a nice variety and it has a very pure sound.<br /><br />The volume is controlled by the touch buttons and can get quite loud especially for a sound machine. I think it’s very helpful that the speaker is directly on top of the sound machine. It really helps project the sound.<br /><br />There is a timer option. The timer options are 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes. The button can also be held to turn the timer completely off. I personally don’t use the timer.<br /><br />The outer portion of the sound machine is a cloudy white color. Everywhere that’s the cloudy white color can potentially light up to one of the night light colors. There is a large variety for different settings and different preferences. The night light can also be turned off and not used at all.<br /><br />Overall, this is a simple and efficient sound machine to use. [SEP] This is exactly what I needed to help put me to sleep. [SEP] alot of different sounds and lights  and the size of the product is great [SEP] This noise machine is high quality and has a lot of great features. I'm impressed with the light, the sound options, the timer, etc. I dont think the sound quality is the absolute best but I didnt get this for crisp and clear sound. It serves its purpose and sets an ambience in the room even if you dont turn the sound on, the colors are very cool by themselves.",3,True
Halloween Balloons Party Decorations Kit Happy Halloween Balloon Banner Latex Balloons Star Pumpkin Ghost Mylar Balloons Paper Garlands Tissue Tassel Halloween Balloons,[],[],,4.5,64,108,"Very cute Halloween decorations that include a variety of items to decorate with. Will be fun to decorate with closer to Halloween. I know my kids will enjoy them when I put them up. [SEP] There aren't quite as many decorations included in this pack as expected but it's perfect for decorating a smaller room or entranceway. I didn't have any issues with defective balloons etc. The mylar balloons were a hit with the kids.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this for any Halloween party or for Halloween night. [SEP] These Halloween decorations are okay, but they are smaller than I expected. It's enough to decorate an entry way or one wall or snacks table but that's about all. The shaped Mylar balloons in particular were quite little.  I got a spider (8"" tall x 14"" from leg tip to leg tip when deflated), a ghost with  pumpkin (a total of 11"" x 13"" with a 8"" x 8"" pumpkin and a 5"" x "" ghost), and 3 16"" circular balloons (2 that are orange and say ""Happy Halloween"" with cute Halloween pictures, one black with a bloody skeleton that says ""spooky""). So I got more than the 3 Mylar balloons promised in the product description, but they were much smaller than the product description indicated. I got 16 latex balloons, 4 each of white with a ghost face, orange with a scary jack o lantern face, black with a red scary face and clear with orange and black confetti. They look good but smell very strongly of turpentine. I got 6 tissue paper pom poms (some assembly required) with an 8"" diameter. 2 each in orange black and white. There were also kits to make 12"" long black and orange tissue paper tassels. Lastly there is a set of cardstock cutouts with images that spell out ""Happy Halloween"" and some black ribbon to string them on. Overall the decorations look cute, but honestly I was hoping for something better at this price. [SEP] Poor quality... the foil baloons deflated so quick . Could not keep air in them. Cheap decoration [SEP] This kit comes with a lot of stuff for the money - and the balloons are fabulous - I would get this for them alone. Helium was used for the full effect seen here (not included with the kit but worth it.)  The other things in the listing (garlands, pom-poms, and banner) do take a little work.  The pom-poms ARE manageable but they take A LOT of time and care to spread them all out and it is tricky to do without ripping them. If you get them please note the instructions DO NOT say to leave the ribbon on. YOU NEED TO LEAVE THE RIBBON ON or it will never work.  Even after figuring this out (which took longer than I’d care to admit) I'll be honest after ripping one beyond salvage and the time spent on the second one I gave up with those.  The same goes for the garlands- I have zero crafting skills and didn't even attempt them (but that's on me).  The banner comes as separate letters and one very useful extra was the plastic needle to help thread them.  Made life much easier.  I put them on one long string (provided) - but did have to take them off and rearrange them - because I had the words backwards the first try. (Totally my fault and didn't even realize until the hubby pointed it out).  Overall I would say if you are crafty you will get a fabulous effect for the money.  For me - as I said the balloons alone were well worth the cost (even after adding in the cost for the helium tank). [SEP] I got everything as described in the ""what's in the box?"" picture. I was a little worried about the mylar (which look amazing) but then read you can use a straw and blow them up yourself. Should be just as fun to assemble and decorate as they will be to celebrate the season! Recommended. [SEP] There are a good amount of decorations in this set and we did not have any issues setting them up.  We were surprised to find that the small mylar pumpkin and spider do not float.  Even when filled with helium, they didn't float at all.  There is a hole on top that you can tie the blown up figures.  The pompoms were a bit confusing at first - key is do not remove the band holding the strips together.  Leave that band in place and pull out portions according to directions.  The latex balloons floated OK, but they didn't last long.  They started drooping after a few hours.  This is a good kit by itself for Halloween decorating  of a medium to large space.  We had quite a bit of supplies unused from the set that we didn't need an can use later  after using the amount in the pictures. [SEP] This Halloween party decoration kit has everything you need for a Halloween party, or just to decorate for the holiday.  There is a good assortment of fun balloons as well as some on the scarier side.  The other decorations are easy to put together.  This is perfect for a party, decorating a classroom (minus the scary balloons), or just to decorate your house.  The kit is a great value as one individual helium balloon usually costs me $3-$4.  This kit comes with 5 mylar/helium balloons which already brings you to $15, plus you get so much more with the kit besides just the mylar balloons.  It's a great value and I can't wait to use everything to decorate! [SEP] Pretty impressed with this Halloween Party Decor Set. Spooky but cute!<br />Will update review and add more pictures once we actually set it up*** as it is not Halloween yet, but kids are so pumped!<br /><br />So far, recommended!!!

Smells fine, tastes fine, just too big a dose to get benefits! I prefer a once daily tablet. [SEP] These smell a little fishy but other than that I am happy with these. They are vegetarian friendly, organic and non-gmo. I take spirulina for overall health. They are a superfood and very nutrient dense so I take them every day. The recommended dose is 6 so I split them up and take 3 in the morning and 3 at night. They are easy to take and easy on the stomach, and i could even take them on an empty stomach without nausea, or after taste/burps. [SEP] Found on the Vine Program, we wanted to try a different brand of spirulina, as we've been using the same brand for years. This brand gives you the same benefits and flavor as the more popular brands, with a smaller tablet size. If you already use spirulina as part of your regimen, consider trying this brand. If you haven't tried spirulina, what are you waiting for? [SEP] This is a great supplement for vegetarians, I stopped eating animal products a year ago and now I use a lot of plant based protein powders. This supplement has 12 grams of protein per serving, (6 tablets) so it's definitely worth taking. It's a really nice change from powders because when I use them, I have to cover up the taste to some extent and they can be a bit inconvenient because they can make a mess trying to use them when travelling. These ""tablets"" (I believe they're actually called caplets, which are easier to swallow than tablets because of their shape) , are very easy to swallow because of their oblong shape and smooth coating. This is also a good source of iron and potassium; they're pretty important and this can eliminate the need for taking extra pills if they aren't included in any of your other supplements. There are a lot of great reasons for taking this supplement; it's onsidered one of the most powerful superfoods in the world; it was found to have more protein (up to 70% more) than beef or soybeans! This spirulina supplement is all natural and organic; it's an excellent value.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />  [SEP] These organic spirulina tablets are just pure spirulina blue green algae, no additives or fillers are included.

"zelaxy Mask Strap Extenders, Soft Silicone Mask Holders for Relieve Ear Pain Caused by Mask (Thumb)",[],[],,3.9,23,8167,"These ear savers are durable with a nice flexibility to it that makes them quite comfortable on the back of your head.  They have enough adjustment options that my kids can use them which helps the disposable adult masks to fit them.  They are large enough for an adult male to use as well.  The only issue I have is the silicone has a rubbery feel and if you have your long hair down it can get caught in it. [SEP] I’ve tried so many brands of masks that loop around my ears trying to find a good fit, but most masks just pop right off my ears and fall off. I don’t know if it’s the shape of my ears, head size or what the issue Is, but a mask extender seemed like a potentially good solution to keep a mask secured in place. Unfortunately, these silicone extenders seem like a poor design that doesn’t help secure a mask in place.<br /><br />These extenders are only 5.5” long, and each extender has three notches on each side. The idea is to seat the ear loops into the notches to keep the mask on. But the extenders are short and flimsy, and the notches are shallow. The loops don’t securely fit down into the notches in a way where they don’t just separate from the extender. I’ve tried many times and find no way to hook the loops to the notches on the extender so the mask would stay in place. The extender just falls off, and so does the mask.<br /><br />I’ve tried using these extenders with various brand of masks with stretchy loops, but they don’t work with any of my masks. I don’t know if the extenders could work for a kid or teen or someone with a small head, but I still don’t see how the design of the notches can actually keep the mask loops securely in place. The extenders seem like they need a clip or a way to tie a loop to it or something to secure the loops besides the notches. The variety of colors is nice and I like the idea, but these extenders don’t work for me. 2 stars. [SEP] I was really excited to try these, but they didn't work very well. They were not comfortable to wear at all and kept slipping down. I ended up taking my mask off of these and just putting it back over my ears, so in my mind this was a fail. Bummer, because these look like a good idea. [SEP] These are soft, and comfortable, but don't do a good job holding mask strings/elastics due to the flexibility of the (silicone) material; and the slots are too small for most cloth mask elastics.<br /><br />Thank you very much for reading my review.  If you found it helpful, I’d appreciate your clicking the button below. [SEP] With masks being worn every time we go out my kids NEED these as well have yet to find masks small enough for them. Mt 2 yr old wears it on the tightest setting and my 4 yr old wears it on the middle setting. Super cute and durable these were a great buy and I highly recommend 👌 [SEP] I am disappointed with this mask holder.  The slots are very small - really do not work with cloth masks.  These WILL work with the thin cords of disposable masks - but nothing is said in the listing.<br /><br />The extenders are really short as well.  Again, they may work better with disposable masks where the ear cords stretch more but they were way too short to work with my cloth masks. [SEP] These are made from a thick material that is tough and hard to stretch. I was expecting a more flexible material so it is more comfortable for the mask, but these don't really stretch enough to be comfortable around my head. I wear a size XS hat and these still felt too harsh for me to keep on for long. I wish these where more flexible and comfortable. [SEP] I use this with the masks I have where the elastic is too long and I really like it. Mask stays on the ear saver well. The silicon is soft so it's more comfortable on the back of my head.

I was pleased and would recommend it. [SEP] This is an okay straightener and curler. I personally did not find it better than the one I have been using. I think my granddaughter took it home with her and she has been using it just fine. She has a thick head of hair but the strands are fine like mine, so it is easy to work with our hair [SEP] [[VIDEOID:beeb910dd7418983ac3cadad6d42b80b]] This Beshoi professional 2-in-1 Straightener is super nice! It comes with: a storage case that is great to use when traveling (although it dies not say it is heat-resistant; 2 hair clips to section your hair while straightening; and a glove to keep you from burning your hand while using this straightener. This hair straightener has a rounded barrel which allows you to not only straighten your hair but also curl your hair. It has very little “pull” when straightening your hair (it h Is not painful to use). It also has a lock feature so you can lock it closed to avoid accidentally burning something while it is heated. It is very simple to use and has a digital display. It’s overall sleek looking and I like the gray and pink color combo. See my pictures for additional information. Overall, I recommend this product! [SEP] This isn't the greatest straightener for thick curly hair.  It does have the ability to adjust the heat temp, which is useful.  However, the plates are rather small and just don't work great on my hair.  It is packaged well and oddly does curl my hair better then straightening is.<br /><br />The power button and digital screens are easy to see and clear to read however, please note, that when turning it on it isn't instant you MUST hold the power button longer then other product types or it simply won't turn on.  Not a major issue but still an issue.<br /><br />The 360 swivel cord, the glove and clips are all excellent features.  However, overall this isn't a very well made curler/straightener. [SEP] This is an okay straightener, but you sometimes do get what you pay for and in this instance this is not a great product but it’s cheap.<br /><br />It is easy to use. Heated up fast. You can adjust the heat settings.<br /><br />They do provide a full glove, and two hair clips, which I thought was a nice touch.<br /><br />However, the plate is small in length. The way it’s designed the plastic pulls on my hair too much—both the outside plastic and because the heated plate is so short in length.<br /><br />It did not work to for me at all to be a 2-in-1 curler and straightener. I didn’t get one bit of curl. Since only that small plate heats, I don’t see how that works anyway. Though the barrel is round-ish, that doesn’t mean it curls.<br /><br />It didn’t straighten all that well either but it did an okay job. Again, the plate is too short.<br /><br />This straightener just feels and looks cheap. Yes, at under $40 it is cheap, but I’ve seen straighteners around this price that were made better.<br /><br />The pink shot of color is cute, I suppose.<br /><br />Not for me. I’ll pass it on to someone else or place it in the Goodwill box. Maybe someone else will have better luck or like it better. [SEP] I've used this quite a bit this week and I can say I really enjoy the versatility of this 2 in 1.<br />If you’re like me, you probably have a drawer full of hair tools and products, I was able to declutter a bit with this versatile gadget. Ive noticed incredibly even heating within fifteen seconds. While this isn't the best straightener I've used it is good value for the price. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:5b0de882eb9f712e866b5cc8745251a5]] I’ve had the same straightener for years, so it was time to replace it. I came packaged neatly. At first, I thought mine was broken because it wouldn’t come on, but you have to hold the power button down for a little longer than you expect. It has adjustable temperature but none of which really worked on my hair. It did heat up really fast and I thought it was fun to watch the temperature climb (refer to my video). But unfortunately, this straightener is mediocre. I have medium thick hair that’s not dyed and it’s wavy so it’s not really a chore to get straight. However, this straightener didn’t work well in straightening it. I did attempt to do the curls with the straightener and it semi-worked. They were more of waves than curls but again, my hair is naturally wavy, so I’d prefer that it curled it. I guess this would be better for thinner hair. I am a little bummed that this wasn’t better. I’ve used cheaper straighteners before that worked better than this. I’d say keep looking, unfortunately.",3,True
Zep Cleaning Bundle - All Purpose Cleaner & Streak-Free Glass Cleaner,[],[],,4.1,52,726,"This is a nice cleaning bundle. You get one bottle that is a streak-less glass cleaner that you can use on either glass surfaces or mirrors. I have had no issues with this and indeed it is streak-less. It works very well and it is pretty much ammonia based like most others are.<br /><br />The other bottle is an all purpose cleaner that works very well on pretty much everything else like your shower, cook top with a greasy mess and everything else that your cleaning hands come across. These 2 cleaners work very well. They smell like cleaning supplies do so no surprise there really. [SEP] (4.5)<br />These Zep cleaners that came in the Zep cleaning bundle work perfectly. Just like brand names, if not better than some.<br />This bundle comes with an all purpose cleaner and a streak free glass cleaner. The all purpose cleaner is a degreaser as well and it works brilliantly! We had grease splatter on the stove top and I was dreading the clean up but figured it would be a great test for this stuff. I gave it a spray, let it sit for 60 seconds, attempted a wipe up, and wow! The grease came right up. I was impressed. I wasn't 100% in love with the smell but the cleaning power sold me.<br />The glass cleaner I would definitely say is in line with other blue glass cleaners. It only streaked if I wiped it really poorly (I can streak any window/mirror/glass surface imaginable, I am so bad at that). It had the normal smell that you would expect. I liked it a lot.<br />I thought both these cleaners were very good. I'm not sure about the price and how it compares to other cleaners though. Even though I definitely recommend these for their cleaning power, I did have to take just a tad off for the slightly higher cost. [SEP] I really like this duo.  Right now we are cleaning more than ever.  This works great!  It works well on our counters and our glass.  We use it clean everything with no issues. [SEP] I'm a fan of Zep products and these do not disappoint. The glass cleaner did great, a little goes a long way. Dried hazy in some areas I over saturated but a quick second wipe took care of it.<br /><br />The APC is nice too, cuts through grease and crust with no problems. Please note, this is not a disinfectant, only a degreaser/cleaner... So it will not protect you from germs or virus.<br /><br />Price is is pretty high compared to brick and mortar stores. [SEP] I really like this duo.  Right now we are cleaning more than ever.  This works great!  It works well on our counters and our glass.  We use it clean everything with no issues.

"Pre Workout Demon (Berry Flavour) - Hardcore Pre-Workout Supplement with Creatine, Caffeine, Beta-Alanine and Glutamine, 40 Servings",[],[],,3.4,39,747,"This is a good solid pre-workout. The energy is strong. The beta alanine itches. The pumps are big. And the flavor ain't bad. I would do this one again. [SEP] When I get a pre-workout, I like it to have creatine, beta-alanine, and caffeine. These are three elements that make me feel ""ready to go"" in terms of working out. The addition of glutamine, taurine, and citrulline is also cool, since I often put those in my ""mid-workout"" which I take partway through the workout when I do cardio and lift.<br /><br />So this formula pretty much takes care of everything I need. The only thing I noticed is that the caffeine content is pretty high, and since I'm a big coffee drinker, it's just worth noting that your daily caffeine content can really shoot up if you combine this with coffee and aren't sensitized.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good too. I look forward to it. [SEP] Good tasting power up for my workouts. Will continue to buy after I’m done with this one [SEP] Some of us prefer a little less flavor to our pre-workouts. I definitely would be up for less aftertaste and more impact at the expense of too much flavor. This is a product that after one scoop in ten ounces of water tasted more like water than it did any type of berry.<br /><br />There are a ton of ingredients in here that SHOULD have engaged me much more than it did after 15 minutes of use for a period of five workout days. Each day I felt the same. I felt a slight buzz followed by a pretty difficult workout compared to when I use other supplements for my pre-workout. My workouts were around 20% less effective using this than with other supplements.<br /><br />To make sure that I wasn't having my own placebo effect because of the lack of flavor, I tried this again after going back to another supplement and also doing a workout with no pre-workout. Further, I tried two servings to see if it made a difference. The flavor was of course more pronounced. However, the effectiveness after the 15 minute ""slightly better"" buzz was still less than other supplements.  I am not sure if I am just not responding to the ingredients or if I needed more than one or two servings to get results. [SEP] It has a super boost of power and I like the taste. It has Creatine and other goodies for building up the muscles so, it’s good to pull out the scoop and shake the jar a bit before scooping it to make sure it’s mixed well. I pull the scoop first to avoid having to dig for it.😁<br />  I like the scary name too. Lol! Whether you use a double dose of 400mg of Caffeine or a half dose, I would recommend it. [SEP] Pretty decent, middle-of-the-road pre-workout. Mixes well, tastes good. Doesn't really stand out for any reason, good or bad. Maybe I'll up the dosage. [SEP] Because I generally work out in the morning and am already sufficiently caffeinated after a mug of coffee, I can't really say how much a pre-workout drink like this brings to the bench.<br /><br />I can say that the prescribed two scoopfuls of this berry-flavored powder mixed in water tastes pretty good. The chemical aftertaste is quite subdued compared to similar products I have tried.<br /><br />At around $25 for 40 servings, this powder is also reasonably priced at about 62 cents a serving -- a bargain compared to Red Bull or similar energy drinks.<br /><br />So if you would like an extra dose of creatine, taurine, and caffeine to power you through workouts, you might want to give this stuff a try. [SEP] Product was so clumped when I received it that I could not use it. Would not recommend. [SEP] Pretty decent pre work out. The flavor is surprising tasty and easy to enjoy in a chilled shaker bottle with ice. Mixes well. Suggest drinking it about 20-30 minutes before your work out to give time to kick in. Perhaps drink during stretching and warm up. Gives a nice little booster and bump of energy to push yourself in the gym. [SEP] First off let me say that this supplement does mix smoothly and tastes pretty good.  No complaints there.  You will also feel the caffeine effects so no issues there also.  My biggest problem with this blend is it needs a little refining to make sense.  The ""demon's blend"" section needs to look like the double dose but in a single serving.  The volume of those ingredients in the single scoop side is too lacking for it to really make any difference.  If they were to increase the levels of the demon blend and keep the caffeine the same it would make for a much better supplement and hold better grounds against the more well know pre-workouts of the world.<br /><br />Basically, they should make it the high strength dose only but reduce caffeine down to 200/300mg and put 30 servings of that in the container.  At that point this would be a top contender and would highly recommend at that point.  Otherwise this is just not hitting the mark for me and will use other more well balanced blends.<br /><br />Oh and hopefully they can switch to a safer form of sweetener as well which would make for a truly premium product.  Price is pretty standard for a supplement of this kind.",3,True
"YEEIN Auto Hair Curler, Wired Automatic Hair Curler for Long Hair Anti-Scald Rotary Curling Iron，Temperature Display and Adjustable Curl Direction Fast Heating，Negative Lonic Protection (Green)",[],[],,2.4,24,6687,"The instructions are lacking. You have to find a youtube video to figure out how to use this. It's difficult to use on your own head without the fear of it getting tangled in your hair. It does curl if you can manage to figure it out, but I don't think it's worth the frustration. [SEP] The color of this tool or so beautiful! Feels heavy duty. Curls come out nice but really takes some getting use to/ can be very easy to burn the ends of your hair off. It’s hard to control the heat exposure in this and I really feel you’re playing a game of chance putting your hair in this. [SEP] I probably would have used this product 20 times in a year for may 10-15 mins each time and it has stopped working. When I first used it, was so please with its performance, it made perfect curls but I am not a big fan of heat products so only use them sparingly. It’s such a shame that this product only lasted less than a year for a price that’s far from being cheap. I don’t know if the product was faulty and if it is then the supplier should be replacing it but there is no way to reach out to them. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:85515d715cfa67029492b7cacccb329d]] Temperature heated to 200 degrees very quick.  However, I can’t figure out how to use it.  It did not come with instructions.  I have short hair and the curler wouldn’t work.  I’m going to stick with my traditional curling wand. [SEP] I am not very good with a traditional curling iron, so I decided I would give this a try. There is an odd learning curve that goes along with this tool and I feel that the reason for this is the lack of a visual (be it video or image) as to how this needs to be used. I did read the directions, but they were of minimal help. Due to this learning curve, I docked a star. Once I learned how to properly use this, though, curling the hair becomes quick and easy and has great results on my hair.  It takes away much of the worry of burning myself that I have with a traditional curling iron and wraps and unwraps my hair itself (another part of the learning curve).  Overall, this is a good and useful hair tool. It works well, heats up quickly, and has great end results. It would just be great if the seller would add a video showing how this is to be used to make it easier for people like me who aren’t as intuitive in styling hair and in using hair styling tools. [SEP] this machine was so hard to use, the tutorial video makes it look ease but its not. IT IS HARD AND MY HAIR GOT STUCK IN IT<br /><br />threw mine away [SEP] I recommend;  I arranged my hair in a few minutes, it doesn't pull, it doesn't burn, the curls are perfect and resistant [SEP] YEEIN Auto Hair Curler, Wired Automatic Hair Curler for Long Hair Anti-Scald Rotary Curling Iron Temperature<br /><br />Not sure if others were able to make this work but my daughter and I tried for hours - she finally gave up but not before I scared her when her hair got tangled and stuck inside. That was enough for her - luckily I was able to untangle it without having to cut it. If I started at the end of her hair - nothing happened. The hair didn't get pulled inside and rolled around the iron - it just stayed stuck inside but not doing anything. But if I started it closer to the scalp, the hair started spinning but got tangled inside. Bottom line - it is a scary device that did not curl her hair! If anyone has any better luck with these things, they must know the trick that I didn't figure out. But for me, it is one star - my daughter and I are both educated individuals and neither of us were able to curl hair with this device. We surrendered and admitted defeat! 1 Star! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful. I would have posted a picture of her hair but it didn't look any different and she had ""HAD ENOUGH"" at that point! Others have said it is easy to use; but I did not find this to be true for me! [SEP] Wraps hair poorly. Difficult to use. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:3a41c4c5d0ed30f36fd2966360e391a]] I thought this looked kind of cool and wanted to try it out. I have long straight hair and have always used a standard curling iron. I think I will be sticking with my standard because I found this one to be loud, bulky and not really any quicker. It definitely takes lots of practice to figure out how to use it. I guess the outer layer is the anti scald part but it doesnt allow to see how hot my hair is getting by touch so I was scared to leave it rotating in it for more than a few seconds. It also tangled up in it very easily.",3,True
Probiotic 40 Billion CFU with MAKtrek® Bi-Pass Technology - Probiotics for Women and Men - Digestive and Gut Health Supplement with Live Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium Lactis (60 Veggie Capsules),[],[],,4.2,22,528,"This is not a super strong probiotic in comparison with some brands. But if this is just added to your daily routine as a backup, it is more than adequate.<br /><br />While it is nearly impossible to pinpoint or single out bodily benefits from one supplement, I can say these were reasonably easy to get down (I have trouble swallowing pills, so take them with food). I did not notice any heartburn or taste kickback from these either.<br />The only beefs were that the fresh date was only five months out, and that Amazon put their sticker over the ingredients list/amounts.<br />Seems to be a quality supplement. [SEP] All natural formula. Each ""serving"" contains 40 billion cfu (a serving is 2 capsules) - they promise a minimum potency of 20 billion could by the expiration date. Theres 60 capsules in the bottle. The probiotics strains listed (there are 4 of them) seem to be similar to others with names like bifidobacterium andclactobacillus, etc. The difference in this product being the ""Macktrek bi-pass technology"", which appears to refer to the specific blend and how it survives into your system. The capsules are easy to swallow gel caps and they're defined as ""shelf stable"", the bottle i got has an expiration date approximately 5 months from when I received them. [SEP] I can't find any information on the bottle about ""strains"" but possibly that is on the website. Regardless, my other probiotic was 20 billion CFU with 10 strains and recommended dose was 2 capsules. This probiotic features 40 billion CFU and appears to make a difference. I think it's safe to say this has been the worst year ever since 2008 or 2001 or beyond. I feel like a human yo-yo with all that has transpired in and out of work.<br /><br />But after taking this product for a short stretch I can say that I feel some definite improvements including:<br /><br />-- my gut feels good<br />-- my mood is great<br />-- no digestive issues<br />-- energy is good<br />-- I have been losing weight and it seemed to plateau but it's going down again<br />-- morning movements are looking better than normal (healthier if you will)<br /><br />My other probiotic was working as well but I feel this has upped the ante. I definitely think it's worth giving a shot if it falls within your budget. [SEP] This seems to be a unique probiotic in the sense that it uses something called Bi-pass technology which is supposed to help get the probiotics to where they need to go without getting destroyed by the stomach acid.  I should note that I have been using probiotics for some time and after a week of using this, I don't notice any difference between this and the one that I usually take.  It should also be noted that the best by date is very short.  The product that I received is set to expire February 2021 and I received this product at the beginning of November.  Of all the probiotics that I've used currently and and in the past, I've never received a product with such a close expiration date.  I would like to think that it is because it is extremely fresh but I truly think that this just didn't sell for some reason and now they are looking to offload the product. [SEP] Probiotics are one of those things that you can't really notice if they're working or not. Sure, one fail-safe symptom is that the business at the ""back door"" is going smoother. Potential claims about weight loss--a popular add-on for nearly anything--remained unsubstantiated for me. In fact, I am within half a pound of the ""before probiotics"" weight, despite having plenty to lose.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't notice adverse effects, either and it may be a bit of a mind game aside from more regularity mentioned above. That alone, however, is worth it for me. [SEP] I really like that these have bi-pass technology meaning that it will get past your stomach acid and to the small intestines where it needs to go in order to be absorbed. That is really important otherwise all your going to do is dissolve the ingredients in stomach acid and flush your money down the toilet when it is removed by your kidneys. These are a great quality and easy to swallow. I did notice the same thing another reviewer has mentioned about the use by date being a short time span, which I understand, but the disclaimer about how the company only guarantees 20million cfu instead of the 40 million your paying for is bothersome. This is too expensive if you are truly only getting 20 million by the time you take it. [SEP] I can not tell whether this is better or worse than other probiotics, though some have really upset my stomach and this has not.<br /><br />I see that others are bothered by the fact that the manufacturer states that this amount of probiotic in this may not be the same as listed. I am GLAD that they state this fact. There are very few supplements that have shelf stability but most people don't know that. I you want to make absolutely sure you're getting what you need, buy a liquid and refrigerated product. [SEP] I like taking different probiotics, I feel like taking different ones over a period of time helps my body and helps keep my digestion in order. [SEP] As someone who uses probiotics daily, I am happy with this brand so far. Since I struggle with digestive issues and a leaky gut, I need a probiotic with a high strain count. This supplement has the high number I need and has seemed to help keep some of my stomach issues at bay. It's easy to take and the capsule isn't overly large or difficult to swallow. It also hasn't caused excess heartburn or gas after taking, so all in all, it seems to be gentle on the system. The bottle itself requires no cooling or refrigeration, so it would travel well and be convenient to take with you. As a necessary product for me, I do believe this is a worthwhile investment. [SEP] I've been trying a variety of probiotics to help with digestive issues and this one has the shortest range of shelf stability (about 4 months). Since one bottle is a one-month supply, this isn't a big problem. I think the short expiration date is probably a good thing since it means that the manufacturer may be more accurately estimated the viability of the cultures in it.<br /><br />This is supposed to have a special formulation to help the probiotics survive stomach acids and reach the intestines to assist with gut flora there. I have no way of knowing if it is working. I can only say that I have had considerably less stomach discomfort and bloating since taking this. I tolerated it well, didn't have any issues digesting it or having it feel ""stuck"". The capsules aren't too big to take, though they are less slender than some. They have a slightly sour milk smell, but they have not taste.",3,True

That said, I think these capsules are good quality and they have not given me any adverse side effects. I have to be careful what I ingest lest I get a serious bout of gastric distress going. So far I have not had any problems with this supplement.  I think this is  very good loose, maca root powder. [SEP] This bag contains 10.6 ounces of certified organic maca powder. That is the only ingredient. It tastes and smells like I would expect. It seems equal in quality to the other brands that I've tried. Since it's a fine powder, it acts like a fine powder when you're scooping some out or stirring it in. I like the somewhat caramel taste that it adds to my chia puddings. [SEP] I’ve been taking Maca for years, mostly purchased from an online company devoted to maca sales. This preferred gelatinized formula absolutely matches their product and costs a little less. This maca which is light brown in color (there are also yellow and black macas) has a nice flavor and blends well in smoothies. I will absolutely buy again from this seller. Excellent product. [SEP] REVIEWING: Aspen Naturals Maca Root Powder - Organic, Raw, Gluten Free, Gelatinized Superfood, Keto and Vegan Friendly, Easily Add to Your Smoothies, Baking, Ice Cream, and Coffee. 30 Day Supply<br />*<br />*<br />For a first time Maca Root user I have to say this seems really great quality. Very fresh taste & blends very well. I'm more motivated to use this as part of my daily routine because of the quantity you get PLUS quality. I have more than enough to make my daily health routines a habit.<br /><br />I prefer to mix in my oatmeal & baked goods as smoothies make me sick regardless of what I use. I definitely notice the energy benefits with continued use (results can take up to 6+ weeks). I'm usually always tired all day no matter what. I haven't implemented anything else into my diet nor routine, so I know this has attributed to my energy levels.<br /><br />Be mindful that Maca Root is used for weight gain as well which is an added benefit for me personally. I have yet to notice results solely from Maca Root as I have become much more active. [SEP] Tastes great<br />Mix well into anything<br />Can’t tell if it’s my mind but I feel great after putting it in my shakes.<br />Seems like I can tell a difference. [SEP] I adore maca. This one is superior and the price is about the same as other brands.<br /><br />Maca has a toasty almost yeasty taste and smell. I can’t explain it. I happen to love the taste of it. I use it in smoothies and have for years. It’s supposed to be good for you. Can’t attest to that, but I do know that maca seems to give me a little boost without the jitters of caffeine, so that’s great for me as I can not tolerate caffeine.<br /><br />I particularly love smoothies with a combination of raw cacao and maca. Try them together if you haven’t.<br /><br />When I first started using maca I remember that I thought it actually smelled like sweaty socks - not dirty socks, but athletic socks that had been worn on clean feet that had been sweating. It’s a very particular odor! Nutritional yeast has that smell. And I thought all maca does, too, but that turns out not to be the case. I don’t get that smell from this brand of maca. I’ll admit that I rather like that smell. I like nutritional yeast and I like maca, but this is quite a bit nicer. It has a strong smell that maca lovers will like. My hubby, whose sense of smell isn’t as strong as mine (according to him) really loves this maca and commented on the good smell when I put it from the re-sealable bag into a glass storage container.<br /><br />It is noticeably finer ground than other organic brands that I’ve been buying. That means you’ll have a less grainy taste, not that I noticed it before, but I did notice that this was ground very fine indeed.<br /><br />Good price. Good product. My only complaint is an odd one, and not one that I’ll take away any stars for: I do not like the packaging design. It doesn’t look like the packaging of a food product but more like it would be suitable for office products. Doesn’t matter, as I threw it away. I like keeping products like this in glass containers.<br /><br />Highly recommended. [SEP] This is fresh, clean tasting maca powder.  I mostly add it to my smoothies, where it blends right in and lends some toasty malt flavors.  I'm not sure how maca can be both raw AND gelatinized at the same time,  as my understanding is that gelatinized = cooked.  Oh well, this is still good maca. [SEP] Maca is a superfood, adaptogen, that I consume daily. It is an acquired taste, mind you. I usually add it to coffee, along with mushroom powder blend and protein powder (sometimes a collagen powder, and often chocolate flavored). This is what I call my superman, superfood morning cup of coffee. Some studies have shown vast health benefits from maca consumption. It's contains antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and generally considered to be nutrient dense. It helps with energy, mood, general well being and hormonal balances, too.<br />The company notes that they ""tested dozens of samples from various suppliers around the country, and based our choice on organic quality, flavor profile, 3rd party testing, and country of origin.  WE DO NOT SOURCE OUR INGREDIENTS FROM CHINA"" (Note: country mentioned is Peru.) I mention this aspect because many are concerned about the purity and integrity of supplements/foods with China origination. And, with maca being a native product of Peru, it makes sense to get the 'real' thing from the proper source.<br />The label has certifications/badges for: Gluten-free, Soy-free, Non-GMO, Packaged In USA and USDA Organic. The certification for USDA Organic is comforting. I wish they also had FDA registered facility and/or cGMP certifications.<br />The scent and taste of this maca is exactly as expected. I feel that it's an excellent source for quality maca.<br />This product merits a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation. [SEP] A lot of the time when I order powdered supplements to add into my smoothie, when they’re unflavored, I worry about how they will alter the taste of my smoothie or if I’ll be able to notice them. You are able to notice this in your smoothie, however, it’s not a bad taste at all! It’s actually pretty tasty. It blends well, does not feel gritty in my smoothie, and I love that I’m able to add another super food into my diet. I love that this company is climate pledge friendly, because I think that it sends a good message to other companies to join along. Sustainable, tasty, and healthy! What more could you want? [SEP] I've been using Maca root products for years.  Mostly in baking quick breads as it not only provides additional nutrition but also produces baked products with better texture and flavor.  The fiber components are beneficial and more effective than other products and in smaller amounts.<br />This is especially noticeable when combined with fruits and vegetables in baking, banana bread, pumpkin bread, zucchini and carrot breads or cakes as well as both fresh and dried fruits.  Blueberry pancakes with a quarter cup of Maca powder substituted for 1/4 cup of the dry ingredients is an excellent example.

It also helped with relief for my neck and upper back pain after a long day at work.<br />It gets very slightly warm towards the end of a session, not hot like a heating pad.<br /><br />Based on their site, this item has ISO9001,ISO13485,CE,FCC,ROHS certificates.<br />The lighted panel is 21x5 inches, so you'll need two sessions for larger areas.<br />The control panel is inconveniently placed if you wear it on your waist; had to set it up before putting it on.  The indicator lights are blurry, so you have to look closely to know which level it's on.<br />You can't choose which wavelength (660/850nm) to use. It's always both.<br />Changing the timer setting turns it off, so you have to make sure to turn it back on after setting the timer.<br />The battery pocket is all velcro, and not very big (3.75x4.25 inches flat).<br />You need to purchase 12V battery pack for portability; regular power banks won't work as it needs a lot of power.<br />Easily folds for storage and portability.<br /><br />No eye protection included; although not necessary, they do caution you not to stare directly or treat near eyes. [SEP] I have a military back injury and this item worked and helped the pain, but after wasting my time and money getting 2 of them,  one originally, the other a replacement, they both stopped working and when they did work only 30 minutes at a time which was not very useful thanks for nothing this was a  bad product11 [SEP] Review for: Red & Infrared Light Therapy Belt for Body Pain Relief Wearable Light Therapy Device with 2 Wavelength<br /><br />I have been using a red light pad on my shoulder for quite a while it has made a huge difference. I have a bit of arthritis in my back and thought I would try it on my back. While I love the light for my back, the design of this belt and the controls is poor.<br /><br />The controls are built into the red light part of the belt rather than on the cord. This means that once you put the belt on, the controls are on your back, unless you have an 18” waist like the model in the photos. Like most red lights, this one decides to turn off now and then. If/when that happens, you won’t know it because you can’t see the controls because they are on your back. The controls themselves are poorly designed with three lights that can be lit up for the settings. The problem is the light leak so if one light is lit up, so are the others and you can’t tell what setting you are on. They need to go back to the drawing board on this one. [SEP] I just recently learned about using red/IR light as a form of therapy. I know this type of technology used to be expensive but now these things are so much more affordable and convenient. This one can be worn as a wrap around your waist/body so you don't have to be in one place when using this. I do recommend using a portable charging power bank, like the ones you use for cell phones, that way you have more freedom of movement. If you plan to use this lying down you can just use the plug that comes with this.<br /><br />Due to a move where I had to pack hundreds of boxes, my entire body was sore and cramped. This really helped relieve some tension I had until I could get some free time to get a massage. I was surprised this worked because it is something so simple (in a sense) yet effective. It was comfortable to wear, I didn't feel like I wanted to take it off or anything like that. You can even choose the power, timer, pulse, etc.<br /><br />Overall I was pleasantly surprised at the results. This to me are like those heating pads, which I also use for my soreness and cramps. I am happy with this and will be using it continuously for any cramps and muscle soreness I have. One last thing I have to mention is that I noticed some of the reviews are saying it stopped working but so far mine is still working. If I experience anything different I will be back to give another update. [SEP] The first thing that sets this apart from other similar devices is that it comes with a “cover”.  It says it is for sweat and stuff.  OK – I guess.  It is sort of a pain to put on and looks weird as it attaches to the front of the device with velcro but wraps the entire inside. I prefer t sue it without the cover as any type of movement at all – even maybe breathing – you can hear the velcro on the cover make noise.  It is so weird. No cover – it is silent. I guess it would have been better if it were black but the directions say it was designed to transmit the light through. I just skip it.<br /><br />The power bank plug comes disassembled which is a little odd.  At first I thought it was one f those plugs that rotated in the socket so that is why.  But nope – it doesn’t rotate.  I think the only reason it comes in two pieces is so it fits in the box – and that is weird.  It does fit – but weird.  There is no direction about putting it together – but it is not rocket science. But no mention in the directions.<br /><br />The belt itself seems to work fine in regards to red light therapy – it is just not the easiest to operate and use for a few reasons.  First, the power button is in the middle of the buttons – and I am dumbfounded at that.  All the buttons are close together and look the same.  And actually, they are not buttons at all.  It is hard to see what you are pressing and hard to see what setting it is on.  All of the lights for the buttons are also colored the same – except for the time which is blue.  You can barely read the words on the “buttons” as the print is teeny.  Lastly – unless you are going to use this thing like on your abdomen or your upper front, though – the button placement is not great.  Maybe if you are a teeny tiny petite person and you wrap it around your waist – the buttons may fall at the front if you are treating your back.  For me – they are at my side when treating my back. It is weird that they are at my side and I can not see what the heck I am doing. You can’t really feel your way either.  I, instead turn the thing on on my abdomen and then have to swing it around to my back.  Plus, since the buttons are not really buttons and are easy to change inadvertently – you can mistakenly turn it off or change the setting easily while using.<br /><br />This thing would have been MUCH better with a remote attached to the cord like most others – or even an actual remote.  It does come with a detachable battery pouch and a USB cord so I guess you could hook it up to a battery pack and use it that way which is good.  I just plug it in for the wall as I am not going to walk around with it personally and I use it when I’m relaxing - like sitting on the couch.  It fits me just fine and will fit bigger people – although it is not that big.<br /><br />So, it’s fine – it is just odd to use.  I have used others that were much easier to use.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] This is an attractive well made belt that will go around up to a 46"" waist.<br />The controls are on the belt which is easy access if it's on he waist =<br />not so convenient if used on other parts of the body EG: back / shoulder.<br />Can be used with a power bank (not included)<br /><br />The timer is three times ten minute - up to 30 minutes<br />but the belt turns off with each time the timer button is pressed to get to 30 min.<br /><br />Although this product info is the usual 660nm and 850nm they apparently<br />can NOT be used separately with this product which is a really big disappointment.<br />OTHER products we have are THREE MODES = 660nm / 850nm separately and the 3rd together.<br /><br />I'm guessing here - but I would imagine they're other folks like me that would want this for<br />the 850nm to penetrate deep to relieve pain / muscle stiffness / joints / swelling / etc.<br />And not have to deal with avoiding the red light which is extremely harmful to eyes.<br /><br />But there's no mode that you don't see red light.<br />So I assume the 850nm is here but it's together with the 660nm and can't be used separately.<br />That pretty much ruins the usefulness for me.<br /><br />>>> The belt gets a decent warmth on constant.<br />Comes with instructions - but could be more through.<br />Includes wall plug (2 types ) and USB cable.<br />A cloth to keep the center of the wrap clean.<br /><br />((( OTHER PRODUCTS= Usually =<br />> 660 nm of RED LIGHT can be seen and targets skin cells = gently warm<br />but not as warm as near infrared light<br />> 850 nm of NEAR INFRARED LIGHT can NOT be seen and targets deep tissue.=<br />gets very nice and warm - much more than red light )))<br /><br />Doesn't seem there should neg's at the current $148.00 price point. [SEP] Didn't work for more than 3 times [SEP] I suffer from a condition that causes swelling in my chest wall. It gets so bad it actually broke 2 ribs. I wear this thing for 2 days and can literally feel the inclination subside. Red light therapy changed my life for ever. [SEP] I bought this belt and to be honest waste of money: didn’t do anything and it kept unplugging due to the base. [SEP] I was excited to receive my belt. After less than 5 uses it stop working. It will no longer turn on. Waste of money.",3,True

The windshield is huge and it was always a big job to be able to twist around to get the windshield, especially at the very bottom.  This does the job.  it protects your knuckles too.  We tried it yesterday and it worked perfectly.  We still had to stretch but not contort ourselves to get the job done.  I used a bit of window cleaner and it really removed the haze effortlessly. It stays secure on your hand too. We haven't tried it on our stainless kitchen yet but that's next.  I think if the microfiber pad would be a tad bidder, it would work too.  it's just a nice product that makes the job of cleaning the windshield much easier. [SEP] I always end up with streaks when I clean my windshield, no matter how many times I do it or how careful I am. Same with the television screen, or the stainless steel appliances in my kitchen. Streak city.<br /><br />I like the design of the inShield Wiper. The two elastic straps hold it tight against my palm or the back of my hand. The white plastic board, between the black foam and the microfiber sponge, holds the sponge firm while cleaning various surfaces.<br /><br />The microfiber sponge itself is thick and looks well-constructed. According to the instructions, the sponge is machine washable.<br /><br />The wiper works pretty well on windshields, removing streaks. It’s certainly a lot easier to get the awkward spot right by the dashboard (works best to take it off your hand and hold an edge for that area).<br /><br />The instructions say to use DRY, but I had the best results using glass cleaner on the windows. Same with cleaning my television screen and stainless steel appliances -- using glass cleaner worked much better than using the sponge dry. [SEP] This is a nice microfiber sponge tool. I use it in the car to keep my windshield clear from fog. Spray on glass cleaner and wipe. My wish is that the sponge were larger. This is just a tad too small. It's one case where larger would have been better.<br /><br />I hate reaching on the inside of the windshield. We have a very steep pitch on our windshield which is fine for the outside but terrible for the inside. It is not a natural motion for me and I'm a little lazy about cleaning it regularly. This makes it much easier.<br /><br />The microfiber sponge is attached by Velcro to a hand backing surface that allows even pressure for cleaning. Handy when the windshield is just out of reach. The microfiber sponge is washable. I soak to clean in purified water to make it last longer. Just change the water until the water comes clean. [SEP] keeps my windows clear and smudge-free. I love the straps that allow me to keep a good grip on the pad while I'm cleaning. [SEP] Everybody knows how annoying is the cleaning of the bottom of the windshield. With this wiper, it is much, much easier. The whole idea is very simple. You can attach the small (it could be a little bit bigger) pad with microfiber to your palm, and you can easily clean any surface. Because you do not need to grab it, your hand is relaxed, and cleaning is much easier. This tool is not for windshields only. You can use it on many (not too big) surfaces.<br />I used it on the TV screen and my car windows.<br />I use a little bit of a detergent, that helps in cleaning. The microfiber can be removed from the pad and washed. [SEP] I got this for the inside of my car. I often get streaks on the inside of my car windows and can’t seem to get rid of them with car window cleaner or windex or paper towels so I tried this pad. It works well. It is easy to use too as it fits my hand nicely and gives me control. I’m going to keep it in my center console. [SEP] inShield Wiper Reusable Multi-use Microfiber Cleaning Tool- Washable Microfiber Cleaning Sponge to Easily Clean Windshield<br /><br />It’s a 50/50 when it comes to this item, It works but a microfiber cloth can do the same job. It’s can be use on multiple type of surface, I have small hands and getting in the base is not easy. And as it show on the picture I was only able to get In the top and once I start to wipe the glass it slides off my hand. That’s why I have mix feeling for this item. [SEP] This is a very good cleaning tool. I use it on the inside of my vehicles windshields as well as on my TVs and computer monitors. It cleans TVs and monitors well, and does an even better job removing blemishes and light haze on windows. There are two straps on one side; I believe they are designed to put your hands through to hold it, but they don't stretch well, and don't fit over my large hands. [SEP] I thought, ""how much better of a job can this thing do than just a cloth""... Well, A LOT! It's so simple but so effective...Good sized and secure with just the right amount of stiffness. I really helps with car windshields! Gets down in the valleys with ease. A gadget I never thought I'd need but now can use anything else. [SEP] Does not work well even after spraying with window cleaner, it leaves smears, has to wipe with cotton cloth to remove haze, so not an  useful product. Not recommended.",3,True

If it's only Chlorella you're interested in this is a great way to take it. I like both the powdered and capsule forms.

It is much cheaper if you buy it in bulk and mix it with water, but that also tastes pretty bad. So, if you need chlorella pills, I recommend this. [SEP] This green superfood is a type of algae that is full of nutrients. The broken cell wall makes it easier to digest. These capsules are vegan and free of any additives. This is manufactured in the USA and sold by a company in Miami Beach but it does not say where the chlorella is sourced from.

18 Bath Bombs Gift Set. Candle Gift Set. XL Candle-Shaped.

I have no idea what it was supposed to smell like. It didn’t smell bad, but my nose was clueless.<br /><br />The bath bomb didn’t fizz at all. It floated around the tub and slowly dissolved.<br /><br />The “Passion” bath bomb did color the water a deep green color that did not stain at all, so that’s a plus. [SEP] Absolutely loved them.

The price was good too, liked how there was a coupon for them too. Will definitely buying more in the future. Definitely recommend. [SEP] These are nice bath bombs. Each one smells a little different and since they are individually wrapped inside the box, you could gift them out or make them as stocking stuffers as well. The colors are fun, and they don't stain the water or your skin. These smell very nice and leave you feeling clean. [SEP] These bath bombs arrived in a lovely, heavy-duty gift box.  They are all individually wrapped and can be given as a set or broken up to use in individual gift bags or baskets.  I really like the scents but did find that a couple of the bombs were already starting to crumble.  Not a big deal since they will be dissolved in a bath anyway but it could be an issue if you are opting to give this as a gift.  The candle design would not be my first choice, especially if you want to give this as something other than a birthday gift but not a big deal if you’re purchasing for yourself.  Overall, this is a great set at a reasonable price.  At roughly $1 per piece, these are definitely a better deal than many others that I have purchased in bath and body shops. [SEP] Looks good. Smells good. Feels good. The scent is so good. I did not want to throw the box after use. [SEP] The smell was horrible. Smelled like an old granny with strong stout perfume that stinks up a storm and lingers. [SEP] They make the water a beautiful color but as far as anything else it was mediocre. No secant which was a bummer. [SEP] These bath bombs smell nice but they barely fizz which is disappointing. I've used a few and each time, they barely fizz. Their scent reminds me of essential oils. There's a few in here that I don't like how they smell but for the most of them, they smell really fragrant. The packaging is okay. Not the cutest. They break down in the tub and didn't notice any residue or of the such. Overall, they're okay but not my favorite and I wouldn't purchase again. [SEP] Absolutely love these scents!",3,True

It is hard to explain what the taste is like though.  I have tried the peanut butter chocolate ones and I do prefer those a little more than these.  These do not have as much flavor as they did to me.  This was more of a nutty natural taste.  I did not get much sweet or cherry taste. They are still pretty good though.

Just stay away from this stuff unless you like the rancid vitamin taste. [SEP] It’s easy to mix and it taste good.

I've now tried three different brands and I haven't noticed a single difference in my playing after drinking them.  As for Glytch, the taste was fine.  Sweet, but not overly so.  It mixed easily into water.  No residue at the bottom of the glass.  It's fine, I guess.  But for $35 I'd say it's a hard pass. [SEP] Usually when I see “sugar free”, I move right on to the next one, and it doesn’t really matter what we are talking about.  Going against better judgement, I decided to give this one (Glytch Gaming Energy Supplement) a try, and I am sure glad that I did.<br />Despite being sugar free, Glytch actually has a good flavor to it.  The label says it tastes like “Rainbow Magic”, though I’m not sure what magic tastes like, so I will say that it has a berry flavor that is not overpowering and is actually really easy to get down, unlike many energy supplements.<br />Within 20 minutes of drinking a single serving, I feel a noticeable increase in energy and motivation .  It makes me feel ready to do whatever it is that I have planned, either gaming, going to the gym, or going on a run.  It is a physical as well as mental effect which makes it really easy to focus completely on whatever it is that I am doing and even makes me feel excited to be doing it.  This energy supplement by Glytch really does work. [SEP] I am not a gamer, but I've added scoops of this to my water bottles during long rides (I am a cyclist) for an extra caffeine boost. It has a great flavor, reminiscent of ""blue raspberry"" flavoring used in candy. However, there is no added sugar, and it only has 15 calories, which is great! I've also used it during long drives to keep me focused and attentive, and it works well for that too.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like so much is that it contains food coloring to give the drink a very blue color. In my opinion, that is completely unnecessary. Besides the blue food coloring, I do not have complaints. The main ingredients are vitamins C, E and B plus  'performance' , 'energy', 'ocular', and 'antioxidant' blends, which consist of various fruit powders and vitamin blends. Each serving contains 175 mg of caffeine (1 cup of coffee has about 95 mg), so I rarely take more than 1 serving of this per day (the package says never to take more than 2). Overall, this is a good-tasting energy drink that works well for any activity that requires concentration, stamina, and focus. [SEP] I drink energy drinks, pre-work outs, post-work outs, etc some type of caffeinated jolt product every day otherwise I am practically useless.  I don't like overly sweet drinks and was worried this one would be.  It isn't sweet its just gross.  It has this off taste funky sour thing going on.  To the point that I couldn't chug it down.<br /><br />Now one of my work out friends loves it.  He thinks its great. So for Him this is like 4 stars.  For me its like 1.<br /><br />No jitters from the 1/2 portion I did take.  Price point is similar to other brands and overall packaging is really good. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:3eec922e589e907e5b121cf4a39cb1b4]] This is the best tasting energy drink yet! Has a super unique way to scoop and deliver the powder to your water...look at my photos and video...it’s a great idea and works well.<br />This gives good energy for my workout and I drink throughout. Good stuff at a good price! [SEP] So I am a major user of pre-workout drinks and use them for both working out, but also for getting through portions of my day and assisting with work, focus, everything. I was pleased to pick this up and will tell you that as a user of pre-workout drinks for 10 years now, its a pretty decent product.<br /><br />I am highly desensitized to caffeine and most energy supplements and, quite frankly, I’m totally turned off by many of them nowadays which leave me feeling almost nothing.<br /><br />I won’t say glitch is the type of energy supplement drink that is going to wire you up, make you want to pump iron, or do things you never normally want to do ;-). I think it’s a good blend of ingredients and definitely is something you are going to feel but not in a super strong way unless you are starting out new to energy supplements like this and have never used them before. If that’s the case, this might not be a bad one to try, but definitely start with half a scoop and assess your tolerance and reaction to it.<br /><br />From my perspective, I definitely notice there is more of a of a mental focus type affect than most other energy drinks I’ve used which is awesome. Obviously given this is geared towards gamers, which I am not one of, I see why it has that effect and for that I think it’s a great product. Given I have actually used it as a pre-workout supplement and recently used it before a very long bike ride, i’m overall impressed.<br /><br />The product mixes very easily and consistently. I’m not particularly crazy about the flavor but I really have come to not judge energy drinks by flavor so long as they mix well and are tolerable. This definitely falls squarely in the category of tolerable but not amazing as far as flavor is concerned!<br /><br />Good stuff, and a good addition to your list of options for an energy supplement! [SEP] This stuff is definitely blue in color and has a nice sweet tart like taste. The macros are actually decent and after initially testing it mixed with just water we ended up putting it in the freezer to partially freeze making a most delicious icee/slushy drink.<br /><br />Only thing I would do away with is the blue coloring as it is very pronounced and this product uses FD&C Red #1 along with sucralose. I would have preferred it missing those two components and let me sweeten it by my own choice.<br /><br />4/5 [SEP] Very good product with no “chalk” taste to it. Product dissolves into water and gives a boost when gaming. Been drinking it for last two months and really enjoy it",3,True

These are high quality and come in at a budget-friendly price. The length is longer than average to keep your sleeves dry. These sets come in several colors, so you can choose your favorite. I'd get several just to keep them on hand.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] I have been washing dishes a lot, since the dishwasher was not doing its job!!  But,  I believe I got the Medium size,  and they fit good, but not tight.  I have small hands,  and the Medium is not tight,  and not loose.  I can take them off easily and put them on easier.<br /><br />Washing dishes is tough for rubber gloves!  Knives and forks often make holes.  And,  these gloves are still going for me.  I like them.  They last long,  and no holes after many uses.  I have several pairs of these for the bathroom and kitchen!  Strong gloves,  last long! [SEP] These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] I've had several pairs of these gloves and they are great. Very durable, protective and comfortable.  5 stars! [SEP] I ordered these gloves to have reusable gloves available for when I shop at the grocery store.  I can avoid touching surfaces that are frequently contacted by others with these gloves.  Once I get back to the car I just wipe them down with a disinfectant wipe and leave them in the car until I need them again.  I have another pair staged by the entrance door; I use them to open packages, then disinfect them, and remove contents to place inside my house.  It is an extra barrier I can use as protection against COVID-19 without ordering any disposable gloves (which we all know should be going to those in the health care business). [SEP] We rec'd two pair.  One is lined and one is not.  The difference is immediately obvious.  Both are strong feeling with a nice comfort stretch.  The lined pair would be great for warmer or very cold solutions or cleaning jobs and they have a bit less ""touch or feel"" from inside as one might expect.  The lighter, unlined pair have heavier finger and thumb areas that you see indicated by the color but this is no way effects the ability to feel the pressure of your hand on the object it is touching.  They both have a ""grip pattern"" on the palm, finger, thumb areas that is very effective.  My wife has owned number of gloves similar and she said, without a doubt they are her new go-to when she needs them.  I watched her put them on and use them and run them under hot water the first time and there was no doubt that she was genuinely impressed. [SEP] I thought these gloves would be 'flocked inside' with some kind of discernable fabric texture.  Instead, these gloves have a very, very faint lining of some kind of powder like substance that left a slight powdery residue on my hands when I pulled them out.  Flocked gloves do not do this.  Additionally, these gloves are short on the arm allowing water to splash up and run down into the gloves.  I cannot comment as to durability as I have only used them once.  Also, since they aren't flocked, then do not protect against very hot water like flocked gloves do.  I can already tell that I do not like these and will not order them again. [SEP] I love having gloves for doing the dishes, these work great! Only think Is I wish they had a little more grip on them. I seem to drop things when using them. I do love the color choices ans the fit is great, I got size medium. I havnt used for anything other than dishes yet. [SEP] My wife uses all sorts of gloves to protect her hands and nails. She just loves these! A medium fits her well, like a glove should. She likes that the base of the glove comes up several inches past her wrist, which protects the sleeves of her blouse.  They are easy to dry out and look as if they are thick enough to last a while. Great gloves! [SEP] These gloves in a medium fit me as expected. I am an average-sized woman (5’ 4 ½”) with average-sized hands. The large fit is a bit loose for me, although wearable for jobs that don’t require manual dexterity, and it will be snug on my husband. These gloves do have flocking, which is much more comfortable than the unlined version.<br /><br />I use these gloves for crafting when I’m doing glass etching, dyeing, etc., where I need to protect my hands. I also use them for cleaning jobs where I use toxic chemicals. With some tasks, I was using two layers of disposable nitrile gloves, but these are a much better and sturdier solution. Not to mention reusable. I was looking for utilitarian gloves for tasks like this where I really need to protect my hands, wrists, and forearms. These have nice long sleeves, so they will protect more of my clothing and skin. Very pleased with these gloves.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

It has a nose wire and internal pocket for the supplied filters. The ear loops are adjustable with the silicone adjuster; however, they can fall off if adjusted too much. A lanyard would prevent them from falling off.<br /><br />There are two thick filters supplied as well.  The only big negative with this mask is that the medium adult size is more like a kid-size mask. I usually take a medium in a mask as I find the large is too loose. However, with this mask, I should have picked a large.<br /><br />The $19.99 price tag is also too expensive for this. If the sizing were right, it would have gotten 4 stars from me. If both the sizing and price were right (about $10), then it would have received 5 stars. [SEP] Biggest issue I had with these, besides having to replace filters, was the very poor fit around my nose. No matter what I tried I constantly fogged up my glasses which was a huge pain. [SEP] I am wearing masks everywhere I go. I have been searching for the holy grail of masks. I have used the pieces inside the mask that are supposed to make it more comfortable and cooler (doesn't work).  I have tried the K95 masks (even one that gives you a daffy duck look) and other K95 that are more comfortable. I have used home made, cloth masks and none keep me from fogging up my glasses or allow me some coolness when I talk. I think I am claustrophobic. [SEP] This is my 2nd purchase.  I bought my first one 1 year before Covid for my allergies.  I stopped taking my allergie medication and wore this during high pollen days and it worked great!  I am a Public City Bus Operator and use this mask every day for Covid.  Their filters are the best.  I only wish that MeoAir would offer more like they used to especially filters. [SEP] I've gone through a lot of masks even though I try to stay at home.  I've still got too many medical/dental/lab test appointments and ""emergency"" food runs.  Although most of my food shopping is delivery or curbside pickup, I still wear a mask for pickup.<br /><br />This is a well made made. The ear loops are adjustable and stay on reliably.  The filters are good quality (I tested them when it was cold enough to see your breath, and there was a significant difference when the filter was in the mask) and it is comfortable.  Although I double mask (this over a KN95) I do not have any issue breathing with this and another mask on.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied with this mask and would recommend it. [SEP] Per my wife: There are so many positive things to say about this mask! The design of the mask leaves a nice little air pocket right below my nostrils, making it easy to breathe even when I take a deep breath. Too many times I have felt the discomfort, bordering on paranoia, of feeling a mask sucked up into my nostrils when I was already short of breath. Never a problem with this mask! The adjustable nose band strip lets me get a perfect fit with every wearing so that I have no gaps and so that my glasses don't fog up even with heavy breathing. The wide, soft, stretchy and adjustable ear loops are very gentle on my ears and make it a pleasure to wear this mask for extended periods of time. The inner mesh lining is smooth and comfortable against my face and is also very easy to breath through. The mask comes with two filters, but the overlapping mesh layers inside the mask make me feel quite safe wearing the mask as is without using a filter for my normal everyday activities. It's definitely nice to know I have that option, however, before entering a more crowded or more unsafe environment. This mask is very well made. The stitches are nice and even, and all the outer seams are sewn with good heavy duty thread. The ear loops are a continuation of the upper and lower edges of the mask as opposed to attached separately, which makes for a much stronger mask. the only way those ear loops are coming off is if you physically cut them off. I have tried quite a number of masks over the last year, and so far this one is my definite favorite. 5 stars. [SEP] I ran across the meo lite mask and needed to try it because to my knowledge it’s the only mask that uses wool as it’s filter, which just sounds awesome. Also this mask is supposed to do a great job filtering coronavirus, basically as well as an n95 or kn95, but is reusable to save costs if you’re just using it to run to the market every so often.<br /><br />A little background on me: I currently live in an area that is hard hit with coronavirus. I usually only use homemade masks because I have a pronounced nose and wear glasses and store bought masks really have not fit well. I’ve been looking for a better filtering reusable mask since kn95s also do not fit me well.<br /><br />The meo lite mask feels well built. There are simple adjustments on the ear loops and the fabric is thick, soft, and well sewn. The filters themselves are also think and replaceable. They feel a lot more substantial than most reusable filters I’ve used, and the pocket where you place the filter is secure, much better than Velcro I’ve seen other reusable masks use.<br /><br />Wearing the mask is a little warm probably due to the wool, since it’s winter it hasn’t bothered me. It doesn’t feel like wool, and you don’t actually have the filter against your face so if wool itches you that shouldn’t be a problem. The mask is easy to breath through as well and for me it formed a solid seal around my face without fogging my glasses.<br /><br />The one downside I found is the medium mask does not cover under my chin. I personally prefer masks to hug the bottom of my chin because just feels more secure to me. I weigh 190 and am 6’ so usually I would buy a larger mask, but Amazon doesn’t carry this mask in large. My wife is much smaller than me and the mask fits her perfectly though.<br /><br />I personally am super impressed with the meo lite mask and have recommended it to my friends. I might try to hunt down a large size to see if it fits a little better than the medium.",3,True

Within just a few moments, there's a steady stream of steam coming out of the nozzle. It goes a fair distance, but to get the best coverage of your face with the steam, you will want to be about 15 inches below the nozzle.<br />The steam feels really wonderful and relaxing! It runs for about 4 to 5 minutes and really opens your pores to help clean away any impurities.<br />I really like the simplicity of this facial steamer, but would not consider it professional quality.

This does a great job of steaming your face, but can also be used for a lot more.  We also use it as a humidifier to put moisture in the air.  It does a wonderful job.  It’s also good when you have a cold or sinus infection.<br />It is very well made, easy to assemble and easy to use.  The water container is nice and thick and well marked.  It gives a steady stream of steam for about 30 minutes.  When the water gets low it will make a beeping sound so you know it’s time to either shut down or refill. It adjusts to the height to suit your needs.  It swivels easily for convenient  placement of the nozzle, so the hot steam can hit you just right. The four rollers on bottom make it easy to take from one place to another.  It is a  good quality product and I would recommend.

It works well to clean my monitor but leaving a streak on the monitor is not good. [SEP] These aren't amazing - they could certainly be a little thicker, but they do the job. Just a decent sized container of screen wipes. They aren't perfectly streak-free, but are as good as nearly any other pre-moistened wipe I've used. One wipe was enough for me to spot clean our 55"" tv screen where our toddler had splashed/sprayed milk from his sippy cup. It also seemed to offer some static resistance as the cat fur in the house wasn't immediately sucked back to the screen.<br /><br />Really, it's just the thickness that's keeping me from giving these 5 stars. [SEP] These do a nice job of cleaning fingerprints, smudges, and general grime from your electronics.  I use them for my laptop screen, phone, Kindle, and even the television.  They make cleaning your screens easy. [SEP] They don’t separate very easily and when you pull them out several come out.  They are small about the size of your hand so it takes a few to clean a monitor.  They dry out quickly when using.  I tried it on my phone and a computer monitor.  The monitor is very streaky.  The phone looks better.  I would only use this for cleaning phones and tablets. [SEP] These are very moist but not dripping wet and have a light lemon scent. I have used them to clean my glasses , phone , tablet and tv.<br />I have found the secret to getting streak-free result is to use the included cloth immediately after wiping with wet wipe. On my 65 inch tv I did small area , wipe with dry cloth and move to another area these eliminated most streaks by doing this.

It took a few seconds to find the center wipe and a couple of extra came out with it since I had not quite grabbed the end.  After that they all came out smoothly as expected.<br /><br />This comes with a polishing cloth which I used, after cleaning, on my phone and tablet.  I have a smart home so, in addition to monitors, I have a variety of AI devices with screens.  I cleaned all of them and these wipes left them bright and streak free. They do dry out fast compared to other types of wipes but that may be do to the different ingredients in specific purpose wipes. These do contain ethyl alcohol. They have a pleasant and mild orange scent.<br /><br />Ori-Lemoon Monitor Wipes work very well to clean fingerprints, smudges, etc. off of electronic screens.  I was so pleased with these wipes that I even used them on my eyeglasses which they also left clean and clear.  I like these screen wipes and would get them again. [SEP] These wipes come pre-moistened but are very damp.  I like that they have enough solution to clean, but not too much that I worried about using on my electronics.  As most wipes, you are going to pull from the center and more than what you need will come out.  I just push the unused wipes back into the container.<br /><br />I have used these on my touch screen monitor and also my cell phone.  I really like them.  Both were left clean with no excess moisture. [SEP] I was very impressed with these wipes.  We go way too long between cleanings of our computer and TV monitors.  Well-saturated cloths clean fingertips, smudges and dust very well and leave no residue behind.  Unlike other wipes I've tried, these do not attract dust 2 minutes after I use.  Recommend. [SEP] There's not a whole lot to monitor wipes besides two questions:<br />1. Do they work well?<br />Yes<br />2. Are they affordable and convenient?<br />Yes<br /><br />For that reason these win in my book. Beyond that, they came well packaged, the wipes themselves were sealed in plastic to keep wet.

Homesprit Strap Extender 12 PCS Reusable 3D Face Nose Mouth Bracket to Increase Space and 50 PCS Adjustable Strap Extender Non-Slip Ear Saver Strap Extension Ear Hook,[],[],,3.9,97,717,"This is a pretty good kit for making face masks a bit more tolerable and easier to be honest. For one you get 12 brackets that keep the face masks a bit more of your face. I like that these are washable and reusable. These don’t have a lot of material to them which is nice, makes them feel a lot more airy unlike some others. They do have little snags that helps you snag them onto the face masks, but the snags are not the greatest and it makes it not that easy to attach them to those 3 ply fold-able disposable face masks but you can make it work. More practice eventually leads in better results.<br /><br />Then you get 2 of those lanyard straps which I like. You can attach your face mask to that and when you don’t use it, like if you are out to dinner and you are eating and don’t have a place to put it, you can just hang it around your neck instead. I really like this so much better than any other solution out there like those little wallets for face masks.<br /><br />Lastly you get those ear protectors, little straps that you can attach the face masks behind your head to instead of securing the face masks to your ear and straining your ears. You get a lot of them. These are fairly cheap but they work. You get so many in fact that if they break who cares and you have still so many that you can share with friends, family and coworkers if you are so inclined. All this for $17, not a bad deal really. I think it is worth it and all these little gadgets help making wear masks a little bit more tolerable. [SEP] That strap on the back really makes masks stay on better and feel more comfortable, but the little cup insert thing didn’t really work for me.

The extenders are just hard plastic, so expect it to slide to down to your nape unless you have your hair in a bun to prevent it from moving. The cutouts are narrow as well, so really only surgical type mask loops will fit in there. I like the lanyards but since the ends are plastic I do worry that eventually they are just going to snap and break. [SEP] I personally detest wearing anything like this because, masks make my face break out and make me feel even more ill than I normally from hindering my breathing and making my existing Health problems worse. With that said, I have to say that this kit, with the little frame that goes over the mouth and nose, does help to keep a mask from completely smothering my face as bad as without it. I can commend these folks for putting together a nice little kit that has a mix of things to make this mess a little more tolerable and would definitely recommend them.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone! [SEP] Perfect to help breathe easier while wearing a mask [SEP] The mask bracket isn’t one size fits all but does a good job of keeping your mask from rubbing up against your face. Helps you breathe a little better and saves me from having to reapply my chapstick! The lanyard is great so you can hang your mask around your neck and not have to worry about putting it away and searching for it later after dining out. The ear strap extension hook definitely saves the ears from pressure from the mask! Overall this set will have you set for when you’re out and about and need to wear a mask. Very convenient! I leave this kit at the office so my coworkers can take advantage of these as well. Wish there were more lanyards thought. [SEP] These work great. I wish the gaiter masks were more accommodating for them because there’s hooks on them but no where to hook them. These keep me from sucking the mask into my mouth when talking. [SEP] This kit has everything a person needs in order to make wearing a mask as comfortable as possible.<br /><br />The kit includes 2 lanyards.  Each lanyard is 28"" long with a decently hefty cord lock which easily allows the lanyard to be adjustable to any length (see photo).  At the end of the lanyard is a plastic clip that can be used to attach to the mask ear loops.  The plastic clip is about the same size as a smaller paper clip.  I could imagine the plastic clip breaking over time, but hopefully a solution for ending the pandemic happens before the clips break. I wish I had these lanyards a few weeks ago when I went to run errands with my mom.  She kept misplacing her mask..too many pockets and places for a mask to hide.  A mask lanyard would have been ideal for my mom.<br /><br />Also included are 50 extenders that are 5 1/2"" long and can be used to wrap around the back of one's head and attached to the mask ear loops.  Each notch is approximately 1/8"" deep (see photo).  I tried to use the mask extender with a homemade mask that pretty thin elastic, but the extender didn't grip the elastic very well and I felt the mask would fall off my face.  However, when I tried it with a disposable mask, the extender worked perfectly.  I was even able to move the ear loops from notch to notch in order to adjust the mask without a problem.  The design of the extender allows for numerous head sizes.  I have a petite sized face and used the notches closest to the middle of the extender.  My husband has a big melon (his words..not mine).  The extender fits his head when he uses the furthest notches away from the middle.<br /><br />And, there are twelve 3D brackets included with the kit.  These brackets are the reason I ordered the kit.  I've been wanting something that would allow more breathing room inside my mask.  These soft and pliable 3D brackets help to keep the front of my mask away from my mouth so that I feel that I can breath more easily.  I am home most of the time and will only use these brackets when I am out running errands and need to wear a mask, so I cannot comment on  what happens when the brackets are worn for hours on end.  There are hooks on each side of the bracket that allow for the bracket to be attached to the folds of an accordion style mask.  I have an Olsen mask which doesn't have folds that the bracket can latch onto.  I am going to sew a couple of eyes (as in a hook and eye closures..like the kind one uses on skirts) on the inside of my cloth mask so that the hooks on the side of the bracket can be used to keep the bracket secure.<br /><br />This is a great product!  Highly recommend. [SEP] The lanyard is sort of a throw away but if you remember it (and remember to wash it!) it can be useful. (Try hanging it from your rear view mirror with a mask attached.<br />The items are being shared and reviewed by a family of healthcare workers (RDH, MD, EMT, RN) for professional and personal use.<br />None seem to be fans of nose/mouth brackets in the professional arena, it’s just another layer of PPE but for teachers and retail it surely is a matter of preference and this package offers a wide variety of products to try at a fantastic price.<br />The ear savers (mask extender) are stiff and thin and we liked these as they stayed in place much better than those made of silicon. (The general consensus is I’ll use most earsavers!)",3,True

I The tub is very small! I didn't realize that it was a sample size. So the price isn't as attractive as it seems.  Other than that complaint, I can recommend it. Isn't too sweet, and definitely works. [SEP] Gives alot of energy you will definitely sweat and increase your workout I love it. [SEP] Alphalion has been advertising free protein if you buy their pre-workouts so i thought i'd try this before i commited to buying their products.  I bought the bottle that has 14 servings.  I will say that the flavor is good, but this pre-workout didn't do much for me. I went back to my old pre-workout that works wonders for me.  But since I bought this one, have to use it up so i just mix it with my old pre-workout.  I'll stick to what works for me.  :P [SEP] The Hulk Juice flavor is named sour gummie bear which I don't think fits.<br />This is a sweet / SLIGHTLY sour drink that's quite good. Sour isn't predominate<br /><br />The powder mixes especially well with a spoon.<br />It's quickly - thoroughly blended but does settle a tiny bit, not as much as many,<br />but may need to swirl around the last swallow.<br /><br />For me the drink kicks in energizing in 1/2 hour and lasts through the day.<br />This is good for a workout - general work - PC. - and without jitters.<br /><br />This is a small tub of 4.47 oz. - I measured = there's 14 scoops - scoop included.<br />Serving for beginners = one scoop in 6-8 oz water = 14 servings<br />> Advanced = two scoops in 8-10 oz water = 7 servings.<br /><br />I use ginseng / energy shots / drinks / gummies / capsules / etc.<br />So I'm kinda aware whats enough for me = and one scoop is it.<br />Two scoops would likely be fine but I'd be flying and nervous.<br /><br />Among other ingredients to support the speed and energy of the body and mind<br />> the powder contains 150 mg caffeine per scoop (as Anhydrous caffeine) meaning<br />it has no water as to not impede it's impact.<br />> Plus a tiny bit more in the green coffee bean / green tea extract<br />So with a cup of perked coffee containing 90 mg this is approx 2 cups of coffee.<br /><br />Drink 15-30 minutes before repeated action.

It gives me a good clean energy feeling without any jitters. I will be buying the full-size version next. Recommend this for someone who wants to try it without committing to a full canister! [SEP] I tryed the hulk juice, it was pretty good .I do think it's over priced for the 15 serving  size but over all it  was good. [SEP] Smells good and taste good nice product [SEP] I ordered this to try something new, maybe find a hidden gem. This pre workout does not disappoint!<br /><br />The flavor is great, albeit not very sour. The gummy bear flavor is there though, and it's actually quite nice compared to many that I've tried in the past. It does a good job of covering up the chemical flavor of the various stimulants without coming off as overly fake or sweet. The color doesn't match the flavor, but I really don't care much: it's just something to know.<br />The only complaint I have is the price to product ratio, 14 servings of this costs as much as 30 servings of other products. That being said, if you're really into this sort of thing, I'm sure some people will find a good value here.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this pre workout! It gives clean energy without too many tingles, and the flavor is honestly the best I've ever tried. It's a bit pricey, but worth the money. [SEP] Need a boost?  Try this and be ready.  LOL.<br /><br />It's well designed to give you intense energy to destroy your workouts.  I was in full blown go mode and ran through my program like a machine!<br /><br />Try it! [SEP] Tropically flavored pre-workout drink.  It would be better if carb count information were provided for people on Paleo/Keto diets.  I'm pretty experienced at taking pre-workout drinks so needed to use two scoops to get the pre-workout boost that I am accustomed to.",3,True

Great size bags for gifting hair straighteners, curling wands, hair brushes, cooking utensils, and more. Honestly a great size and shape for gift bags! [SEP] These bags are nice-ish, but definitely not for ""spirit"" bottles. They don't have a cardboard in the base, the glue feels weak, and the paper feels weaker.  If you put a nice bottle of wine in one of these, you'd want to carry it by the bottom, not the handles.  The ""paint"" on the outside came a little scratched, even though the bags were in a sealed plastic bag themselves.

Any issues and we will replace a new one and make things right for you.']",[],74.99,3.7,32,2444,"The device comes with one battery. You unscrew the bottom of the device, put the battery in, and screw it back together. Then you unscrew the top and use the included USB charging cord to charge the battery whenever it's low. A red light next to the USB port indicates charging and green is charged. You screw on the top to use. The button is at one end and the lights at the other. The three LED therapy lights are very small, but they seem quite powerful. They shine brightly through my hand joints. My initial impressions are that this does help with my arthritis inflammation. The light should be used against bare skin and can be held directly against the skin. One of the lights is infrared (heat), so the head can get warm and you may need to let it cool (while off) before continuing to use it. It has 10 minutes before automatic turn-off, and the head only gets mildly warm by the end of that time . The therapy area (lighted area at the end) is 0.75"" across, so the downsize is the limited area that you can treat at one time while the advantage is that it's battery-powered portable. The power button sequence is: one press = on, two = off, three = strobe light, four = off. I don't like how fast the strobe light pulses and so will never use it. You never have to see the strobe if you just hit once to turn on and once to turn off (and wait before turning it back on).<br /><br />When placed on a hard surface, the little stand will hold the light pointed where you want it. I see no point to using the stand as distance decreases the penetrating power of the light hitting your skin. [SEP] I am not yet sure of the claims and the effectiveness but I have been told about infrared-light therapy in the past – especially for pain.  I have issues with my ankles and tendons and have torn my achilles tendon in the past.  I still have pain most of the time so thought I would give this a try.  I never heard of the red-light therapy for skin issues but am still fighting an allergic reaction on my hands to something I used in home repairs more than a month ago – so wanted to try it there as well.<br /><br />The instructions say to use the light one to three inches from the surface of your skin as otherwise you may burn your skin.  I do not think the head of this things where the light is emitted gets that hot.  It gets warm.  So, I did not get any burns even when I put it directly against skin.  Although I did not hold it in one particular place but rather moved it around slightly.  The body of the flashlight gets hot though – well not hot per se, but more very warm – much warmer than the head at least – I should say that is where I felt all the heat.<br /><br />For my ankle – it didn’t make it feel any worse and after using it at night I felt no pain in my ankle.  My pain is not constant, though anyway.  I tried it on my left hand as well – where the prickly skin is from my allergic reaction.  Upon waking the next day, my left hand looked better – less red – than my right hand.  But to be honest, my right hand is my dominate hand – so it might have been worse off to start with.  Suffice it to say, I am going to continue to use this device on my ankle tendons and on one hand to truly see if I get relief – and long-term relief at that.  So far, so good.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] This pen light is a wonderful product to own.  My husband had surgery several years ago for torn tendons and a rotator cuff.  It has always caused him pain.  He has been using this pen light faithfully every evening for the last few months and it has helped so much with his pain.<br />The stand that comes with the light is very useful. It really helps to have hands free convenience.  There is a user manual included and it’s very informative and easy to understand.

[SEP] [[VIDEOID:b0e163de1d81e5a6cea7bc5f5fec9559]] My red light therapy device NEVER lets me down when I need that quick relief from those stubborn aches and pains that plague my body after my marathon runs! Not only does it give my muscles relief, but it works well on my joints also! [SEP] There seems to be more pen shaped devices offering red light therapy features.  And, usually, their offerings are only in that specific red light wavelength spectrum.  This product offers both Red Light Therapy and Near InfraRed Light Therapy, 660nm wavelength and 850nm wavelength respectively.  The main difference between the two is the depth of penetration of the light therapy.  Red Light deals more with aspects closer to the surface of the skin, while Near Infrared Light can affect deeper within the skin to more directly affect muscles and subcutaneous tissue.<br />Some assembly is required in this instance.  The bottom section unscrews to reveal the battery compartment. They supply 1 rechargeable battery.  In this design form, when the rechargeable battery goes bad, you can purchase a replacement, and continue using the product.  In other products, with a 'fixed' installed rechargeable battery, when the battery fails, the product is finished.  And, rechargeable batteries do eventually fail.<br />In another clever design move, they made the top section removable, too.  This reveals the usb-c charging port.  There is a small indicator light near the charging port. While charging it glows red, and then green when fully charged.  It takes 4 - 5 hours to fully charge a depleted battery.  The defined treatment session is 10 minutes, after which the device will automatically power off.  The user manual states that it can be operated up to 12 times on a single charge.  So, basically 2 hours of expected operating time.<br />Besides the usual accessories (protective eyeglasses, drawstring pouch and usb power cable), they include a tripod with flexible legs and an adapter clamp to hold the light therapy pen.  This is a smart and clever addition, which allows the user to position the device handsfree.  This addition boosts the rating.  It's an accessory that I never considered with our other light therapy 'pens'.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.  Various angles and provided for a comprehensive overview of the light therapy pen, with closeups of key aspects/features.<br />The product offers 660nm and 850nm wavelengths, for Red Light and Near Infrared Light therapies.  It's smartly designed, with the product exhibiting quality materials and construction.  It satisfies expectations for a portable, reliable dual wavelength light therapy pen.  Thus, earning a 4.75+ star rating, with a very high level recommendation. [SEP] Easy to use, you don’t feel anything. Great for travel. Takes a few weeks to notice improvement but helpful. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:2560621db15eacb7482c03d4fe50d494]] Nice light. Feels sturdy, aluminum, built in charger. Comes with a tripod with light holder, which is nice to have...Tripod quality is lower tier but functions well. The light works well, despite the small emiters. What I don't like is the strobe function, they call it pulse but it's just a strobe function and IMO has no benefit and is super annoying...More annoying is you have to cycle through the strobe light every other click.<br /><br />For the price, I expected better. It's not terrible but just okay. [SEP] I am not sure how well this works as I do not have a way to measure its claims.  That being said it clearly emits a strong red light that is visible and likely emits the near IR light it claims to.  IT is easy to assemble and use and I love that it is rechargeable.  It does come with safety glasses I recommend using to protect your eyes, even when using for short periods.  There is also a bendable tripod that is easy to adjust and aim at almost any direction.  There is also a charging cord but not brick so you will need a USB slot to plug it into.  The small size makes it very portable as well.  The presentation is very nice with a sturdy box with interior slots for the pieces.

"MONQ Essential Oil Blend, Roll On, RELIEVE - Pure Essential Oils in a Carrier Oil Blend - Topical Aromatherapy - Feel Supported with this Blend of Ginger, Spikenard and Helichrysum - Doctor Approved",[],[],,3.5,57,2023,"I use essential oils by themselves before my yoga practice and typically choose ones not diluted in a carrier oil. Even then, the scent only lasts about ten minutes.<br />This combination is just wonderful. Clean, fresh, uplifting and balancing.<br />Great for men and women as it’s not floral.<br />I put it on both wrists and found myself being drawn to its unique blend. There’s something really captivating about it: energizing yet soothing. [SEP] while packaged attractively and according to the company website - all organic ingredients, it is not clear how much evidence there is for the long-term (or short term) effectiveness of the aromatherapy blends.  This particular blend is heavy on ginger but dissipates very quickly.  While no doubt the initial whiff provides a positive awakening energy, it doesnt linger long enough to be able to notice significant change in mood or any symptoms.  Unsure if at this price point, it provides significant advantage over using one's own blends in diffusers. [SEP] Pros:<br />The scent is great<br />I like the consistency of the oil when applied to my skin<br />My aches in my arm feels lessen after use<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cannot think of any !!! [SEP] Comes well-packaged and is very suitable for gifting.<br /><br />Scent is rather bland at first hit.  Once you give it a while to work warm up and settle in on the skin it does open up a bit.  Complex - but a still a bit muddy.<br /><br />This is not an amazing scent.  Not really memorable.  But nice and subtle enough for everyday use or gym roll on.<br /><br />I'll continue to use it and update this review. [SEP] First, the good: This product comes in a package with a roller ball in it, so it is easy to apply topically. The bottle is dark, so it protects the oils inside.<br /><br />Now, the middling: The scent is tolerable, but not particularly mind blowing. It doesn't last long.<br /><br />Finally, the bad: I didn't notice that this blend of essential oils really did much for me. It certainly didn't offer me any relief, mostly because it wasn't strong enough to last for any length of time. I won't be buying this product again. [SEP] I ordered this as a handy roll-on to keep in my purse for a pesky pop up headache.  It seems to relieve some of the pain and smells good, but it leaves a lot of oily residue that I have to rub in.  If I wanted to rub the oil in, I would just use a dropper.  It has a pleasant lemon smell and really doesn't take long to absorb after I rub it in, I just don't like the fact I have to.  I do use it quite often with pretty good results. 3 stars may be a bit harsh but the oiliness is a big minus for me. [SEP] A beautiful and elegant 10 ml bottle, label, and cap - perfect for a gift. The roll-on is perfect for topical use. Very dark glass to maintain the oils' properties. Unfortunately, the label doesn't include a full list of ingredients (you can find it only on their website which is not convenient). The blend has a pleasant aroma and consists of Ginger, Spikenard, Helichrysum, Bergamot, Copaiba, Frankincense Carterii, Geranium, German Chamomile, Lavender, Nerolina, Organic Jojoba Oil, Roman Chamomile, Rosalina & Spike Lavender. [SEP] This is a nice oil blend. It’s a relaxing smell. I enjoy using it at the end of the day. My wife likes it as well. There’s no need to use to much, it has a strong smell. It also washes of easily. [SEP] Lovely oil that is lightly scented.  It absorbs quickly leaving a pleasant aroma.  I've been using it before bedtime and I think it leads to a more restful sleep.  I like that it has a metal roller ball instead of the usual plastic.  I'm not very well versed in essential oils and the subtle differences between various types.  I do know that I very much like these MONQ blends. [SEP] I am a yoga teacher and I use this in my classes. We do hands-on assists and I like having a yummy scent on when I go near students, to help relax them. I roll this on and usually get asked what the scent is, because it's really unique and smells sweet but also earthy. Highly recommend!",3,True

The cord is a bit problematic. I'm going to try using it with a battery pack and see if that fixes ""the problem"". Also will make a good gift for those that do the whole sinus thing or need a nice dark eye mask. [SEP] When you have eye fatigue, headaches, sinus pressure that makes your eyes hurt, this little compress that puts steam and heat on your eyes can help. There are times that my sinuses get so bad, I have sharp pain right behind my eyeball. This seems to help [SEP] It's ok. I dont particularly care for the material it's made out of, and the cord that it of course comes with makes it awkward, I dont feel comfortable/safe to wear it to bed without getting tangled up in it. It heated up quickly about 5-7 minutes, and it does have various time and temperature settings which I liked. It came with a small squirt bottle I'm not sure what exactly that for. All it all it does what its supposed to, but I doubt I'll use it much except for maybe a headache. [SEP] My eye doctor wants me to use a warm, damp compress on my eyes once a day.  It's not always practical, and the electrically heated ones seem to work better in my experience..<br /><br />I love that this eye mask has a silk cover, which should be much better for the skin around my eyes.  I haven't spritzed it yet but it seems to get my own eyes to release tears, at the least.  I have another heated mask which seems to run longer, and at a higher top heat than this, but half an hour's probably all that's practical anyway, and I don't want it to be too hot.<br /><br />I'd put the cord on the other side of the mask, if it were up to me.  Also, the nose cutout isn't realistic for Western noses, though it does work.  My bridge is just too high for this to fit just right.  Other than that, I'm happy with it.  That said, which mask will I take with me when traveling?  I believe it will be this one, as it's less bulky, and the silk is so nice.<br /><br />If my review was helpful, please click the button below.",3,True

I spray a bit of cleaner around the bowl, put on a plastic glove and scrub with the pumice stone. Those nasty hard water stains come right out.<br /><br />These stones are fairly large but easy to handle. This pack should last a while. [SEP] I have hard well water. My toilet gets build up really fast. Nothing gets the build up off except for pumice toilet sticks. Once a week I scrub the bejesus outta my toilet with the pumice stick & it keeps the bowl in good shape. For the hole the water exits through, I have to awkwardly chip out the build up (usually once a month) with a flat head short screw driver because I can't get the pumice that far into the hole. [SEP] I tried it, but can’t say it did better than using a spray cleaner and a brush. I cleaned one side first to see if there was much difference. Other than removing the top particles, which anything would have done, it didn’t make much difference to the actual stain in the bowl. There’s a lot of scrubbing, time and elbow grease involved in using this and since there’s no wand attachment, you practically have to sit next to the commode to use it. [SEP] There is nothing that gets stains out of toilet like a pumice stone! You don't even have to use any chemicals at all, just this stone and water.<br /><br />The best part is that it doesn't leave scratches like I thought it might.  It's possible that they are there but I sure don't see them.<br /><br />The only thing this is missing is some kind of reusable handle and maybe a filtered storage.  When you want to quickly clean and you don't want to have to put on gloves, and then after you use it, you're searching for someplace to set it down!  Nevertheless, it really does the trick getting rid of stains, even if the stains have been there for months.  I have one in each of my four bathrooms. [SEP] I have really hard water at my house and as a result, it ends up leaving hard water stains in the toilet, bath, shower - everywhere!  No cleaner gets these stains off - I had to google what was effective.  Pumice stones are amazing, but they wear away (so you need the pack of six!  I am able to clean my entire house, 3 toilets and 3 tub/showers and there is only about an inch of wear on the stone.  It works on glass (with water) and all porcelain.  I also have a cast iron tub and it works wonderfully on getting the hard water stain out.  Highly recommend pumice stones for anyone that has grime or grit in their bathroom. [SEP] The toilet in my master bathroom had a bit of a continuously running water that caused my toilet bowl to get these stain. I ordered the pumice stone because these stain doesn't get scrubbed with a typical toilet brush.<br /><br />The order comes with six (6) pumice stones. It's the best scrubbing tool there is to get the stain off. The stones have textured particles that will help with the scrubbing. The stones start to wear down with each use. Thankfully, with much scrubbing I've done, the toilet bowl surfaces were not damaged. It was just as white as before.<br /><br />Each stone lasts a long while and you don't need any additional chemical or cleaning agent. The only thing is these stones do not come with a holder or stick. [SEP] Works on toilet and removed lime from granite [SEP] These will work for me, and last a long time. I have really bad water stains and mineral deposits in my toilet, and this got rid of most of it at first try... I got tired (my stains are that bad) and the rest should be easier to tackle. What I was able to tackle came off fairly easily. [SEP] These pumice stones have officially made it into my must have section for cleaning supplies. These particular stones are longer and rectangular in shape. They have a lightweight feel but are easy to grip because of their longer size. For me, I use the stones corners for smaller areas or to really work certain areas needing a deeper clean. The pumice does wear away which also helps with melding it to the area I am working with. The stones are natural and I like that they don’t contain any chemicals. I don’t find that they have an odor either. They work well and because they are rough they don’t take very much pressure. Instead consistent pressure and forward/back motion to get an area clean is all it tales. I have used them in sinks, toilets and my tub. Of course not all the same stick. But I do like that this is a multipack. This is also a good set because there are six individual bars to use. They come individually wrapped too so they stay in pristine condition until your ready to use them. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:b6b9e7fb29337dba3cfed77f93ad002]] These six (6) pumice stones come individually wrapped in plastic.<br /><br />When I unwrapped a pumice stone, tiny bits of pumice debris fell on to the counter. It's not a big deal, just something I noted.<br /><br />The pumice stone felt light in my hand. It has an abrasive texture.<br /><br />I wet the pumice stone before I use it to avoid excessively scratching those surfaces.<br />I like how well these pumice stones worked to get rid of the stains and rust rings of our sinks and toilets, although it took a lot of scrubbing to remove those stubborn stains.<br />I like that although the pumice stone does get smaller the more times that I use it, the stone did not break off into multiple pieces.<br /><br />Lastly, the product description page has good details and tips on how to use the pumice stones. The product I received did not contain any information, just the pumice stones themselves.<br /><br />Overall, these pumice stones helped make our surfaces look better.",3,True

"URBEST Electric Hand Massager, Cordless Rechargeable Wrist Finger Massager with Heat and 3 Levels Air Compression",[],[],,3.9,32,16227,"This massager is pretty neat.  I have tried one or two others that were very similar although I think I prefer this one.  Wy?  Because unlike the two others that REALLY crushed my wrist – like trying to remove it from my hand – with some of the settings – nothing here does that.  Sure, on some of the modes you feel it more in the wrist area – but it is not too crazy.<br /><br />It is easy to operate and there are three main modes and then three levels of intensity for each.  There is also one button for heat – and let’s face it, who doesn’t always want to use the heat? : )  It is easy to charge and the charge seems to last quite a long time – definitely multiple uses easily.  It also has clear instructions of how your hand should fit and rest – the others I have tied had no such instruction.  So, this is helpful for proper placement of your hands.<br /><br />If you are not used to this type of machine, I would definitely say work up to the strongest modes.  Personally, I like to star on the first mode at the lowest setting.  After a few minutes I switch it to the next mode on the lowest setting, then after a few more – the next mode.  Then I circle back to the first mode but put it on level 2 – and then I do the same for the next two modes. Circling back once again, I do each for a few minutes at the highest intensity. When I remove my hands – the dots are present in my skin – but my hands feel great.  Working up is the way to go.  I really do like using this machine.<br />I hope that you have found my review “helpful”. : )  Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] [[VIDEOID:8ae3cf489b8f4912dfd4bd86857bccbb]] This is a great product for those that use their hands a lot it is a deep massage great value for the money [SEP] I have, thanks to a combination of spending a lot time on the computer and slinging boxes around at work, the occasional twinge in my wrist that may or may not be carpal tunnel (undiagnosed). The occasional PAINFUL twinge that interferes with the previously mentioned activities when it occurs.<br /><br />While the fact I have one of those ""on your feet all day"" retail positions means I can't exactly use this at work at a moment's notice, it takes care of the problem quite nicely at home.<br />Well, sometimes. See, while it has a rechargeable battery, it can't be used while charging. Maybe a safety feature, maybe flawed design, I don't know, but it means that for a product that only lasts a few sessions per charge you have to remember to charge it regularly... or wait until it's charged when you might need it most. It's also quite bulky which limits where I can be while I'm using it; need to declutter besides the point, my current desk would probably work but I would never have been able to use this when I was dependent on a tiny little student desk, and it's really not comfortable enough to sit in my lap the way one of the official product photos suggests.<br /><br />But when it works, it works well. Heat if you want it, something resembling the fine-pointedness of acupressure (that'd be what makes all of those temporary pressure marks in your skin when you use it), multiple pressure intensity options, multiple modes depending on where you want to focus that pressure.... And a timer indicator that works in five-minute increments, giving you somewhat an idea of how much time you have left during your current session.<br /><br />My two biggest problems that I think need addressing both relate to power.<br />One is mentioned above and that's the inability to use it while it's charging.<br />The other is that it uses the much older style round plug-in on the UNIT'S side... and USB on the charging end, making it difficult to charge if you don't have any shelves conveniently near a USB port without investing in a USB extension cable (not included) and all but impossible to swap cords if and when the included one wears out, unless in both cases you're lucky enough to find a ""universal"" cord that has the right size connector. Frankly, if they were going to use USB they should've gone USB the entire way, charge it with as universal an option as if I were charging my cell phone. [SEP] Overall we are pretty happy with this product. It is easy to use and functions well. The quality is good for the price and has held up well to our use.<br />Overall i would recommend this unit. [SEP] Okay, this is an awesome little machine. It's small enough to sit on a desk or end table, the battery charges quickly, and the various modes let you choose between several combinations of heat/massage strength/pressure and duration.<br /><br />The only downside is that if you don't have your hand positioned quite right, the pressure on your forearm just back from the actual wrist joint can be almost painful even on the lowest setting. However, turning it off and adjusting my hand/wrist to a slightly different position solved that issue.<br /><br />Also, it gives a very strong massage, even on low. I'd definitely have to work up to using higher levels!<br /><br />I think this is a good product, has enough options for almost anyone to find one that is comfortable and works for them, and is a good value for the listed price. My starting-to-be-arthritic hands are very, very happy! [SEP] I gave this to my aunt who experiences a lot of arthritis & pain in her hands and joints. She absolutely LOVED it!  Although she did yell out once when it happened to touch a very sensitive spot, for the most part she was sighing with delighted relief. [SEP] Just about everybody in my family has hand issues ranging from arthritic joints to carpal tunnel.<br /><br />Treatments in the past have ranged from hot wax dips (a mess if you’ve never tried one) to hot and cold compresses and the occasional (yet amazingly expensive) medical injection.<br /><br />So, I decided to give this a try (or, more accurately, relatives gave it a try).  It seems to combine the purported effects of hot and cold compresses without the mess and bother.<br /><br />This is essentially a large plastic box with an included rechargeable battery and controls on the top for heat/cold, timer, etc.  Just for the sake of simplicity, you get 3 modes and the ability to turn the heat on or off.  No need to worry about complicated codes or button pushing.<br /><br />Expecting something possibly miraculous, I was surprised to take a close look at the internals and discover it’s a modified blood pressure cuff. or an inflatable wrap if you so desire.<br /><br />And here’s another surprise - you had better not have big hands.  This works if your hand is small or not swollen with arthritic joints.  Great if your hand is petite, but the fit might be a bit much for larger hands.<br /><br />However, for the average person this might be just the ticket.  Using alternating pressure cycles (inflate, deflate, inflate, deflate....) this unit provides a firm, yet comfortable, massaging action.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, if you're looking for something portable, this isn't it.  It's larger than most tablets in surface area and several inches thick. [SEP] Pros:<br />Rechargable battery.<br />Strong pressure.<br />Stronger pressure.<br />Strongerest pressure.<br />If you like compression massage to your hands OMG so nice.<br />Turns itself off after 15mins.<br />Can be manually turned off.<br />3 modes focus the massage differently, but I didn't feel too much variation.<br />Heats up... sorta.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Will not function while plugged in.<br />Makes noise.  Not much, but it's kinda like ""hmmmmmmmm tsssssssssssssssssssss"" as it compresses and then releases the pressure.<br />Probably not good for BIG hands.  I'm a fairly average guy and it worked fine but was pretty tight.<br />Doesn't... release?  Not sure if this is a hand-size issue or not, but turning this thing off doesn't seem to release the compression of your hand.  I was still able to easily wiggle my hand out but I really felt like it would/should ""tssssssssssssssssssssssssss"" and release all pressure.  It doesn't.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />I can't say if this is worth the price.  I like it, and will absolutely use it again if I do some yardwork or whatever and my hands are sore/beat.  Probably a cool thing to pull out at a family get together and let some folks get a hand massage.  Certainly a cool gift idea.<br /><br />it's a bit bulky and I can only describe the ""heat"" as ""mild"".  To be fair I am not 100% sure the heating part did much of anything as my hands were already warm.  It warns it ""may"" leave dots on your hand that will go away.  It does.  Lots of them.<br /><br />This is probably more geared towards women or persons with smaller more dainty hands.  I do think it does it's job. [SEP] Very relaxing and feels great, especially if you are the type to use your hands a lot. First time I used one was at a massage and I had to get one. It’s easy to use and real user friendly. It had three different modes and a heating option which is nice. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:28b41da2dec2d1153a4fb0e3d8f14dab]] **TLDR pros/cons at the end of this review**<br /><br />I have a lot of hand/wrist pain and weakness from my chronic illnesses and am constantly looking for tools to provide some relief. This will be a nice aid when I'm in flares or am unable to manipulate manual tools.<br /><br />First impression aesthetically: The massager is a bit bulky and looks like something out of a ""futuristic"" cartoon. It will take up some space for storage, particularly since the instructions advise keeping it in the original box.<br /><br />Practicality: This item has very specific and limited usage, which makes the current price feel a little high. Additionally, the charger form factor is a bit limiting and you'll need an adapter if you don't have USB specific charging ports available.<br /><br />Usage: The instructions are simple to follow and describe the three modes, although the names for each aren't too helpful in understanding their effects. It would be more practical if they described what function they serve. If you have small to averagely large hands, there's enough space to rest them comfortably, with room for your thumb on either side. The inner lining is smooth and feels nice against your skin. It's simple to select the mode you'd like or to add heat.<br /><br />Sensory: This may take some getting used to, depending on your sensory needs. I experience discomfort when things press stop my cuticles/nails, so I may not use the refresh mode as much. The compressive aspect is a bit bizarre initially and made me internally squirm a bit, but after a few minutes you get accustomed to the feeling and it becomes relaxing. I was able to close my eyes and enjoy the pressure and heat as the little nodes did their thing. I particularly enjoy the feeling on my wrists, as their norm is to feel loose and pained. This provided at least some temporary relief from finger stiffness.<br /><br />My doughy EDS skin takes on texture impressions (so don't worry, you probably won't see the pattern of the nodes when you remove your hand), but I figured I'd include a photo to give you a better idea of the internal workings. The size of each massager remind me of the side of an small pony bead.<br /><br />Overall, I can see this having some positive benefits regarding relaxation and relief from general discomfort. It's a good tool to make hand massage more accessible for those of us with mobility/grip issues and/or disabilities. I'll be sure to update this review if further usage causes concerns or additional benefits.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Different modes and levels, plus heat<br />-Helps enliven stiff/cold fingers.<br />-Easy to operate, can fit variety of users<br />-Relaxing, good self care to add to your routine<br />-More accessible hand/wrist relief option for the chronically ill or disabled<br />-Fairly quiet when running<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Bulky<br />-Cost may be tough to budget for<br />-Charging form factor is limiting<br />-Specific usage<br />-May trigger sensory issues or initial flight reaction due to compression sensation (start at the low setting, you may adjust quickly and find it relaxing)<br /><br />Update: Originally 4/5, now 3(3.5)/5. I've used the hand massager for 45 minutes to an hour total after fully charging it when it arrived. While it's convenient to not be tethered to an outlet, it's disappointing that the unit turned off just now when I tried using it. For the current price, I thought the battery would last longer before needing a recharge. Also, I usually use this with headphones on and my eyes closed, so I didn't see the warning light flashes when the battery died during use. It doesn't seem that the nodes are repositioned prior to shutting down (the machine just stopped during a compression cycle).",3,True

I got this one because the ingredients seemed good, and I had never tried this kind before. It does not foam up like most toothpastes which some people may not like. My only concern about this toothpaste is that it contains silica which is ok to use but I also read it could wear down enamel. Because of this I probably wont be using this as my regular toothpaste and may make it a weekly or biweekly thing. Makes my teeth feel clean though! [SEP] This is actually and a pleasant taste.  My teeth felt super smooth and appeared whiter.  I have only used it for a week,<br />but I really like it.  I have sensitive teeth and usually use a toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth.  So far my teeth do not hurt after not using a sensitive toothpaste.<br />However, I think the price is high for my budget, but it is not a unusual price in the broad market of toothpaste.<br />Recommend [SEP] First time use with this product gave my mouth a fresh clean feeling. The mint flavor is mild and pleasing. I felt no burning in my mouth or lips.  The gel is thick and I had to press the tube harder than normal, but after about a 2 minute brushing and then rinsing out with just water, my teeth felt clean and bright.  I like that it doesn't leave a gritty feeling after brushing and it did brighten my teeth color.  My opinion is the product was a good experience and I certainly recommend it. [SEP] When it comes to these natural type toothpastes, people are not comfortable with things like the toothpaste is not creating foam. This toothpaste reminded me of when I have used baking soda for toothpaste. We have become accustomed to strong chemicals in our products and it's not a good thing. I personally felt this toothpaste cleaned well and freshened my breath. It tasted like spearmint. It wasn't an over powering flavor. This toothpaste didn't having me gagging or drowning in mint. I always use a firm toothbrush when cleaning my teeth for maximum effectiveness. [SEP] This is a decent natural toothpaste. Good ingredients (it does contain glycerin). Not toxic like conventional toothpaste which I haven't used for well over a decade. It deserves 5 stars for all of that, but there is one thing I don't like about it. It doesn't give me that fresh mouth feel. Otherwise, it's great. [SEP] This toothpaste is good for young kids since it is Floride free. Taste was pretty good but on the expensive side. There are other Floride free option out there much cheaper so probably won't repurchase. [SEP] I didn't love this toothpaste. I look for ones that are SLS and flouride free and I like tea tree, so this sounded good. Attractive tube which is cool. Unfortunately, I had to work harder to get to a point where my teeth actually felt clean. I use an oral B electric toothbrush, so technically it does a lot of the hard work for me. The flavor was also underwhelming. I like something more minty. My favorite is still the NOW foods platinum mint, which is about 1/2 the price of this Aromatica toothpaste. A hard pass for me. [SEP] I haven't used a lot of non fluoride toothpastes but I've been wanting to switch and this brand seemed good because I am a fan of Tea Tree oil. The paste is translucent, almost clear and has a fresh minty taste to it. Abrasive particles are used to clean deposits off teeth and gums and it works well with my Sonicare brush.<br /><br />The tube is a bit smaller than other brands I've used but you only need a small amount as it's very strong. I overwhelmed myself the first time I used it and was sneezing for a few minutes from one of the ingredients. I reduced the amount of paste I used and that didn't happen again so I have no side effects to report when used properly. Good product, and a nice alternative to fluoride toothpastes. [SEP] This toothpaste is a healthier option than a normal toothpaste and I really wanted to like it but I doubt I'll use it again... If you smell the toothpaste in the bottle it has a nice minty smell but for some reason when brushing my teeth the scent was different and kind of smelled like hemp. This toothpaste doesn't foam which is fine for me but I felt it was worth mentioning. There is hardly any flavor at all which left my mouth feeling like it hadn't been brushed at all. I love that clean mint feeling I get after brushing my teeth but I didn't get that feeling with this toothpaste. [SEP] I like this gel because it helps with bad breath and cleans my mouth but it is not strong at all. i will use this when my teeth or gums or tongue feel sensitive because it is so gentle! The ingredients look very healthy and edible.  i was thinking about using it with my toddler but im afraid he will eat it and im not sure if it will be safe lol.",3,True

I'm not some loon, there's just real science behind keeping things as natural as possible, especially in this artificial world. A bamboo and activated charcoal sponge is a great addition to the collection of more natural products in the shower/bathroom. Certainly seems effective so far!

It also has a string attached to it so it can air dry between you using it. It does feel hard in the package but will get softer after it's in some warm.

I like the size, it's easy to hold if you want to use it on your whole body.<br /><br />I like soaking it in water infused with some essential oils.  I feel like they're really able to penetrate the skin barrier thanks to the activated charcoal.<br /><br />However, it says on the package to replace every 2 months at the most, and I just don't see how its going to last even that long.  Small pieces are falling off it, which started happening by my 3rd use.  But it could be the fact that I'm soaking it with essential oils or that I'm using it on more than just my face is making it degrade more quickly than it ordinarily would.<br /><br />Even so, I will purchase this again.

Herb Essential Pure Haritaki Powder - 100 g,[],[],,4.0,168,1110,"If you buy empty capsules, you can make your own capsules to swallow and save yourself the bitterness of this powder. I do not plan on purchasing capsules, so I will mix with my Manuka honey and water and drink it down. This is supposed to be great and I am going to believe in that as I drink each glass. [SEP] I wrote on the back of the bag what the uses for this powder are, and how to mix it up in hot water.  Put about 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon in hot (not boiling water) let it cool and drink it down.  It tastes awful. It can be sweetened with a little bit of honey if necessary.  It's supposed to be good for gastrointestinal health, weight lose, is an anti-oxidant and anti-bacterial, lowers blood sugar levels, increases insulin sensitivity and is often used to treat mouth ulcers and gum disease.  It should not be taken during pregnancy.  If you take too much it can make you poop a lot.  As far as I can tell, this powdered Haritaki is very finely powdered and is good quality. [SEP] This is my first time trying Haritaki. I can’t evaluate the purity of this or any other supplement. Notably, the label on my bag doesn’t indicate this is organic and neither does the Herb Essential India site referenced on the bag. The Amazon product page says it is organic and maybe the labeling has changed, but I can only go by the label and must assume (at least for now) this is not organic. I have no way of knowing if this Haritaki is free of contaminants.<br /><br />Haritaki is supposed to have many potential benefits. The package only refers to it as a “gentle laxative”. It says 3g to 5g can be taken twice daily but doesn’t say if that’s a general dose or for a laxative effect, or how long it should take to work as a laxative. I took two doses the first day and then went to one dose in the morning (each dose was about 5 to 6 grams) for 6 days total. I didn’t have any digestive problems, but this Haritaki didn’t have any laxative effect for me.<br /><br />Haritaki is extremely bitter (as expected) and is also so astringent it makes my mouth chalky and dry. I can get it down, but I have to mix it with a few ounces of sweet juice even though I don’t normally drink fruit juice. The package didn’t say what to mix the powder with, but I now see on the product page a picture showing to mix it with water. I don’t know if not mixing it in water prevented a laxative effect, but I doubt it as I always drank a full glass of water after taking a dose.<br /><br />I noticed a few things while taking Haritaki that might be related, or they could just be pure coincidence. The first day, I took it morning and night as directed. That night, I had the most lucid, bizarre, disturbing “dream” (a nightmare actually) that I can recall ever having, and I still remember it as it was so vivid. After that, I didn’t take an evening dose again and started only taking one dose in the mornings. While I understand it may be coincidence, I haven’t had a bad dream again.<br /><br />I came down with a bad sore throat that felt like the type that would last a few days and drank Haritaki mixed with juice, and my sore throat only lasted the one day. I get really fatigued most afternoons, and I felt more energetic when I took the Haritaki. I’ve since read Haritaki may treat a sore throat and increase energy, but my experience may be coincidence. I can’t fully recommend this product as it’s labeled a laxative but didn’t have that effect on me, and it’s not labeled organic. But it’s possible that it may have some beneficial properties. 3 stars. [SEP] It'll take some time to see results, but I just want to say that it seems like a great value for bulk powder. The quality seems very good, fresh, strong. The flavor is slightly bitter, earthy and numbs the tongue a little. Pale colored powder, slightly yellowish, tan. Fine powder but has a grainy texture, sandy as well.<br /><br />I have chosen to take it, 750 mg at a time mixed in honey water, hot. Just a couple of ounces of water, 1 stp of honey and 750 mgs of powder. Two times a day for long term health effects. I'll check back in a month or two with results. So far I have not had any side effects or undesirable stomach issues. My aim is over all reduction in inflammation, maybe some brain happiness /fitness, and longevity/energy. That's a lot to expect but as a bitter herb, this should be a good supplement. No jittery effects so far. The taste is strong, you can't cover it up. If you don't like bitter, earthy flavors, get capsules or encapsulate so you can avoid the flavor and be comfortable.  I don't mind this flavor, and only drink a small amount of liquid with the powder, and it's not hard to swallow or so bad tasting that it was difficult. Herb Essential Haritaki Powder, 100g, It's a Good value, fresh, strong product, seems good quality and authentic. I will update with results in 4 to 8 weeks. [SEP] I got this for my husband mainly because it claimed to help ulcers. So far from what we've seen and used of it, it does help lessen flareups for him and helps him with other stomach issues. He's been putting it in breakfast jars I make for him and so far it's been working to help stop his ulcers. [SEP] This herbal powder is free of any additives (not sure if it is organic though). Haritaki is used in ayurvedic medicine as a laxative and is fairly safe to consume in small amounts. This comes in a resealable bag and is a good value for this herb.",3,True

It cools and soothes skin, providing temporary relief of pain and itching associated with sunburns.']",,4.2,86,479,"The lidocaine does a decent job stopping pain from irritated skin. The menthol is almost, maybe just strong enough, to actually reach deep enough to the muscles.  The product was also nice on mosquito bites and my parapsoriasis. The only issue I had was it got on a white t-shirt and it's still on that white t-shirt after one wash. Maybe a few more washes and it will fade entirely. I thought about using this to help heal a new tattoo, the lidocaine really intrigued me but the menthol worried me on a raw wound that a fresh tattoo presents. [SEP] The addition of lidocaine is much appreciated! It turns the horribly sensitive skin into slightly calmer and more hydrated skin. If you make the mistake of getting burned (and seriously, avoid it with suntan lotion, because sunburn is dangerous and increases your likelihood of cancer), this stuff helps protect and heal with aloe, cool and distract with menthol, and block some of the pain with lidocaine. Very nice! [SEP] This gel is terrific. I inadvertently got a serious sunburn on my back. I was at an outdoor function. The sun must have been stronger than I realized because it penetrated my shirt. Probably the worst burn I've ever gotten. this provided almost immediate relief. The aloe is soothing and healing. The menthol is cooling. It does have a strong minty fragrance, almost like a supercharged mouthwash. I wish it was either unscented or lighter. But the bottom line is it provides pain relief quickly and stimulates healing. Great stuff. [SEP] I am happy with this aloe vera gel. It goes on smoothly, doesn't feel heavy or greasy, and quickly soaks into the skin. The gel has a light mint fragrance and the scent doesn't linger on the skin. Where I live, it's past the time of year that I will get a sunburn, but I've been using the gel on a bug bite I have and it's been very soothing. I'm glad to have this gel in my closet for bug bites and for that occasional sunburn once the warm weather returns. [SEP] I've known about the soothing benefits of aloe for some time, but always found aloe gels to be a little goopy.  This combination was a pleasant surprise.  When you add menthol and lidocaine to the mix, it takes the soothing relief to a whole new level.  The menthol is so cooling and soothing.  I use this when my skin gets itchy and it is very calming. [SEP] Dries nicely, not a sticky finish. It isn’t 100% aloe, it also contains some lidocaine and menthol. It is basically scentless but very effective. Instant relief as well as long lasting. [SEP] I purchased this for a relative going through chemo. This is a very good working lotion and smells great. Price is great for the amount you get! [SEP] I've used prescription lidocaine for a long time, but sometimes, it just seems like the patches were too big for the problem area.  But this stuff is great for small areas of aching like hands and fingers.  It's also wonderful for mosquito bites (mosquitos love me) especially if you get it on before you scratch it.  The smell dissipates quickly and isn't sticky.  You simply can't beat the price in any online or box store.  I haven't had a sunburn yet, but I think the methanol would be very cooling.  The price is very reasonable and the 6 bottle deal is amazing.  1 bottle lasts a long time, but it doesn't go bad. [SEP] This product is a must-have for anyone who spends any time out in the sun or anyone who has a tendency to get sunburns.  This is a gel-type product that contains aloe, lidocaine, and menthol to help reduce pain and ease the discomfort of too much sun.  It has a cooling effect on the skin which is exactly what you need when you've got a burn.  Definitely a must have for the first-aid kit.

Helps removes germs, dirt and soap build up without the offensive or hazardous smell of Clorox, etc.<br /><br />Spray it on, wait a few minutes, rinse or wipe off and you’re done.  Love it.

This was an impulse purchase for me as a chronic cleaning supply hoarder and I am really glad I did. I will be buying more. [SEP] It is what it says it is. A 3% concentration of hydrogen peroxide with and orange scent. Remind me of the orange glo or whatever brand it was of orange oil cleaner that was big in the early 90's when I was a kid. It seems to perform like the low concentration you would mix for glass surfaces of the orange cleaner as well.<br /><br />I saw a review that claimed there wasn't a labeling for concentration on the bottle. It is listed in the  center of the label that it is 3%. Which is the same as the drugstore brown bottle disinfectant hydrogen peroxide you buy over the counter. The orange scent smells like orange peel oil that all orange cleaners have which smells like oranges but not at the same time.<br /><br />Overall it's a pretty decent cleaner and disinfectant, but the price is rather high for what you are getting. You can get hydrogen peroxide in higher concentrations an mix a gallon of 3% for much less than half the price and if you are one who needs scents you can buy and mix in your own organic oils and make a similar product. But this saves time and guess work if you don't mix your own concentrations often and with hydrogen peroxide getting your math wrong can be hazardous so this product does have its place and value in that respect. [SEP] Amazing product! Cleans better than anything else I have ever tried. [SEP] Smells great (orange oil) , sprays a wide swath, and this formula really takes the dirt off!! I used 1/ 2 a bottle along with a ton of wipes, to clean off a filthy outdoor slide-down metal storage unit door (management never delivered on its promise to powerwash this door and it was ""health-risk filthy"").

Plenty of different strains of beneficial bacteria in adequate amounts.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1. These supplements do not have an enteric coating in order to allow the probiotic bacteria to reach the colon alive.<br />2. This product is not listed on the company’s website, though it is promoted on their Facebook page.<br />3. Intestinal Fortitude (IF) was founded about eight years ago in Williamsburg, Virginia. It is a very small company whose supplements, including this one, are undoubtedly produced by a much larger company, which specializes in manufacturing supplements. Unfortunately, IF has not openly disclosed on its website the name of the manufacturer of its products, including this one.<br />4. IF states on its website that their ingredients are sourced from around the world, though their supplements are bottled in the USA. [SEP] I regularly take probiotics because of a lot of promising research that is coming out related to gut bacteria having a lot of benefits, digestive and even beyond.<br /><br />This seems to be a really good product, with 11 billion CFUs of probiotics, and a guaranteed 4 billion by the expiration date. It has multiple strains and is timed release, probably to release them into the gut and avoid destruction in the stomach.<br /><br />This ""11 billion"" amount was kind of confusing for me at first, since the label says ""4 billion."" However, if you look at the bottom of the back side, below the label, it explains it has 11 billion at the time of manufacture. It is kind of cool that they guarantee 4 billion until expiration. Most companies aren't that transparent. [SEP] There are a number of probiotic supplements on the market. Many of them make the case that they are better than the next one based on having billions and billions of strains and other mumbo jumbo. Reminds me of a famous burger joint. :)<br /><br />Anyhow, this is one of the best probiotic supplements I have used for digestion help. I have never gone so long without any type of discomfort in my belly prior to using this. Sure, there are always going to be things we eat that cause some discomfort, but overall this has been wonderful. At a cost of what appears to be less than 50 cents per day, this is a valuable addition to one's daily nutritional intake. I look forward to continued use and to seeing great results. [SEP] Love all of these products !! Works great !! [SEP] I've recently done a fairly broad comparison (about 10) of leading Probiotic options on the market, so I feel like I have a good point of reference on this.<br /><br />The Intestinal Fortitude 11 Billion CFU capsules are on the middle of my list. Here's why:<br />1) NO prebiotics included. Prebiotics are often extremely high in FODMAPS and can trigger symptoms in IBS users. This product has none.<br />2) Great tolerance - I found I was able to tolerance these perfectly well with no side effects. I can't say the same with some other Probiotics<br />3) No gimmicks. No exaggerated claims or extraneous additives like soil based organisms which many other products do<br /><br />However there are some issues namely:<br />The time release capsules are not effective. They can, and very often do, go right through the GI track unopened. As an alternative, all is not lost, it's easy to open the capsule and empty the contents and take it directly on the tongue.<br /><br />The other issue is that this is marketed by a relatively small company and most likely manufactured by some other vendor. There isn't much transparency on what lab is really producing this. The good news is that they appear to be manufactured in the US. [SEP] Waste of money.... Wouldnt buy again after 60 days adding it to my regime [SEP] I've read that everyone should be taking probiotics, so they might as well be at a great price! I double the dosage and they're still cheaper than the ones down at Walgreens!! These are fantastic!!! [SEP] I have been taking probiotics for years and have tried different strains. While researching have learned its best to switch after a couple of bottles and then go back to the other - in other words, rotate. I began using probiotics with 3 billion and then 10 billion, now I take 20-50 billion. These 11 Billion CFU are a good starter dose for starting probiotics, but may not be a high enough dose to help chronic problems. This particular blend of probiotics appears to be shelf-stable and easy on the digestive tract. The delayed-release it nice because I can take it in the morning and feel the effects all day.  They can have 4 stars because I didn't necessarily find anything wrong with them, and they didn't do anything detrimental to my health. [SEP] Great probiotic.

It mixed in well, although the directions say to mix in two whole scoops.<br /><br />All in all, it's pretty decent for the price. [SEP] I start every day off with a nutrition packed protein smoothie. What I appreciate about this mix is that I don't feel like I have to add an additional superfoods powder to my smoothie because the ingredients are already to fantastic! I tried just blending it with ice cubes and coconut milk the first time I had it, but the flavor was a little bland and the pea protein left a chalky taste in my mouth so I added some cold brew coffee and a splash of coffee creamer and  then it tasted like I was drinking a delicious blended coffee! Yum! If you don't mind doing a little doctoring to mask the chalkiness this is a great option with squeaky clean ingredients! [SEP] The directions say to add two scoops per 10 to 12 ounces of water.  I decided to try two scoops and 10 ounces of cold water in the blender.  It comes out sort of starchy – not grainy – but starchy.  To me it was also almost sickingly sweet this way – like wow.  Sweet drinks are not my thing so…  If you can get the cloying sweetness out of the way – I noticed that there is actually a nice chocolate flavor hiding in there.  If it were at least half as sweet – I am sure I would be able to taste the chocolate flavor more.<br /><br />Way too sweet to drink so back into the blender it went with an additional four ounces of water.  At 14 ounces the sweetness was cut down a lot – not enough for me, though, but the chocolate flavor was severely muted then too – like down to a “hint of chocolate”. : (  Again – if it were half as sweet…  So back into the blender it went where I added a banana and a bunch of kale.  That way, the sweetness was pretty perfect with the greens.  So, I am unable to drink this stuff alone - but with greens added it was actually quite pleasant and that is the ONLY way I will drink this going forward.  Glad that it is clearly marked Vegan and is full of good stuff. : )<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] Well, this was a disappointment in the flavor department. The vanilla is good, so I expected the chocolate flavor to also be good. Can’t say it is.<br /><br />The ingredients and fiber content are quite nice, as are the vitamins and minerals.  The shake does make a very good meal replacement and keeps you satisfied for a few hours, if you can tolerate the taste. There is just something too earthy about this particular chocolate  flavor that isn’t present in the vanilla. I’ll definitely finish it because I like the nutritional profile but it will have to be doctored up to be palatable. Hopefully adding some instant coffee and half oat milk/half water will mask the flavor.  Also, the price is a bit high when compared to other similar powders that tend to go on sale regularly.<br /><br />Good quality, bit so good flavor for me. [SEP] I became a vegetarian a few years ago, so I began using a lot of protein drinks. During the last year or so, I got away from drinking them (I like them, but I got lazy) and was just relying on a fish dinner once or twice a week and an occasional PB sandwich.  One day recently I was asking myself, where has all my energy gone? I was feeling downright weak! I've been drinking this protein powder for about 2 weeks now and I've noticed a huge difference in my energy level. It's amazing how this problem of low energy just crept up on me unnoticed until it was pretty pronounced. I'm glad I tried this one - it's very palatable - it  has an excellent chocolate flavor and mixes easily. I've been mixing it with ice and water in a shaker and it tastes good, it's even better if you use almond, coconut or soy milk instead of water. I'm very impressed with this supplement and will definitely reorder. [SEP] I enjoy the flavor. Milky chocolate. Pretty close to a real chocolate flavor. Huge container, excellent value. I enjoy all the ingredients, a tad more net carbs than I like but not bad. A welcomed addition to my morning nutrient shake routine! [SEP] About two scoops is not a clear direction lol. Anyone else annoyed by this? Seriously, I don't want to figure out what ""approximately two (2) scoops"" equals to 70gr. So apart from that... it comes out grainy no matter how much you blend it. I think this would taste better as a half serving ( so approximately 1 scoop lol).<br />It is sweet, it does tastes like chocolate.  It makes you feel full, so definitely good for a meal replacement. [SEP] I have both the vanilla and chocolate versions of this product. While I know that these powders are sold by weight, not volume, I was a bit surprised to see that the vanilla version took up a fair bit less volume. I’m not sure if the vanilla powder is heavier or if it was somehow more compressed.<br /><br />So this product is meant to be a meal replacement and not purely a protein powder, so it has a lot more going on than what a typical protein powder might have. In addition to protein, it has a lot of vitamins and minerals and a lot of fiber. Flavor-wise, it’s OK. It’s got some chocolate flavor, and the sweetness isn’t off-putting. I’ve tried protein powders that were strong with the stevia, which is a sweetener that I don’t really like. This contains some of that too, but it also has cane sugar. I’ve certainly tried far less palatable protein/meal replacement powders. I’d probably rank this high up the list, though that isn’t necessarily saying a lot if you’re coming from never having tried these sorts of things to consuming a lot of them and just getting used to the not-very-good flavors. This does have some grittiness, though I make my drinks the night before, which allows for the powder to hydrate well. Also, given that this has more in it than protein powder, the grittiness should be expected. For example, this has a variety of ground of seeds, which is why it has so much fiber.<br /><br />In comparison to the vanilla flavor, this has slightly less calories, but it has slightly more sodium, more fiber, and more potassium, so there is some difference between these beyond simply the flavors.<br /><br />I’m not really keen on the fact that this is $37, is in a huge tub, but only has 15 servings. Granted, these sorts of products are all kind of pricey, so this isn’t overly so. The biggest negative for me is the amount of sodium this contains. There are 480mg of sodium per serving. I’d be a lot happier with this if it had maybe half that. [SEP] What I like about this particular brand of protein powder, is that it can operate as more than just a post workout recovery drink, and do double duty as a meal replacement as well. A couple of years back, I had some surgical procedures in my mouth as a result of some receding gum lines, that required gum grafts. That really is as unpleasant as it sounds. I mentioned that, because at the time it was difficult to eat solid foods for a while, so I was more or less on a liquid diet. I would very much like to have had this protein at that time, as a meal replacement because I feel it would have done a very good job of offering a good overall nutritional value. In this case, I have been using it as a post workout recovery drink. For that purpose, it works very well too. I do fairly high impact resistance training, so by the end of it I'm spent. My muscles certainly benefit from post workout recovery drinks that are protein rich, and will encourage muscle regeneration and synthesis. I found that this protein did nicely at helping me recover from my workouts. I have had the opportunity of trying the vanilla flavored one as well, and I think I actually prefer that one to the chocolate. My wife on the other hand, very much prefers the chocolate. So, I guess you can see that it's obviously going to be subjective. I personally found the chocolate to be a little sweet for my taste. So it's no surprise that my wife liked it, because she has quite the sweet tooth. I did find it to have just a touch of a grainy texture, but certainly nowhere near as bad as others that I have tried. I use a ninja blender that has a smoothie attachment, and that thing does a pretty incredible job of pulverizing the powder. I make my shakes very simply by just adding ice and water, with a couple scoops of this protein powder. As far as the ratios of how much water to powder I use, I usually experiment with that and don't pay much attention to the recommendations by the manufacturer. Personally, I prefer to dilute it a little bit in more water, as I find that makes for a more pleasant drink. All in all, I do like the fact that it has a good nutritional balance of fibers, vitamins, and minerals, as well as the protein content. Like I mentioned, when I had my surgery, it would have been nice to have had this as an option as well as the Ensure drinks that I was always having. I think it's a fine option, and I would recommend it. [SEP] This tastes pretty good, although it does have a bit of that protein flavor. It mixed in well, although the directions say to mix in two whole scoops.<br /><br />All in all, it's pretty decent for the price.",3,True

You can take these on hikes, throw them in a bag, or keep them on hand for emergency food. I'd definitely recommend this as an alternative to high sugar bars.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier. [SEP] Pretty good! Helps keep my sanity when I get hungry before my main meal.  I think it makes for a quick snack- either to take care of a sweet tooth need, or just need something to nosh on to take care of hungries before next meal. When I am on the go all day, I often dont eat anything until dinner (Im just not hungry, and copious amounts of coffee and/or a smoothie takes care of my need to masticate a meal), but.. sometimes I do get a little hungry. OK, sometimes a lot. lol.  I pack some snack bars just in case, but sometimes I want a better mouth feel/different texture than what a dry bar provides. SO give me cheese stick, olives, meat stick.. and now these yam sticks. Of all the other options, these are the easiest for me as they are room temperature stable. Now I can have one of these and maybe a handful of nuts, and I am satisfied enough to hold off until dinner.<br /><br />Has a light, mild taste. I think kids would like this as it isnt as strong as some sweet potatoes. I know some of the flavor is dependent on the type of sweet potato/yam used, and region. That is the extent of my expertise, though haha.<br /><br /> The texture is decent. It is a soft with a little bit of chew. Easy to eat. I have another yam product I prefer (about as mild, but little more chew), but I would totally buy these again. If only because I can control myself better. This is 80 calories per stick, where as the other is a bag at 180 per serving/bag. Not bad, but I dont always need that much at once (but I cant control myself haha). So different items purchased for different reasons. If you want to get fancy, this would be delightful paired with a slice of turkey or chicken, then maybe a slice of cheese all rolled in a small soft tortilla shell. Or ditch the meat, and add in avocado. Hmm, making myself hungry now.<br /><br />Yammy: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SYBSSN3 [SEP] Taste not good and not worth the money [SEP] Order again?  No I will buy real sweets potato.<br />Sorry to saying this but  it doesn’t real sweet potato taste to me. [SEP] The IMWELL Sweet Potato Bars do not taste good at all.  The positives of these are that they are very healthy and they are convenient to pack in a bag.  I like sweet potatoes and I like eating healthy foods, but I could not stomach these.  The sweet potato bar is bland and is dense.  There is no extra flavoring, which they desperately need.  I would have given two stars because they are healthy, but they also come with a plastic food freshner pouch in each bar.  This is easy to overlook and if I didn't notice it and just gave the bar to my three year old, he could have choked.  After removing the packet, I gave a bar to my son and he took one bite and spit it out.  These had so much potential.  The company should add honey or something else to make the bland sweet potato taste better. [SEP] Well, it tastes like plain roasted sweet potatoes, mashed up and shaped into a bar.  Kind of what I expected, and that's a good thing.  The texture though seems a bit unique.  Kind of like sweet potatoes that were blended or really mashed, compressed and shaped into a bar (which is probably what happened), so it's denser than I expected.  Sort of like fruit leather, but much thicker.<br /><br />It's a plain, simple, tasty and healthful bar.  It could benefit from a bit of salt, but you can always add that yourself.  Nice to see a healthy bar that won't melt in the summer heat. [SEP] I can not taste sweet potato flavor. I tried many different types of semi dried sweet potato snacks from South Korea. This one is tasteless. [SEP] The bag was opened and patched together with tape. One sweet potato bar is missing and the taste is like plain fried sweet potato. In that regard it’s exactly as expected. It might be nutritious but unless you’re Chris Traeger you’ll need a honey packet or something to make this palatable.<br /><br />Can’t believe a seller would send open used food items listed as new. And with missing food items on top of just an opened package. Clearly someone tried this, didn’t like it and sent it back.<br /><br />Zero stars for being a crap seller [SEP] I love a good sweet potato.  These really caught my attention especially with only being 80 calories per bar.  They have a leathery texture, but did taste like a very bland sweet potato.  I just was not a fan of the blandness or the texture.  If you are not a person who minds that, you will probably like these.  They were just not for me.

Its smaller than most pill organizers, which I prefer since I only take a few pills. But honestly, it isnt worth more than $3-$4. Wait for the price to go down because even paying $5 for this, I thought I was overcharged. If you really love the aesthetic of the rainbow, go for it. But if you need more space for vitamins and pills, get something else. [SEP] I love these pill boxes which snap into place or can be carried as a pill box for the day--brilliant. Each box has two compartments for morning and night. These don't take a lot of room on the stable and don't scream ""pill box"" like my other one does. However there is one flaw, ESPECIALLY for someone who is easily confused: each day's box is not labelled on the edge that shows, so it will be hard for someone to find their pills for the day. However is you don't need a lot of help and just want a practical pill box with two sections for each day, this is your pill box. I'm pleased [SEP] This comes with 7 multicolored plastic pill containers. Each one is labeled with the day of the week. This is perfect for anyone who has to take pills on a daily basis. [SEP] Love this pill organizer that has different colors for each day of the week.  Each day container slides out easily.  Will be taking on an upcoming trip to organize my vitamins. [SEP] Cool organizer, works as expected. [SEP] Easy and makes taking your meds easier! [SEP] I love this pill organizer.  The little pill boxes stay put in the organizer even when the organizer is turned upside down and even then when one is removed.  That being said, the only thing that I wish it had was a hard cover lid, just for the layer of extra protection.  Otherwise, this is a very sturdily-made and cute little pill box that doesn't advertise itself as a pill box just as a glance.  Highly recommended! [SEP] My son needed to take Aleve twice a day for a sports injury and this Pill organizer was perfect for the job!  It's small and doesn't take up so much room on the counter.  His one complaint it that there is just one lid for each day.  He'd like to see the morning portion have a separate lid from the evening portion of the day.  I'm sure we will be using this for years to come! [SEP] Very nice. Each day has the double compartment. My other day-night-two week cases were too big and hard to fill. This is nice and compact. I can travel with one of the 7 separate cases or all 7 and the holder.  Also the  holder will work great next to my bed. Good quality too [SEP] Very happy with these.

Daily Roll-On for Instant Relief - Made from Organic Hemp Seeds Oil - Great Cooling Gel for Pure Body Relaxation by Alter Native - Made in The USA - 3 oz,[],[],,4.2,35,1207,"This roll on smells like menthol and goes on icy cold. I get a cooling, soothing sensation for about 15-20 mins then nada. It’s nice to use after a workout or long day so it’s been great for me, but you will need to constantly reapply for lingering aches. [SEP] This is easy to apply with a convenient roller applicator bottle. The gel has a strong menthol smell, much like IcyHot or similar products. It goes on wet, takes a few minutes to dry, and the smell lingers, though personally I like the smell of it. A few minutes after applying to my lower back, I started to feel the icy cool sensation that brought some relief to the ache in my back. The feeling lasted a few hours, after which time I reapplied. My tight back was loosened and less achy after using the hemp gel. How much of the relief is due to the hemp and how much to the other ingredients I don’t know, but I have friends who swear by the relief they experience using hemp products. Being that this product is made in the USA from all natural ingredients, I’m happy to use it over some of the other not-so-natural products I’ve used in the past. If you’re looking for relief from mild to moderate aches, I recommend giving this a try. [SEP] Rarely do I rate a pain cream, spray, or roll on, high.  Some may help the pain a bit but usually not for long.<br />I will say that this hemp roll on is good.  Yes, it does have a strong menthol scent but it's not overwhelming unless you roll half the bottle on your body.<br />First thing I tried it on is the pain on the top of my feet.  Almost instantly the pain was gone.  I mean gone!<br />Nothing has been able to take my arthritis pain away for as long as this roll on did.<br />Next place I tried it on is my lower back.  I've been hurting so bad for the last 4 days now so I was willing to try anything.  I am sitting here right now with barely an ache in my lower back.  I rolled it on my lower back about 20 minutes ago.  Within 5 minutes I could feel relief.  How long will the relief last?  Not sure.  It depends on how much activity I do today I'm sure.<br />It's not that expensive.  Can't guarantee that it will take away your pain completely but, I'm betting it will at least take that big edge of pain off.<br />I'll be ordering more bottles of this for sure. [SEP] For people who are used to expecting these types of roll ons  to have a strong aromatic effect, perhaps a touch of aromatherapy or psychological bump from the smell, but it's not going to go over well for people with migraines and issues with scents.<br /><br />I am not sure if it works for pain as the scent is not tolerable for me. It's too strong to wear during the day when around people as well and anyone in your family who doesn't like it, will be put off by the way it smells as well. Definitely for the solo person who is used to strong scent.<br /><br />The fluid is very watery, not lotion and not oily.<br /><br />4 stars. [SEP] This roll-on works for pain – and even itchiness.  When I received it I didn’t really have any pain at that time.  What I did have was extremely itchy hands from not wearing gloves outside as well as having an allergic reaction to either paint or spackle or something I was working on in the house.  So I applied this roll-on to my hands.  Instantly my hands stopped itching completely!  They felt cool and tingly.  The calmness of my hands lasted for quite a bit of time too.  Then I reapplied it again for relief.  It also made my hands look better too.  The redness was gone and the little itchy bumps had subsided quite a bit.  It didn’t get rid of the problem but helped temporarily.<br /><br />As for pain – sure enough, a few days later my back was acting up so I applied this roll-on.  I must say I do wish it didn’t roll on as “wet” as it does.  I find myself using a gloved hand to rub it in or the closed cap of the product to help work it into my skin.  It takes a minute or so to dry too.  BUT it relived my achy back COMPLETELY!  Felt great!  So, I definitely recommend this stuff on itchy skin or painful muscles.  Worked for both! The only thing is it seems like it might be Vegan so I hope that it is.  If so – I wish it were marked.  The label with all their little “certifications” is quite blurry – and tiny – (see my pics and that is NOT my camera but how it really looks!) so it may but it can not be read….<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.

Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] Hi, it's Glamorous Gem, hope you all are having a wonderful day,<br /><br />Anyway, we all have our aches and pains, but believe it or not the strongest stuff is worser for your body. I wanted to incorporate more natural alternatives rather than prescriptions and pain killers.<br /><br />This is great for moderate to mild pain. Let me start by saying, this is made of a mostly natural blend, besides menthol.<br /><br />Upon first opening, menthol is the strongest scent, though. It's very heavy so it tends to cancel out the other ingredients due to its smell. But, what I like immediately is it's application.<br /><br />This has a roller impeded in the top of the bottle, kind of similar to roll on deodorants. It's great for minimizing spills as well as being great for direct contact on your hot spots.<br /><br />It's also soothing for a deep rub on sensitive areas. It has a cooling sensation immediately. What I like is, however I've been using it, I haven't had any sensitivity or adverse reactions either.<br /><br />It's as natural as it says and it does seem to work with pain. Lately my lower back has been acting along with my thighs after heavy lifting and this has been helping along with cool compresses.<br /><br />A little goes a long ways and it's easy to apply. I just wish it would have a longer wearing period. It would work for short time, like an 45min-1hour or so, then after that it would be quite dull. Even though the smell is still there, it just wears off a bit too quickly.<br /><br />I don't doubt it's effectiveness, just wish it would last a bit longer between applications. Otherwise, it's a great alternative to steroid creams, so it's still recommended.<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews.

"White Noise Machine, OREiN 3-in-1 Portable Sound Machine with Night Light, Bluetooth Speaker and Sleep Timer, Sound Machine for Sleeping with Memory Function, Soothing Sounds for Adults Kids Baby",[],[],,3.6,24,170,"[[VIDEOID:8de8f2a73c9b580c98c4923324b62860]] At the current price of $33.24 ($34.99 minus 5%), this is super expensive for something that can only be used as a nightlight. I was unable to pair this to any Bluetooth device and I tried a couple. Also, the touch controls are quirky, the timer goes off by itself with any button change, the light comes on automatically sometimes, and the pause/move ahead button is for show only as it does nothing. There are buttons on the front of the unit and on the bottom. It is impossible to read the bottom buttons. This is nice as a nightlight only and is barely functional as a sound machine with only 5 sounds. This is definitely not worth the current price for such a quirky and partially working sound machine. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:863022be23191cee993f4c6a8a3ba713]] This whitenoise machine is ""ok""! Nothing super special about it! Its very small...smaller than a can of soda actually! The plastic is not best quality theres obvious lines everywhere on it! But its goodbforbtraveling purposes! Can easily fit in luggage! The light is not too bright which i appreciate! And the volume goes up to a decent level! The sound is not best selection though! Only one i liked was rain sound! The fire sounds like something is dripping or being bounced! Its weird! But i would probably keep looking for different better machine.... [SEP] I am not sure if I would truly call this thing a noise machine.  There are ONLY 5 sounds.  Rather I would call it a Bluetooth speaker that has a few sounds as well as a light.  Again, there are only 5 sounds.  All are decent enough for what they are - except for the campfire – that sounds weird and I would never guess it is a fire at all – almost like a clinking – thought it was weird chimes actually.<br /><br />It was VERY easy to pair with my phone and that is what I will predominantly be using this as – a Bluetooth speaker.  You can use the buttons to help with the music tracks but personally, I find it easier just to do it all on my phone anyway. The sound is pretty nice for most music I played.  The ones with constant beaty treble, though – sometimes sound a little staticky – mostly with fast repetitive pop.  Everything else sounded really good on this speaker.  It also played plenty loud for my needs.<br /><br />The light function is OK.  It is not very bright and really can’t be used to see.  Might be good as a night light or just to set the mood with some friends listening to music. It is also pretty small – so can easily fit on even a small table.<br /><br />The thing I was not a fan of – again, for my needs, is when you flip the thing over it turns into a nightlight and turns the speaker off.  If you – or one of your guests – do this – your speaker totally disconnects.  To pair with the phone again – you have to completely power off and then power back on to pair again.  Might be good for someone’s needs – but I just wish that was different.<br />I hope that you have found my review “helpful”. : )  Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] I got this mainly as a replacement for those expensive Bluetooth speakers. This works great and is very easy to operate. The lights make it look fancy. Sound quality is pretty decent, somehwere in the high middle ground. Not fabulous like a Bose but also not terrible. I love the same compact size, about 5 inches tall. I have small hands and the diameter is no larger than my palm. So this is perfect for travel too. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:2323063f8ab86743582502814c4ed10]] I ordered this hoping to mostly use it as a bluetooth speaker paired with a phone when I'm outside in the yard - it refused to pair with ANY device I tried. When it's in the bluetooth pairing mode it cycles though the colored lights and a little blue indicator light next to the control buttons blinks - mine is STUCK in bluetooth pairing mode now. None of my bluetooth devices can see it, none of the other buttons on the speaker respond. I can't even turn the darned thing off, I've tried quick-pressing the power button and holding it down for ages. There's a blurb in the manual about holding the -/+ volume buttons down at the same time to turn off the night light function - I've tried that and that doesn't work either. It's just stuck flashing in the bluetooth pairing mode. I can't even tell you if the sound quality is decent because I never got it to play any sound!<br /><br />Aside from being a total brick, I wasn't impressed with its appearance when I unboxed it either - the plastic is very cheap and you can see the lines where it was moulded. Y'all - do not waste your money on this! Even if you get one that works it just looks so cheap and ugly! The ONLY redeeming thing about it is that it comes with a USB-C charging cord AND adapter, most of these cheap electronics don't give you the adapter plug anymore. [SEP] This sound machine functions on many levels.  It's pretty, there's that.  It' is a night light with many color options.  It plays soothing nighttime sounds to help put you to sleep.  There's rain, fire, meditation, ocean and fan.  You can easily control the sound level.  This unit also offers a bluetooth option to play your own sourced material (music, audiobooks, etc.).  I have not used this function so I can't comment but judging by the built in sounds I'd assume you get decent quality.  This would make a great gift. [SEP] My habit is always to wait at least a few weeks before reviewing anything. That way, readers of my comments know I am not just excited about a package coming in the mail but have also tested its usefulness.<br /><br />This white noise machine is great. The sound quality is above average. It fills the room without being overwhelming. I can put it on a bookshelf and get great coverage. The night sounds and forest sounds are especially realistic. It has a Bluetooth option so you could use it as a speaker when you don’t want the white noise. It has some soft lighting options which are nice if you want a night light for kids. Small and doesn't take up too much room on a nightstand.  Looks nice, too.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] This works wonders for me and baby when it comes time for bed and it helps with soothing my baby [SEP] [[VIDEOID:355c1f4b3318bf9d1f703c484877ebf4]] This white noise device looks small and cute but has relatively loud and clear sound. The choice of sound is not may (only 5),but those are selected and most used ones on a white noise device.<br />The lights is soothing and don't irritate your eyes. They look beautiful in dark.<br /><br />Only suggestion I have, is to move the sound buttons(at the bottom) near the power button in the front, this way you don't always have to lift the device and search for the sound changing buttons.<br />No doubt the quality and look of this product is great, the price could have been lower . [SEP] This Orein Assoupi 3-in-1 Sleep Sound Machine has three different functions. With the color changing lights, it functions as a pretty little lamp. It also functions as a sound machine. Its third function is a a bluetooth speaker. I'll discuss them in turn. The power button, light button and three volume controls ( - , pause/play, and + ) are all located on the front of the machine. The sound button and the timer button are located on the bottom of the machine. LAMP FUNCTION: As a lamp, there are five programs, accessed in sequence by pushing the light button on the far right of the front of the lamp. The programs are: 1) fast color change, 2) move to the beat, 3) slow fade color transition, 4) night light, and 5) lights off. Though there are many light colors, you cannot stop on any particular color but instead can only see either a fast or a slow continuous rotation through them all. The exception is #4, the night light, which is only available golden yellow. As a stand alone light, my favorite setting is 3, the slow fade color transition. It is so peaceful to watch, and is absolutely mesmerizing to me, especially when the house is dark. Setting 2 works best connected to bluetooth, but will also change colors and intensities to the sound machine selections, and it's definitely cool to watch on the rain/thunderstorm setting. SOUND MACHINE FUNCTION: There are five sound programs that are accessible by using the controls on the bottom of the speaker. The programs are 1) rain, 2) fire, 3) meditation, 4) fan, 5) ocean, 6) sound off. They have to be accessed in order. The fire program doesn't sound anything like a crackling fire to me, it sounds like very high pitched tinkling. I didn't like this one at all, although I would have liked it if it had actually sounded like fire. The meditation program is a very soothing new age kind of sound that I like a lot, and I also like the rain which includes lots of thunder, and the ocean. I'm not much for white noise, but the fan would be pleasing to those who are. I thought the sound was amazingly clear and sharp for such a tiny little machine. Sound can be played continuously, or the timer button on the bottom of the machine can be pushed to choose an auto-off of 30, 60, or 90 minutes. BLUETOOTH SPEAKER: It was amazingly easy to connect bluetooth, and I tried it on a number of different types of music using my iPod as the music source. I was pleased with how this little speaker sounded with each music selection I played. While this is obviously not going to match the high fidelity sound of my expensive home sound system, I feel it performed quite well. Note: if the power button is held for two seconds and the blinking blue light is on, indicating the speaker is ready to pair to bluetooth, the speaker will automatically shut down after two minutes if it is not paired with bluetooth. If I change my mind about connecting to bluetooth after the blue light is flashing, I can just press the power button rapidly and the blinking blue light will go away and I will return to normal speaker mode. Also, if the speaker is paired to bluetooth and is paused for 15 minutes or more, the speaker will automatically shut down. I find that the more I use this little sound machine, the more I like it, and am content with its limitations. The slowly fading lights and a soft mediation program in the background with this little machine sitting on the corner of my computer desk at home is just perfect for me, and I am glad I ordered this machine.",3,True
"FeelGood Organic Superfoods Broccoli Powder, Vegan, Non-GMO, Gluten Free, Rich in Fiber, Flavonoids, and Vitamin C, Pure Organic Broccoli, 7 oz",[],[],,4.1,15,1630,"here are some key points in my overall experience:<br />- smell of the broccoli was stronger than the taste lol, so don't be deterred by the smell lol<br />- easy way to add some veggies to your diet!<br />- perfect for putting in smoothies, or add to juice<br />- i love that this product is organic, non-gmo, and no fillers<br />- I would've liked to know if this product is raw or cooked, and also how much of the powder is one daily serving of veggies<br />- overall good experience, but hoping they add the above info, which I would find very valuable! [SEP] I enjoy fresh and steamed broccoli and have noticed that usually, the next day after eating a good amount of broccoli, I feel and look better.  I think there's something in broccoli that really tunes my engine.  So, when this package of broccoli powder came up on my list of items I could review I wanted to try it.  I like it.  I mix it with some wheatgrass powder or other super foods (like to include a sweet one for flavor) and water, mix thoroughly and drink it down.  It's not something to write home about, but I like it well enough and I feel I'm getting some good nutrition.  This powder seems to be fresh and will puff out of the envelope if you're not careful with it. [SEP] I tried.  I really tried to find a way to use this healthy powder in the foods that I eat.  But, I could not.  I tried this in my morning yogurt with blueberries.  Nope, not doing that again.  I tried this broccoli powder in some chicken noodle soup.....better, but still nope.  Now, I will admit that I may not be using this the correct way and I am probably using too much in the dishes I have tried it in.<br /><br />I like raw broccoli and eat it whenever it is around.  And this powder did taste somewhat like broccoli.  But, that taste did not translate into the foods I added this to.<br /><br />The powder is also extremely fine and it comes in a heavy duty paper bag with a solid 'Ziploc' style closure at the top.  I like to push all the air I can out of the bags of this style before closing them.  This was a mistake with this fine powder.  When I tried to gently extract the air a pretty big dust cloud formed outside the bag.  No matter how gentle I was in trying to push the air out a lot of broccoli powder formed an impressive dust cloud.  10 minutes later I went back into the kitchen and could still smell the broccoli powder.<br /><br />I was hoping to make some of the food I eat healthier with this powder, but I don't think this will work for me.  Even with my critiques above, I don't this is a bad product.  There are probably other ways to use this broccoli powder successfully.  It just won't work for my uses. [SEP] I just tried this on my fried eggs and they were phenomenal!! All I did was sprinkle some over top and cooked it right in. Not saying that this the best way to use this powder, but it WAS crazy delicious.<br /><br />I decided to do that after opening the bag and sniffing it first. Broccoli can have a uniquely unpleasant odor anyway—you know what I’m talking about. In a concentrate like this, I figured it would be pretty ripe, so I was shocked when all I could smell was just a really yummy, savory broccoli soup-type aroma.<br /><br />Honestly, I’m not sure who would then decide to blend this with fruit, oh my word no! That’s a personal choice, obviously but this is not going to pair well with sweet smoothie ingredients in my opinion. Gross.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, it’s sooo much better than I expected! I can think of many other ways to use this. The flavor is amazing. And since I heated it up in a pan, of course my whole house smells like broccoli now. But it’s actually still a very yummy smell, not like the big green fart I was expecting.<br /><br />I’m going to get more of this for sure. I think it’s a brilliant way to work tasty, clean, mega-greens into multiple recipes. The only way that was going to work for me is if it tasted good, and this is crazy delicious, so CHECK. Now, I can’t wait to try the spinach too! [SEP] I use beet root powder regularly so decided to get the broccoli, while not bad on its own it does need to be used as an addition to boost nutrition levels.  It did add a nice hint of flavor to this broccoli, spinach frittata I made for breakfast and next up will be some kind of broccoli cheese soup or chowder.  It is difficult to rate these kind of supplements as you have to get past the flavor whether good or not so good.  The extra nutrition benefits cannot be ruled out the concentrated dose you get, so one has to decide which works best for their needs.  I didn't try the carrot powder, I like carrots but not carrot juice so skipping them.  I have not decided on the long term use of the broccoli, just need to use it in a few more ways.  As a vegetarian I do get a good share of greens but have not ruled this out yet.<br />In the end if you do feel you need a green boost this will definitely give it to you. [SEP] FeelGood Organic Superfoods Broccoli Powder comes in a 7 ounce bag that is well sealed.  The source country of the broccoli is not mentioned on the label but it does display the USDA certified organic seal.<br /><br />This broccoli powder is an easy way to add broccoli taste and nutrients to recipes.  I make a lot of slow cooker soups and find this adds a wonderful flavor and aroma to them.<br /><br />FeelGood Organic Superfoods Broccoli Powder is a healthy and convenient pantry staple.  The recommended storage is in a cool, dry and dark location.  It is a flavorful organic and gluten-free vegetable powder.  The expiration date on the bag that I received is 9 months in the future.",3,True
"Ancestral Roots Organic Turmeric Powder - 4oz - 100% Pure, USDA Certified Organic Turmeric Powder (Pack of 3)",[],[],,4.5,19,2111,"No complaints about this turmeric powder. The aroma when opening the bag was very rich. The taste was also excellent, and not at all muted as some turmeric's I've used. I use this mainly with rice (or rice substitutes such as wheat berries, couscous, and the like) and both the taste and the strong yellow color make for a tasty dish.<br /><br />I like that, while it is priced similar to a bulk item, it comes in three fairly small (4 oz) bags. That allows for cost savings by buying in bulk, but the smaller packages help maintain the freshness until it's ready to be used.<br /><br />Fresh, tasty and a good value. Hit's all the right marks. [SEP] I buy a LOT of turmeric powder either from Amazon or from my nearest multi-cultural food market.  I make what is called, ""Golden Paste"" out of turmeric, coconut oil, water and freshly ground black pepper.  It has helped me and my husband immensely with bone and joint health.  I'm 62 and play very competitive tennis, singles and doubles against opponents less than half my age and I often win.  I am a true believer in the miracle of Golden Paste as my previously super sore and creaky knees have been transformed into those of a 25 year old's - no kidding.  Please google ""golden paste"" and see how easy it is to make at home and give it a try.  When this ORGANIC turmeric came up on my list of items I could review it took less than a nano second to select it.  I think it's wonderful, it comes in 3 smaller bags instead of one big one and it seems to be among the best organic turmeric I've used. [SEP] This is fresh flavorful turmeric. It is a great price for the quantity you get! I use it mostly in making Indian curries and it works well for that. It comes in 3 ziplock resealable bags. [SEP] Fantastic [SEP] Disclaimer: these bags are big :D. There are three individual bags for a total of 12 oz of turmeric powder. The scent, color and taste are as expected. There is only turmeric listed as the ingredients, however it is packaged in a facility that also handles tree nuts, so this product is not allergen free. This item is listed as raw, vegan and USDA organic in a BPA free package.<br /><br />Overall, the quality of the turmeric is good enough and comparable to other turmeric I’ve used. It tastes pretty good and has a very good scent. My main complaint is the packaging. The zipper to seal the bag is a poor design and as soon as any powder gets in the zipper it fails to stay sealed any more. I ended up having to put the bag in another Ziplock to keep from spilling as the zipper wouldn’t rezip after the first time opening.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this product as is good quality turmeric and priced very good. [SEP] It is 100% organic with USA certification. It is pure and it’s quality and color is great. I use it for cooking. It smells good. Just I concern about its warning about lead in it. [SEP] Love will continue to buy [SEP] Very well done product here.  Tumeric is one secret of staying healthy, and as a spice it just works well in a wide variety of dishes.  At first impression for the package is that you get three hefty size packs in an overall clear packaging.  Its got a nice heft, this is a lot of tumeric.  The processing is good and you can tell the product is pure.  You can cook with it, package it in gel caps and use it daily as a tonic.  Just don't take raw tumeric after dinner to ensure you don't have digestion issues because it does have some heat.  Good stuff. [SEP] This package includes 3 resealable bags of organic turmeric powder. The bag labels are easy to read and the contents are reasonably fresh. For organic turmeric spice powder this is not overly expensive, and getting the smaller bags is an alternative to getting a single larger bag.",3,True

This particular one is of high quality, packaged in the US, and the company is owned by women. I have taken black seed oil in various forms for over a year. Taking the oil directly is difficult due to the taste, it is much easier to use in capsule form. I am happy to have this capsule  extract since it may be the purest form. I do believe that my health has improved since taking black seed oil, and am very pleased to have this product to review. [SEP] Nigella Sativa extract is a very powerful anti-oxidant, anti-carcinogen and has been proven to be effective against 97 out 144 superbugs. And this is just a few of it's health benefits.  The dosage is two capsule per day which delivers 700 mg of nigella sativa extract.  I think this is a great supplement to keep in your medicinal arsenal along with Oregano oil and Olive leaf extract. This is one of few nigella sativa powders I've reviewed but I find it to be as good as, and maybe better than black seed oil.  It costs more than black seed oil.  As of this review one bottle of 60 nigella sativa powder capsules costs nearly $40.00.  I've bought black seed oil frequently so whenever I see nigella sativa on my list of items I can review I instantly select it because it is one mine and my husband's favorite supplements. [SEP] Black cumin seed oil has a variety of benefits, and I have taken it for a little over a year. After taking it, I noticed a lot more drive and mental energy to get things done. This has been the best benefit of black seed oil for me. I take it regularly for a few weeks, and then take a few days off to make sure the effect doesn't go away.<br /><br />This is an extract, which is standardized for the active ingredient, which explains why it is more expensive than other pills. It will, however, also be more effective than plain old black cumin seed oil, which doesn't have a set amount of the active ingredient guaranteed.<br /><br />This is a good product, and the price is pretty good for the extract. [SEP] I like the quality. Seems to be helping. Doesn’t leave bad aftertaste [SEP] I am a huge black seed oil (Nigella Sativa) fan and have used it for YEARS. I don't use it for skin care, although it definitely helps in that regard too. For me, it's all about building my immune system up as well as I can. This is one of the core ingredients in doing so.<br /><br />The quality of this seems to be good. I do like the fact that they were able to use an extract, which can result in a better ""use"" of this supplement. Sure, drinking the liquid straight out of a bottle does have advantages, but you really negate that when you're able to extract the right ""stuff"" that matters to the goals you have.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand and product based on the fact that it seems to have worked as well for me as my other favorites. With that said, it must be pretty good. :) [SEP] I've just started taking this, so it's to soon to know it's benefits<br />but this is a decent dose in an easy to swallow capsule.<br />It's suggested 1,000mg to 1,350mg daily is a good daily dose.<br />This product - 2 capsules = 700mg<br /><br />A little research has shown some impressive health benefits of<br />black cumin, AKA nigella or by its scientific name Nigella sativa,<br /><br />It's high in antioxidants, studies have shown over a two month period of time black cumin seed<br />may reduce high blood pressure that's mildly elevated.<br /><br />It may reduce cholesterol and because it can kill bacteria, it may help fight cancer.<br />It's anti-inflammatory agents supports the liver and help prevent stomach ulcers.<br /><br />Serving - 2 Bottle 30 servings [SEP] The selling point here is that it’s an extract, not just an oil . And the extract has a higher quantity of the thymoquinone, which is the power behind Black Seed. This is a time tested herb, with a thousand years of usage. There are many more benefits or possible benefits than are even listed here, such a inflammation, digestion, asthma and even cancer fighting. This is an essential fatty acid that the body cannot produce. Certainly read up on it. I have been taking the 500mg oil pills for years ( as they are cheaper ) and I’m excited to try this extract and see how it affects my aging body. Give your body what it needs 🙏 [SEP] I've been taking either black cumin seeds or black cumin oil for several months now. This is my first experience with an ""extract."" I'm not sure what makes this an extract as what is in the capsules looks like ground black cumin seed. However, it does say it is standardized to 5% thymoquinone so I'm guessing it is balanced in some way. In terms of usability, this is easy to swallow and I tolerated it well when taking it with food (no stomach distress). It smells vaguely herb-like, but it doesn't have any taste. I also did have any unpleasant burbs after taking it. I can't speak to the efficacy of it as a supplement because this isn't the sort of thing that you take and have immediate results with. It's a long-term dietary addition which is supposed to contribute to overall health (as does eating leafy greens or other nutritious food). I believe it is helpful, but I can't prove it. This is only a one-month supply and on the pricier side, but it's hard to rate value when it's impossible to compare this extract to the more common oil supplements. [SEP] I am not sure why, but this helps me to sleep more deeply. It's amazing. I don't sleep poorly, but i can always tell when I didn't take it.

Everyone should be taking these daily to strengthen your immune system (even if you are vaccinated). Highly recommend! [SEP] Excellent buy, good product. [SEP] I like taking about a gram (1000 mg) of Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) as a daily supplement. For me it seems to help ward off colds plus keep me healthier as I age.  This is a Vitamin C 500mg small tablet that has in addition 5mg of Rose Hips with no added sugar or flavorings. The tablets are small and easy to swallow with a slightly acidic ascorbic acid taste. These are not for chewing. The label does not say where the ascorbic acid and rose hips are sourced from but does say ""Blended and Packaged & Lab Tested in the USA"". That gives me a secure feeling that this is a product to trust. I am willing to pay a premium for that.<br />I won't risk taking foreign sourced drugs generally as I have read too many horror stories of adulteration with awful stuff. The ingredients do appear to be sourced from outside the USA however. That would drop a half star but since there are no halves, I'll default to 5.<br /><br />This bottle comes double sealed and the tablet size is seen in my pictures. I liked the convenience of the flip top to open cap on this bottle.<br /><br />I do note that these have a recommended Serving Size of 1 a day for a 500mg dosing. That means the bottle will go almost a year at 1 a day; even with me taking 2 a day there are 150 days worth at a great value. Supplements such as this are best taken with a meal I believe as that improves absorption.<br /><br />As always check with your Healthcare Provider whenever beginning a new Supplement/Nutraceutical/or OTC Drug as there are many possible drug interactions that need to be considered.<br /><br />I Recommend these Carlyle Store Vitamin C 500mg | 300 Tablets | Ascorbic Acid with Rose Hips | Vegetarian, Non-GMO, and Gluten Free Supplement | High Potency Formula | by Carlyle.

[SEP] Well made, but (and it may be that the Vine product was just a small size) these were a bit tight, so it's tough to wear them for a long time.  They do protect from heat, soap, mild chemicals when working around the house.  Just make sure you get a pair that matches your hands! [SEP] Even though these were on the inexpensive side, I was really happy with the quality and fit. [SEP] We use these for cleaning and washing dishes in the kitchen. Normally we use the purple ones from Costco. These are nicer looking, especially the white ones. I like the grip pattern on the fingers. They definitely improve the grip, which is important for washing dishes.<br /><br />The material is nice and thick but not too stiff. It does not smell which is important. There is a light powdering feel to the inside initially but that went away after a day. Probably some coating during manufacturing. Good value for a pack of four pairs. [SEP] I use household multi use gloves all the time in my house projects. Washing dishes, cars, cleaning fish tanks, scrubbing bathrooms and floors and just about anything else I don't care to get my bare hands into. I was offered Pacific PPE 4 pack of Latex free gloves and thought I'd try them out.<br /><br />They come nicely packaged as a set and then again individually for storage until you want to use them. I got a set of medium sized gloves. I have long slender fingers (bottom of palm to tip of middle finger 7"", and palm width not including thumb approx 3"" across), these gloves fit me very nicely. The product page says the unlined gloves are for ""dishwashing"" which I find amusing, though they would certainly work for that I find the flocked gloves entirely more comfortable to wear when working with hot water as your hands tend to perspire and then stick uncomfortably to the unlined glove. The unlined gloves will likely go to cleaning my aquarium or washing my car. The gloves are a nice weight and seem just as durable as my brand name ""mr. clean"" gloves that I'm sure I paid more than $3.75 for which at the time of this review is the cost per pair here. These are a good value and will very much come in handy. [SEP] Overall, a nice set of dishwashing gloves. They are individually packed, and come sealed in a larger plastic bag. Funny thing is one set was supposed to be green, but my eyes see them as being more bluish. Not to start another internet meme about colors, but i found it interesting the color differed a bit from the product details illustrations. Other than that, these gloves are pretty much as described and depicted by the product details.<br />One set is unlined, another set is flocked with cotton, integrated into the glove. The gloves I received were size M. As opposed to a different set by the same company, these fit reasonably well. Just a smidge snug, but no complaints. Personally, I usually get these genre of gloves in size L, so that it's easier to put on and remove. I will say the flocked lined gloves were easier to put on and remove, and perhaps has more of a premium, luxurious feel. The company says they use the latest materials and manufacturing processes. Since these gloves feel kinda thin, hope the technology facilitates stronger durability of the materials. However, being thinner, the fingers feel more free to handle items. Personally, I did not notice any appreciable increase in tactile grip, but that could just be a function of normal washing of glasses and dishes. For a test, i was able to pick up a dime from the marble countertop.<br />I think I may re-purpose the gloves to protect my hands while crafting. I think these could be very useful when making candles in molds, or using soap molds (I don't make soaps, but think these gloves could benefit those that do.).<br />For the purpose of dish washing, these are fine gloves.  They are thin, but I can't determine durability until time, usage has elapsed. If there is any development after some reasonable time of use, I will amend this review (positively or negatively). [SEP] They were okay. We'll see if they last long. Not too happy that they are made in China. [SEP] We have a lot of dirty jobs to do around the house and yard - from chemicals like chlorine to mucking out the pond, there are simply things you don't want to expose skin to....that is where these come in. Comfortable enough to wear for several hours yet durable enough to tackle a wide variety of tasks, these are good all around gloves. Nothing fancy but good. [SEP] Great household gloves. They held up great through the dishes and spot washing on the floors. They also survived the toilets and showers. So yes they are very durable with lots of life left. Price is a little more than the dollar store gloves but these would hold up longer I think. I would recommend [SEP] Nice and soft, comfortable to the hands and pretty good for the price. It got a hole in it fast in less than a month. I mainly use it to wash the dishes.",3,True

They come with a total of four  scent pads, two of each.  I'm only using one of the dispensers as our car is garaged most of the time and gets not too many miles added.  Just right for our use.  I suppose one could make their own scent pads by using a small absorbent material or just a plug of cotton with your favorite perfume.  Possibly they will have refills available in the near future.  Really pleased with this innovative product.  The one small problem is that the scent disk will easily fall out of the holder....solution: fold it over then push it in. [SEP] Super cute and i also like the scent. Thanks [SEP] There is no smell unless you hold it up to your nose. I don't think it looks nice either, it reminds me of something you find at the dollar store. It looks cheaply made and it doesn't even smell. [SEP] The sunflowers are even prettier in person! If it wasn't for them, I'd probably give this 1 star.<br />The scent is nice - reminds me of artisanal soap. It is very week however. You can only smell it if you put your nose on top of the air freshener.<br />I wouldn't recommend unless you plan to use the sunflowers for decoration.

The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] Make my hand itchy and rash [SEP] The rubber on these is just a bit thinner than the gloves they are replacing. If I was doing things that caused a lot of abrasive stress on the gloves, that would probably bother me, but washing dishes and scrubbing sinks doesn't require anything super-heavy-duty, so I think we'll be alright. Actually, the previous gloves sure virtually no sign of wear, but need to be replaced because the kids have gotten water in them a few times and the Shell mildewy.<br />Gross.  I'm guessing these will last long enough-despite the thinner material-that something of a similar nature will be their demise and not from simply wearing out or getting holes.  And, in fact, the slightly thinner rubber, combined with the pleasantly soft lining actually make the gloves feel more natural and it increases my dexterity a bit, which is appreciated.<br />I do love the soft texture inside; it feels very comfortable.<br />No complaints with these gloves - I'd get them again. [SEP] These are your basic pair of rubber gloves.  They arrived exactly as described.  They are very durable and do a good job keeping your hands dry while using in a sink.  They come up to about mid forearm.  Good mobility and dexterity with your hands and fingers.  Just leave out to dry after your done and you should be good to go. [SEP] Good all-purpose cleaning gloves that also work well for light gardening work. I have used both and it's important to know that one pair is lined, while one is not. I prefer the lined pair for texture and comfort and wish they both were lined. I think they fit true to size, and were not hard to get on and off. They are on the thinner side but still are protective and impermeable. They have lasted a few months of intermittent use. [SEP] I used one pair to protect my hands while cleaning a disgusting toilet. It felt like they protected me.<br /><br />On the down side, I couldn't come up with a method to clean the gloves afterwards that I was comfortable with; due to the extreme nature of the germs/bacteria they were exposed to; & $5 for a single use is very pricey.<br /><br />I think with normal cleaning, either following the suggestion (washing in the sink with running water) or even using a washing machine would work. With what I exposed them to, running water would not be sufficient & I am not willing to contaminate my washing machine. I suspect for lighter cleaning, running water as suggested would be sufficient.<br /><br />Good fit, no tearing, not difficult to put on or off.<br /><br />Other than for moldy environments (like my toilet), I would recommend these. I will likely use disposable gloves for the toilet in the future. [SEP] Great for gardening, dishwashing, and cleaning. They are a good quality product… but a slightly better quality. We have been using another brand of reusable gloves to clean for years and years… they were a staple until I discovered this. This is more like the light house cleaning type.  We like having gloves to protect our hands from the variety of harsh chemicals we use to clean… especially when we clean our toilets or drains. I wasn't sure initially if these were more the latex like gloves that my mother introduced me to years ago for dishes or if they were more a thicker, industrial type. [SEP] Comfortable and sturdy kitchen gloves. Great for keeping harsh chemicals off of my delicate skin. [SEP] My big hands love these size Large gloves!<br />I’ll save the unlined ones for bathroom cleaning & more harsh cleaning where I just need a barrier from the chemicals.<br /><br />I’ll use the flocklined gloves for everyday dishwashing & glass cleaning - they come off so easily because of the soft fuzz lining.<br />These feel like high quality, thick, well made gloves that are true-to-size.<br />I’m a fan!<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this & hope that it’s Helpful!)

"Everyday by Formthotics Regular Fit Orthotics for Sport Shoes- Dynamically Forms to Your Foot, Customizable Support for Improved Performance and Injury Reduction. Insoles for Men and Women",[],[],,3.1,18,221,"I take a size 9 to 9.5 women's shoe and that is the size I ordered (see photo). However, the sizing advertised is all wrong. This is more like a size 11.5 if measuring from tip to tip. Also, I just noticed that they claim a smaller woman's size equals a larger men's size. That is incorrect. A size 9 in a women's would fit a size 7.5 in a men's size and not vice versa as the men's sizing is always 1.5 lower than the female sizing. These cannot be cut down so I can't use them.<br /><br />If these fit, they do have some cushioning and arch support, which is good. However, it is made of super cheap foam and there is no way this is worth the $49.95 price ($24.95 if applying the $25 discount) they are asking. I would not expect this to sell for more than $6.<br /><br />NOTE that I tried to attach the sizing listed on the Amazon site and point to the wrong sizing but Amazon would not post that review, so I removed that photo. As of this writing, the men's and women's sizing is reversed. [SEP] These insoles are comfortable to wear and provide an extra cushion between your foot and the sole of your sneaker or boot. I have flat feet due to weak arches so this works for me. However, unlike other arch supports or insoles I've used over the years, these insoles come with no guidelines. I had to trim these to fit my sneakers but there was no helpful dotted lines to show me how to customize them. I have many other insoles that show you exactly how much to trim if you want to whittle down the size to 7, 8, 9, etc. Here there is nothing. Hence three stars for the extra work required for me to figure out how much to cut. [SEP] I put these in my work sneakers and really like them a lot.  The are easy to use and easy to trim to the perfect size.  They are very comfortable and don't cause my feet to sweat too bad (a walk 8 to 10000 steps a day at work so I'm on my feet and lot).  They also stay put hen I take my sneakers off.  They have made my ratty old sneakers feel like new ones.  They do really form to your feet and are very comfortable all day long. [SEP] Because it's pliable but hard foam, it will take a while before your feet breaks them in/molds them to your feet (the company says 2 weeks, and literally your mileage my vary). In the meantime they feel like normal old-school insoles, maybe with a little more support depending on your feet and your current insoles, but certainly not the cushy memory foam some shoes come with. They have a new shoe smell, which I liked.<br /><br />They don't have any guides for cutting, which I think at this price point should have been included, since not everyone is going to cut a nice curve even with the guides. There are instructions, but I still think guides would have been better.

[SEP] I've done some research on the health benefits of fisetin but can't really find a lot about it.  It hasn't had many studies and the results of the ones done weren't very conclusive.  But, the reason I selected this product for review was not for the fisetin content but the quercetin.  Quercetin is absolutely wonderful at getting zinc into cells to fight off and kill viruses.  It really goes very well with vitamin C, D3 and zinc and I take all of those daily. [SEP] Review for: Balance Breens Fisetin + Quercetin 650mg - Supports Cognitive Function, Vitamin Supplement for Graceful Aging - Immune Support Powerful Antioxidant - 30 Non-GMO Vegan Capsules<br /><br />I have been taking Quercetin for a while and believe in it’s benefits. Fisetin is new to me and after reading about it, everything that I have learned is positive. This seems like an excellent combination.

It is possible to overdose on Quercetin so I would have preferred to have the amounts listed separately.<br /><br />My bottle arrived double sealed and with an expiration date on the bottle.

I use NetiPod squeezable bottle to rinse out my nasal passages, and thought this product is a good fit for me evaluate the effectiveness.<br /><br />The sample package came with two bottles.  Each bottle has two dispensing nozzle and a cap.  The bottle’s bottom has a tactile button to engage air valve to allow air to flow into the bottle when dispensing the rinse solution.  There was no discernable leak from the valve when the bottle was sitting up.  The flow of water is adequate for rinsing.  If additional pressure is desired, a slight squeeze to the plastic bottle will increase the solution pressure/flow. Overall a smart designed product, and I can see the use of this bottle.<br /><br />However, I noticed that there was a thin piece of plastic chad inside the bottle hanging from the air valve.  I am sure it would be safe, but not having a quality control on the health product was concerning.  Frankly I did not feel 100% safe to use the product, so I threw away the bottle was I reviewing, and decide to use the second bottle that did not have a chad. [SEP] Review for: Neti Pot Sinus Rinse Bottle Nasal Nose Wash Cleaner 500ml X 2Bottles, Sinus Wash Nettie Pot Family Set<br /><br />I very seldom have a cold or any congestion but when I do, I get out my neti pot and rinse the nasal cavities  with salt water. This has always cleaned up my congestion quickly. Neti pots are a bit of a pain to use though and this device is much simpler.<br /><br />The set of bottles does not come with any instructions but looking at the product page answers the questions if you have any. Instead of tipping your head upside down over the sink with the neti, this device allows me to stand up and tip the bottle instead. Water runs through the nasal passages and cleans them out.<br /><br />I suggest using only distilled or boiled and cooled water with some salt. Also, the bottles must be super clean or you can cause an infection . I like that you get two bottles in this set because you can always have one clean and ready to go. [SEP] Easy enough to use (though the bottle material could be a bit more flexible), but the bottles come without instructions of any kind, or a formula for rinsing solution. [SEP] It isn't the sexiest thing in the world, but every so often it is good to clean your your nose. Dust, pollen, pollutents... they are get stuck, and having an easy way to clear things out is a really good thing. This is a 2 bottle set of moderately easy to squeeze plastic with a long reach nozzle that allows the liquid to easily fill your nose. You do need to clean them first before using the first time, then again after each time you use it... hence having 2 bottles so one can dry while the other is clean. A good product. [SEP] The bottle is easy to squeeze when the bottle is full but once it gets to less than half full it gets hard to get the rest of the water out. The bottle is easy to fill up and is easier to use than other sinus irrigation systems I have used in the past. [SEP] While I have not used neti bottles a lot, I know that my sinuses need a good flush every so often. These do the job well as long as you use them correctly. I used to use those prefilled saline bottles but now I don’t need to buy those anymore. If you have trouble with your sinuses and need to flush them every now and then, these bottles will work for you. [SEP] There are 2 sinus rinse bottles included in this set. There is an on/off button at the top of the bottle. There are 2 caps to use on the bottle where one streams water and one is more of a mist. This is easy to use to clean out your nose and sinus tract. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:54e87b94d4bd3c970c39ceb098563d3]] I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of these pots! Sturdy plastic, quality...The button to activate the flow is smooth and easy to operate. Provides a gentle but steady fair stream of sinus wash. Exceeds it's value at this price point. [SEP] These work well. A couple of things would make it five star -<br />First, and most importantly, put some instructions somewhere!<br />Although these might seem obvious, they really aren't, especially if you have never done a sinus rinse before.<br />Second, the flow is a little weak. That, in itself, isn't so bad. I'm just used to a stronger flow. I don't know how to fix that.<br />The plusses - they are well-designed, washable, easy to fill. The markings on the side are helpful, but would be even more helpful if you would at least tell us what the units of measurement are. I assumed that they were ml. and I think I am right. I'm an American. What do I know of metric??<br />Anyway, overall, I like them and glad I got them. [SEP] It is important to regularly replace your sinus rinse bottles as they can harbor bacteria and mold. These are an upgrade over a simple neti pot as they allow more control, but I found them hard to squeeze. They do soften a bit when filled with warm water, but I still needed to apply quite a bit of pressure to get it to spray. My husband really likes these as he doesn't have to bend over the sink as much and can easily squeeze them with one hand. The tip sprays water like a shower nozzle rather than in one jet stream like his old bottle too. Not really sure if that makes a difference in the cleaning of your sinuses, but it feels nice. Overall, for the price for two bottles, this is pretty reasonable and the saline packets are easy to pick up at your local warehouse store or online. With the cold weather approaching and fall allergies in full bloom, these are great to have on hand to keep your nasal passages clean and moisturized.",3,True

Very happy with the product. You just have to use a tiny bit so it goes a long way. [SEP] This face cream feels so gentle on my skin. I have been loving probiotic face creams lately as they are usually gentle, not very fragrance or fragrance free. This one is fragrance free as well, which I appreciate the break from some of my other heavier scented creams. This cream is creamy, easy to apply throughout the entire face. My face feels soft and moisturized and no sticky or tacky feeling with this one! Looking at the ingredients list I also noticed this one does not have dimethicone - yay! - which seems so rare these days because 8/10 face creams I try has dimethicone. I really like this product and how it feels and does to my skin.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this is the pod style refill. I rarely see this kind of packaging with skincare products although every company should be doing this! I don’t know how many beautiful, perfectly fine face cream containers I’ve had to throw away... if every company could do this refill style packaging that would help reduce the amount of plastic waste. It would be even better if the refill pod is a biodegradable container. Overall, very happy with this wonderful face cream in every aspect! [SEP] I love this brand and I've used quite a few of their products.  This cream doesn't proclaim any magical anti aging properties other than a vague slow the signs of aging.<br /><br />What it does deliver on is really soothing and calming your skin.  I've been using it nightly and my skin is very dry and I use this in the evening after my usual serum.  It is nice and rich and sinks in to my skin easily leaving it feeling calm and smooth.<br /><br />There's no scent and I didn't experience any adverse reactions.  Now that the weather is getting warmer I'll store it in the fridge for an extra cooling boost after I've been outdoors. [SEP] I tried this cream for 10 days before I decided to discontinue use. When I first got it, I put it on my sensitive wrist skin to check for a reaction. I didn't react or have any issues, so I decided to try it on my face. I used it around my forehead, cheeks, and chin, as well as my chest and tried to avoid my sensitive eye area. It gave my skin a bit of a tingle, but nothing too terrible. I slept it off.<br /><br />After a couple of uses on my face, I went ahead and applied in my eye area. It began stinging the sensitive skin in the periorbital area, and was too tingly for my comfort. It did dissipate, but I was not keen on it. Thinking it might just be an initial irritation or perhaps too much sun, I have it two more chances at night with similar results.<br /><br />I haven't noticed any particularly astounding results with hydration or skin brightness, and I wasn't keen on the stinging and tingling around my eye area so I've discontinued use. It could be amazing for someone else, but it isn't for me.<br /><br />The top ingredients aren't particularly astounding either. I don't find it worth $48 to get the neat container that I can refill. I'd rather pay more or less for a product that won't irritate my skin, and will show some improvement in my dark circles and dry face. The first ingredient is water, the second ingredient is methylpropanediol which is just a surfactant, and the third ingredient is vegetable oil.<br /><br />Polyglyceryl-3 is supposed to be moisturizing and help with emulsifying. Polyglyceryl-3 is another emulsifier. Betaine is added for moisture, although I didn't see much improvement in my dry areas in the 10 days of use. C6-14 Olefin is another emoliant. It's rated a 1 by Skin Deep in the correct concentrations. Then there is shea butter, which usually leaves my skin soft and moisturized, but perhaps the concentrations are lower in this formula.

My wife will be love this product, , I like the option to buy only the refill container, I really recommend it. [SEP] This moisturizer works good. I had been using a serum, a stay-on mask, and a moisturizer daily, and decided to stop using them to see how this moisturizer would work on its own. It took only a small amount to fully moisturize my face and neck, and it lasted the entire day. I noticed the moisturizing effect within the first day.<br /><br />Now, I didn’t notice much change in the dark spots on my face. Didn’t notice any changes in wrinkles or the texture of my face. However, it did work to moisturize my dry winter skin and was long lasting. It easily took the place of the three products I normally use with the exact same results, and I had to use only a small amount of this moisturizer, so it’s definitely a good value for me. [SEP] The first time I used this skyn Iceland Nordic renewal moisturizer I wasn’t a fan of it at all. It felt very heavy and thick on my skin, even with the smallest amount used. Generally I hate moisturizers that are that heavy feeling. However within 10 minutes of using it I noticed it had all sunken into my skin, and my face wasn’t greasy or gross feeling at all. This is honestly the first moisturizer I have ever used that went on that heavy, but soaked up that fast and left my face feeling soft and moisturized without being greasy or gross feeling!<br /><br />Scent wise this is very very lightly scented. I can’t smell it on my skin and I have to really sniff to get any sort of scent form it at all even in the jar. It’s almost like a sunscreen/summer scent that’s hard to describe. But it doesn’t smell bad and the scent isn’t overbearing at all. I also really like that when you want to buy a refill you get it a little cheaper and just insert it into the original jar. Overall I’m actually quite likening this thus far! [SEP] I don’t typically like to try new facial products but I’m glad I took the leap for this cream! It is super thick but when you apply the cream it just melts right in, to nourish an moisturize dry skin. I really feel like my skin is thirsty and loves to have the cream applied to quench it. It doesn’t smell or leave any sticky or heavy residues. Great product. [SEP] My skin has gotten more dry over the years, especially during the colder months.  And no matter what I do, I cannot get the dryness to ease up.  My wife has used some similar products to this and suggested I try this one for myself.  At this point, anything is worth a shot, so I did.<br />It is a small jar and I didn't know how much use I'd get out of it.  But, I found that this is a slightly thicker cream so I only have used small amounts.  A small amount does go a long way.  It absorbs into the skin nicely without leaving an oily feel to it.  I've not noticed any shine on my face which is nice because I don't wish to have an oily appearance.  After a few days of using this at night, my skin has become much more soft and the usual flaking I get has been eliminated.  I'm very happy that this cream has been repairing my dry, flaky skin.  Cost is high, but if you only use the least amount needed, this can last for some time.",3,True

It makes great chocolate peanut butter cup protein shakes!! [SEP] Loved this product. Best clean chocolate protein powder I had so far. I will buy this again. [SEP] I love love love Bad Athletics protein! By far the best naturally-sweetened whey protein I have ever tried! I have tried Dark Chocolate, Salted Caramel, Coconut, and Vanilla Cream and they are all SO good! They work well in baking as well, and I have been making protein waffles with them every morning! Thank you Bad Athletics for such a great product, it is officially my go-to! [SEP] I really love using this after my workouts!  I mix this with unsweetened almond milk and a shaker bottle.  It blends easily with no clumping.  The best part is the flavor.  It tastes great!  I want to try all of of the flavors.<br /><br />I have tried several items from the brand and I have loved them all! [SEP] Bad Athletics is my go to for protein powder.  The flavors are so good and I love how clean the ingredients are. [SEP] This protein powder is smooth and delicious!<br />Taste great and blends well!<br />I love that t has healthy ingredients!<br />Great product !",3,True

[SEP] Not a bad suppliment at all. Helps relieve some aches and pains in my knees. Over all a good suppliment [SEP] These are a good quantity and a fair (if not amazing) value supplement.  I can't really notice a difference in how I feel or look with this, but perhaps it takes longer.  I can't say.  No issues with digesting these, though. [SEP] I started taking this specifically to reduce fine lines, keep skin hydrated and to plump up my skin to get rid of the sunken eye look. It works very well, I take this along with collagen and my skin has been glowy and amazing! [SEP] I took this in 1 pill a day in combination with 3 pills of Glucosamine chondroitin a day and my knee pain wasn't as bad during the day and doing physical activity.<br />The pain didn't go away, It just made the pain less frequent allowing me to walk better and stand longer.<br />The problem is I don't know if the effects is because of glucosamine or Hyaluronic acid all I know is when I took the cocktail combination of vitamins my knee felt much better.

These gloves are great - they fit close enough that they don’t get in the way of most jobs - we use them in the kitchen - and in the lavender barn, moving plants around, watering, sprinkling fertilizer - everything! We like that they have long arms, to protect long sleeves.  They’re very sturdy and strong and we haven’t lost a pair yet! [SEP] I received the blue/white gloves and the purple gloves and they seem to differ. The blue/white gloves seemed really shiny/slippery. I received a size large, but could have used a medium so I would say they are true to size. The purple gloves seemed thicker than the blue/white gloves and less shiny/slippery. They have a swirly design on the inside which helps with grip. The inside feels soft, like there's actual cloth material inside. They would make great for washing dishes and cleaning because of the thickness. I'd reccommend this item. [SEP] These work great. The are long enough to wash dishes and do other household cleaning. You get 2 pair in different  colors so you won't get the ones for the bathroom mixed up with kitchen gloves. They keep your hands clean and do a wonderful job. [SEP] Almost the same, but perhaps not quite as thick, as standard dishwashing gloves you might get from the grocery store.  And maybe not quite as long in the sleeves as some others, either.  Regardless, they have plenty of great uses around house house, including working on the car.  Anything to cut down on the clean-up time. [SEP] think these latex-free gloves are every bit as good as name brand latex gloves. They are also prettier with the lace imprint going around the bottom of the gloves. I have worn regular latex gloves a lot, especially when making my hand made soaps but I will be wearing these from now on. I don't think I'm allergic to latex but I used to get some horrible zits after going to the dentist so maybe I am. These latex-free gloves feel flexible yet seem durable to last a good while. [SEP] Excellent quality gloves.<br />Fairly thick rubber with a flocked lining.<br />I usually wear an XL glove but I was able to squeeze my hands into these. [SEP] These PVC gloves make excellent hand protection for household chores. They aren't good with oils or harsh chemicals the package says. They are easier to slip on and off than rubber gloves. I like the lined pair best. The hold up on the forearm well which is a good thing when working in liquids where slipping exposes the hand skin to the material one is trying to avoid touching. [SEP] I have a personal preference for the flocked gloves, as they are more comfortable to wear in the current winter climate. However, come summer, I'm likely going to switch out to the unflocked version. I have rather large hands, and these gloves are a very comfortable fit. There's enough room for my hands, while not being baggy or having too much extra material to get in the way of my work.<br /><br />My one gripe is that they're not as grippy as I need them to be when dealing with porcelain dishes and hot soapy water. Mind you, this was because the water was running at full tilt, and the dish was very soapy. However, I wish that the texture on the fingers gave you more of a grip on slippery dishes. It's not THAT bad, but it is something to watch out for.<br /><br />The colours are vibrant and pretty, and look much nicer than those horrible yellow gloves you see everywhere. [SEP] These are great gloves for household chores. The  purple gloves have a soft lining for comfort. The white ones with blue fingers  do not have a fabric lining. Bottom of my palm to tip of my middle finger is 7"" long  and palm is 3.5"" wide and the large size gloves fit a bit baggy and loose at the fingertips. The large size is easier for me to get on and off than the medium. [SEP] These gloves are great for protecting hands while doing household chores around the kitchen and bathroom.<br /><br />They are really thick and do an excellent job at keeping those harsh cleaning chemicals and dish soap off of your skin.<br /><br />I just wish they weren't such a hassle to put on. I find that it takes a few tries for me to get my hands in them. Maybe it's just my hands. But once they're on, they make doing household chores much easier so I'd still highly recommend them.",3,True

[SEP] Very thorough results and laid out in an easy to read and understand report.  It takes a while to get the results but that is the lab industry.  Great knowing what is in our water!! [SEP] Easy to do pack up and ship out. This kit was very comprehensive test including pesticides. Not complicated. Like another reviewer, had it sitting on counter for a while because I didn't want to ""get involved"" in some complex process. It is not. Get it, do it and learn about your water. [SEP] I did not trust my city's drinking water reports, esp. with an old landfill with hazmat in the middle of town. Flint Michigan set the precedent. The movie Dark Water did the rest.<br /><br />This is the best and most comprehensive test I was able to find. It comes with a temperature controlled return box. The online report results were very comprehensive and easy to understand.<br /><br />While the price might be more than you would expect for a water test, it costs less than a single cancer screening.<br /><br />Fortunately all tests came back within EPA guidelines, so I shared the results with the city. [SEP] Update (12/1):  I eventually was contacted by someone at the company after I filled out the web form to 'contact us' and I was able to get my results.  That said, if you pay $350 for something, you expect to be able to email or call the company, which I wasn't able to do.  Would I use them again for testing?  Probably not because if they can't deal with simple IT and business issues I have to question what sort of 'lab' they are actually running.<br />----original review below----<br />Beware, I registered my kit with an email address that ends in .email which seemed fine.  However, when I go to the site to retrieve the results it won't let me use that email address because of the .email extension.  I've tried emailing all of their addresses (they all bounce) and calling (they either don't answer or I get the old 'the email box is full you can't leave a msg).  So, seems pretty scammy to me.  Be careful buying these kits, you may or may not get anything for your money! [SEP] I liked it but the results will tell the whole story. Easy to follow instructions! [SEP] Very easy to use and comprehensive kit.  After getting the results back I realize i no longer need a backwashing type acid neutralizer, a non-backwashing unit will do.  Also, the results are way more accurate than any basic kit from home depot.  I have such peace of mind now knowing our well water is fine. [SEP] Easy to use and easy to read test results. [SEP] I was looking for a test that did more than the typical dipstick which provides a yes/no answer to whether a contaminant is present. Being a toxicologist, I understand that dose is of utmost importance (meaning, it is not just about whether a contaminant is present, but at what concentration, that determines health impacts). This company offers various kits, and I chose the 'ultimate', which tests just about every conceivable parameter. The instructions are simple; fill some bottles with water and return in the included package. It took about 2 days for my sample to make it to the testing facility, and 16 days until I received my results by email (the company keeps you abreast of progress with texts in the interim). The analysis was thorough and detailed, and provided levels in the mg/L (or appropriate unit, depending on substance). For a person with little background in reading these types of analyses, the results may seem a bit overwhelming initially, but they are also color coded to rapidly grasp any areas of concern (green means your water is ok, yellow if a compound is present but not at dangerous levels, red if contaminants are present outside of safe levels, etc). The cost of this product is hefty, but it provided precisely what I was looking for, and I like knowing exactly what I (and my kids) am drinking.<br />Note: I was not paid for this review, nor am I affiliated with the company in any way. I am just a person who is passionate about water quality. [SEP] Not to worry, I taped the box back together again and was therefore still able to follow the directions that required the same box be shipped back to the lab with the water samples inside. 4 season business model allows customers to send water samples in all different temperatures because the box fits perfect around a custom styro-foam material cooler with fitment lid. I was required to return the included ice pack even though the kit says not to freeze it in my current temperature ranges. Overall it is easy to use, we'll see how long it takes to get the lab results. I did not want to register the kit, but it was a requirement so I did.",3,True
"SENSOLOGY Silicone Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush, 5 Modes USB Charging Toothbrush Design for Sensitive Teeth with 1 Replaced Head Protect Gums for Kids and Adults (Pink)",[],[],,3.1,60,12280,"Great packaging. I gave it 3 stars because even though the fronts of me teeth felt clean, the backs of my teeth didn’t. I’m going to use this as my after lunch tooth brush. [SEP] The bristles on this thing are thick and made of silicone. They really dont get into the teeth to clean super well like a traditional or a bamboo tooth brush. The instructions were not really clear either.<br />If you end up trying it, keep in mind that the charging port is towards the bottom in the back, un-clip the black tab, that's where the charger goes. The overall experience is kind of like taping a ""massager"" to a tooth brush and calling it an electric toothbrush. [SEP] I bought this based on a great reviews. Oh well, it absolutely does not clean your teeth and /feels smells horrible. Money wasted. [SEP] You would have better luck cleaning your teeth with a floor mop. Brush thoroughly with this for 20min and you still would need to follow up with a different brush to get your teeth clean. Awful product! [SEP] I was in the market for an electric toothbrush and when I saw this one made of silicone bristles, I was intrigued. It has great features such as a timer and different speeds, which are all great but at the end of the day the reason to get a toothbrush is to brush your teeth and clean them. I feel like this item is fundamentally flawed because the bristles are too big to get in between your teeth. Once I finished using this toothbrush, I got my other regular toothbrush to finish off. Increasing the vibration on the toothbrush does not leave me with a satisfied teeth brushing. I love the features this toothbrush has but if I cannot clean my teeth correctly, than I am not going to have to keep my search for a better toothbrush. I give this product 3 stars for the functions it has and take 2 off for the poor quality of brushing it provides. I hope this helps you make an educated decision. [SEP] The product came with everything they had mentioned and was easy to charge and use. I always appreciate the extra toothbrush head and the step by step guide for usage. I don't use electric toothbrushes much, so trying a silicone one was very interesting. I felt the vibrations in my head a lot more and ended up getting headaches after, so I come to realize it isn't really for me.  I made sure to fully charge the brush before use, but for some reason it would keep stopping mid-use.  My teeth felt polished after, but you still have to floss or you won't get all the plaque built up on your gums.  One thing to note was it didn't feel like it was scraping away my enamel, so I had less issues with  hot and cold sensitivity. [SEP] I got this for my sister, whose kid is attending dental school.  she insisted that she needed an electric toothbrush.  I liked the fact that it was cordless and usb rechargeable.  it seems like everything is these days.  we opened the box and the 1st thing she said was, ""y is it only 1 color?  u need to have 2 different colored heads so that u dont use someone else's toothbrush.""  strike 1.  she put the toothpaste on and pushed the button.  she said it turns off a little every 30 seconds so that u can change positions.  it runs for 3 minutes, which she said was a very long time. strike 2. if u think about it, its weird that it runs for only 3 minutes u need to do both sides of the inside of ur teeth.  so wouldn't u need 4 minutes?  I guess no one wants to brush that long.  the bottom glows green when its on, and it doesn't make so much noise that its annoying.  once she cranked it up to 5, it did get a little loud and she said that after a while her hand started to feel weird.  strike 3.  we put it in a cup of water to watch the bristle action.  only the top moves, the bottom stays frozen.  strike 4.  she said her teeth felt clean after though.  the instructions that come with this machine are very lacking as well as confusing.  its as if they were translated to English.  the punctuation is all wrong and the words are just incorrect.  so if u r looking for assistance with using it... ur on ur own, but its a toothbrush... haven't we been using them our whole lives... I hope this was helpful. [SEP] Having a rechargeable toothbrush helps to get any plaque that a regular toothbrush might have missed but I feel like thick silicone bristles make it hard to deep clean my teeth. [SEP] This toothbrush is pretty cool, but it doesn't feel like it does a good job at cleaning.  If you like the idea of a silicone brush then it's fine but I'd honestly suggest looking into a more normal brush if you want a deeper clean. [SEP] I received this product in exchange for an Honest Review.  This product description and photos are accurate.<br />The SENSOLOGY Silicone Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush is small and easy to handle.  Yes, it is easy on the gums and teeth so if you have extreme sensitivity this might work for you.  Unfortunately for me it doesn't feel like it removes enough plaque for my comfort nor cleans my tongue thoroughly enough.  However, I do us a tongue scraper so this could be one reason why I feel it doesn't clean my tongue well.  Is it worth the price they're asking?  In my opinion, no.  HOWEVER, IF you have extreme sensitivity this may very well be just the product that you've been searching for and it may work for you.",3,True
"Apple Cider Vinegar Pills for Weight Loss With ACV Complex Plus, Iodine, Kelp, Potassium, and Bromelain 60 Count",[],[],,3.6,39,579,"I like the mixture of ingredients incorporated into this product. The dose for one capsule seems rather low, so I have been taking two. I tend to have a sensitive stomach when it comes to taking pills. This formulation does not bother my stomach at all. Seems to be very gentle, which helps in compliance in taking these every day. I normally take a shot of ACV in a glass of water, and this is actually so much better. The other ingredients are great additions to help boost the affect of ACV. I seem to be in more control of my appetite lately, and I think that regular use of these pills have contributed to that. EVen so, taking ACV every day is beneficial to health. [SEP] I have been drinking a Apple Cider Vinegar mix for the last couple of years.  I have to mix it once a week with some apple cider.  It is just a pain to have to mix every week and to make sure I have everything.  It also does not have the best taste.  Yuck but the doctor recommended it to me.  This Apple Cider Vinegar capsules is a welcome relief to what I have had to do the past couple of years.  There are 60 capsules in each bottle.  The recommended serving size is 1 per time.  The suggested use is 1 capsule taken 1 to 3 times a day.  I am currently only taking 1 a day.  This bottle should last me 2 months but I may adjust depending on how I feel after a couple of weeks.  These Apple Cider Vinegar capsules are much better tasting than my current mix of apple cider vinegar.  After a week I do not feel any difference in my health but definitely like not having to make a mix and drink that mix. [SEP] I take ACV daily unless I'm traveling. I now take this with me, and it is great. This has helped keep my eczema at bay, and it didn't hurt my stomach. The capsules are a bit large but not bigger than many mutli-vitamins, and do not have any after taste. [SEP] This is an apple cider vinegar formula with some extras that may slightly help you lose weight. For example, it contains lecithin, kelp, and apple pectin. Lecithin and apple pectin may help you digest fats better, theoretically ensuring that fat is used properly. Kelp contains iodine, which might positively impact metabolism if you have a deficiency.<br /><br />I mainly like vinegar for the acetic acid content, which may have a positive impact on longevity. Unfortunately, this formula doesn't list the percent of acetic acid in the vinegar.<br /><br />The main reason I knocked off a star is that the vinegar dose isn't as high because of the added extras. [SEP] For some people the addition of apple cider vinegar works for that acid reflux you get after you go to bed.  I've had great luck with this addition.  I started by drinking a teaspoon of the vinegar mixed in a glass of water and found it unpalatable but necessary.  These pills take the nastiness out of the process.  I take one pill between dinner and bedtime and so far it works like a charm. [SEP] These easy to swallow pills are a good way to get ACV without having to deal with the awful taste. This product also contains other good ingredients like Kelp, Apple Pectin, Bromelain, Potassium and Vitamin B-6. I had no bad reactions from taking this. [SEP] I have been taking this integrator for a couple of weeks and it did exactly and more than what I had expected.<br />Everyone is different but this product<br />gave me more energy and reduced appetite and cravings. .<br />Also, I feel less bloated and I have lost a little weight in my abdominal area.<br />It doesn't give me any issues or adverse reactions.<br />I would recommend to take the pills with a meal for don't upset your stomach<br />I would recommend",3,True

Safe Biodegradable (22oz)",[],[],,3.1,17,565,"I'm sorry to say that my bottle arrives busted, and therefor I couldn't really use it. I sopped up some of the loose liquid and worked it into a stone floor. I knew exactly what I was planning to use this on, so I got straight to it. I just have one spot in my late 30s, early 40s Sears kit home that has an unsealed rough stone floor. I have been wanting to find something that could clean that floor. Nothing ever describes what I have, so I have been reticent to buy anything. So I haven't used anything!<br /><br /> When I saw that this product can be used on pavers, bricks, sidewalks, etc I figured that was much closer to what I have in terms of porosity. So here I am with a busted bottle, and just a rags worth of product, and I dab it onto one spot. It really seems promising. This isnt a case of ""oh, I can use anything"".. and I certainly cant use a power washer. Hm, maybe a steamer.. but yeh, I need a cleaner. This could be it, but I dont have enough to work with. I am highly considering just buying another bottle (but concerned about another broken bottle). Personally, I think the price point is reasonable, hence why I never rate on price. IF I do buy another bottle (currently have one sitting in my cart) I will be back to update. [SEP] This Safe 'n Easy All Green Cleaner Countertops may have been good but I got an almost empty bottle. The bottle leaked and it is just a mess inside the plastic bag. I was able to read that it could cause severe burns if it gets on the skin, so I will not be opening the plastic bag.<br /><br />The bottle has instructions and if it hadn't leaked I would be able to read it. The bottle does have a sprayer included in the package. I am disappointed that I was unable to use this cleaner.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Safe 'n Easy All Green Cleaner Countertops to family and friends. [SEP] I was so sold on the description and whoever wrote it is a great marketing guy. I liked that it is nonbiodegradable and non toxic but also none of anything. It has a very slight scent, a little sud when sprayed with water  and then no effect at all on the stains that it claims to take out.  Soaked in 15, 20, 60 minutes and then 2 hours - same stain and not a dent on it. I am not sure why it is being advertised as  a power cleaner. The price point is too much to be an ordinary cleaner. There are better priced cleaners that can do something.more and pay less. [SEP] the description on the amazon listing says it works on granite, however, nowhere on the actual product bottle label does it mention granite. still, i tried it on my bathroom granite counter where i had some hard water stains. i sprayed and let it sit for more than 30 minutes. it did not remove the hard water stains. i tried it again a few days later, and still didn’t work.  i also sprayed it on some stains on my concrete driveway, and the stains did not go away. tried it again a week or so later, and still the stains remained.  yes. it will clean simple dirt and grime, but it does NOT clean the tough, stubborn ones. this cleaner is not as tough as it claims to be. [SEP] Just been a week using it and couldn’t be happier. I have an outdoor kitchen and this effectively cleans and clears the dirt, grease and grime. It’s good on tiles and stucco. The smell is nice and I am happy that it’s a safe, bio-friendly cleaner. [SEP] I like the safe and easy appeal to this product but found no ""easy"" to it... Directions were simple, it created a soapy sud when washed but found lack luster results with a hose. Probably would be better with a powerwasher, but a powerwash alone would most likely be just as good. [SEP] My wife and I tested this cleaner on our kitchen. And we can confirm it is working and working very good! [SEP] This All-Green Cleaner comes in a 22-oz bottle with a separate sprayer top.<br />I removed the cap and saw no inner seal. This cleaner has a mild lemon scent, as I sniffed the bottle.<br />I then put the sprayer top on. I like that the tube touches the bottom of the bottle.<br /><br />I used this Cleaner to clean the bricks around the fireplace, as follows:<br />1) I poured water on the bricks to get it wet. A few minutes later, I sprayed the bricks with this Cleaner.<br />2) After "".....let[ting] the product sit for 30 minutes...."" (as per directions on the bottle), I then started scrubbing.<br /><br />I like that the bricks did not look as dusty as they did before I started cleaning, even though I could not get the bricks to show that classic red color.<br /><br />My driveway has areas with dirt/grime/debris that were recently made, and other areas that haven't been cleaned in a while. I sprayed all those areas, waited 30 minutes and then started scrubbing. This Cleaner got the areas with the newer stains clean, but I couldn't get the more stubborn stains out.<br /><br />Overall, this All Green Masonry Cleaner does a decent job in cleaning the bricks and parts of our driveway.",3,True
[Recle] Face Shield Replacement Film Type Set(frame1+film5) Random Color,[],[],,2.6,14,1493,"This is ok if you are only going to use it for a short time, but I would invest in something better if you are going to wear it all day every day. This item came with one set of glasses/frames that you could stick the 5 disposable shields to. It was pretty hard to get it to work. It looked like there was a groove for the shield to fit into, but I could never get it in. The adhesive was pretty lame. By the end of two hours it was coming off. So much for extra protection. [SEP] Very comfortable to wear. They really are as comfortable as a pair of glasses, even with a shield attached.<br />Unfortunately, there is such a gap on each side, I would not wear this without a mask underneath. These face shields would be useful if you are only expecting something to splatter right between your eyes, or in the exact middle of your face. Nowhere else.<br />So these are fine, depending on the level of protection you're looking for.<br />The shields attach with a pull-off tape that sticks to the eyeglass portion. [SEP] This face shield doesn't come with instructions. I ended up attaching the plastic cover to the outside of the glasses, closer to my face. I had some trouble fitting the plastic insert in the middle space of the glasses - the corners didn't fit right.  While the plastic is clear and it is easy enough to see using this face shield, it didn't feel as sturdy as some of the others that I've used in the past.  It should be okay for indoor use but with the wind, etc outside I would not use this particular face shield.<br /><br />The face shield is worn like glasses and is propped up on the nose.  It is reasonably comfortable for short periods but I wouldn't want to use it all day. [SEP] Everything in the Recle set looks good and seems great quality but with my glasses on it’s extremely painful to wear. I tried it with the nose guard in front of and behind my frames. In front it pressed down on my earlobes so hard that it was immediately painful. Placing it behind my frames made the guard touch my inner eye and put the shield too close to my lenses. The shield also doesn’t wrap around enough if you are wearing glasses and leaves the sides of your eyes exposed. The fit maybe okay if you are lens free, but even then I found it made my earlobes start to hurt within minutes. [SEP] This shield setup is comfortable to wear and the view stays clear all day. The number of replacement shields that this comes with is very handy if one of them gets scratched or cleaned too many times but each shield could last a long time if cared for. The whole setup is very light weight so wearing it for extended periods isn't a problem. [SEP] This face shield is very comfortable. I used to wear eye glasses back when I haven't had lasik surgery and I would say the nose piece of this face shield is not that bad in comparison to wearing eye glasses. I thought it doesn't look good if the frame is color white compare to other face shield that my coworkers are wearing which is usually transparent. The frame is just like a frame of eye glasses and doesn't look weird when you are wearing it. The material doesn't look cheaply made and I think it will last for a while. The plastic film is clear although I'm not used to seeing my reflection especially with the mask on it but that is fine as long as I am protected from the virus especially these days of pandemic. The plastic film is attached to the frame with the adhesive strip that is already on the film. Not sure how long the adhesive strip will last but I think it will stick around for a while.<br /><br />Update 12/4/2020: After a week of use the adhesive came off. It is still useable but the adhesive is not a good concept. I’m updating it to 3-star because I can still use it but I’m just a little bit disappointed of the film’s adhesive. [SEP] There are no directions and the replacement shields don't hold whether  you  put them on the inside or outside of the frame. We even tried some double sided tape which didn't work either. . The slot in the films suggests that they are meant to be attached from the inside of the frame.  If you look at the pictures you can see why they are uncomfortable and impossible to wear with glasses even if you could get the film to stick to the frame.  Worthless. [SEP] This is a plastic full face covering that you wear like glasses.<br /><br />It comes with 5 stick on plastic lenses.  I was not sure how you were supposed to stick them on (no instructions).

So you choose.<br /><br />It does not steam up on me!  Even with mask on also!  That is a big plus.<br /><br />Vision does not seem more distorted than most safety glasses.<br /><br />Only issue I see is that I don't see how they would work on top of glasses.<br /><br />I think these are the best way to protect yourself besides offering a little more droplet broadcasting protection for others than mask alone and way more than nothing.<br /><br />Here is a big plus over a mask...you can see peoples expressions.  This on top of some distancing could reduce virus transmission most likely than distancing alone and allow for facial expression.  It is not in the news much, but I have heard scientist say that droplets in the eye are a path of infection and I am not talking about from your hands.  I am referring to people talking right into your face which is what people tend to do.<br /><br />Unfortunately most people will be laughing at me for wearing this in public.  I will wear it around my parents where I distance >10 feet and still want them to see my face.  I don't want to give them the virus.  I want them to enjoy what they want out of life which is not what they have been getting these last 9 months sitting at home with people visiting with masks.  This product will provide people with an alternative they can decide how to use in places where there are not other conflicting rules.

I will stick with double masking.<br /><br />I am very disappointed. [SEP] I tried and tried to get the shield to attach to the frame, and I never could. It kept falling out. There were no instructions. I suppose I could tape it on, so I tried the frame by itself over my glasses just to see how it felt, and it was extremely uncomfortable.

"Natural Sensitive Toothpaste (3PK) - Fluoride Free - Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth and Gums - Vegan, SLS Free, No Artificial Flavor, Sweetener, Color - Healthy Tooth & Gum Oral Care",[],[],,3.7,31,814,"I have always had sensitive teeth since I was a kid.  Finding toothpaste that is good for sensitive teeth, tastes good, and cleans well is not always easy.  This time, I think I found a winner!<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS TOOTHPASTE LIKE?<br />This toothpaste is not a white paste more of a paste gel.  It has a really nice mojito flavor that is not sweet but still tastes good at the same time.  There is a flip top on it and the tube is plastic.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />I have used it for half the tube now and it seems to help with sensitive teeth.  I also feel that it cleans the teeth well too.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I like this toothpaste/gel.  It tastes good, is unusual, but seems to work well for my sensitive teeth.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS so far.  This is a nice product.  I would probably buy again if it continues to perform well over time.  I have two more tubes to go through.  I will update if anything changes. [SEP] I got the Mojito flavor because of the healthy teeth and gums. The taste was okay but left an aftertaste. That went away quickly. My mouth feels clean and fresh. I am thinking of getting the other flavor too that is for the freshest mouth. [SEP] This toothpaste has an interest flavor. Never had a lemon mint toothpaste, and it's not bad! It will probably grow on me more too. One of the main reasons why I got this toothpaste was because the ingredients seemed better than conventional toothpaste. Although I didnt realize it contained silica (never heard of it before either) so I looked put up to see what it was. I guess it is ok to use, but I also read it could wear down your enamel. So I dont think I'm going to be using this regularly (just in case) I may use it weekly or even biweekly. The toothpaste doesnt foam up much, which some people may not like. Besides the silica concern, I like the toothpaste. Makes my teeth feel clean. [SEP] According to the manufacturer, ""Fresh Aid Toothpaste is packed with quality ingredients that target gum diseases like gingivitis and plaque. It prevents tooth decay and gum and tooth pain. It's also the best toothpaste for those with sensitive teeth and gums.""<br /><br />This toothpaste has ginger root extract, which I can taste and may partially account for the tingling sensation that stays on after you rinse your mouth out. The toothpaste has a yellowish color and kind of reminds me of lemon filling. It leaves your mouth feeling fairly clean but there is a lightness to this toothpaste that other white and chalky toothpastes (like Crest) don't have.<br /><br />I question whether the lack of fluoride will be effective in the long-term at protecting my recessed gums and preventing plaque from taking hold. I usually use Colgate Total, so only time will tell if this toothpaste will be as effective. I have been brushing it now for only a week, so I will update this review if anything changes. For now, it's an OK toothpaste for those who are concerned with the amount of chemicals in their toothpaste. Because of my gum issues, effectiveness is more of a priority for me, so if you have overall healthy teeth and gums, you may love it. [SEP] I recently had gum surgery, so having the opportunity to test this toothpaste came at the right time. This toothpaste has a very nice refreshing taste, and cleans the teeth. It is kind of a yellowish color gel.  It tastes fresh, but is mild so it doesn’t burn or sting the gums as some toothpastes do.  It is the perfect tooth product to use after dental surgery, but it is really a pleasant toothpaste to use especially if you have sensitive gums.  Highly recommend. [SEP] I really like this toothpaste. I've tried a heck of a lot of various natural toothpastes over the past 2 decades & thankfully have liked a heck of a lot of them. I decided to try this brands ""The Freshest Mouth"" Mild Spearmint & this Mojito ""Healthy Teeth & Gum Care"" toothpaste. Out of the two, I like this toothpaste much more. Don't get me wrong, I like the spearmint well enough, I just like this better.<br /><br />Like many natural toothpastes, this doesn't have a ridiculous amount of foam. It doesn't feel abrasive at all. It also doesn't irritate the flesh inside of my mouth. I love the light lemony flavor as well.<br /><br />If you like a strong flavored toothpaste you probably wont be happy with this. There are other natural brands that have a lot more essential oils. If you are looking for something mild, you are going to love this brand.<br /><br />Overall, I am satisfied. [SEP] I like natural toothpaste, especially fluoride-free. This product fits the bill: tastes good, feels good after brushing, and is a good value. [SEP] This natural toothpaste is great. I never realized how bad my breath can get until I had to wear a mask to grocery shop due to covid-19.<br /><br />This toothpaste does a wonderful job at eliminating bad breath while not being loaded with a bunch of chemicals. I just wish it was just mint flavored. Mint and Lemon doesn't really mix in my opinion. [SEP] I'm not really impressed with this toothpaste.  I do like the natural ingredients.  However, you have to use a lot to get any lather going, and it doesn't leave your mouth as fresh-feeling as other toothpastes.  I wouldn't order this again. [SEP] Most toothpaste, to me, has a sweet / sugary kind of flavor mixed in.  This toothpaste doesn't really have that.  It isn't bitter or chemical just has a somewhat minty non overly sweet flavor.  Not a ton of foam, which I don't think is an issue, and does leave my mouth/teeth feeling clean.  Overall, this doesn't taste bad at all but it is different.  If you have ever had ""natural"" or ""chemical free"" (I didn't label it that) toothpaste then you will get the idea.  Kids may not be to excited to use this.<br /><br />Price pint, per tube, is a bit higher then standard commercial brands but they are pretty normal / comparative to other natural toothpastes I have used.",3,True

The bristles are stiff, scratchy, and shed everywhere.  I haven't seen any difference in my skin other than being red and irritated.  If you have itchy skin though this may be a great way to solve that without being too rough on your skin.  I'd rather have a softer brush. [SEP] Long enough to reach those hard places. Sensitive enough to not hurt me [SEP] This is your standard shower brush. It seems to be well made. The handle is easy to grip and the bristles are soft. I am hopeful that this will last me a while. If you’re looking for a good value, this is a good buy. [SEP] Nice back brush that gets the job done. The handle is just the right length and the bristles are not too scratchy. It feels really good to run this brush around the back with some nice soapy lather. The item is easy to hang on a hook, not included. It has stayed up in my shower on a rubber disk hook. [SEP] This review is for the Asenlin Body Brush with Long Wooden Handle. The bath body brush is light, and the handle is easy to grip onto and use. The bristles are a medium soft strength, and I lathered in some body wash into the bristles and it spread out and dispersed, and held nicely. The Body Brush was easy to use, and reached easily everywhere to scrub. Overall, enjoy the body brush, would recommend. [SEP] I have poor circulation in my legs and extremely dry skin. This brush has been great to help scrub it away and allow me to moisturize the skin under all that flaking.<br />I do feel the handle is a little difficult to control, but the length is good to reach the middle of my back.<br />I've not had any issues with the bristles falling out. They are sturdy enough to make your shower very invigorating! [SEP] El cepillo es de madera con un mango largo para lavar fácilmente la espalda y pies, me gusta que las celdas son suaves, mi piel es sensible y este cepillo es perfecto porque sientes que limpia pero sin lastimar la piel, además de que se siente muy agradable. Lo único que no me gustó y que hubiera sido ideal para este artículo es un chupon para poder colgar el cepillo en la pared de la ducha para que se seque, pero me gustó este cepillo. [SEP] Gets the job done ✅ I just want to see how long it lasts for [SEP] Overall I like this body brush. I had to use a little more body wash than I usually do to keep the brush lathered. Using it on my upper and lower back was a little tricky as it was a little awkward to hold and use. The bristles feel a little harsh on the skin when you're using it but it may not feel like that for others. I just decided to use it mostly for my feet and under arms. Still a good body brush though.

This tool is rechargeable (so no need to worry about batteries!) and has many different attachments. It came packaged well. It cuts without being in danger of cutting skin, which is super important when trimming your nose or ears and can't really see what you're doing. Exactly what I expected the product to do [SEP] This little thing is a great shaver and trimmer. It does the job and it's really compact, which will be great for travel. [SEP] So I'm old enough now that I have to trim my nose hairs.  I've typically used scissors, but that's become a bit of a pain.  So I decided to bite the bullet and get a nose hair trimmer. I have to say, this thing works great.  The base attachment trims quickly and easily, with no risk of stabbing your brain.<br /><br />The eyebrow trimmer also works great.  I get a few rogue eyebrow hairs that make me look like Thufir Hawat's stunt double from David Lynch's Dune.  The trimmer comes with two length settings.  I used the longer one and it trimmed quickly and easily.<br /><br />There is also a shaver attachment.  This worked fine, but is a bit small for regular use.  It was handy to trim missed hairs, and would work well if you only wanted to travel with one device.<br /><br />Changing out the trimmer heads is very easy, and just takes a couple of seconds.<br /><br />My only complaint that would drop this to 4.5 stars if that was an option, would be the lack of a wall charger.  The device has a USB-C port, which is nice, but only comes with a usb-c to usb-a cable.  No plug in charger.  As the bathroom is one of the few rooms I don't have usb charging ports, this is a minor annoyance.<br /><br />However, overall, this is a great device and I'm as happy as I can be for a device that I really don't want to have to use.  :) [SEP] You can do much more than just trim your nose hairs with this unit. It can become a mini-shaver, and hair trimmer. While the shaver is only 3/4"" it will do a full shave in a pinch. The same hold true for the hair trimmer but I found that excellent for trimming around the ears. Getting those nose hairs with this is a no-brainer. Just turn it on and rotate while moving in and out of your nose and it gets all the hair. They also supply a cleaning brush to keep it clean and unclogged. Charging is quick and I did it with the same ""C"" cable I use to charge my phone. They supplied lights to showing you the exact stage your in while charging. Be careful because it is so quite you may have a tendency to leave it on after you are done and running the battery out completely. I think the full charging cycle took about 2-3 hours when it arrived. Small enough to keep in your computer backpack or attaché so you'll have it handy for instant touch-ups. A fine unit to do a task that isn't very much fun. [SEP] At some point when you begin to notice your barber trimming your eyebrows at your monthly visit you'll start to consider a nose and ear hair trimmer. This one does the job, although it's not the sort of thing you really cross shop or can easily compare against prior purchases. It comes with different head attachments for sculpting brows and sideburns and a shaving head, but the main attraction is the nose and ear trimmer. It works and is pain free. [SEP] Okay so yes us men need to do some manscaping. As we get older hair grows in some strange places. Nothing like that nose hair that touches your mustache tickling your nose. It’s time to trim!  This is a solid trimmer with some attachments. It holds its charge well and does a nice job of trimming the hair and NOT ripping it out. It’s easy to use and the price is good. My only complaint is it doesn’t come with a bag or case to keep the attachments in.  Definitely worth a try. It’s fairly quiet and worth the cost. [SEP] I got this for the nose trimmer. It works ok. I wouldn’t say it works great. I’ve used others where it left you bald in your nose but this one didn’t. I do love that it has other attachments. My husband tried the face shaver but wasn’t too impressed with it. I do like that it works from being charged up rather than batteries. Nice feature. Overall I just say it’s ok. [SEP] Great gift for dad or hubby! This comes with the nose hair trimmer, an eyebrow trimmer and a tiny shaver head, so it would maybe work as an overnight travel shaver. Works well, nice and compact. Only wish it came with a little carrying pouch to keep everything in.  Still, this is a good buy for the price! [SEP] So, if you are in the market for a hair trimmer that won't trim your hair, this this is the perfect product for you.<br /><br />I don't know if I just received a dud or what, but I have tried several times over to get the nose/ear hair trimming attachment to actually cut a single hair.<br /><br />The shaver part seems to work a little, but the nose/ear part not at all.<br /><br />I charged this thing up to 100%, cleaned it, sung it a song, everything - but nothing worked.  I tried my neckline with the shaver but it only cut about 3 little hairs.<br /><br />It sounds like it is running.  I have checked and rechecked all the heads, but boom, nothing, nada, zilch.  I still have hairy ears and a hairy nose.<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful.",3,True

There is no manufacturer or distributor listed anywhere on the label. I do not know what country they are from. That alone erodes my trust in this company.<br /><br />The other issue that is a bit alarming is that the information on the label does not match what the product page states. I have no idea which one is correct.<br /><br />Because of the two issues above, I can not recommend these gummies. [SEP] Every time I think og zinc, I remember The Simpson's and ""A World Without Zinc"".  Fun fact:  I looked it up and humans would not exist without zinc.<br /><br />These supplements are tasty. They aren't too sweet, but they still taste like candy. There is 240 per order. I see some complaints about the label verses dosage. I think zinc is like vitamin E where there is a dosage for natural verses manmade. [SEP] My wife and I saw this supplement available for review from VINE and we agreed. We are not doctors or nutritionists but we have been occasionally including zinc in our supplements particularly because we've read about its benefit in suppressing colds.<br /><br />The chief complaint about taking some other zinc products is the taste, which some people, including my wife and I, find unpleasant. That's why zinc often is masked with fruity tastes.<br /><br />These gummies are soft and good tasting. Of course, we know that any review of food products and flavors is a personal matter. We're pleased to give this 5 stars as a good-tasting way to occasionally get some zinc. [SEP] All the info about these that I saw when I ordered these has disappeared by the time I received them. No current price is listed either. I had ordered them based on info listed and the bottles don't have the supplements the listing said it would. These only have Zinc. I'm really sketched out with this seller and these gummies so I'm going to be throwing them away instead of feeding them to my family.

Poleview Shower Steamers Aromatherpy Shower Bombs Relaxing Gifts Easter Birthday Mothers Day Self Care Stress Relief for Women 12 Pcs with 4 Different Fragrance,[],[],,4.1,53,335,"I love these aromatic steamer shower bombs! They are vividly colored, appropriately sized, delightfully scented, and affordably priced, and they always provide an invigorating shower experience! Each disk comes individually wrapped, and the entire set is attractively packaged, but I will say that any other scented products I use at the same time as these overpower the fragrant scent of these bombs (simply because body washes and shampoos are closer to my nose). The air is scented strongly for up to about 3 feet above each bomb, and they dissolve cleanly without staining surfaces, so I’d still recommend this boxed dozen to others! [SEP] It smells really good, it makes showers quite relaxing [SEP] There is absolutely no scent and needed to scrub shower after one use. Wanted to test to see if I could give as Christmas gifts but sadly no. [SEP] Smells pleasant, I like the variety of it and it did relaxed me [SEP] The attractive presentation makes this a very gift-able option.  The shower steamers are colorful, with a mild scent.  In fact, that is the problem with this product.  She used one last night, and I used the product in this morning's shower.  My shower tends to be quick, so I thought the short duration affected the aroma intensity.  It didn't seem as strong as other shower steamers that we've used.  So, when I asked her impression of the steamer, she said that she was a bit disappointed because it barely had any fragrance.  She said she even picked it up, to sniff the disc. It definitely had a significantly weaker fragrance than others.<br />I also noticed that the discs are smaller than other shower steamers that we've used.  But, the size shouldn't affect the scent.  Also conspicuously absent was the usual welcoming aroma upon opening the box. In this instance, there was barely any scent.  I thought they possibly used a different covering/coating around the shower steamer to 'hold in' the fragrance.  When I'd hold a steamer to my nose to sniff, there was a slight recognition of the fragrance.<br />The steaming discs are not labeled, nor identified on the box.  They do give a color code with associated scent, on the enclosed 'thank you' card.  It's in small print, but it's there.  While I don't like this mode of identification for the shower steamers, it's better than nothing.<br />This set of shower steamers, offering four different weak scents, proved disappinting.  Accordingly, it earns a 3.5 star rating. [SEP] These shower steamers are so much fun and they would make a wonderful gift. The scents are all very nice and there isn’t one I dislike. The only problem I have is that the scents aren’t very strong once you put them in the shower. You can barely smell it. I’ve tried a few different shower steamers and they all seem to have this same problem. They last about 10-15 minutes in the shower and it might help to use 2 at a time. [SEP] Another great set of shower steamers. Perfect for those who love steamers while they shower. Also a great set that can be given as a gift.<br /><br />Katiebabs [SEP] use these steamers in my daily showers. it acts as a bath bomb but just doesn't say. no scent or anything.<br /><br />you 12 cakes. you place them in your shower floor. they dissolve like bath bomb. [SEP] These are super useful when you've had a long tiring day. Gets you relaxed and in the mindset of rest. The scents are great and they last at least 10 minutes in the shower. Can be overpowered by certain body wash scents though. Very giftable and can't be packed in a toiletry bag for travel [SEP] My wife enjoyed each scent.

"Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower - Double-Sided Body Brush for Women and Men, Exfoliating, Lathers Well, Long Lasting, Comfortable Massage for Improves Blood Circulation and Skin Health (Blue)",[],[],,3.0,32,608,"I saw a commercial for this Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower. I loved the way it lathered up on the commercial. It did not do this for me. I tried both sides. I tried more body wash. I tried rubbing the back scrubber against itself to create the lather. Nothing worked.<br /><br />I loved the feel of the little scrubbers and it may very well be a good exfoliator but that is about all it would be good for. The description for this scrubber said, ""Improves vascular blood circulation, helps evenly distribute fat deposits, and release metabolic waste of your skin at the same time"". I can't see that this will be effective.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower to friends and family. I will be letting them know that the commercial shows a lot of lather but it did not produce that for me. [SEP] This is pretty easy to use not that I've seen a big difference. [SEP] We like the gentle scrubbing action of this silicone 'loofa'.  Having only used a regular loofa in the past, which can be rough on the skin, a silicone one is a nice change. We use a bath gel which lathered well and helped the scrubber glide over the skin.  The scrubber is long enough but just barely - it could be a few inches longer for ease of use.  We could use it just fine on our backs but if you have difficulty with shoulder movements it would be harder.  Overall enjoyable.  I like that it dries out much more quickly than a regular loofa. [SEP] This scrubber avoids getting gross and gunky by simply not holding your soap lather. It all rinses off the moment the slightest jet of water hits it, making it simply a back scrubber. As a 'soapless' scrubber, it isn't all the great either. It<br />s too awkward to be used anywhere other than the back, and the ""men's"" side is a bit too coarse while the ""lady's"" side is too soft. So if I wanted to use this, I'd only be able to either harshly or barely scrub my back with it, but without any soap lather. So I've abandon it in favor of my excellent-at-lathering/scrubbing/exfoliating facecloths that maybe aren't as easy to use for scrubbing my back, but the other things they do, they do better by a long shot. [SEP] # My Review<br />This review is for the KerKoor Silicone Double-Sided Body Scrubber. I’ve used many bath/shower body scrubbers over the years and they either work well or not so well. With that in mind, I’ve always ended up with a long handle brush that works - but, when I saw this back scrubber, I wanted to give it a try.<br /><br />This silicone back scrubber is around 2 feet in length and 4 inches wide that has 2 large handles on each end to conveniently hold while using this in the bath/shower. There are 2 sides to this scrubber, each side with a different design, style and size (coarse & fine) of scrubbing bristles that provides the following benefits as described by the manufacturer:<br />1. Cleans body deeply<br />2. Improves vascular blood circulation<br />3. Evenly distributes fat deposits<br />4. Releases metabolic waste the skin<br /><br />The silicone is strong and appears to be made of high-quality grade material. The bristles are adequately spaced and easily dries up quickly after use which stops any mold growing. I applied a generous amount of bath/shower gel on the scrubber and started to use it as instructed. The scrubber was put to its test – I lathered it up and started to wash with the bristles doing its job, however the lather soon dissipated and didn’t last long. It appears that you need to use a lot of bath/shower gel to maintain the lather for this scrubber to be effective. The handles make it easy to use across the whole body and helps those hard to reach areas. The bristles do feel nice and you can see them working against the skin to exfoliate and massage at the same time.<br /><br />Overall, this is an OK scrubber.<br /><br />** Thanks for reading my review!

[SEP] As I've gotten older and less flexible, scrubbing my back has gotten more difficult. I've tired brushes and they are hard for me to maneuver. This Silicone Back Scrubber is a much easier to use tool.<br />I've found it to lather well, scrub with just the  right amount of pressure, and rinse out easily.<br />As a woman of ample proportions, I wish it were just a bit longer, but it does work. [SEP] This scrubber is long enough to reach every part of my body easily. I am able to scrub my back up and down and sideways.<br />It works really great for exfoliating dry scaly skin and getting the itch that is hard to reach. It does a great job of cleaning and massaging my back when my husband is not home. It might take time to learn to maneuver the handles though. When finished, I can put the scrubber over the rail on my tub. [SEP] The KerKoor Stores Double-Sided Silicone Back Scrubber Brush is exactly what I have been looking for.  At 29 inches I can pretty much access any area of my back – although someone less limber may wish for a few more inches.<br /><br />Side B (the smaller nodes) is the best thing I have found for applying lotion to my back.  Eczema sufferers should find this very useful as that side of the brush is very gentle so that lotion or cream can be applied without  inflaming the skin further.  Side A works for aggressive cleaning or exfoliation although it will probably not be abrasive enough for some people.  A good product at a reasonable price. [SEP] No lo use, muy mal producto [SEP] I really like this, so much better than the old loofa ones that tend to mold if left hanging in the tub. This is more sanitary, can give a vigerous scrub, is easy to use. I am petite, and the scrubber is quite long.

I didn't take it for 30 days because I don't like the taste of the capsules and because I believe that it should show *some* effects along the way. That is, I doubt that you notice no results for 29 days and then it hits all at once on the 30th day. [SEP] There is a lot to be said for this supplement. I thought it did a pretty decent job within the first two weeks but then leveled off for the rest of the 30 day period. I found that I could measure performance being marginally better when using this versus when I took a few days off after. It was on the third day after that I knew that something about this supplement did in fact work for me.<br /><br />That said, I find that there are other options that provide better value and better results. In fact, their other product (which is a little stronger in three capsule form) is significantly stronger than this one. However, I still find other options are available with other ingredients that work as well for me at a lower cost.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to try this product first, take the 30 day challenge (I did not take it) and if it works great for you, awesome! If it works pretty well and you're fine continuing something, try the Braini LEX formula they also have. [SEP] I always take something daily to keep my brain going and I got this to go against the Alpha Brain that I’ve been using, with good results, for some time now. I’ve only been taking this a few days and stopped taking the other. Only time will tell but, I’m hoping this does even better; it costs more too.<br />  It’s like they advertise, it’s like a cup of coffee but, this is helping the brain function better. It’s made in an real blue glass bottle and is clinically tested in the USA. It has completely different ingredients than other products, to help the Brain, than I’ve ever tried too.<br />  I’m glad I’ve tried it and will update if it makes a difference over my usual supplementation.

What I received has an best date December 2021.<br /><br />This is the first product I've seen that provides a test for one to see for themselves<br />if the product has indeed bettered cognitive performance and brain functions.<br /><br />Braini is stimulant free - natural ingredients.<br />It's a pretty standard size vegetable cellulose capsule 3/4"" long.<br /><br />Gluten free - NON dairy - Caffeine free. [SEP] Not sure that it made a difference The baseline test and the test after 30 days only showed<br />minor change. To know if the tests are accurate is another thing. I certainly did not notice any<br />difference. Probably will not purchase these again. [SEP] I'm always trying nootropics. This is a good supplement, I felt more alert and focus. My only thing is the price. It might be worth it but I'm not willing to pay that monthly. [SEP] I had reviewed Braini capsules before. My experience with their products was very positive. When it came to the capsules, I wanted my 80 year old father to try them. He unfortunately, has been going through several health issues, but was also experiencing a little bit of fogginess in the head when it comes to memory, and issues of repeating himself. My father is still very much lucid, but struggles from time to time with remembering details, as well as short term memory issues. I actually had him try Braini for 30 days, and he had experienced some very promising improvements. His memory, as well as his focus had certainly improved. For him, that was something that also translated into an improved mood. That's because his frustrations from forgetting things, could often lead to aggravation. When I saw that there was another opportunity to order more capsules from Braini, I jumped at the opportunity, because I wanted him to continue taking it for longer than just 30 days. He continued to take Braini, and saw an even greater improvement in his abilities for recall, as well as communicating his thoughts without having to search for ideas. Basically, he did notice a positive impact to his cognitive ability, more so after continuing then even during his first 30 day trial. I personally, I'm very pleased with these results, and I know for him, who is going through health issues, something that can improve his cognitive abilities has increased his quality of life. For this, I am thrilled about it. I know he's happy with it too, because he says it to me directly. Based on his and my own experience with brainy products, I do highly recommend them.

supersred 54w USB Red Light Therapy Panel with Timing Function， 18Leds Red 630nm 660nm and NIR Infrared 850nm Red Light Bulb,[],[],,3.3,31,607,"This SUPERSRED 54w USB Red Light Therapy doesn't do anything as far as I can tell. Half the lights do not work. I don't know if that is how it is supposed to be but I doubt it. It does come on, the timer works and the stand is nice. There is instructions for the timer but nothing else.<br /><br />The light comes with a nice stand, it took a little bit to get it to work but it is nice. It also comes with a power cord that has a timer on it. There are 18 places for lights but only half of mine work so I don't know if that is a defect or if that is what it is supposed to do.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this SUPERSRED 54w USB Red Light Therapy to family and friends. [SEP] This radiates a red light, and seems to relieve some discomfort. It's easy to use, just make sure to protect your eyes, the same way you would in a tanning bed. [SEP] It seems to be working at reducing my back pain. It is really easy to use [SEP] This therapy lamp has been a real game changer for my husband.  He has been using it every night for six months now.  Surgery from a torn rotor cuff and also ankle injuries from a long ago motorcycle accident left him in constant pain as he has gotten older.  This light has really help him.  We had read about the benefits of red light but were both skeptical, but willing to give it a try,  I am so glad he did!  He uses it twice a day for 20 minutes each time, for both ankle and arm.  The light is very convenient and light weight.  The red lights are kinda bright.  The panel has 18 LED’s, 3 639 6 660 and 9 850 nm wavelengths. The lights do seem very bright so don’t look directly at them.<br />I feel like it is very well built and of good quality.  The timer works well and is nice that it cuts off after the timed session is done.  I kinda wished it came with a user guide/manual but it is sort of self explanatory.<br />We are well pleased and would highly recommend this red light!  It has made a tremendous difference in my husbands pain levels! [SEP] Nice FAR / NIR Device that is Powerful for it's size. It is easy to use and benefits Everything from Healing, Pain Relief and Improving Quality and Appearance of Skin...Worth taking advantage of so Go 4 It!!!<br /><br />;-D Paul [SEP] Considering the design, the form makes this a very transportable device. It even comes with a drawstring bag to store it. With a rating of 54W, this has ample power, similar to some of the more powerful bulb types. It covers 630nm, 660nm and 850nm wavelengths, as opposed to most bulb types that don't only include red light 660nm and infrared 850nm.  I also feel the rectangular format issues a more uniform exposure.<br />The power cord has the power button, which also accesses the timing function. Successive taps of the power button will cycle the timer settings.  Including the usb power plug is a smart decision, making the item a complete product. Now, the user won't have to search for an available usb port, or a spare usb power plug. The only disappointment is the lack of a user guide/manual. But, to be fair, other red light therapy bulbs that we have did not have a user guide/manual included.<br />Another included accessory is the folding stand. It can unfold in various configurations to allow numerous positions for the lamp. See the attached photos, I show two possible configurations, with the lamp in horizontal and vertical orientation.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the product, with a ruler for size reference. Note the compact size, and the smart design. There is no fan, operating in complete silence. This product could easily travel inside a gym bag or luggage.<br />If you are searching for a credible, quiet photobiomodulation (red light therapy/phototherapy) lamp for skin, muscle treatment, this deserves serious consideration. It matches the descriptions and images in the product details, and appears to be a very well crafted device. It earns a solid 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] I requested this because I remember seeing that red wave light is good for acne prone skin.  I was surprised to find the box on my doorstep - with just a label on it.  No wrapping, instructions or any other info of any other sort.  The lights are super bright but I have no idea how I'm supposed to use them.  Honestly, they remind me of grow lights I ordered a bit ago.<br /><br />With no safety info or instructions, I'm certainly not going to have my teen use this to 'see' if it improves her acne! [SEP] It's small and convenient, light weight....bought for pain relief and so far have only used for facials, will update in a month [SEP] This therapy lamp has been a real game changer for my husband.

The visible red light is blinding. If you look directly at the device you will have spots on your field of view when you look away.<br /><br />The build and quality is on par with others in it's class. It feels quite well-built.<br /><br />As for the NIR effects, well that is a matter of time. I've used other NIR products for injuries and feel the benefits. I'm making the assumption I will have similar benefits from this one. NO reason to doubt I wouldn't.<br /><br />But, again understand this produces a highly intense, focused beam of visible red light from 9 of the outputs.",3,True
Dental Herb Company - The Traveler,[],[],,4.5,51,670,"Great line up with this combo-travel pack. Everything can easily slip into bag so you can have freshy fresh breath on the go. This is an interesting taste. I taste clove and mint. All 4 kids use it without complaint too and we all agree it makes our mouths feel super clean. [SEP] These are nice little travel packs to bring along in a pinch when you are out of smaller tooth paste and mouth wash, plus a small size of spritz breath spray. These packs are very small and easy to store and bring along. These work pretty well. I am not a huge fan of the breath spray, but that is just because I don't generally use them so I wish they would have included more mouth wash and tooth paste since those I use a lot more. [SEP] perfect portions for brushing teeth, rinsing with mouth wash and a handy spray container for freshening up your breath as needed. [SEP] My dentist introduced me to this line of products some years back, and I had been using the mouthwash and the oral irrigation rinse for use with my water pic ever since then, but had never tried the breath spray or the toothpaste. I also recently went on a vacation where I was not able to bring my mouthwash, and I had really missed it.<br /><br />This was a wonderful way to get introduced to the other products in the line that I hadn't yet tried, and to have some travel products available for the next time I go on vacation so that I don't have to do without.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent and seems very sturdy, yet it's easy to get into when I want to use. And I really like the breath spray, which seems to actually neutralize issues rather than just cover them up with a squirt of mint. [SEP] This are perfect when space in your luggage is at a premium.  If you're only traveling for a few days toss several of these in your toiletry bag and you'll be set.  This is so much better than trying to fill up a travel bottle with mouthwash and finding a toothpaste tube with the least amount in it.  I have nothing negative to say about these dental packs whatsoever. [SEP] This travel set of Dental Herb Company products contains 5 Tooth & Gums Tonic mouthwash single packs, 3 multi-use packs of Tooth & Gums Essentials toothpaste, and a full sized Spritz breath spray. The flavor is a very strong herbal/minty/chemical taste that I found very unpleasant. The small sized packets are nice for traveling. [SEP] Awesome little travel pack. The flavor is great and my teeth feel clean when I use. [SEP] Loved the Mouthwash. Did not like the taste of the toothpaste. [SEP] It’s natural and not strong flavor  and doesn’t burn [SEP] It has helped with my mouth health during chemotherapy- along with regular brushing.",3,True
"Lavender Essential Oil, MAYJAM Premium Pure Essential Oils, 3.38FL.OZ Lavender Oil for Diffusers Soap Candle Making, Ideal for Home Office Car Yoga Use",[],[],,3.8,47,2007,"This has a lavender note to it, but not the strong unmistakable scent of any lavenders/lavandins I've worked with before. It is not floral to my nose at all. It has a somewhat chemical pine like scent that is present that I'm not fond of. There is no information about the oil, as in the botanical name or its origin, on the bottle or packaging. I'm certain this is not true lavender. [SEP] This lavender essential oil already has 102 reviews with a high star rating so I doubt I can add anything unique to say about it.  It has a lovely lavender scent and I will be using this to scent my hand made soaps. [SEP] I don't get too many essential oils from unknown brands because I'm not well versed enough to tell if something is ""fake"". I know having a popular name brand doesn't necessarily equate to ""real"" essential oils, but at least you get a general idea of the company's reputation. I threw some caution to the wind with this one because I was just going to get lavender, which isn't anything too expensive and is a pretty common essential oil. Although I don't know how pure this oil is, it smells like lavender to me. So far I've used a few drops in my diffuser and it made the room smell nice. I also put a few drops down the kitchen sink daily, as deodorizer. I do have to admit after seeing some of the reviews I am a little hesitant and wonder if this has been mixed or diluted with other ""stuff"". I don't plan to repurchase but I think as long as you aren't using this topically (and of course NEVER ingest this!) on your skin or plan to inhale this on a long term basis, it is fine. This works great for what I am using it for. [SEP] This is a very generous bottle of Lavender essential oil, seems like almost twice the amount that you normally get when buying essential oil of similar price. The smell is very good too, it's like fresh-cut lavender. I only use this essential oil for diffusion, so I can't speak on it's effectiveness towards anything else, but when diffused it smells amazing and really aides in feeling relaxed during down-time. I definitely recommend it! [SEP] I diffuse this oil. It is easy to use and smells great. The only issue I have is the concentration. It seems to be a lighter scent than other similarly priced oils.<br /><br />I love using the in my bedroom at nighttime. [SEP] I have used MAYJAM EO’s before and have been generally impressed (their Ylang Ylang and Sandlewood are great!).  Lavender is one of my favorites though, and this one is excellent.  If you are familiar with lavendar EO’s you know that they generally fall into two main categories of scents (depending on the specific species of lavender used).  One type is slightly sweeter smelling (still strong lavender scent but the subtle sweetness takes the edge off of the scent.  The other general category of scent is a stronger, almost medicinal scent with a slight edge to it.  This falls closer to the latter.  Personally I prefer this stronger scent as I think it does a better job in a diffuser, which is how I generally use it.  It does well in other scenarios too, but sometimes the scent needs to calm a bit so that the edge is off.  I would say that while this one is closer to the stronger, almost medicinal scent, it is not the strongest I have smelled, so in that regard it is sort of the best of both worlds.  The bottle is a large, almost 4oz bottle with a screw on top.  It comes boxed with a separate screw on dropper as well so you can use either.  The box was securely packaged, as was the glass dropper inside.  The price, at under $10 for almost 4oz of high quality lavender EO, is *very* good.  Overall this is definitely a winner.  I hope this is helpful info to you! [SEP] This arrived well packaged, I like that a dropper was included. I can smell the lavender, it isn’t quite as good as my usual lavender go to. [SEP] Sometimes you order lavender essential oil and it has an off-smell, but this one has the perfect balance of earthy and floral, just as a lavender EO should smell. The size of the bottle is large, so it will last you forever, and it came with a glass dropper that screws on. The bottle arrived with a plastic plug under the screw cap to prevent leakage during shipping and it worked! I would buy this again. [SEP] I love this oil, I whenever I am feeling anxious I drop some oil into my diffuser, rub some on my chest or hands to smell the aroma and it definitely help calm my nerves, anything lavender helps [SEP] Doesn’t smell like lavender at all don’t waste your money!!!",3,True
NEW Gentleman's Shower Tablets (10 Tablets),[],[],,3.8,37,1614,"If Vicks VapoRub were a shower steamer, this would probably be it. It smells exactly the same, and boy does it seem medicinal to me. I guess gentleman really enjoy Vicks over things that actually smell good? I don’t get it. I’m glad there was less packaging (but keep in a dry place, or they’ll be ruined), so that’s a plus, but I genuinely found the fragrance of these to be unpleasant. I bet they’re great if you have a cold or something, but other than that? I didn’t find it particularly soothing. [SEP] It’s relaxing, it smells good and it could even be perfect for cold season [SEP] Not sure why there are complaints about medicinal smells but that's kind of what these shower steamers are for. I've used the type that just smells ""nice"", floral and what not, but I always come back to eucalyptus type scents. I just like that it opens my nasal passage while the steam and the eucalyptus evaporates. I could be a little biased because I LOVE eucalyptus essential oils. These ones are a little more fragile than other shower steamers I've used in that when I toss one in the shower it breaks in half. It doesn't really matter to me if they are whole or in half but it was just an observation I made. I actually thought these took a little while to dissolve than other shower steamers I've used. This one still smells very eucalyptus to me even if it is frankincense + eucalyptus. Although these are marketed for ""gentlemen"", it is great for anyone and everyone. It doesn't smell any more masculine than the other scents. Overall I am very happy with these tablets and think they're great. These also seem to be of much better quality than some of the cheap ones I've seen (usually made in China). Price wise these cost about as much as the Vicks Vaporub tablets but I believe they're larger per tablet. These are Made in USA, if it matters to you. [SEP] Definitely did not like this scent. It was extremely overwhelming. It was overpowering while in the bag but in the shower, the scent did not sit well with my nostrils. Can't really describe it but I just know the mixture of eucalyptus and frankincense is not for me. The good news is that it didn't dissolve quickly and the scent filled the shower well allowing you to have a good or bad experience with it. This one just wasn't a scent I liked but someone else may. It dissolved easily once under a light stream of water and cleaned up easily also. [SEP] I can smell it through the bags, and it smells very promising.  I will mention more later [SEP] Good steamers, produce a decent amount of awakening eucalyptus to my showers. Very happy with the amount compared to other steamers I've used. Good sized, lasted most of my shower length. The bags had descriptive stickers on them (vs being printed) and the stickers were very crinkled...BUT the bag seals great with the velcro catch and that is what really matters. The steamers are loose in the bag and some were chipped, shaved or damaged upon arrival. But overall, a pleasant scent and invigorating experience! [SEP] These smell awesome. I wouldn't say they are for 'men' though. They aren't really masculine - just minty/eucalyptus smelling. The first think I thought when I smelled them is that they would be great when you have a cold. [SEP] Like throwing money away?  If so then this product is for you!  It does nothing, absolutely nothing.  I used this in the shower after work hoping for a nice relaxing environment and this product did nothing but dissolve.  There was no indication it was actually in the shower.  This product is 100% waste of money",3,True

[SEP] In the right shoe, ones with enough room for this much thicker than any other insoles I've ever owned insoles, they work well.  They are very soft and get the right pressure on my arches.<br /><br />If they fit this way in all my shoes, it would be a five-star product.  However, they are uncomfortable and unwearable in MOST of my sneakers.  The insoles are just too thick for my feet to fit in my sneakers properly, causing pressure on the top of my feet.<br /><br />As a result of the inability to use these in most of my footwear, I've got to go with a 3 star review. [SEP] These are pretty good as build ups for older work boots that the old inserts are going out in.  My guy put these in (as a replacement for the old ones) then put in soft inserts over them.  He has pretty intense flare ups of his plater fasciitis every now and then and he likes these double stacked when it does happen.  This insert won't work best for everyone since it is hard not soft.  BUT if you need to have a hard surface to press on then its a great one.  It fits his 11 size boots with no issues and are comfortable for him. [SEP] After 5 months of use im supper happy with them I pass 8 to 10 hours standing up at work and my foot was hurting me a lot I have been using these and since the very first day the difference was notable, just be sure you order the correct size for you. I will buy it again [SEP] Very good, especially for someone with Plantar Fasciitis. My brother has suffered from that and has pain a lot lately. These have really helped him. They are very supportive and comfortable all day long. [SEP] I thought it is solf but nope. Better forget this 1 [SEP] Orthotic Insoles are a more solid high arch, than if you buy same from Walgreens.  They helped me adjust my body and my back hurt for two weeks, but after  that, I feel Great!  Anything new will hurt but this is great as I am a cosmetologist.  I am on my feet all day. Love these non flimsy insoles. [SEP] These worked great, they are stiff, but the support I was looking for I’ve tried all kinds of insoles these work the best for me [SEP] Very uncomfortable.

However, if the price were more than $12.99, I would have rated this 2 or 3 stars due to the additional items included.<br /><br />This comes in a giftable box and includes a sleep mask, a silk eyeshade (like another mask), and disposable foam earplugs in a plastic case.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the foam mask. It is a cushiony soft, but full-bodied sleep mask. This mask has eye cutouts. There is also an adjustable strap in the back. Since there is an eye socket channel, I can open my eyes underneath without touching the front of it and it blocks out all light incredibly well. It feels like it is made of cloth covered form. It is comfortable to wear and fits me very well and is not too snug. It does not move around when I lay down with it. Overall, I really love the mask.<br /><br />However, the eye shade feels more like a lightweight silk mask. Even when I extend the adjustable strap all the way, it pulls tight around my eyes, is useless at blocking all light, and is supremely uncomfortable. The ear plugs are also just junk to me. They should leave out both items. I only took off one star because the mask is 5 stars. If they left out the other junk, I would have rated this 5 stars at the current price of $9.99. [SEP] I was looking for a sleeping mask that I could use on an upcoming international trip. I have trouble sleeping when it is not totally dark, so sleeping when travelling in a plane, train or other mode of transportation has always been difficult.  I wanted to find a sleeping mask that was both comfortable to wear and blocked out all light.<br /><br />I ordered the Seedling's 3D Contoured Cup Sleeping Mask and it has really hit the mark on what I was looking for.<br /><br />Good:<br />1. Comfortable to wear. It is not flat. Cushion runs around the outer edge of the mask so it does not touch any part of your eyes.<br />2. Blocking light. I tested wearing the mask during the daytime and to my surprise there was no light seepage. It was totally dark. Since the mask has contoured cups around your eyes you can open them while wearing to confirm no light was coming in.<br />3. Material. The mask feels like it made out of some neoprene/spandex material. It is smooth against the skin.<br />4. Bonus. It comes with a bonus silk mask and ear plugs.<br /><br />Bad:<br />1. Nothing to note. Although one suggestion I would make is to include a carrying case for the mask instead of the bonus silk mask. Since I plan to use the mask when I travel, I have to figure out how to protect it in my baggage when not being used.<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend this sleeping mask. [SEP] Got this for when I have migraines. It is amazing. No light came through anywhere. The strap is adjustable and it's is very soft and cushioned with gel pads. [SEP] Love  is sleeping mask, It feels so good on my head and my eyes it is covering eyes and does not let any like to come in [SEP] This fits great, is comfortable and completely blocks light.<br />I have been using this mask while traveling and it has been great on the planes and in hotels.<br />I love this mask. [SEP] I ordered these because I wanted to test out several pairs.<br /><br />These have probably the best eye relief of those that I've tested.<br />With my long eye lashes I don't want to have them touching the mask and these work great.<br /><br />They don't really ride up much at all.<br /><br />I do suggest you buy 2 or 3 masks. This way when one needs to be washed you can take the other out and not have to do laundry THAT DAY.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with my purchase. [SEP] I have tried so many different types of eye masks and this one is comfortable, affordable and serves it’s purpose. The nose area sits very comfortably too [SEP] I just got a different sleep mask for travel and I loved it so much I wanted one for home because I work nights and sleep during the day. This mask exceeded my expectations (I got a surprise bonus green silk mask in my box and it’s so beautiful!) I was worried about the adjuster piece on the back would get stuck in my curly hair but it’s so flesh with the strap it hasn’t posed any problem. This mask totally blocks light and does so without putting pressure on the eyes or head so if you’re a side sleeper - it’s a total win. [SEP] This Seedling 3D Sleep Mask doesn’t seem to have any odors that give me an allergic reaction.  I’ve had bad luck with allergic reactions to odors in the past with similar 3D masks.  This mask has a plastic loop near the temple that I don’t like.  My favorite 3D mask has the plastic loop placed on a sewn-in elastic loop, so that the plastic loop is 4.5” back toward the back of my head.  Better for a side-sleeper like me, maybe not so much for a back sleeper.  Another challenge with 3D masks like this is the pressure on the pillow-side eye-socket, but it’s one that I can live with by finding the spot on the end of the pillow where that pressure is mitigated.  This mask came with a bonus silk mask that I won’t use, and two ear-plugs in a small plastic case that I will use.  The earplug case is a nice touch that I’ll will use after the provided earplugs are done.  I’m hoping I can live with the plastic loop at my temple.  If I can’t I’ll update this review.  If you're a side sleeper, you may want to keep shopping for a mask that doesn’t have a plastic loop right at your temple. [SEP] I tend to not sleep well with visual stimulation...  including light through closed eyelids.  So, I always keep my bedroom very dark.<br /><br />But there are times this doesn't work.  My wife might not be able to sleep and is looking at her cell phone screen.  Or I'm on a long flight.  Or in a hotel with some item...  a thermostat panel, or an LED on a smoke detector, or lights from outside shining past the blinds... which causes issues.<br /><br />I have been buying the ""Good Night sleep mask"" from Magellan's for all this time, after trying, and discarding, quite a few others.  The Magellan mask is neoprene rubber...  think ""like a SCUBA suit""... cover with soft cloth bonded to the rubber.  What makes them so good is that the rubber is formed, so there is a ""domed"" cavity over each eye, and even while wearing them, you can have your eyes open, blind, and so on, with no sensation of contact with your eyes or eyelashes.<br /><br />Their drawback, however, is that the fabric inevitably debonds from the rubber.  A set, if well cared for, may last a year of continuous usage.<br /><br />So, seeing these, I wanted to give them a try.<br /><br />Generally, I like them.  They're very comfortable to wear, block light effectively, and seem likely to last longer than my long-time favorites.<br /><br />But they don't QUITE clear my eyelashes.  Opening or closing my eyes with this on results in a ""tickling"" of my eyelashes.<br /><br />If these were a bit more ""domed"" over the eyes, but identical in every other way, they would be PERFECT.<br /><br />As it is, they still work quite well, and if you have short eyelashes or deep eye sockets this quibble of mine might not be a concern for you, anyway.<br /><br />But for me, opening my eyes and still being in pitch blackness without any sensation of contact?  That's a huge selling point.  The Magellan ones accomplish that.  These don't, for me.<br /><br />So, while I'm keeping these and will use them, I'm not ready to abandon my favorites for them just yet.  I'll keep both types around for now.<br /><br />But a set like these, with the around-eye ""pillows"" and well-sewn construction, but with those domed eye cavities?  That would be a vast improvement over either type.  If someone made a set like those, it would be all I'd ever buy again.",3,True

They would also make great reusable lunch bags. Come with thanks you tags and string to attach. Durable and make gift giving fun. Great to keep on hand for last minute gifts. [SEP] These are not your typical gift bags - they are sturdy and can stand up to wear and tear. They are not made of paper so they can be re-used - in fact, if you're giving them out, your gift receipent can easily re-use them numerous times, so they are eco-friendly. I love how glittery they are and they come in a variety of colors - silver, gold, rose gold. I love how they look and they are ideal for gifting small items like jewelry. The only thing I didn't like was the gift tags - only one kind is offered, ""Thank You."" I wish they came with a variety of tags. As it is, they seem made only for ""thank you"" swag bag-type gifts. [SEP] These are so adorable!  Perfect for gifting or storing like-items for yourself.  These are well constructed and come in lovely colours.  Cannot recommend highly enough!!!  Your gift will stand out in these! [SEP] Classy packaging/bags.  I use these for my VIP/Return clients.  They are very well made and look great.  Love these!  Thank you! [SEP] These were nice and fairly sturdy. You could easily put something like a glass candle in there and not have to worry about it tearing. The glitter (other than on the tags) stayed nicely on the bags and didn't contaminate everything - my husband hates glitter lol.  (Note -the glitter DOES come off the tags but they were in a separate packet so could be avoided). [SEP] They’re fine [SEP] These gift bags are so much prettier in person. They are shiny, durable, and really make for a great presentation. They hold a fair amount of items without the handles pulling loose a d the bag material is nice and thick. The included gift tags help you personalize each bag for the occasion, so they are perfect! For value alone, this earns my highest recommendation. [SEP] My favorite bags for my candles!!! [SEP] Estas bolsas son hermosas y super durables. Las use para bolsas de regalo en el cumpleaños de mi sobrina y fueron un éxito. Les pusimos varias cosas entre juguetes, dulces y hasta una camisa con el motivo de la fiesta y no tuvimos ningún problema. El material tiene buen grosor. Y se sienten resistentes.

Innovative Floor Cleaning Sheet for All Situation Rinse-Free Household Cleaning Tools for Wall Tiles (30 Sheets (1 Pack)),[],[],,3.4,27,568,"[[VIDEOID:52a084fa7223ef32e368a0d7b392c1c7]] These really aren't too shabby. The cleaning sheets are as expected--I read through the product description before ordering.  I think I have used something similar in the past as it felt rather intuitive to use. Just add a sheet to water, it instantly dissolves. I think 1 sheet per gallon, give or take. Can be stuffed into a cleaning bottle for a spray solution, or can be added to a bucket. Smells nice, works well. Small pressure zip plastic packaging. Little footprint. Really no waste.<br /><br />I have used it primarily on counter tops and tubs. While it mentions floors and walls, I just use it as a basic cleaner--seems gentle enough. My rag picks up a lot of dirt, so I know it is effective. Current price of $5 for 30 sheets makes this a budget friendly option, especially if looking for something that doesn't take up much space, or plan to use it in a spray bottle. Of course, there are liquid concentrates that would offer same. But hey, I thought it worth pointing out.<br /><br />I really think it is an ok product!<br /><br />Lack of directions is a concern, though. I dont mind information in another language other than English. If I can't figure it out, then using a translator app, I pass my phone over it.  Odd thing is, there aren't any instructions. The most info you get on this product is what you see here on the product page. There is no workable information printed on the package. So I dont down rate because of the info not being in English, I down rate because there simply is no info! I will include a picture of the translated text. But even so, I think nearly anyone could/should be able to figure this product out.<br />""Water-Soluble Cleaning Sheet: Concentrated cleaning sheet will quickly dissolves upon contact with water and is immediately ready for your cleanup job""<br /><br />I DO  like these cleaning sheets. I clean homes for a living, and while I dont always need my own cleaners, I do keep a few in my tool kit. Having the option of mixing something up on the go, and having no added weight or mess to carry around is highly appealing.  I would even tear off half a sheet and add it directly to a toilet. It does dissolve instantly, easily, and smells good and fresh. Not too strong. No need to rinse.<br /><br />lovely product, overall. 4 stars [SEP] The product page tells me you mix a sheet with water, but I’m not sure how much because the instructions were in Chinese. Since they use metric, I assume it’s a number of liters, maybe 2-4. I would have liked to have known the ingredients as well, which I thought was required to be listed in English to be sold in the States. Kind of hard to review this one, honestly. It worked fine, and in theory, it’s more eco friendly because you have less packing materials and fewer emissions to ship something lightweight. [SEP] These cleaning sheets don't come with instructions re: how much water to use. I used half a sheet and a bucket and gradually added as I needed.  The sheet dissolved easily and the detergent worked well.  I like that it is so easy to store and such a space saver, thus eco-friendly.  I wasn't sure if it would work as well as regular cleanser but it was effective and did not give off the toxic fumes/scent. [SEP] This product is to be dissolved in water for cleaning, but there are no instructions in English, so I have no idea whether to dissolve it in 2 cups of water or 5 gallons, and I don’t know if I need to use rubber gloves when using this product or if it’s safe for skin. So this product, without instructions in English, is useless to me. [SEP] Disappointing cleaning sheets. It says good for floors, but it's more for countertops and tables. These sheets feel strange and doesn't do much in terms of cleaning. Pass on this and stick to what you know.<br /><br />Katiebabs [SEP] These little sheets dissolve completely, almost immediately, in water. They are highly concentrated and work GREAT. They smell nice too. Not overpowering, but fresh and clean. It's a unique product and I am really happy I tried them! They are easy to cut/tear in half for smaller jobs too. These are compact and space saving, not to mention LIGHTWEIGHT. They are excellent for throwing into a bag and not worrying about spilling in a vehicle, ect. Good for more than just floors! Weird, I know, but I used them to clean my duck's eggs and they would fabulously! ha ha<br />These would be perfect for camping, RVs, or cleaning services that provide their own cleaning supplies.<br />I would use these again and definitely would recommend them to people I know! [SEP] Very simple and easy to do. Dissolves  quickly for a fast acting cleaning job. [SEP] I like the convenience of these Floor Cleaning Sheets: put sheets into a bucket of water, go get my mop and mop heads and when I come back a few minutes later, the sheet has dissolved. While wearing a pair of gloves, I swished the solution around to get a good mixture.<br /><br />The sheets - dissolved in water - cleans our floor decently. I could not get the more stubborn stains at the bottom of the baseboards cleaned with the mop, so I hand-scrubbed the stains away using another product.<br />Once cleaned and dry, the floor has a mild, pleasant scent. I saw minimal residue on the floor once I was done cleaning and the floor got dry.<br /><br />These 30 sheets take up very little space in our cabinet.<br /><br />Lastly, the product package did not have instructions that I could understand to tell me how much water I should use with one cleaning sheet. [SEP] This is absolutely wonderful, no more bottle cleaning solution, just one sheet and<br />do the job.  Thumbs up",3,True
"HOUSTASK Painless Bug Bite Suction Tool,Poison Remover - Bug Bites and Bee/Wasp Stings, Natural Insect Bite Relief",[],[],,2.9,30,1177,"I wish this product  was available years ago. This is the most amazing product for mosquito bites. I’m the one that’s bit  in my family I’m always getting bit and scratch like crazy. If you use this right away you too will be  amazed that it worked so well. The itching will be gone. There was still swelling but it did not itch. It’s so simple to use. I actually have the original namebrand one and I prefer this one better because the finger loops make it easier to use. I cannot say enough positive things about this product! The price is excellent , especially since you get three of them. I keep one on my purse and one in the car and another in the first aid kit. This is one purchase you will not regret!! [SEP] I'd seen this product under a boutique brand and wanted to try it for a while. My kids are allergic to the mosquitoes in Texas and get these huge welts from bug bites. I liked that this one came in a set of three and was super affordable. I'm just not sure who needs 3 of these devices, but I have one in the car and one at home, and I gave the spare to my friend. I got the opportunity to use it Independence Day weekend and it really does work. Its a little uncomfortable for the user but I explained to my kids that the welts would hurt more! It works perfectly to remove the venom from the mosquito. [SEP] HOUSTASK Painless Bug Bite Suction Tool,Poison Remover - Bug Bites and Bee/Wasp Stings, Natural Insect Bite Relief<br /><br />is a decent pack sense it comes with 3 in there... however the suction is not as strong as what I'm use to and so the itching continues<br /><br />however they are not the best bug suction tool. a better one is The Bug Bite Thing, which works much better than this [SEP] This has not been tested on any stings and I hope it doesn't have to be, but my daughter and one of the grandkids each had a mosquito bite so we tried it on them. It seemed to help and helped quickly. [SEP] I was intrigued by this product. I get very bad reactions to mosquito bites (I swell so badly & get cellulitis) so I wondered if this would work. Of course I'd rather not get bit by any kind of insect so I hope I never have to use this. I did try it out on random areas to test out the suction. I guess it's decent. The suction was stronger on areas of looser and not taut skin. The pieces can come apart easily if you're not careful but it's easy to put back together. I will update if I ever get bit by anything so see if this product helps. [SEP] This was not a very good suction tool. I firmly put it over the bite and then pulled the little piece upwards and it’s a very weak suction. Barely feel anything and didn’t do much to my bites. [SEP] Idk if mine are defective or what but they have little to no suction. I have used other brands before and these just don't work :( [SEP] I bought one of these in the brand name version a while back. I was pleased with how it worked and wanted another one to keep in my first aid kit and give my teen for her purse.<br /><br />The device is extremely similar to the brand name. It works in the same manner as well. I wouldn’t say it’s exactly the same though. The construction seems to be lacking but just by a bit. If I hadn’t used the name brand one then I probably wouldn’t know.<br /><br />I have had good success relieving the itch in both old and new bug bites. Depending on the bite it may need to be done again for continued relief. While other bites can be a one and done treatment. The younger children just take some practice with it. It does have a light pressure but it’s not painful.  I also liked that this one comes with multiple devices versus just the one. It helps to have them stationed in different bathrooms and first aid kits.

"Replacement Toothbrush Heads Compatible with Philips Sonicare, 10 Pack Electric Toothbrush Heads C2 for 2 Series Plaque Control ProtectiveClean 4100 5100 6100 Handles,with Hygienic Caps HX9024",[],[],,4.2,66,767,"These work well for me.  They are the right softness and I have no complaints.  The only thing is that I need glasses to see, my current toothpaste is green, the same color as the brush, and it is hard for me to see how much I have on the bristles.  LOL  My next tube of toothpaste will be a different color.<br /><br />Anyway,  these do work well for me and I am happy to have them. [SEP] These replacement brush heads work very well with my Sonicare toothbrush. They fit perfectly. The bristles are medium firm, and last me about six weeks before I can start to feel they aren't cleaning my teeth as well as I'd like. At this price I don't worry about replacing them as soon as that happens--an excellent value. [SEP] These work just like the name brand ones from Sonic. They are just a tad bigger. I have noticed they pull off the brush sometimes when I take the cover off as it fits snuggly. Otherwise they are the same. [SEP] These are great replacement toothbrush heads and fits my Phillips Sonicare model HX682P. Cleans well and is durable. Better priced than the actual Phillips brand replacement heads. [SEP] This seems like a credible replacement for sonic toothbrushes. However, the cavity that accepts the metal extension is smaller than expected. To be fair, though, it was not tested with a Philips brand sonic toothbrush; the host brush is a different brand sonic toothbrush.  So, it is possible that it's fully compatible with the Philips brand.  (Although, I've attached other 'compatible' sonic toothbrush heads with success.)<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the toothbrush heads. I included pictures of the product attached to a sonic toothbrush. You can see that it cannot fully attach, leaving a gap.  Also want to note that it took considerable effort to 'force' the brush head onto the metal spindle. When powered, the brush did appear to function as expected.<br />Overall, the brushes appear to be identical to my original sonice toothbrush head. I couldn't measure the diameter of the receptacle. However, from attempts to attach it, the hole was obviously too small.<br />Since, I cannot be fully certain of the compatibility with the specified Philips sonic toothbrushes, owning a different brand, I will rate this product based upon the apparent quality of materials and manufacture. As such, it's a very credible product, and will receive a 4.5 star rating. [SEP] Both my husband and I have a Sonicare Flex Care toothbrush and since the OME replacement heads are pricey,  I was looking for a cheaper alternative and found them. The fit is perfect and after using them several days, we both feel these are as good if not better than the original heads that came with our toothbrushes.  You might even be able to buy some beef for dinner with the savings. [SEP] I always try to make my Sonicare brush heads last as long as possible because they cost so much, but the price of this multipack makes it so reasonable to change them that I'll probably do it twice as often now.<br /><br />Most importantly, the head seats securely on my Sonicare handle and the brush operates properly with it on. And the little protective caps for the heads actually click on more securely than the ""real"" ones do.<br /><br />The bristles are slightly stiffer and that does matter to me for gum protection, but I can just lighten up the pressure a bit and the end result is about the same. I'm still on the first head, but after a few weeks none of its bristles have loosened or fallen out as seems to be common with inexpensive brush heads.<br /><br />Overall, a good value for the price. However, if your gums are sensitive, perhaps consider looking for heads with softer bristles. [SEP] If you have a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush, you know the Philips replacement heads are really expensive. These heads are a fraction of the cost of the Philips heads. Are they as good? No, but they're good enough. These have medium soft bristles -- maybe slightly stiffer than the Philips heads, but softer than other replacement heads I've tried. The size is a close match for the Philips heads, again an improvement compared to other replacement heads that are a lot bigger. These fit my toothbrush securely, and each head has a plastic cover.<br /><br />Overall, while these aren't as good as the Philips replacement heads, given the significant cost savings, I can't really find much to complain about. [SEP] GreT quality and value [SEP] If you're reading this, then you know that Philips uses the razor model for their toothbrushes: Sell the body for a decent price, then charge like crazy for the replacement heads.<br /><br />I've been around this block a few times, and I've tried other non-Philips replacement heads before--usually to great disappointment. But I like to save money, so I keep trying.<br /><br />These brush heads are far better than some I've tried. I mean, at least they are attempting to create a brush head that looks like the real thing. The brush head is about the same size as the genuine article (see photos). And it connects stably to the toothbrush itself.<br /><br />In terms of feel, these feel a bit less soft than the genuine replacement brushes, but the difference isn't dramatic.<br /><br />One key difference between these heads and genuine Philips is that Philips includes a metal ring at the base of the head. These don't (and most cheap heads don't--not sure if that's for price or patent reasons).<br /><br />What I like a lot about these is that each comes with its own plastic brush cover, suitable for travel.<br /><br />In the end, these are OK for the price. They aren't perfect replacements, but certainly good enough and far cheaper.",3,True

I used one pair to stain my stairs. I used one pair when washing my pots and pans with pure hot water.. no heat on my hands. One pair when cleaning the bathroom. They are great multi use gloves. Its also great to wear when spray painting . I usually end up with paint all over my fingers and its hard to remove so smart to wear these. [SEP] These gloves are fabulous. I recently had to use them when I needed to clean out an old trailer, and they were great from everything to moving to cleaning. They are built well and are very strong. Even in the worst of conditions they didn’t show signs of deterioration. I would highly recommend! [SEP] Great heavy duty gloves!  These are really well constructed gloves and they fit my hand perfectly. They are very comfortable on the inside as they are cotton lined. They will hold up to some pretty heavy workload and scrubbing. I Felt that for a pack of four this was an excellent value for the quality. [SEP] These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] The thing I notice with a good protective glove, is whether they feel good on the hand and fit well. I find that some gloves may be strong and long lasting, but if they don't cover the hand correctly they pull and stretch against the movement of your hand as you work and that is tiring, and causes my hand to get tired and sore. These gloves are all the same size and fit but different colors. The fit is loose on me, I would normally wear a Medium, but these are Large. The sleeve come to mid forearm. The back of the hand and wrist are baggy but across the palm, when I open my hand there is a tight pull across the palm from the small finger to the thumb. This is tiring. I would be nice if the entire glove, including the inner palm size fit better.  The material seems good, soft.  The tips of the fingers are roomy also for big fingers. [SEP] They are a good quality product…  Great for gardening, dishwashing, and cleaning. We have been using another brand of reusable gloves to clean for years and years… they were a staple until I discovered this. We like having gloves to protect our hands from the variety of harsh chemicals we use to clean… especially when we clean our toilets or drains.  I wasn't sure initially if these were more the latex like gloves that my mother introduced me to years ago for dishes or if they were more a thicker, industrial type. This is more like the light house cleaning type. [SEP] These are so oddly soft, I really like em! Great deal for a 4 pack! [SEP] The lined gloves are very comfortable but the unlined ones are a bit thin. When wearing the unlined gloves, they get kind of stuck on your hands. [SEP] I liked them the first time so I ordered them the second time for my mother in law. Unfortunately they sent the wrong size so I took off a point. I like the flocked ones best. Your hands don't sweat as much and they are easier to put on and take off. They are a good quality glove for the price and will out live the 99 cent specials. [SEP] These gloves in a medium fit me as expected. I am an average-sized woman (5’ 4 ½”) with average-sized hands. The large fit is a bit loose for me, although wearable for jobs that don’t require manual dexterity, and it will be snug on my husband. These do not have any flocking; they’re not lined at all. I’m going to use these for crafting when I’m doing glass etching, dyeing, etc., where I need to protect my hands. I was looking for utilitarian gloves for tasks like this where I really need to protect my hands, wrists, and forearms. These have nice long sleeves, so they will protect more of my clothing and skin. Very pleased with these gloves.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

Thanks [SEP] I really disliked that there were zero instructions in English, and that there is no ingredient list either. Everything is in Korean on the box…lucky for you, I can read Korean!  It basically says mix it with 400ml of hot water with one tablet. So if you are cleaning a large water bottle you will likely need 2-3 tablets to clean just one bottle.<br />Unfortunately, I couldn’t really tell if this stuff was doing anything at all because it only bubbles for a few seconds while the tablet quickly dissolves. Then once everything is dissolved, it becomes a slippery liquid that smells really weird. I cleaned 4 water bottles with it. One plastic Tritan one, and 3 from Takeya that had a stainless steel interior. None of them looked super clean or special afterwards. Maybe my bottles weren’t dirty enough since I only use water, no tea or coffee in these bottles. Basically, it was as if I just cleaned it with regular soap and water. It did get my water bottles clean but I had to rinse and wash again because of the weird smell I mentioned earlier. They are travel friendly as they are individually packaged which is really convenient if you travel a lot. [SEP] The order of the cleaning tablets come in two boxes. Each box have 14 tablets, all invidually sealed and packaged. There are a pair of tablet packing attached which you can break off to use. In total you get 28 cleaning tablets with the order.<br /><br />I used the tablets on a old coffee mug that had coffee stain that were not washing away with regular washing. I put the tablet in with water and watched the table work its magic. I let it sit for a good hour. The tablet sizzles as it dissolves and I let the mug just sit in its liquid solution.<br /><br />I would say it removed about 85% of the existing stain. The stain around the ring was prevalent. They're thin markings but they still remained along the texture of the mug's insides. [SEP] We guessed on how to use these.  We used one tablet in my son's giant water bottle, and put about 16 oz of water.  It fizzed and the water bottle smelled clean and fresh after soaking overnight.  Box instructions are not in English. [SEP] I was skeptical at first.<br />but when I tried out, the results spoke for itself.<br /><br />the tumbler in the picture is over 10 years old and it has pretty tough coffee stain.<br />the cleaning tablet brought it back to its original color. [SEP] This is one of those products that has definitely made it to my shopping list. I was skeptical at first but this product has shown and proves itself. No residue was left behind on my water bottles and coffee cups.  It doesn't produce too many suds, so cleaning is quick. I enjoy the no fragrance option, as well.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] I tried using these tablets on several different occasions but I never had a good result. The tablets usually leave white marks that need extra rinsing later which defeats the purpose of using the tablets at the first place. I tried washing my kids cups as suggested and that was a fail but it further and tried cleaning ice machine which was another “no result” situation.

It is definitely funky using toothpaste that is black but you get used to it. It tastes pretty good and cleanse your teeth very well. I would recommend mixing it up with regular toothpaste though because it can strip your teeth because of the charcoal. It does have some bad breath eliminating features which I like and it can help whiten your teeth, don't expect to have like bright white teeth because of this but it can neutralize some stains which is nice. I really like this one but I am not making this my own and only toothpaste but actually rotate it with another one I use. [SEP] I've had very good results using this toothpaste after a couple of weeks. It's very pleasant to use, with a nice aftertaste, and it leaves my teeth and gums feeling fresh and clean. I have noticed some whitening, as well. Three tubes for the current price of $18.99 is a decent deal. [SEP] I like the taste of this one. I like the clove and mint taste. And it really cleans your teeth well. [SEP] I liked the minty taste of this toothpaste (despite the name, it doesn't taste like charcoal at all) but the black color takes a bit of getting used to.<br /><br />When you spit out the toothpaste, it looks as if you're spitting out mud and if you're wearing something light colored it will stain. The second thing is that the packaging is deceptively larger than the actual product - once I opened the box, I was disappointed to find that each tube is small - no bigger than the size of a ""deluxe"" sample or travel-sized toothpaste. Good for TSA regulations but stingy if you're wanting to use it at home. So, while it leaves my breath smelling fresh, I'm not sure I'd buy it again, for aesthetic as well as quantity reasons. [SEP] Too soon to tell that it's whitening BUT I find that it's really great on killing the morning breath and great for use after meals especially LUNCH TIME at the office for those of you who do that sorta thing. [SEP] I've used toothpaste with activated charcoal.  I know what clove tastes like and have even used pure clove oil to help with a toothache, so the taste isn't unfamiliar to me.  But for whatever reason, the combination of the two in this toothpaste was the most awful thing I've ever tasted!  The only reason I can give it two stars rather than one is because the charcoal did what it was supposed to and scrubbed up my teeth.  Even if the foam did look like I'd been bobbing for apples in the local sewage treatment plant.  However, I can get the same kind of tooth cleaning from charcoal toothpastes which taste much, MUCH better. (Actually, I'll get a better tooth and mouth cleaning with a toothpaste I want to use for more than five seconds, especially when I don't want to gag when I brush my tongue.)  I'll donate the other two tubes I've got - maybe somebody else will enjoy them - but the rest of the first tube will be going in the trash, as much as it pains me to waste stuff.  Because thanks, but no thanks - yuck! [SEP] Love how it makes my teeth feels after each use. Does not stain my tongue [SEP] All but a few words on this packaging are written not only not in English, but also using characters rather than letters so there isn't any way to look up the words to translate. The only thing that an English speaking person can understand is that this is toothpaste and has charcoal in it. The tubes are a strange design, but they are safety sealed which is great. They do not contain fluoride so they are not the best toothpaste for protecting your teeth, but if you are okay with that, the flavor is good. The toothpaste seemed to have separated in transit, so I had to squish the tubes back and forth in an attempt to remix the product. Overall, I feel there are better options for toothpaste and would recommend purchasing a product that lets you know what exactly you are putting in your body. [SEP] I do it'll just like the black color but I think it makes my breath smell better [SEP] It's very expensive, smalll container for results it provides",3,True

Glass Nail Shiner - JORLAI 3PC Nano Nail Shiner Nail Files Polisher Glass Nail Buffers Professional Crystal Manicure Tools Kit for Natural Nails,[],[],,4.5,56,525,"I really don't see the big deal about these glass filers. They look neat, but they just quietly do their job. They come in a case to keep them from scratching other things or being scratched up.<br />While they are listed as buffers, they are more of a nail file.<br /><br />Overall, functional, nice, but just another nail tool. [SEP] This is a great set of glass files.  Super sharp and smooth to leave an outstanding finish on your nails.  Works very quickly and leaves such a smooth clean edge it is almost like you never even cut and filed them.  These also don't clog like traditional files do.  I know professional manicurist use glass files to produce  super results and these produce those same result.  Love that these can be washed off and no worries about rusting.  With proper care these should last a lifetime. [SEP] I have thrown away my typical 3 way buffers. This takes all those steps and turns them into one. Plus, you rinse it and it's good to go again, unlike the one time use a buffer gives me.<br />This also shapes my natural nails to a smooth snag free edge.<br />Only one side of this has 'grit' - but, the edges are rounded and super smooth so I can get close to the skin and cuticle without any issues, pains or nicks.<br />It's super smooth, but very effective. I wouldn't use this to shine often, use sparingly!, because it works so well.<br />Compact size, great cover, and perfect to carry in my bag. [SEP] I love the glass files for natural nails. I experience less breaking, splitting and pealing when I use a good nail file. It leaves a very clean soft edge. I'll update with the quality of nail growth. I am not using this to buff. All three files are the same texture, they are not arranged as file, buff polish. Each file has a textured side and a smooth side. I'm not sure I'd know how these can file and buff and polish, but they do file and shape well.  4 stars. [SEP] I have extremely thin and weak nails (thanks parents!) and using the files that come in nail kits or the file attached to my clippers is impossible.  Most files are so rough that they chew right through my nails.  Glass files are a godsend, they're gentle enough that I can shape my nails and get a clean edge, without taking off half the nail.  They're also pretty durable.  You can break them if you really try, but generally they're going to hold up during normal use.  I have mine sitting in my pen cup and have had no problems. [SEP] These work great for shining up my nails and getting rid of the ridges.  I can either wear clean shiny nails or polish them because the glassy new surface of the nail provides a great base for polish.  It takes seconds to smooth and shine each nail, and the file itself comes in its own individual case.  Perfect for your purse, pocket, desk drawer, glove box, wherever you find yourself needing a buffer/polisher/file.  I have used buffers in the past and they are multi-step and time consuming.  This is one easy step, it also works to smooth the edge of the nail like a traditional file, and its washable.  Its perfect for me! [SEP] These glass nail files (with very fine etching or embedded particles) are pretty amazing!  They make super quick work of shaping your nails and then you can use the same file to buff and polish the tops as well and they come out very polished and shiny -- look great and you can do each nail (shape and polish) in a hot second!<br /><br />They only have the file on one side and the end is also smooth for you to hold onto.<br /><br />They are washable and come in a nice container for storage.  Because they are so small, it is easy to take them in your pocket, purse, glove box, whatever -- they take up no space.<br /><br />They seem pretty robust so I expect them to last a long time -- much longer than a traditional nail file.<br /><br />The only tricky part is that you have to get used to using a file with no bend or give to it since these are a hard surface.  If you are used to an emery board, you will have to learn to follow the curve more explicitly since this file will not bend or follow contours for you. [SEP] Cute and portable. I keep it in the plastic container since this is glass and I’m sure can break easily, especially since the first set I got actually came shattered in the casing. They file my nails quickly and don’t leave them feeling sharp like normal filers do. I also like that all I have to do to “clear” it off is to rinse with water. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:f8563bd8c8f1dc01c9af918c2012ea6f]] Since the rise in popularity and affordability of acrylic nails, us gals who have strong natural nails have been ignored. I was super excited when I stumbled across these Glass Nail Shiners and couldn't wait to try them. I have a medical condition that causes ridges in my nails, but they are strong and grow quickly. The first pic is prior to doing anything to my nails besides washing my hands. The other three photos show the results after using the Glass Nail Shiner. It took a decent amount of time to achieve these results, but worth it.  I am guessing with regular maintenance, the time to achieve the desired shine will decrease.  The next day, the shine is still as brilliant. These do remove layers of your nail, so those with thin, weak nails, these may not be for you. But healthy strong nails that you don't want to have to keep up with polish...these are a MUST! I know I will keep one in my purse in the convenient storage case to do quick touch ups. Love these. Buy them and see for yourself! [SEP] Mom kept going through paper files. I gave her my glass nail file.  I got this set.  And really handy.  They work really well, and leave my nails smooth.  If I need to shorten, they do the job quickly.  I'm so glad I got these.",3,True
"Bath Bombs Easter Gift Set, Ribivaul XXXL Size 6.5oz ×3 Handmade Kids Bath Bombs with Natural Ingredients, Cloud Bath Bomb with Rich Bubbles and Rainbow Color, Great Gifts at Holiday and Birthday",[],[],,4.4,31,183,"[[VIDEOID:ad765ba71227745eaa9f743b3024fc37]] I had tried [[ASIN:B08KW73KL2 these]] bath bombs, which are the same as these but in a smaller size. Unfortunately, this large size performs slightly differently as I'll describe below.<br /><br />There are 3 super large individually wrapped bath bombs in this set. All are large clouds with a smiley face on the package covering.<br /><br />Each one is strongly fragrant when dry and lightly fragrant when in the bath. They also all have the same scent. The ingredients are sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, magnesium sulfate, water, cyclodextrin, PEG400, hydrogenated jojoba oil, hydrogenated grapeseed oil, butyrospermum parkii (shea butter) oil, natural essential oil, fragrance, and FDA approved colorants.<br /><br />These are very, very large and fun. They perform well, produce a lovely rainbow of suds, and dissolve in about 10-15 minutes. The fragrance is subtle in the bath. However, there is one difference in the results (read on).<br /><br />Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I use them in a foot bath. When I was done, the color did not adhere to my foot bath but it turned both my feet pink and  my drying towel. Note that the smaller bombs did not do this even though they are the same. Perhaps it is the extra profusion of color in such a large size. This is the only reason I rated this 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />The current cost of $ 19.99 for 3 bombs comes to a very expensive $6.66 per bomb. However, these are certainly way different from typical bath bombs. I like these very much but would have loved them if it did not color my feet and towels. Note that the color does wash off the towels in the laundry and in the shower for my feet. [SEP] These very large cloud shaped bath bombs are a lot of fun. Shape wise they remind me of the cloud character from Trolls--as noted by a 6 year-year old. These bombs are marketed for kids. You get 3 bombs in the box. That means each bomb is quite pricey. IMO I would prefer more bombs, smaller if necessary.<br />They have a lot of colour and fizz and lasted a long time in the tub. The only downside is the $$ as you won't be using these one a night every night. Cost is too high. [SEP] It’s giftable, super cute and the bathbombs are gorgeous and fun for lil ones bath time [SEP] These are some big, gorgeous bath bombs.  They're pretty expensive, but if you don't know about the rainbow it's an amazing surprise and in my opinion, it's worth it for a special occasion.  They're very giftable.  Super cute design, well packaged, mine came in great condition with no dents and with the middle completely hidden by the ""clouds.""  I'm going to buy a set for my nephew for Christmas. [SEP] I struggled with this review because at first I was very disappointed in this product because it didn’t really dissolve like I have seen other rainbow bombs. The 3rd picture i posted is about 2 minutes after putting it in the bath. But about 3 minutes after that (so about 5 minutes) it did finally start working. Guessing it was just so big it had to dissolve more of the white to get to the real colors.<br /><br />The other reason I dropped a star was I didn’t like the smell very much. It was just a little too strong, but my daughter loved it. [SEP] The colors are awesome! My kids think its the coolest bath bomb they’ve ever tried. Definitely gift able! Smells great! They are pretty big as well so definitely get your moneys worth!! [SEP] You get 3 huge clouds in the cardboard box—very sturdy by the way!<br />The colors are easily found and exposed for a quick rainbow presentation once wet! I suggest placing the cloud straight on top of the water and then lay flat over the water so your colors dont take too long to show .<br />I believe someone said the scent was too strong or not the best—honestly it smells just fine, like any bath bomb. The fragrance is almost like a floral/rosey scent. I believe most beauty products smell like that nowadays.<br />I only deduct 1 star because the amount of bath bombs u get and the price they are at right now is not the greatest in my opinion… again, FOR ME. But for you it might be good :) i say you try for yourself! These are super cute to add some fun to ur bath or for a childs calming, fun and interactive bath time!<br />Thank you to the seller!<br />These are my own thoughts/opinions. [SEP] Muy grandes me encanta que mi bebe puede bañarse y dura mucho saliendo los colores. Hace suavidad en el agua como locion y es muy olorosa. [SEP] These HUGE bath bombs completely THRILLED a pre-teen!  They are very large in size and take a few minutes to start releasing.  At first, we thought they were ""duds;"" but when they started to release, the result was ""magical"" to a pre-teen.  Her mother was worried about the ""cleanup"" since the bombs release very colorful trails.  The colors truly did not adhere to the tub.  There was a little residue left on our bather, and unfortunately it did transfer to her bath towel.  But. the color did come out in the wash. [SEP] This box comes with three huge rainbow cloud bath bombs. Each bath bomb is 6.5 ounces and has a cloud face that is smiling and winking--very cute. The minute a bath bomb is put in the bathtub, it begins to stream a beautiful rainbow of color and to fizz its way around the tub. The show lasted way longer than any other bath bombs I've ever had, and it was an absolute delight to watch. The color continued to stream until every last particle of the giant bath bomb cloud had dissolved. The scent is quite pleasant, but even if it had no scent whatsoever, the color display alone makes these bath bombs well worth the current listing price of $19.99. These bath bombs are most definitely giftable to anyone of any age or gender that likes to take baths--whoever receives them is in for a true treat.",3,True
"FREY Laundry Stain Remover Spray -Stain Remover for Clothes, 2 Ounce Travel Size Bottle (325 Sprays) (Sandalwood Cedarwood Fragrance)",[],[],,4.3,19,1575,"This product smells wonderful. Oddly, as you can see, the label claims it to be unscented, and the listing claims it to be scented. I believe it might be mislabeled, but it doesn't matter because this product is very good. You spritz it on to the stain and work it into the fabric. After letting it sit for a couple of minutes, run water through the fabric or blot with a wet cloth.<br />I found that with most stains I had to do that twice, but on the good side it's clear that this is safe for a lot of hand washables, as long as you are gentle and don't rub the stain too hard.<br /><br />I've had those big commercial brands of stain removers make things worse by fading the area that you spray them in. That was not the case with this product. It might not be as effective, but it's not going to damage your clothes. If you have something delicate and/or your clothes are a huge investment, invest in this product as well.<br />Another plus is that the 2 oz spray is good for travel.<br /><br />So, this might be a product that you need, or another one might be best for you. Hopefully this review has helped you to decide. [SEP] Like most stain removers, this one works best on ""fresh"" stains - for example, if you just spilled wine on your blouse five minutes ago. This remover worked but then, so does seltzer if you apply enough of it. When I tried it on an ""old"" stain (a pair of jeans that had a spot on it from grease), it didn't do anything. The small bottle is handy for travel, however, so it's good for when you're on the go. Overall it's good for mild stains that just happened and you don't have anything else on hand. For more stubborn stains, I'd use something else. [SEP] Nice travel version of stain remover. The bottle size is easy to carry. I like how it works. The smell is a little strong for me but pleasant and doesn’t linger after a wash. Removes stains from cloths well. Overall, I’m happy with it. [SEP] The thing about this brand is that its products smell A-MA-ZING! They work great, yes, I suppose, but the reason you want them for your laundry is definitely the scent. That's also why you'd want such a small bottle of their products -- to get that amazing scent in each product that you use.<br /><br />But these are unscented. So they work fine and remove stains if you spray them before washing, but for the life of me, I can't imagine why anyone would want such small bottles of laundry stain remover?? The small size makes them easy to misplace, hard to find a good spot for in the laundry room and not last long enough to get rid of more than a couple of small stains.<br /><br />Without the favorite scent of the laundry detergent, these stain remover sprays just don't seem worth the trouble of trying to live with such tiny bottles. Four stars because they do remove stains. But would need to be larger bottles and smell good to get five stars from this house.<br /><br />Maybe these would work for travel, but in that case, I'd think you'd prefer the readily available Tide pens. [SEP] I sprayed in on my mom's favorite throw rug she was going to throw out... nothing was removing a big beet juice stain. We left it overnight then washed the rug... no more stain! Did the same with large ketchup stain on my husband's favorite grinch Christmas sweater... no more stain! Seems the trick is leave it overnight. Eats the stain, doesn't damage the fabric. My only complaint is not being able to buy  it in bigger bottles! [SEP] After dinner, I noticed that I'd gotten a little splotch of oil from oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes on my shirt. I sprayed it with the white bottle as per instructions and ran it through the washing machine.<br />When I took the shirt out of the washer, it looked as though the stain was gone. Great!<br />But when I took it out of the dryer, I could see that it was still there. Granted, it was lighter, but the stain was still there and now possibly heat set. Not great.<br /><br />Spray 'n Wash has removed even set-in stains like this, but I really liked the idea of this product's natural ingredients so I wanted to try it. I'm disappointed that it did not work. Perhaps it is more effective on non-oil stains.<br /><br />Additionally, the bottles I ordered were supposed to be sandalwood and cedar. The bottles I received were both marked ""Unscented,"" even though a scent was already evident because one of the bottles had a loose top causing it to leak in the packaging. I can guess which scent is which, but it made me think that greater quality control might be a good idea. [SEP] These FREY Laundry Stain Remover Spray bottles are small, but they get the job done well and are convenient to pack in a car or purse so that you have a stain remover for when you are on the go. I've used it on several small stains so far and found it to work rather well. There is still a minor outline of one of the stains, but I'm sure it'll disappear in the next wash. Although the bottle seems small, it does contain 325 sprays each so it will last you. [SEP] These stain removers are definitely impressively effective. I cook a lot and I don't always wear an apron, so I end up with grease or sauce splatters sometimes. If I happen to be wearing a shirt that I like, that's not ideal, so I was excited to try these out. The scents are nice, and a little bit goes a long way to breaking up stains prior to throwing these in the wash. The scents don't seem to matter, however, since you'll just wash the clothes after. I guess you could keep one in the office or wherever else to try and spot treat stains on the go. I haven't tried that yet.<br /><br />In the end, for around $20, these aren't the cheapest, but they work well, so they're easy to recommend.<br /><br />***I write reviews as a hobby because I love trying out electronics, clothing, household products, kitchen devices, and more. My hope is that my review will guide you to make a more informed choice about whether or not to make a purchase. If this review helped you in your decision-making today, please let me know with a helpful vote. Have a great day!*** [SEP] I absolutely love Frey products and this stain remover is no different!

"Nature’s Edge Q-Gel 100 Dietary Supplement, 60 softgels",[],[],,4.4,22,296,"CoQ10 is an essential supplement for overall health. It is used in all of our cells. It's especially useful for neurological and cardiac function. It's important that the CoQ10 you choose is water soluble so your body can fully utilize it. This one is 100% water soluble. This supplement also includes vitamin E. This is a high quality supplement that you should consider adding to your daily diet. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] Great coq10. It is a higher concentration than most which is super nice. No more taking multiple pills for just one supplement. [SEP] Co-Enzyme Q10 is an anti-aging nutrient I have taken for many years. It has been shown to help with heart health issues and other health concerns.<br /><br />This formula contains co-enzyme Q10 paired with lecithin, which has been shown to help its absorption and utilization by the body. As such, it is a better way to get co-enzyme Q10, which can be difficult for the body to absorb and utilize. Note that this is not the ubiquinol form of Q10, which is ultimately the best-absorbed, but which is also very expensive.<br /><br />So far, I have been very satisfied with this brand. I recommend this if you want a good form of Q10. [SEP] I had needed more CQ10 and saw this product. It was packaged nicely so I thought I’d give it a try.  When I received it and checked out the ingredients. The Coenzyme Q10 is the Ubidecarenone form which has to be broken down in the body to the Ubiquinol (CQ10). This is a problem for older people because the ability to break it down is declines with age. Fortunately I am not old enough that it’s a problem. The Vitamin E is d-alpha tocopheryl acetate which is okay but I’d rather have just simple d-alpha tocopheryl.  I was disappointed to find listed in the “Other Ingredients” section on the label is polysorbate 80. This is chemical is used to help disperse the ingredients, keep the gel consistency and etc. But according to it’s own MSDS it May cause adverse reproductive effects, cancer and may affect our genetic material (mutagenic).<br />After seeing the polysorbate 80 in it I did not think I should take it.<br />Others may not mind these types of ingredients but I want to be vigilant in keeping myself healthy which includes watching what I put in my body. I did not mind the rest of the ingredients. The softgels swallowed easy enough even though they are larger than other supplements I take. And the manufacturer tried to think of a good mix of ingredients to help everything absorb better.<br />I would not recommend this product for everyone only really healthy individuals and I would not recommend taking it everyday. I would, however, instead encourage people to find a more natural, less harmful formula. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:c078fdb98072ff27f5108c63346b3beb]] You get a nice dose of CoQ10 as well as Vitamin E in these easy to swallow softgels. [SEP] Wow, these are big! (see the pic), but they seem to go down pretty good. I haven't been taking them with other pills, I take them by themself so I don't worry about choking, but haven't been having any problems. I can definitely tell if I don't take coQ10 and it's even one of those few supplements the doctor tells me I should take, so I try really hard to never miss it. I like this. [SEP] I’ve used Nature’s Edge products for the past year and have been impressed: good products, good price, and I feel good after using this for several months.<br /><br />Their version of coenzyme Q 10 is known as Q-Gel. This is ubiquione, also known as ubidecarenone. These are different names for the same substance: CoQ10.<br /><br />Co-Q10 is made naturally in the body. We also get it from some of the foods we eat. It’s an important element in the creation of cellular energy. Since your heart (and your kidneys, liver, brain, etc.) is a hard working organ requiring a lot of that cellular energy, you’ll find a lot of Co-Q10 in heart tissue.<br /><br />Age has a lot to do with the type of Co-Q10 supplement you should consider. There are two forms of Co-Q10: Ubiquinone (most popular version) and Ubiquinol. Ubiquinone is the standard, oxidized form of Co-Q10. Prior to age 30, your body can generally absorb and convert ubiquinone to ubiquinol without any problem. However, as we age, our body becomes less efficient at making this conversion.<br /><br />Since this is Ubiquione, it’s generally going to be a better option for those under the age of 30. The difference with Nature’s Edge is that their QGel has been studied to prove a 3x higher absorption rate. This is good news for those OVER 30 and want to use the product.<br /><br />Of course, as with any supplement, always check with your doctor for their recommendation and to make sure it won't conflict with any medications you might be on. [SEP] I like the heart and blood pressure benefits of QGel but I found with this brand that my joints also get a little bit of relief.  I don't know if that is normal but I like it.<br /><br />Now, it must be said, these are big gel capsules but they are easier to swallow than I thought possible.  I take it by itself with a glass of water and take my time.  I like this formulation and it seems to help a lot of issues. [SEP] Pure COQ10,doctor advised a water soluble product.  I am experiencing high energy with taking this product. Highly recommend this COQ10. [SEP] This Coenzyme Q10 is the real thing! Feel the difference after a few days! Love it,",3,True

It's great for your hair, skin, nails, gut, immune system, and more! This powder is super easy to incorporate into your diet. My favorite way to take it is to blend it into my morning protein smoothie. It virtually disappears and you'd have no idea it was even there. You can also add it to both hot and cold drinks, sprinkle it on your yogurt, add it to soup, bake with it, etc... It's super easy to sneak into almost anything. This powder is nice and fine and seems to be nice quality. This is a little more expensive than other varieties I've seen though. Usually you can get a 1lb tub of collagen powder for about the same price as this and this is only 10 ounces, so it's not the best deal, but it does seem to be good quality. [SEP] I'm a longtime user of collagen powders, so I've tried many different brands and products.  This is the type of unflavored collagen is my preference, as it's the most versatile.  This has basically no flavor, dissolves easily in hot and cold liquids, and gets the job done.  I mostly mix this in smoothies, where it makes no taste of texture difference.  I'm also a fan of adding collagen to soups and stews to boost the nutritional content.  My only reservation with this is the current price, which is a little higher than other comparable products. [SEP] This is a very competent collagen peptide powder. It delivers 9 grams of hydrolyzed collagen peptides per 10 gram serving. It has only 35 calories, No Fats, No Carbohydrates, No Sugars, No other ingredients other than Collagen Hydroglyzed (Beef) Powder. So, this is as clean as you get.<br />I added it to a morning smoothie, that had strawberries as the dominant flavor note. One scoop of this powder added no discernible taste to the drink. Fantastic. I did the finger taste taste, and any flavor is barely perceptible.<br />I am impressed. I am considering adding this powder to some tapioca pudding I'm making as dessert, to kick up the health/protein aspect.<br />The label contains a number of certifications and badges. The one that if of most critical to me is cGMP. Certified Good Manufacturing Practices denotes attention to the purity and integrity of the ingredients and manufacturing processes. Checking off this box is an import plus for me.  At the current price of $23, it's reasonably priced.<br />Good certification/badge, very good 'non-flavoring', excellent hydrolyzed collagen peptides powder, decent price leads to a solid 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] Unflavored. no clump, great addition to my morning coffee. [SEP] This is a high quality product.  It blends well with coffee and has no aftertaste.  It works well when added to other foods.

"Organifi: Move Organic Joint Support - 60 Softgels - Supports Overall Joint Health and Immunity - with Superfoods Arctic Pine Bark, Astaxanthin, Holy Basil and Turmeric - No Gluten, Soy or Dairy",[],[],,4.6,51,306,"If arthritis runs in your family, you definitely want to get a jump on it before your joints start deteriorating. This supplement is excellent for joint support. It contains high-potency anti-inflammatory ingredients. You won't feel a difference immediately, so give it time to work. I highly recommend this supplement.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] Unless you are just loaded with money and don't mind spending $79.98 for a MONTH'S SUPPLY of this supplement, I'd find these components elsewhere for a lot cheaper.  Turmeric capsules are cheap and easy to find, Astaxanthin and Holly Basil Leaf supplements are cheap and easy to find, and probably Artic Pine too. No way would I buy this especially for the turmeric content.  I have bags of turmeric powder (can be found at a regular grocery store) and about a billion capsules of turmeric supplement and I know it's cheap to buy.  I also have a lot of holly basil and astaxanthin to take anytime I need it.  I'm sure the contents and bioavailability of these MOVE capsules are very good, and they're easy to swallow, but my cheapness just won't let me part with that much money for something I can get for less than half and more of it. [SEP] It is good , that it is not me, who should take these pills - they are huge - even my husband with bigger mouth and trachea felt it didn't go through, but stuck in his throat. May be manufacturer will consider making smaller pills? Better to swallow two smaller pills one by one, than one huge?<br />The list of the ingredients is promising and should help with problematic joints. [SEP] This is a powerful formula for joint pain or other inflammatory problems. It contains a variety of ingredients that have been shown to positively impact joint health.<br /><br />I like to take certain supplements to preventatively address joint issues, since at age 41, I work out and lift weights almost daily, and run anywhere from 70-100 miles a month in warmer weather. So far, I have avoided any joint issues, thanks in part to supplements like glucosamine sulfate, MSM, and some of the ones in this formula.<br /><br />I like that it contains a form of turmeric that is readily absorbed and utilized. If you look up the research behind Turmipure gold, you'll see that it is absorbed a lot better compared to regular turmeric extract that is 95% Curcumin. I am guessing this is because it is complexed with lecithin, which should also help the other ingredients absorb better.<br /><br />The inclusion of astaxanthin is good as well, and I take it regularly as an overall anti-aging supplement, as well as for skin health.<br /><br />The main drawback I see is the price. It is pretty high, even if you were to buy the various ingredients separately. [SEP] This is a Highly Premium Supplement, that’s made with All ingredients being Organic and research-backed. The bottle says it’s Nature’s Most Effective Superfoods for Joint Health and I absolutely agree. All of the other ingredients are healthy too, even the Capsules are healthy.<br />  The only warning is that it has some Tilapia in it; Fish. The bottle is even made of brown glass for the best storage possible. It’s also made in San Diego, California so, that means that, I believe, it’s made under the most stringent Safety Rules on the planet. I would Definitely recommend this product. Only time will tell with this one but, I’ve been using all of these ingredients, in different supplements, for years and I know they help me. Yeah!<br />  Enjoy good Joint health! [SEP] I came off a prescription anti-inflammatory into these and there wasn’t any pain during the first few days. It’s only been a few weeks but these really seem to work as said. [SEP] I love this supplement because it literally only has like 4 ingredients.. all that help joint and arthritis pain.  i feel like my inflammation is way lower while taking this!  I also love that the ingredient quality of the capsules is good.  there are no harful stearates for which i am grateful",3,True

"Miracleplus Professional OLED Display Water Flosser for Teeth, Cordless Dental Oral Irrigator for Travel &Home, IPX7 Waterproof Rechargeable Water Pick with 5 Mode",[],[],,3.8,355,897,"I've never used a water flosser before but wanted to try one. So glad I did. This flosser has a good size reservoir for one cleaning. Has all the attachments you need for various purposes. Works great and happy with this particular product. It's also easy to charge and can be transportable. [SEP] I like this water flosser because is small and perfect for travel. So I have one for home and this one when we are out of town.<br />It has different settings that you can adjust the power.<br />The water reservoir in smaller than others that I have, but that’s the same reason why it’s more comfortable for travel. It does not need too much space on the bag. [SEP] Review for: Miracleplus Professional OLED Display Water Flosser for Teeth, Cordless Dental Oral Irrigator for Travel &Home<br /><br />I have been using a water pik type of water flosser for years and it has always been able to remove bits of food from the places that dental floss does not. When using it, I am also able to keep the sink area dry. Because of this previous experience, I have pretty high expectations for water a flosser. While this type of flosser is much more portable, it is also much less powerful. I have not seen it remove any food that the regular floss does not. Obviously the tank is much smaller but I don’t mind that too much because it is easy to refill. I do like the convenience of not having the cord.<br /><br />I have two issues with this flosser and the first is the water that drips from it during use. By the time I am finished, I have water all over the counter. The 2nd is the lack of power. I don’t feel that I am getting the gum area of my teeth really clean because the water does not have enough force. [SEP] Runs out of water fast..<br /> Cant mix moth wash on it [SEP] It,s a great flosser gets good in between the teeth, [SEP] I used this for a while, love it, the settings are a little rough, there is only one setting that doesn’t pound my gums and make them bleed, it just stopped working recently and I can’t figure out how to fix it. [SEP] This is the second similar type of portable water flosser I have obtained, for which I am giving my girlfriend as she has watched me with envy as I use it while traveling.<br /><br />These portable flossers are great.  They deliver a very powerful stream of water to the teeth and gum line which easily pushes away food particles on and in between teeth.  They are so powerful in fact that they rival the Waterpik units that have become a staple of bathroom hygiene for so many years.<br /><br />This flosser by Miracleplus deserves the professional moniker.  It is well constructed and (as I mentioned) quite powerful.  It's also very simple to use:  charge the flosser with the USB cable (power brick not included) and then fill the reservoir tank with water.<br /><br />This kit includes 5 different snap-in nozzles, one of which is a tongue scraper.  There are five different power modes to deliver water to your teeth, one of which is a nice massage burst and the other designed for softer delivery for sensitive teeth.<br /><br />The inclusion of a digital readout is a nice added touch.  It not only displays the currently selected power mode but also the remaining battery level.<br /><br />What I love about this and similar flossers is that you get about the same amount of water power delivered to your teeth in this portable unit as you do with the larger home ones.  At the same time, it's portable enough to simply throw this into your suitcase or an overnight bag.<br /><br />If you have never owned a portable flosser before I think you'll be really surprised how much water power these units deliver to your teeth.  It's certainly a quicker and more fun way to floss than using string between your fingers.<br /><br />This looks to be a very capable, well-constructed flosser that should stand up to a rigorous amount of use both in your suitcase and in your bathroom.  Don't think twice about purchasing. [SEP] I have been using the water flosser for almost a month. Now I can't live without it. Every time I used it, I wash a lot of stuff between my teeth. There are different modes. The low setting is gentle enough to not hurt your gums. The tank is big enough to clean all the teeth. The water flosser can be rechargeable. I brought this water flosser when I travel. It's lightweight and the size is perfect to store in carry-on luggage.<br />The battery lasts longer than I expect because I use it twice a day. Worth the price and not regret it. [SEP] so i went on a trip and forgot my waterpik. I'm a fanatic. I really liked mine to boot, so I looked for a cheap backup on Amazon to tide me over till I got back and WOW. I'm so glad I ignored all the reviews and gave this one a try. I actually like that the reservoir is smaller than my old one. I can waterpik my teeth to death (fanatic, remember?) and this helps me stop that. I can do my whole mouth efficiently with one or two piks full. So besides being smaller, more compact and lighter than my old one, this one charges with a NORMAL usbc charger. My old one had a special don't-lose-this-plug-or-you'll-never-charge-me-again one of a kind charger that I was always misplacing. Sure this one only has basically three levels of pressure and three weird pulse options, but the only setting I ever use is the softest normal setting so who cares? It was a great purchase. And for those complaining it worked once and never again - duh, charge it. it's dead. It lasts about a week on a charge. If it's not responding, let it sit an hour or so on the charger, it's just really dead. Tip - keep the charge port sealed with the silicone stopper attached to the unit. Don't be lazy. Keep the water out of the motor. That's just common sense. Treat it right and you will like this unit. [SEP] Worked fine for 2 1/2 months and then it just stopped working. I can't get it to run no matter what I do.  When it worked it worked well it took a little while to get used to holding it. I really liked it once I got used to maneuvering it. It's very enexpensive, so maybe I expected to much from it.",3,True

They work well. The gloves have granules in the palm and fingers that help to cause friction which leads to a better grip. All I know is that these gloves hold on to things like those pesky dishes much better than some others I've used in the past. These are latex free, waterproof, and go up a good distance on the arm to help keep you dry/clean and the water/dirt/etc. out. This pack is very good because the gloves come in different colors so you can use them in different rooms without confusing, say, the bathroom and kitchen gloves! I love these. [SEP] These are decent quality cleaning gloves that will fill all your basic household needs.  These gloves are of good durability for basic household tasks.  They are not heavy-duty, but they are well-constructed for tasks like doing dishes, and cleaning the kitchen and bathroom.  They are thick enough to protect your hands enough that you can use hot water for dishes or other cleaning.  Two different-colored pairs in a pack is great because you can easily designate one pair for kitchen and one for bathroom, and not worry about mixing up the two (or use one for toilet cleaning and one for sink and tub cleaning within the bathroom.)  These gloves are both useful and comfortable and I would not hesitate to buy again. [SEP] I think these latex-free gloves are every bit as good as name brand latex gloves. They are also prettier with the lace imprint going around the bottom of the gloves. I have worn regular latex gloves a lot, especially when making my hand made soaps but I will be wearing these from now on. I don't think I'm allergic to latex but I used to get some horrible zits after going to the dentist so maybe I am. These latex-free gloves feel flexible yet seem durable to last a good while.  You get 4 pairs in this pack. [SEP] These are good dish gloves! These aren't lined like my other pair. I like that when the water is really hot I don't really feel it through the gloves. The package has a few ideas on other ways to use these and I used a sharpie to write what I use for what so I don't confuse them. The large is a little too baggy for me so I would have gone for a medium. These are great gloves, I recommend them. [SEP] These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] Update - while the vinyl is still more durable and puncture resistant than latex, I'm going to have to ding this a solid 2 stars because of a couple of issues:  1) The PVC hardens after a few weeks, from exposure to grease or detergents, I don't know, but definitely not as supple.  2) The PVC is more slippery than latex.  Still, we have had more than a few latex gloved ruined from goof-off or other solvents which the PVC is somewhat immune to, so there's definitely some advantages.<br /><br />We used to use latex gloves for cleaning and dish washing, but they tend to be somewhat delicate, lasting only a week or 2, so we switched over to heavy nitrile gloves. These last far longer but the rubber is comparatively stiff and not nearly as comfortable as the latex. We also use ""true blues"" PVC gloves, but these are quite heavy vinyl so are really just for heavy cleaning tasks. When I first tried these on I was surprised as the feel was nearly identical to the latex gloves. Sizing is accurate. [SEP] UPDATE - the smell does not go away so I changed from 4 to 2 stars as it makes me think there is something bad in these gloves. A sickening chemical smell that doesn't go away after cleaning with 409.<br />These are for general cleaning and light gardening around the house. They slipped on easy and were easy to get off. They provided modest protection against hot water (ie. not sustained but brief contact with very hot water that you wouldn't have been able to stand without gloves on). There were four sets of glove - two white with pink tips and two solid purple. Each had some slight contour on the hands and fingers for better gripping objects. I was able to hold small objects while using them and clean with them. I used 409 spray, which eats thru daisy cups by the way, and these did fine soaking in them while cleaning some faucet. The 409 did leave a stain on the gloves, but would have on any gloves. It did not eat thru them so can use them again. These gloves come in a rip tear plastic pouch and say they have a shelf life of 3 years. They have a chemically smell to them which I hope dissipates over time. [SEP] These gloves are made of PVC so they won't trigger anyone with allergies to natural rubber/latex. they are very sturdy and should be able to fill a variety of roles.<br /><br />I use gloves like these working outdoors in yard, garden and orchard. I spray chemicals and, although I don't use products that are toxic, I just don't want the stuff on my hands anyway. These gloves are very good as they're a good thickness and I can see them fulfilling a variety of roles at home in the kitchen or outdoors, in janitorial for cleaning and even in some light assembly applications in manufacturing.<br /><br />I wouldn't use these for corrosives or toxic substances, but in their main roles around the house, they will do very well. I find them as comfortable as this type of thing will be and, yes, you're going to have sweat inside the gloves (that can be re-used by the way) but they're easier to get off than the latex ones. [SEP] I can only compare these to Playtex Living Gloves which I have used for the past 10 years. These gloves cost the same, but are thinner and do not have the comfortable flocked lining that PLG's have. I also feel like I have  better grip and grasp when using the PLG's vs this brand. For me, there are only negatives and no advantages (not even less expensive), so I'll be sticking with PLG's. I'll probably use these for repotting plants and some gardening or nasty jobs for when I do not want to ruin my preferred gloves! [SEP] The Pacific 4 Pack Household Glove have 2 sets of two kinds of gloves. The unlined gloves are for washing dishes and the palm and fingertip have little raised design to help you hang on a wet dishes, etc. They are made of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), are reusable and have a self life of 36 months. They are thick enough to protect your hands but not so thick that you have trouble being able to feel the item you are washing.  The gloves that are flocked are latex free, DEHP free, lead and cadmium free and designed for house cleaning . They also are reusable and the flocked lining makes the glove comfortable to wear ( but you should not use them around water where they can get wet inside).  The ones that I am reviewing are labeled large ( 12.6 inches in length ) and are easy to get into and out of but are about a half of inch too big in the fingertips.",3,True

I'm impressed that it comes in at about half the price of Benadryl brand, so if you prefer name brand, over the counter medications, you should definitely consider this. However, I found it was two and a half times the cost of the generic brand I usually use. Sadly, I'll finish this box, but I won't be buying it again.

I've been doing this since forever, and once I realized this wasn't a ""couple of days and you're cured"" kind of thing, I asked my doctor if I could use a generic in place of the brand name drug.  She explained that the FDA makes sure that the drugs are pretty much identical, and in the case of Benedryl, you don't have to be as exact as you need to be with some other drugs.<br /><br />So, I sleep better, snore less and have a slightly heavier wallet.  No downside that I can see! [SEP] I'm very happy with this selection, and I think this quantity and price is a good value.  I've found this med to look and work exactly like standard name brand Benadryl, but at a lower price.

They relieve my itchy nose and sneezing that I get during the night in the autumn from allergies.<br /><br />The only problem at all I had with these caplets was when I spilled a handful on the bathroom floor they are so small it is easy to lose them in the corners [SEP] Got these for my dog (as generic benadryl) on the advice of my vet but they don't seem to be having the desired effect.

"2021 White Noise Machine for Kids Adults, 32 Hi-Fi Soothiing Sounds Machine with Night Lights and Auto-Off Timer, Warm Light & 5 Colors Adjustable Sleeping Helper for Bedroom, Home, Office",[],[],,4.4,38,202,"[[VIDEOID:4783b505348a419e1d8bcbb2086e9d4c]] This sound machine comes with a total of 24 sounds. It is packaged with an A/C adapter, the unit itself, a cheat sheet circle, and a regular instruction pamphlet.<br /><br />Operation is simple as per my video. I just plugged it in and then pressed the light button for my choice of nightlight color. I also pressed the sound playing button to start playing the sounds. This button serves as the on/off button for the unit. The nightlight feature has seven lights that can be cycled through with two variations of white light. The timer feature goes from 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes or can be turned off to play continuously. There are three sound controls - nature/lullaby, white noise, and fan. There are 8 available sounds each for the white noise and fan and 16 nature sounds. I particularly like the nature sounds.<br /><br />The current price of $25.99  is what machines like this go for. Of course, in the days of smart home speakers such as Google Home, no such device is really needed as I can just ask my Google Home to play sounds or tell it goodnight to get a routine. Nevertheless, for those who want a sound machine for a baby room or just for themselves, this does work. Know that there will never be more than 24 sounds available and unless one loves all the sounds, only a few of them will ever be played.<br /><br />I rated this unit three stars for several reasons. First, I prefer a battery operated unit (correction to what I said in my video). I do not like the idea that I have to be tethered to a power supply to operate this and want to be able to take it with me anywhere. Second, the controls on top are very difficult to see (see photo). The printing needs to be a bright white so that it is visible to the operator. Third, the unit is not as sleek as some other units I tried previously--it's tall and squat. Nevertheless, this works as designed and it is a good machine, but this is not my top pick. [SEP] At first I thought mine was broken. I had read the instructions carefully, but couldn't get anything to turn on. It says click, but there's no buttons, just a touch monitor. I would press. Press and hold. Eventually, I got it with a tap. A very brief tap. The only time you need to press and hold is to turn the nightlight off.<br />When you press play, a little voice says ""music on"" before starting, and similar when you turn it off.<br /><br />There's a little ring when you plug it in to tell you it's working, and there is no on/off button because it has no battery. So you must plug it in. It is also a standard two prong outlet plug, and not a usb port which has become the popular power cable.<br /><br />There's no back button on the sounds, so you have to cycle through all of them to get to the one you want, though it's broken up between two buttons, the ""music"" icon and the ""fan"" icon, so there aren't as many you have to go through as with others.<br /><br />The nightlights changes into a variety of colors, first two being soft light and bright white before going to colors. This is really nice for reading in bed. [SEP] The sound machine aptly reflects the pictures and descriptions in the product details. There is a large assortment of sound choices, each of decent quality. The speaker is decent, although a bit lacking in the lower frequencies (bass sounds). The sound machine does operate as expected. While the icon based touch buttons are a bit small, they are rather easy to figure out (especially easy if you read the user guide, and view the round card insert that details the function of each button (see attached photo, close up of the round card).<br />A 3 second press of the 'sun' icon will activate the light feature. Successive taps of that same button will cycle through the various colors. A 3 second press of the button will turn off the lighting feature.  That's an example of how easy and simple the operation of this product.<br />Opposite the 'sun' icon are the three touch buttons to select the audio/sounds. There's 32 audio options available. You can adjust the sound level, however the lighting intensity cannot be adjusted.<br />The clock icon engages the timer options.<br />The operation of the sound machine is much common sense, and pretty straightforward.<br />An important note: this is not a rechargeable battery operated device. This could account for the better speaker (needing more power for this aspect). While I prefer cordless operation of this genre product, this was not a stated feature of the product. So, this does not negatively affect the rating.<br />On the other hand, a full AC adapter with long cord is included. Not a USB cable that requires a free USB port, or a USB power plug. This is a plus.<br />Another feature mentioned is the availability of a headphone jack. I find this a bit odd, but I guess if someone wants the sounds, without disturbing someone in the same room, headphones would be considerate. This scenario only makes sense if you're planning to use the sound machine for meditating or relaxing. I don't envision someone wearing headphones while planning to fall asleep.<br />This is a very credible sound machine with a rather bright night light feature. It basically satisfied expectations, based upon the descriptions and pictures in the product details. It earns a 4.25 - 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] Needlessly complicated to figure out. I have to keep the paper guide next to the noise machine for reference. Controls are tiny and faintly marked. [SEP] Don't like how it's not battery powered. Seems odd seeing that's the trend these days.<br /><br />Also has a proprietary wall plug. Plug is small so powerbrick/strip friendly at the ends.<br /><br />Buttons are flush and not tactile. Can get some miss presses.<br /><br />Some features require you to short press and hold<br /><br />No individualized buttons for specific sound. Have to cycle through genre of sounds.<br /><br />Has a great variety of sounds totaling 32 sounds<br /><br />No visual indicator for the sounds selection, volume loop around, must play by ear.<br /><br />I like how the speaker is facing upward and not on the bottom of the device<br /><br />Muted light. Great night light, but not for reading [SEP] While I like the concept of this product, it has some issues. First, it's not USB chargeable. Most similar products are. Second, the various functions are indicated on the face of the product with non illuminated symbols. So if it's dark in the room, as is often the case with a sleeping child's room, you can't see the symbols to see what you're trying to turn on. Lastly, the light is too bright, in my opinion, to be used as a nightlight. I would pass on this and look for something with better function. [SEP] Works great and love that there is two settings for the brightness. [SEP] This compact little machine fits easily on a bedside table and provides all the background sounds to help you fall asleep. Yes, I know there’s an app for that but you might want to put this in the baby’s room or keep it in place while you use your phone in other ways. Love the light feature too. [SEP] I am a light sleeper so having some background noise helps me to sleep deeper and keeps me from waking up at night over every little noise. Normally, I would use my echo dot to play rain sound, but am trying to move away from internet dependent devices so I thought I would give this a go, but it's a big pass. You can't see any of the buttons in the dark to turn the thing on or off or adjust the volume, and I could have worked around that except that the sounds themselves are lousy. I tried what I thought was the rain sound, but it was more like the sound of water dripping over a crackling fireplace, none of the other sounds were any better and got on my nerves. Also, you get a voice notification of ""sound on"" or ""sound off"" but the words were pronounced strangely, don't get me wrong, I enjoy different accents, but this wasn't an accent I had an issue with, it was the whole pronunciation of the word ""sound"".",3,True
Colosseum General Purpose Unisex Cotton Printed Face Masks (Pack of 2) (Polka Dots),[],[],,4.3,32,70,"These masks are comfortable to wear. The material is soft and slightly stretchy. These do not have filter pockets, nose bridge wires, or adjustable ear straps. I like the polka dot prints! [SEP] These are really cute face masks. I love the polkadot pattern so much. They don't really pull on my ears and there's a decent gap between my mouth and the fabric so it's not too bad to wear for long amounts of time. Overall the quality feels very good as well. [SEP] Comfortable knit with stretch, sits close on your face without being overly snug.  Sweatshirt type material that I expect to be pleasantly warm when the outdoor temperatures dip.  These do not have a filter pocket, which I would prefer, but they have a nice thickness.  I do think those who overheat easily may prefer other mask materials, however these are soft and worth a try for those with sensory issues. [SEP] I really like the design pattern on these polka dot masks I ordered, although I wouldn't exactly call them unisex. They fit fairly comfortably, but there are a couple of little issues that could be improved upon. The fabric is pretty soft and doesn't irritate my face, but the loops around the ear seem to have too much bulk to them. Because they are so thick it makes my ears poke out more than other masks do and with a lot of movement it is easier for them to pop off my ear. The scrunching around the bottom hugs my chin nicely, but fits a little awkwardly over my nose and kind of poofs around it. These are not the worst masks I have worn, but they certainly aren't my favorite. They make a very decent back up set for when your favorites are being washed. [SEP] These masks are cute but they were too big on my face (I do have a smaller face so I tend to have that problem with masks). I had to modify the mask by making the ear loops smaller and then the mask fit much better and more snug on my face. It doesn't have a wire on the nose for a better fit and it doesn't have a filter pocket. The ear loops were not adjustable due to how it's made, it's not an elastic so those small silicone beads that you see on the adjustable masks would not fit on these masks (these ear loops are made from the same material as the edging on the mask, like on cotton underwear). If you have a larger face these should fit fine. But once the ear loops get stretched out from normal wear, these masks will be useless unless you get crafty (I tied some thread around the end of the ear loops to make it smaller or you could also fold some of it & sew it smaller). It's hard to tell which way to wear the mask without the adjustable nose piece (the shape of the mask is not entirely symmetrical from the nose to chin area). There is a tag inside the mask so for my masks, as long as I have the tag on the left side, I feel that the mask is on my face properly.  While the mask is not bad, it did miss the mark in some areas as mentioned above. There are better masks out there that offer a more customized fit (if the mask doesn't fit properly then you're not protecting others from yourself). [SEP] I got these because my daughter is already tired of plain masks.  Out of the package, it was clear that the 2 masks are different sizes.  No idea how/why.  The black mask fits me reasonably well and is comfortable.  The red mask is far too small but fits my 10yo well.<br /><br />They're pretty and one fits each of us well but I was expecting 2 masks that fit the same. [SEP] I bought these because I just loved the pattern of the fabric.  We have to wear face masks now a lot whether it's at work or just out running errands.  They may as well look really good and these face masks do look really nice!!  They are very breathable and well made.  I feel they are made so well, they will wash up well and last a long time.  I also feel they are a great value.  I recommend these masks if you're looking for protection and style both. [SEP] These polka dot masks are super cute and stretchy. My one complaint is that they're tight across the top of my face and I feel like it's going to leave a mark. For this reason, I don't wear it for an extended period of time. Other than that I would highly recommend for quick trips or stops.",3,True
3 Pcs Foot File Kit Colossal Foot Rasp Double-Sided Foot File Callus Remover Foot Scrub Care Tool,[],[],,4.6,514,708,"Living way out in the country, there’a real shortage of salons and folks that do pedicures and foot care.  So, the next best thing is getting the tools to take care of your feet yourself!  This kit includes everything you need to scrub feet and nails, and a rasp for smoothing down callus.  Everything works best after a nice soak in warm water - so make that part of your treatment.  This is a great kit of quality tools. [SEP] It doesn't do diddly squat. The rasp is great - it has a coarse grind and a fine grind and it will do the job instead. The nail brush is like any other. It cleans your nails easily. [SEP] This is a good kit that has the heavy duty metal rasp and the finer sandpaper type on the 2 sided tool.  My husbands feet get cracked on heels/calluses during winter and mine more so in summer from wearing sandals..This is the perfect thing for using in the shower or just sitting down and taking care of yr feet.  The nail brush also included, is used almost every day and really is handy to have. [SEP] Beyond bad. I have a better chance of using a butter knife to get off callous . Dull...cheap and doesnt do a darn thing [SEP] A review from my wife who won’t stop talking about this:<br /><br />I WAS SO SKEPTICAL ON THAT HUGE GRATER AND I NOW DONT DOUBT IT! This whole set is so so so amazing!! Wonderful price for what I got. Made my feet super smooth! I brought the spa to my home 🤗💕 [SEP] I like this allot. It’s not too sharp to cut me (which I was afraid it would) but sharp enough to take off dead skin build up on my feet. I still use it with little pressure and it’s working great for me on my toes along with heals! [SEP] I was pretty skeptical about the quality because the price was super low. However, to my surprise, this is worth every penny and more. My feet are so soft and smooth. Highly recommend! [SEP] We like to have pamper nights and the previous foot callus remover we had was getting gross.  This one is huge and is more the size like an actual cheese grater.  This works really well though at taking off dead skin.  It really works on the heels. [SEP] DEFINITELY SALON QUALITY! WORKS WELL SO BE CAREFUL.... WORTH THE PRICE & YOUR FEET WILL FEEL NICE! [SEP] I had aped-egg before this for my rough heels and it did ok but after trying out this “cheese grater” lol, I’ll always use this from now on! It does a much better job and my heels are looking better than before. It gets the dead skin cells off without hurting you and it’s easy to handle and use. I highly recommend it!",3,True

This one doesn't have eucalyptus but it does have menthol to open up your nasal passage as the shower water releases steam from these tablets. If you don't like eucalyptus scent (think Vicks Vaporub in a tablet form) that really open up your nasal passage I would recommend going with this one. It has more of a fruity scent. This has a good balance of orange and lemongrass, I get a whiff of both. I actually thought these took a little while to dissolve than other shower steamers I've used. I also appreciate that these tablets have no added colorants like mica - I like these tablets to be white in color and don't need them to be some fancy colors. Overall I am very happy with these tablets and think they're great. These also seem to be of much better quality than some of the cheap ones I've seen (usually made in China) - those definitely have a lot of unnecessary additives like colors and very low quality ""essential oils"". Price wise these cost about as much as the Vicks Vaporub tablets but I believe they're larger per tablet. These are Made in USA, if it matters to you. [SEP] Lasts for duration of shower.  Smells great. Didn't feel more awake from it though [SEP] These have quite a kick to them, and I could smell them even before I opened the bag.<br /><br />They are nice, especially when I'd like an aroma therapy bath only have time for an inandout shower. They do dissolve very quickly, but I have a small tub/shower where there wasn't really anywhere I could put it and it not get a direct water hit.<br /><br />Be cautious if you have any allergies to floral scents. The lavender is very forward. [SEP] I'm currently using this for smell training, after losing my sense of smell due to covid. It's helping, wish there were more tablets in the bag. [SEP] These shower steamers smell great and from the bag, the scent is really strong. Once they were in the shower though, I could barely smell it. Each steamer lasted about 10 minutes before it was completely dissolved. The orange and lemongrass smell amazing, but it didn’t do much for me, in terms of “energizing.” It’s definitely better to use two during each shower. These would make a great gift though! [SEP] These New Awaken Shower Tablets have a strong aromatherapy scent but it smells a bit medicinal. The tablets also dissolved fairly quickly so you will go through this bag fast. But if you need to clear your senses, and enjoy the scent of orange, these so a pretty okay job in the shower.<br /><br />Katiebabs [SEP] Wish I could bottle up this scent and spray it in my house. The mixture of orange and lemongrass was awesome. It wasn't too strong nor was it to mild in the shower and it lasted a nice amout of time. I wouldn't suggest using it for quick showers though. Easy to store and clean up. It definitely woke up my senses and at the same time relaxed me before bed. [SEP] These are all individually packed, unfortunately mine were all broken because of poor packing. The smell is not strong enough and I didn't feel refreshed. I am a huge fan of shower and bath bombs but these aren't anything special [SEP] These tablets have a very strong smell, which is perfect for what they are. They disappear a bit faster than I prefer, but perhaps that is because they are designed for morning use and morning showers are usually quick? You can, of course, use them any time of the day or night, but they are a very good way to start your “day,” whenever it begins, or to give you a little boost to get you through the day or night.",3,True
Poleview Shower Steamers Bomb Aromatherapy Essential Oils Stress Relief Gifts for Women Includes 8 Different Floral Fragrances Balls,[],[],,3.6,72,1616,"I’m so glad bath bombs now have a shower equivalent, and it’s not quite as strong, which is perfect for me. This is the second time I try something like this, and these are like the other brand I reviewed. One whole one is perfect for an average bathroom with an average tub/shower setup. Small, enclosed spaces might want to use half a tablet, and bigger ones (open shower, larger room) might need two. [SEP] no fragrance at all and they are tiny [SEP] I actually use them in the bath instead of shower since I found that I get more of the aroma and benefits that way [SEP] A very nice set of shower steamers, lots of different fragrances to choose from. It's a very pretty box and ideal for gifting too. One steamer lasted me 3 showers. A lot depends on where you place the disc, the temperature of the water and definitely, how long your showers last. I placed them in a small soap dish with holes on the bottom, in a corner of the shower, away from direct stream from the showerhead. The fragrances are light but certainly discernible. I have allergies, so strongly perfumed products typically become more of an irritant. But these are pleasing. They do bleed color (as expected) while you shower but they also wash out by the time you're done showering. A nice pick me up first thing in the morning to wake up and feel refreshed. Alternatively, you could also use these as air fresheners in a restroom, if you peel away a bit of the plastic layer. Or even as scent boosters for clothes (especially if you store clothes away seasonally). However, maybe remove the plastic seal, wrap in wax paper so the color doesn't deposit on clothes, make some holes in the wax paper for the fragrance to waft. It's a fun product. [SEP] These little discs smell delightful... In the box.<br />They have such nice fragrances that I have put them in my linen closet, where they are making my towels and sheets smell wonderful.<br />Where these fall down is in the shower, where I found their effect underwhelming.<br /><br />To use these you simply unwrap one disc, then set it just beyond the direct stream of your showerhead; basically, put it in the splash zone.<br />The disc will then gradually dissolve, releasing a very subtle fragrance as it does.<br />The trouble is that, at least in my case, the scent of the discs is easily overpowered by all the other products I use in the shower.<br />Unless I bend down to sniff the disc, the fragrances of my shampoo, conditioner, and body wash are all I really pick up on.<br /><br />In fairness to these discs, my shower is over an old cast iron tub with a double shower curtain, so it is possible that in a smaller shower with a glass door these might have more of an impact.<br />I also tried two fruity fragrances first, so some of the other scents might also might pack more of a punch.<br />In the past, I used similar products made with menthol and eucalyptus that were meant to help reduce congestion that were very powerful, so that might also make these seem less fragrant by comparison.<br /><br />In the end, I suspect these would be better used as bath bombs, but overall they are not bad.<br />These discs smell wonderful and come in a beautiful box that would make them ideal for gifting.<br />They could be a sweet hostess gift or a nice addition to a bath/spa themed gift basket. [SEP] Shower steamers are some of my favorite bath accessories. I dont always like taking baths with bath bombs, but shower steamers are the next best thing. They work really well for opening up my sinuses during allergy season, or just making me feel all around less stressed. Definitely recommended. [SEP] Theses are easy to use. You simply toss it on the floor during your shower and the water hitting them makes it release a scent. I wish the scent was more powerful. I could tell they were working, but it was mild. I was hoping it would feel invigorating and perk me up, they just gave a nice little breath of fresh air. These are very giftable and a neat idea, however I would not get them again as they were not as potent as I was hoping. [SEP] Poleview Shower Steamers Bombs are the ""bomb"". They are great for your shower experience. They create a nice scent that carries from the shower to the entire bathroom. You will become addicted to shower steamers if you continue to use Poleview. I love them.<br /><br />Katiebabs [SEP] I was excited to get these shower steamers but I was disappointed. The set is lovely and they come perfectly packaged for gift giving but the scent is not strong at all. While they last at least 10 minutes before completely dissolving the scent of them is overpowered by the smell of shampoo, conditioner and body wash.<br />I wish these had a stronger scent! [SEP] The scent is gone in about 2 minutes.  The dye will stain your tub (mine is a plastic surround and i had to scrub for a couple of days to get the Pink off) Overall, not worth the money.",3,True

[SEP] This powder is supposedly loaded with great ingredients which it why I bought it. I usually love anything cherry or cherry limeade flavor, but this has a very strange and bitter taste to it. Maybe it is one of the healthy ingredients making it taste bad. I still use it to finish it but I have to mask the flavor with another BCAA powder to get it down. I will not be purchasing product this again. [SEP] I normally take LEAP before my OT workouts and got this to try after. I notice no difference in how I feel, I was hoping it would take the ache away but it doesn't. Also I highly recommend you take this with 16oz of water, not 8. I tried 8 and it was sickenly sweet. It tastes okay with 16 oz of water. I also find the instructions to be confusing. Take up to 3 times a day.... so am I supposed to take 3 times a day to get the best fat burning and muscle recovery? 30 sticks at 3 times a day at $34.99.... not a good deal, especially when there's been no change for me.

I am giving this one star for that reason as I love the idea.<br /><br />Sadly, I did not like the taste of this at all.  I could only take one to two sips before I just had to dump this out.  It had a chemical flavor and was not pleasant at all.  This one was not for me. [SEP] Not the best tasting. My kid really made a face lmao Cherry limeade flavor, Vegan! This supplement is a great pre or post workout drink. I even use this in the morning to get my day started. Comes with 18 packets that are great to pack with you on the go. This is great for muscle recovery. Glutamine and stevia leaf extract. [SEP] Very good! I drink my bcaas during my workouts and it gives my energy to keep pushing! [SEP] I pack my gym bag and take it with me to work and it can sometimes be a pain to pack pre workout. You can either take the entire container or put a few scoops in a container or bag. Also, some preworkout mixes have caffeine which I try to avoid if I am training in the evening. This VivaStix solves both those problems. It packs 5g of BCAAs, 5g glutamine, and some beet root powder along with being naturally sweetened. It tastes great and is very easy to mix into a water bottle. Quick, convenient, and tasty. [SEP] I'll first say that I am not a supplement person. My husband regularly uses protein powder and he picked up these bcaa sticks to try, which is how I started using them. I am a new mom and am trying to incorporate a workout regimen back into my life after baby, and I found that in the past month of using vivastix right after my workouts, I haven't been sore at all (and yes I'm working out pretty hard!) and I have burst through my weight loss ""plateau."" Plus, I like that it's a no brainer to use - single serve packets mean no scooping or measuring, just stirring into my water. Also I appreciate that there is no caffeine and no stimulants because I workout at night and take this after.  These actually taste good with no artificial sweeteners and no sugar. I would love more flavors in the future! [SEP] Wow - super impressed at the taste. There is no sugar or artificial sweeteners but it’s still tastes sweet & refreshing. The cherry limeade flavor is great and the powder dissolves well so you aren’t drinking gritty stuff. Also, since they are single serving packets they are easy to grab & go.

I'd say they're worth giving a try. [SEP] This is far better than drinking the teas.  I do not enjoy tea, or the taste.  So this is a great addition to my detox days.  Just pop a pill and I can instantly feel like i am more focused and less bloated.  I do not get the sudden urges to use the bathroom, i am eased into going.  My skin is clear, my stomach is less bloated, and i have more stamina. [SEP] I am always looking for ways to curb my appetite so I thought I would give these a try. You are to take so many pills each day I think that is hard to remember to take them and with the smell it is hard to force yourself to do. but I was determined to give it a fair shake. I did take them for a week, and I did notice that it helped my appetite. I am not sure if that is because of what is in them, or because of the terrible smell, who wants to eat after you have smelled that? It did work though, so you have to give some stars for that. I defiantly noticed that i was going to the bathroom more often do the detox part worked as well. This is not something I could add or take for my regular routine, but if you are looking for a way to loose a few pounds, or a way to detox for  a week or so, this would work.

We’re not vegan, but use vegan and whey protein interchangeably. We’ve tried a lot of different brands and flavors over the years, but this was the first time we’ve tried one with Blue Sprirulina as a base. Since we mix with a smoothie there are other ingredients to mask the taste of the protein, and in this case, that was a good thing. Neither of us much cared for the taste of the protein on its own, and even mixed with the smoothie, the taste was noticeable. The texture, too, was unappealing. It’s quite chalky, more noticeable on its own, but it definitely changed the texture of the smoothie. As a couple of other reviews have mentioned, our container also arrived with the inner seal partially loose. I do like the limited ingredients and the fact that there is no sugar added. Still, this isn’t a protein powder we’ll choose again. [SEP] I typically like whey proteins better because I’m not really a vegan and pea just doesn’t mix like whey does but, I do like all of the other healthy ingredients in it so, I had to give it a shot. It tastes pretty good and aside from essentially needing a blender to get it right, it looks really cool too being all blue. Under the lid was sealed well enough to feel comfortable but, the lid itself wasn’t that great because I could unscrew it and put it back and it looked the same so, I’d fortunately paid attention enough to feel like I’d be okay by taking it.

This is because the nose area is pre-shaped (like the nose area in a Halloween eye mask), so that the sleep mask doesn’t lie completely flat against the nose.<br /><br />Sleep masks designed with padded fabric across the lower edge of the mask (below the eyes and across the nose) do a more complete job of blocking out light (see, e.g., [[ASIN:B000LY3X7W Lewis N. Clark Sleep Mask]]).  However, this sleep mask, which comes with a set of rubber ear plugs, gives good value for the price (less than $6 on Amazon).  It also has a very wide and comfortable elastic band for holding the mask in place while you sleep. [SEP] The nose area is firmly formed and doesn't fit my face. If I put the mask on with the eye pieces set comfortably on my face then I get a lot of light leakage. If I get the nose section laying flat the eye pads are practically on my eyeballs. I can't blink without my eyelashes annoyingly rubbing against the eye pads. Poorly designed, poorly fitting. [SEP] I am a side sleeper. When I first put the mask on, I thought it was going to be great. The material is nice and sleek and it fit well in the strap area. It was  a little too big over my nose. When I slept on my side, depending on whether or not the pillow was in a certain place, the mask buckled and felt uncomfortable. If I put my head into the pillow and didn't move, the mask was fine. So it was ok for naps but not for all night long.<br />(The ear plugs did not work for me: they kept popping out) [SEP] When you travel for a living, have sleep apnea, and cannot sleep at all if there is any light present, buy this. Frequently, in a hotel, it is impossible to block out light completely. Many nights of tossing and turning, putting multiple pillows over my head, a simple sleep mask came to the rescue. This cuts light out completely, hurrah for the nose baffle, and you can open your eyes while wearing (sounds simple, but not being able to open your eyes runs from weird to frightening. This is so comfortable I forget I'm wearing it. And, it comes with earplugs. Cut out the light, cut out sound (including the c-pap) and you have sleep, heavenly sleep. Recommended. [SEP] The mask is very well contoured for eyes and nose. You will completely be ""blinded"" with the mask - perfect use in the airplane for good sleep. Do you hear crying babies and screaming toddlers? The ear plugs would help, although not 100% guarantee blocking screaming children (at least the noise is muffled). [SEP] Whether or not this sleep mask will work for you will probably depend on the shape of your face and how you sleep.  My husband uses sleep masks regularly for napping during the day.  And he loves this one!  He says it's incredibly comfortable, and it fits him perfectly.  Since he generally sleeps on his back, he hasn't had any problems with the mask slipping or light leaking in around the edges.  He also loves the Velcro closure (which is easily adjustable).<br /><br />Overall, this is a really good product at a really good price.  The ear plugs that come with it are a nice bonus (and would be a big help for sleeping on an airplane).  Highly recommended. [SEP] The contoured shape fits my face well--it keeps pressure off my eyes themselves and the nose piece helps to keep most of the light from sneaking up from the bottom of the mask to my eyes.  The fabric is nice and soft and it feels very comfortable on my face.<br />That's about all I can say for it as far as positive things go.  I'm afraid the luxurious padding and the adjustable strap and everything that I thought was going to be so wonderful is actually a hindrance.  If you sleep on your stomach or side, the pillow pushes the mask off to the side of your face..  That would be the disadvantage of the contour and padding.  If you are a back sleeper, the Velcro on the strap (used to adjust the size) catches on your pillow.  I have another sleep mask that has 2 straps to help hold it in place and I really feel that is a superior design to this single strap.<br /><br />Maybe if you hold really still when you sleep and lay at just the right angle... ?  Anyway, it didn't work for me very well. [SEP] Both of these items proved to be disappointing; nothing seemed to be defective, but the set just screamed ""cheap"" and disposable.<br /><br />The sleep mask was functional, but was not the comfortable, plush item I expected.  The mask was thin and flexible, not unlike the sleeping masks that certain airlines give out to customers on overnight flights.  I also found the strap affixing the mask to the face inadequate.  For those of us who toss and turn at night, every new position on the pillow meant repositioning the mask as well.<br /><br />Like the sleep mask, the ear plugs seemed pulled from the bargain bin.  My dad used to buy inexpensive earplugs like these when he planned to do woodworking, and would throw them away after use.  Such ear plugs do work, once you get them properly positioned in the ear canal.  However, they frequently come loose, fall out, start itching, etc.<br /><br />In short, these ""upgraded"" items did not seem upgraded to me; instead, they were only marginally functional. [SEP] I really like this sleep mask. I’ve tried several of them out, and you can tell this one is a nicely made product. It has Velcro in the back for adjustment, the material is a soft fabric, and it has a gel type material so it’s nice and soft when you lay down. It has indents or cut outs where your eyes go, so it doesn’t swish your eyelashes and doesn’t actually touch your eyes, which is super nice!!<br />The earplugs are super cheap, but the eye mask is really nice!! [SEP] Because my husband has sleep apnea, needs to have a million electronics in our room, and my hubby and I exist at different times... and because we always have more sun than darkness and on occasion, my husband wants to open the blackout curtains and the door, letting the light in... A sleep mask is a necessity for me and not all are created equal. I've tried several others for comfort and fit. Several others have caused me to wake up in the middle of the night for a variety of reasons... This was silky soft and comfortable. It blocks out light, which is a must. This does not feel too heavy or too hot or too tight. I did not wake up from it. It was perfect from my point of view.",3,True
"Replacement Disposable Non-Woven Filter for Cloth Masks with Filter Pocket 70g/m² Polypropylene 100% Air Filter, Made in Korea, 30 pcs (Large (30pcs))",[],"['When used inside a filter-replaceable cotton mask, the efficiency of preventing splashes increases. It is thin as a single layer but has a water-resistant effect.']",5.9,3.9,32,215,"My recommendation is to stick with the PM2.5 filters. These filters are way too thin (just one ply) and the design is odd. In addition they are way too big to fit in any one of my over 45 masks. I actually had to fold them in half in order to tuck it into my masks' filter pockets. I would never order this again. [SEP] Too big for any of my masks--and I have a lot of different ones.  It split into two parts too which I'm not sure if that's intentional or not. [SEP] I have both “3D” and regular masks that need filters.  These are designed specifically for the 3D masks, so they’re larger than the PM2.5 filters (see my photo for comparison) and shaped differently.  I did not have any problem simply cutting the top and bottom “points” off of these so that they’d fit into the regular masks.  I did not both to clip the sides as they didn’t hang out that far.  So the size was not an issue for me.<br /><br />My issue was the thinness of the material.  At first, I couldn’t even figure out if I was supposed to peel them each apart…or use 2-3 at a time.  Compared to my PM2.5 filters these are a lot thinner.  If I have to use 2-3 to get the same thickness, then the price isn’t worth it. [SEP] I got these filters mainly to use with homemade cloth masks and ordered a ""large"" and it seems to be just about enough to cover my nose and mouth without concerns about slipping down. The filter is not very thick, but it is tightly woven. As an addition to a mask that is already 2-3 layers, I found it to be satisfactory without making it too hard to breath through. The only down side to these was that they have slits across the bottom and top to make them fit your face more accurate by angling. I would have preferred to cut them myself because they are cut a bit longer than I need and that increases the likelihood of gaps. However, with a good pocket, I think they should work very well. [SEP] These are very thin. [SEP] With new variants of Covid evolving lately, the new advisory is to look for kn95 masks, or double mask.  These slip in filters can certainly help in adding layers under your existing mask, and if you have a mask that accommodates filters, then perhaps doubling or tripling up on these filters is a good idea.  Otherwise you can even simply put one of these under your existing mask.  Now I haven't done that as I do have a mask that accommodates filters, so I don't know how well it would stay put loosely under a mask, but for ones that take filters it seems to fit well for me.  They seem to be good quality from the look and feel, and a necessary tool for todays day and age.  They also represent pretty good value at 30 for under 10 bucks.  I do recommend them, and hope that everyone wears a mask. It's just common sense, which I guess isn't often so common. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:95925c303bdbcfbbdb2fa0ecdd07a0e5]] It’s been recommended to use non-woven spunbond polypropylene filters if using a filter with cloth. This filter is great for the shape a bat mask or Olson mask shape mask. There isn’t many cotton mask or cloth mask at 900-thread count. Retailers aren’t obligated to put how much thread count are on the cotton face mask. Because of this it is frustrating, and whatever cotton mask I buy I don’t trust it so I put a filter in between. I tried putting in the pleated mask but I must cut it to fit the shape of it. This filter fits my homemade face mask and other mask of similar shape.<br /><br />I have done the following test:<br />1. Flame test - to make sure it doesn’t catch fire but just disintegrate. This filter pass<br />2. Waterproof test - I pour water into it and it held the water and water also just roll off it easily. It pass!<br />3. The Light a Match - I put the filter into my mask and blew as hard as I can to see if the flame moved it didn’t!!! It pass!<br /><br />Totally recommend this, it’s great for people allergic to just wearing medical mask all day long but can use the filter in between breathable cotton and it’s easy on their skin.

Hopefully that was only because it was supplied for my honest review of a free product.

Based on the lack of a legitimate label, and the ""meh"" taste and scent, I'll likely not use this again. [SEP] I really liked this.  I can tell a difference in my hair and nails. [SEP] About two months ago, I was offered a free 7.4oz jar of Ketond Collagen Peptides (types I & III) for review via the Amazon Vine Program, and I accepted.<br /><br />I've been using various brands of collagen peptides for almost three years - mostly type I & III.  I can't be 100% clinically certain, but collagen peptides seem to have done a lot of good for the health of my gut - so I'm definitely a fan.<br /><br />The Ketond Collagen Peptides arrives in a resealable 7.4oz plastic jar.  In my case, it was completely unlabeled - I assume, because it was a new product released to me for early Amazon Vine review.  That said, I prefer plastic jars over bags for collagen peptides as they offer the easiest, fuss-free usage.  There is a fairly small plastic serving scoop in the jar.<br /><br />According to the product description here (since my jar had no label), this is a type I & III collagen peptides.  According to the question that I asked of the manufacturer, ""the collagen ingredients are from the USA and the product is also manufactured in the USA.""  The description also states that the product is from ""grass-fed, pasture-raised, Grade A bovine, and are certified hormone-free and 100% non-GMO.""  That is all very good.<br /><br />Probably unlike most people who add collagen peptides to liquid for consumption, such as coffee, I tend to add them directly to my meals whenever possible.  However, for the purpose of this review, I tested this Ketond collagen peptides in both hot and cold liquids.  It dissolved as quickly as some of the fastest dissolving peptides I've used in the past, such as [[ASIN:B00XQ2XGAA Sports Research]] or [[ASIN:B07BL69CD2 Orgain]].  Like most collagen peptides, it dissolves notably faster in hot liquids than cold.  In my experience, all unflavored collagen peptides add some very subtle flavor, usually similar to a very, very weak salt.  This is no exception.  Depending on what you put it in, you may or may not be able to detect it.<br /><br />In all honesty, I tend to purchase the cheapest collagen peptides I can per ounce and stock up when I see sales.  There are huge price differences between various brands and aside from subtle differences in they way they dissolve, I seriously doubt there is much actual difference in the efficacy at different price points when compared with other type I & III peptides.  I am willing to pay a higher price for the more complete type I, II, III, V & X peptides.  I try to get certified grass fed whenever possible and would never purchase *any* labelled to have *anything* to do with China.<br /><br />As of the time of this review, this Ketond Collagen Peptides is on the very expensive side per ounce at $4.05.  I've seen some good collagen peptides that I've used for as low as $1.09/ounce.  I've seen others at well over $2/ounce, such as this brand.  Based on the price alone, which is really high for a type I & III peptides powder, I'd give this three stars.  I'll give it an extra star because it dissolves quickly, if that's important to you.  That said, at well under this price point you can easily get a superior type I, II, III, V & X collagen peptides. [SEP] This is a sub-par collagen. It smells like one of the cheaper ones, it is not unflavored -- it tastes like how a rawhide dog toy smells. When I put it in soup it is not noticed, I am unable to put it in drinks without ruining the flavor.

I connected it to my phone and relaxed and listened to my music. I has 4 massage modes, hot compress, and kneading massage. I didn't have any problem with the comfort, it felt good. It's also cheaper than the other ones I've seen. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:f8451e37b4d35c9429f07cd819e5374e]] Comfier Eye Massager with Heat features kneading eye pieces that fit over each eye as well as vibration.  When the two kneading eye pieces rotate, it creates a substantial amount of pressure on the bridge of my nose (top part of my nose).  The eye pieces cannot be adjusted.  I have tried repositioning the massager mask, but nothing alleviates the unpleasant and downright painful pressure on my nose.  I used this eye massager mask yesterday and I swear that the bridge of my nose still hurts as I type this review.<br /><br />Based on my experiences using this product, I would not recommend. [SEP] The first thing I noticed upon opening this was that it looked weird, compared to other eye massagers I've tried. That would be because it has acupressure nodes built right into the face of it, instead of covering them up the way other units do.<br /><br />At first I thought that meant it might not be as noisy as other units. That part, as it turned out, is debatable; it doesn't have the same SOUND as the ones that rely on air compression but I'm still hearing the motors turning those nodes around. It wasn't loud, I'm just thinking that making these things quiet is a case of the technology not catching up with the idea.<br /><br />Anyway, second thing I noticed is the fit. How well it works for you depends on your face shape, but this was one of the awkward ones for me--the massager was actually too small to leave room for a suitable position for the strap, resulting in me having to either sit the massager too high on my face to make the strap hold it in place properly or have the strap push down (and past!) my ears to make the massager sit in the right spot. Also, there must be a more significant difference between this and the kneading on other massagers than ""the nodes are not covered"" because I went through every mode and every one involved pinching my nose.<br /><br />And the third thing I noticed... it takes a long time for it to warm up enough to feel it. I was about ready to turn this thing off by the time it actually started feeling hot enough to use as a ""hot compress.""<br /><br />The unit did seem to help stave off the migraine before it had a chance to grow into anything truly painful, though. [SEP] This Eye Massager comes with a heat function, Bluetooth, as well as built in speaker that plays prerecorded sounds from the unit. The eye massager gives audible voice commands letting you know what the current program is being played at the time. You can also use the Bluetooth mode to play your own music you’ve got on your cell phone or other supported device you might have.<br /><br />The eye massager part that sits around your eye sockets and forehead is made out of silicone “nodes” that’s “suppose” to feel good. I didn’t find the silicone to feel comfortable at all around my eye sockets! To me the silicon is way to hard! On the outside of the eye massager you’ll find a LED Screen that’s pretty easy to operate. The screen shows your current working mode, heat, battery power, and Bluetooth or current music you’ve got set up to play.<br /><br />This eye massager comes with an adjustable strap to fit it to your head. The description claims this unit is light weight, However, it’s Bulky as well as heavy once you’ve got it strapped to your head/face. The battery life seems pretty good as it hasn’t gone down much with multiple  uses. The eye massager charges with a Type-C cable(included) which is pretty standard nowadays with a lot of items.<br /><br />I had to adjust the head strap of this eye massager multiple times trying to find the best fit that didn’t cause pain prior to even using it. In order to try to help take some of the weight off of my face while wearing this eye massager I reclined in my chair. Doing that does help take the pressure and weight off your nose but in order to obtain any actual pressure around your eye sockets you’ve got to make the head strap tight. If the head strap isn’t tight on your head the massage “nodes” don’t even touch the area around your eye sockets! By making the strap so tight to even begin use of this eye massager, it begins with pain and discomfort before you even start using it, DEF NOT IDEAL!<br /><br />Once the eye massager is on, you’ve got to use a finger to try to navigate to the small button on the unit (which you can’t see since your eyes are covered) to push to turn on the device. Once you stumble around to locate the start button and then press it, the massager will tell you what mode you’re on. The volume for that function is LOUD! I was never able to find where, or if, there’s a volume button to either mute that loud voice or at least turn it down! Then comes the “built in music” or “peaceful built in sounds”. I found none of the built in music or built in sounds peaceful at all. The sounds only play for a few seconds and then all you hear is the gears of the “nodes” turning and grinding, DEF NOT PEACEFUL!<br /><br />I gave this eye massager Multiple try’s to get use to it as well as to try to enjoy using it. After using this eye massager for the first TWO TIMES within ten minutes of being finished I got Bad Headaches! For the next Four Times of use over a couple of days the headaches weren’t as bad after using it but I did still got headaches, that’s def NOT Peaceful or Comfortable at all for anyone!<br /><br />There’s no way I could ever recommend this eye massager to anyone until there’s some improvements to what all I’ve mentioned in this review. I REALLY wanted this eye massager to work for me and I put myself through a LOT of Discomfort trying to get to that point, but my experience with this eye massager Never Improved at all! Also, the “nodes” left red marks around my eye sockets even when I didn’t tighten the head strap much at all! [SEP] It’s awesome but just giving 4 star because hazardous when you fall asleep with it. I’m not sure if I didn’t know it yet but it’s better if get like sleeping mode (like to set only for couple minutes) and will turn off automatically. Works great if you wanna relax your eye after long period hours of work. I love that it came with build on Bluetooth for music [SEP] This eye massager is a great little item. Works well and has a decent pressure. Multiple settings to find the one that works for you. The quality is pretty good and seems like a good value for the price. Easy to adjust to fit your face. Overall i would recommend this product. [SEP] Good quality eye mask massager and beautiful design, very comfortable, the heat and vibrations features are amazing, it also has Bluetooth connection capability for music. It is rechargeable and works just as advertised, I like it a lot! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:ced37d136f2fbefdcf22a581637a6e3f]] It looks so weird but it is so cool and futuristic. I never thought I would need an eye massager but I'm happy I bought it( it rubs that stop where my glasses sit to long and it starts to hurt.)<br />It's so relaxing. The Nubs on the eye massager part are soft and flexible so they don't hurt.  It has soothing sounds already built into it but you can also play your own soothing music through Bluetooth. [SEP] I own an old pair of eye massagers that rely on pneumatic pouches that inflate and deflate to simulate the massaging motions. I find it somehow good but not excellent, that's why I wanted to try these fancy looking ones hoping for a better performance. Not quite! These actually have no pneumatics but instead rely on the old school method of mechanical motors to simulate massaging motions. The issue with that is if you don't get the placement of those motors right then you get zero massaging and even end up hurting rather than relieving. This is the exact case here, there is no adjustments you can make to make these adapt to the shape and size of your eyes/skull. I put them on and it felt like I massaging my eye sockets rather than my eyes! One way to describe it is like you pay for a massage session on your sore muscles instead you get a massage for your bones!<br />The heat mode feels like a mirage, you feel something and you question yourself ""is this really heat I'm feeling?!"" You don't feel heat on your eye lids, you feel there's some source of heat but you're not sure where is it nor what's its purpose!<br />The sound mode is just useless to me and an unnecessary addon. I can use my phone for music if I want to, I don't need an extra device to pair for this, nor I plan on using these for an extended time that requires a music session.<br />5 stars for the looks 2 stars for functionality. [SEP] First off my family really enjoys the Comfier brand. We have a few pieces of massage equipment from them that works great. That being said let’s talk about this Eye Massager.<br /><br />The eye massager has some good qualities. This massager has four different modes that can easily be changed by its single button control. You can long press to turn on and off, with a short press to change modes, a double press to turn the heating option on or off and finally a triple press to stop the annoying music. It’s only display tells everything about the massager. It’s very easy to tell what mode, heating and charging display all on one display. The strap is very easy to use and adjust. Lastly the massager is a good build and is very easy to charge with the included charging cable.<br /><br />Now let’s talk about it’s negatives. The massager massages my nose and not my eyes. Not sure who engineered this massager but it misses the whole point of being an eye massager. The music that’s preinstalled is very annoying. I would recommend turning that off immediately. Lastly my massager was making an annoying sound while on. This massager needs to be revamped to work like it should.<br /><br />If your looking for a nose massager than this is the one for you. But if your looking for an eye massager then look elsewhere. We were very disappointed with this massager especially having other massagers by Comfier that work great.",3,True

I smooth it on in the shower, pat dry, and my skin feels so much better.  It's got a very mild scent which is not at all offensive, and it's easy to apply.  I wish it was a bit cheaper, and that's the reason it's only four stars instead of five.  But it's a good product so I suppose it's worth whatever it's worth, right? [SEP] This baby oil has a light sweet coconut fragrance. Made from soybean oil, coconut oil, lecithin, vitamins E and C and fragrance, it applies easily and absorbs quickly.. The pump dispenser works flawlessly. It is very gentle and no negative side effects were experienced. The scent is fresh and does not overpower. The oil leaves skin soft and supple.  It is free of mineral oil, parabens, phthalates, dyes, and, formaldehyde. The directions describe this as a massage oil but it functions pretty much like any baby oil. It is appropriate for babies of all ages. [SEP] This Petite Planet Soothing Baby Oil has Soybean and Coconut oils as the first two ingredients (then Lecithin, Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Tocopherol and Fragrance), making this massage oil both smoothly gliding as well as nicely scented with coconut. The smell is a very very light version of that 70s and 80s tropical suntan lotion (which I have always loved the scent of, btw). If you don't like coconut scent, you won't like this. The smell is not strong enough to be bothersome to a baby, but pleasant enough to enjoy massaging your precious loved one. This oil feels very nice, and leaves your skin feeling very soft and protected. I put some on my legs, and I love the way my skin feels. [SEP] I find it so weird that something made with coconut oil stays liquid at room temperature and comes out of a lotion bottle without gumming up the bottle. But it does indeed work. And it has a light, baby pleasant smell. Adults might not prefer this for themselves, just because the scent is a bit newborn. It works nicely, moisturizes well, and is perfect for massages. Five stars. [SEP] I cannot say how much I love this stuff!! I was becoming a self-scratching post with this long, dry winter tormenting me. I squirted some on my legs to relieve the worst itch I've ever had from dry weather--it worked immediately. It deadened the itch, began to soothe my skin, and hydrated like a dream. The scent was awesome, too. I felt like I was at the beach--Hawaiin Tropic comes to mind.<br />Can you imagine how wonderfully this will work on new human skin? [SEP] I thought that a baby oil with coconut oil would smell a little like coconut.  I was wrong-Petite Planet Soothing Baby Oil with Coconut smells nothing like coconut.  It has a weird, synthetic &#34;fresh&#34; smell that I do not care for at all.  I do like it better than the &#34;baby fresh&#34; scent products had when my kids were little.<br /><br />Fragrance aside,  this oil absorbs well, and quickly, leaving skin soft and not greasy.  It does not seem to stain clothes, but I have not really checked, or use this before putting on clothes that I care about.  The kids I work with find the scent weird, and one of them asked me if I had used the lotion they have at the hospital.  It gives my skin some much needed moisture, but it does not take long before my skin needs another application. [SEP] I do not have a baby on which to use this baby oil. I wanted to try it as a moisturizer for myself. I value coconut oil and use it daily, due to its wonderful health properties. Consequently, I was eager to try this mixture of baby oil and coconut oil. The first thing I noticed is its fresh and  gentle scent of baby oil combined with coconut oil. It is a wonderful, light scent. I regularly use baby oil as a moisturizer, and I noticed that this oil is a little thicker than traditional baby oil, and, although it does absorb well into the skin, it does not absorb as quickly. For these reasons, I believe that this would be a better massaging oil than the traditional baby oil or baby lotion. As a moisturizer for adults, I believe it might be better used at night, as it doesn't absorb immediately into the skin. It did make my skin feel soft and smooth and soothed, leaving behind a light, fresh scent. It is ultra-gentle and great for sensitive skin. It contains no parabens, phthalates, dyes, mineral oil, formaldehyde, or harsh fragrances. This product is not tested on animals. The pump bottle is great for dispensing this oil in small amounts.<br /><br />I was given a free sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review. [SEP] This is a nice baby oil product. The main oil is soy which I feel they should be a bit more up front about as soy allergies are fairly common, but it is listed in the ingredients with the second being the coconut. Thankfully no one in the house has soy allergies, and as for the formula it is gentle on the skin and did not cause irritation to even on sensitive areas. The fragrance is pleasant and tropical but a bit too strong. It does work well for massage, not drying too quickly or leaving the skin too wet. It leaves the skin hydrated, and as it is for massage the absorption is slow so I find a gentle blotting after helps. Overall it is a nice oil, it is good on sensitive skin and has a tropical fragrance. [SEP] This baby oil is a gentle oil with a bit of added fragrance. The ingredients seem to be mostly naturally derived with the exception of the fragrance and a lab-made vitamin C. It seems unfortunate to me that an otherwise pretty natural product has a synthetic scent added. While this is better than some other baby oil products it is a bit expensive and has the added fragrance, which is not too strong but not a purely natural scent. The oil comes with instructions for massaging a baby with it as well as a note that you may need to pump the container multiple times to get the oil flowing. This is a Johnson & Johnson product made in Greece. Hopefully this big consumer products conglomerate will commit more fully to some all natural products in the future.

So far no stomach discomfort and seems like a supplement I can benifit from. Hoping it gives me more energy [SEP] I am not big on apple cider vinegar supplements, but my son likes them. These have a pretty strong vinegar scent when you open the bottle.<br />Like many gummies, there is a lot of glucose to cover up the medicinal tastes, so be aware of that, especially if you are diabetic or pre-diabetic.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good once you chew on them. You don't really notice the vinegar much.<br /><br />As far as helpful, well, not sure there is any way to quantify that. My son says they help with his digestion. I do trust the Solger brand. [SEP] I've heard a lot about the benefits of apple cider vinegar so I decided to give these a try. They taste good and are very easy to chew. I haven't noticed any ill effects from taking them, and they do seem to help suppress appetite (not majorly so, but less cravings). However, these gummies are very tacky to the touch and very difficult to get out of the bottle as they stick together and are very soft. I've tried hitting it against something to try to shake them out, but that doesn't work very well. Digging them out can present a challenge since they're so soft. [SEP] Although taste is subjective, I found these to be sweet and tasty, not too vinegary. When you first open the bottle it smells stronger than it tastes.<br />If you don't like diluting a teaspoon of vinegar in water and drinking it, these are a nice option.<br />This company has been around a long time and has a wonderful reputation, so I feel confident taking their supplements. [SEP] They don't taste that great but they are definitely better than drinking raw vinegar.  I haven't actually had any vinegar in a while, and I found the gummies gave me a bit of gastric distress. Probably because I'm not use to them.  I'll lay off for a while and then slowly reintroduce and see what happens. I'll post an update later. [SEP] This bottle contains a 45  day supply of apple cider vinegar gummies at 2 per day. The gummies list beet root powder and pomegranate powder, but the taste was apple cider. The country of manufacture was not listed, but a call to the company was answered promptly and the person answering the phone listened to the question, excused herself to check her answer, came back on the line and indicated these gummies are made in the U S A .<br />  These gummies are also a good source of Vit B-12, something that we often hear being recommended, especially for seniors. [SEP] Solgar is one of my go to vitamin brands. They make high quality stuff and these apple cider vinegar gummies are no exception. They are very tasty, have 1000mg of organic vinegar per serving, and even give you a nice shot of vitamin B. Strong recommendation here! [SEP] I take ACV gummies on a regular basis and compared to other ACV gummies these are very sticky and the vinegar taste is very pronounced.  They say ""Raspberry Pomegranate Flavored"" but all I can taste is vinegar.  I happen to like vinegar but if you do not you may want to try another brand.  I am giving them 3-stars for the excess sticky-ness as it is excessive. [SEP] Received today. Very disappointed once opened the bottle. The gummies seems melting and all glued together became a big lump. I'm not sure whether the shipping was went through unexpected heat or the product have low heat tolerance.

When the bag arrives the balloons are in a vacuum sealed shrink bag.  All the air has been taken out of the bag.  I assume this is done this way because of shipping.  There are 90 balloons.  The colors are blue, pink, light green, purple, mint, yellow, lilac, peach, blush.  When blown up these balloons are approximately 12"".  The balloons we have blown up so far have all been good.  None have popped.  There is a gold ribbon also included if you want to make an arch or string this balloons together.  The price is just about average compared to other bags of balloons that we have used. [SEP] Loved this palette!  The balloons held up well, very few accidental pops.  This was my first balloon arch and these balloons fit perfectly in my arch kit. [SEP] These balloons are your standard latex balloons that are good for parties, party games and fun for kids who like to hit balloons around to keep them from hitting the floor as a fun game.  The balloons in this set come in a nice assortment that has colors that would work well for a baby shower, little girl's birthday party or an Easter party.  The balloons come in a vacuum sealed package. [SEP] We were looking for pastels for a young girl's birthday party and these fit the bill! [SEP] These balloons arrived in a vacu-sealed bag.

I  have  purchased  again, and  you  will  be  happy [SEP] Originally I thought these bags had a gold circle rather than a star, which is why I ordered them - I thought they might look like Kate Spade bags but I was wrong - they are gold stars which is still pretty attractive. The design is generic enough to be used for all kinds of occasions such as weddings, birthdays, baby showers, etc. It also looks like the type of bag a store might use, so if you own a small business, these would also be good for giving to customers. The bag is reasonably sturdy, like a bag from a boutique, and the handles are decent. Overall these are good quality bags but the price seems a little high - it's too bad it doesn't come with gold colored tissue paper, but if you add them yourself you can make them look luxe. [SEP] These Packqueen gift bags are attractive and good quality bags that are super versatile given the design and generous sizing that can fit bigger and odd shaped items. The bags are crisp white with shiny gold foil stars and have long white ribbon handles. The shiny star pattern makes these perfect for an array of occasions such as graduations, birthdays, anniversaries, Father’s or Mother’s Day, Christmas, New Year’s, Valentine’s Day, housewarming and more.<br /><br />These large bags have a horizontal orientation (more width than height) that makes them great for gifting items such as shoes, clothing items like robes or sweat outfits, home goods and gourmet food, a kitchen tool set with mitts, small appliances, toys, books, blow dryers and all kinds of things. These measure about 10“ high, 5“ deep and 13“ wide.  The paper is thick and sturdy, and the bottoms are reinforced with a thin piece of white cardboard glued inside.<br /><br />The bags have clean, fresh look. They aren’t super premium gift bags like some I’ve seen adorned with faux gems, plastic handles and so on. But I’d classify these as high quality, premium bags that are plenty nice for special occasions. No tissue is included, and I personally think these look fabulous with patterned tissue with shiny dots or stripes, but they also look great with plain tissue in a range of colors such as navy, red, pink and so much more. I’m super pleased with the quality and design. Recommended. 5 stars. [SEP] OK, these are very pretty and are not cheap quality.  I like them very much.  I use them for large purchase or gifts.  Very Nice! Thank you [SEP] Great gift bags! These gift bags are very well made. They are a great size. They have nice handles. The inside has a reinforced cardboard bottom which is very good.

"Evogen Greentein | Pure Grain Free Plant Protein, Pea, Pumpkin, Watermelon Seed Proteins Vitamin B12, Dairy Free, Gluten Free, for Recovery and Shakes (Dark Chocolate Hazelnut)",[],[],,4.3,20,295,"Plant protein is a better choice for your overall health. The texture of most is less than desirable. This powder has a non-gritty texture that is easier to palate. The taste is also an improvement. The blend of plants is different than some others I've tried. The watermelon seeds are a novel addition. You may need to add more liquid to this than with whey if you don't like a super thick shake.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] I gave this 5 stars because all the vegan protein drinks I've tried are quite similar - icky, overly smooth texture, bad smell, bad after taste. This one was better than any of those, was easy to mix, and the taste was good. I don't love this but I've yet to find a powdered protein drink that I love. I am a bit confused because I received Chocolate Caramel even though I was sent a receipt for Chocolate Hazelnut and the picture in the listing is for Chocolate almond. The chocolate taste was pretty consistent with other chocolate protein drinks, it was ok but I prefer more chocolate and less sweet. But I love that this is plant based as I don't tolerate milk based protein well. [SEP] This is a decent plant-protein formula that tastes great and is fairly low in carbs, which is the main thing I look for in a protein powder, since I am on a low carb diet and stick to it.<br /><br />I just mix it with a few tablespoons of half-and-half (yes I know this makes it non-vegan, so this could easily be duplicated by using some plant-based milk) and create a pudding-like mix. It is a high-protein, lower carb dessert for me.<br /><br />My main issue with this is that I don't like consuming sugar if I don't have to, and from what I can tell this is sweetened with brown rice syrup and maltodextrin. While, yes, brown rice sugar is more natural than refined sugar, and it isn't high in fructose, it is still basically a fancy source of sugar.  Overall, however, this is a good powder that is still relatively low in carbs. [SEP] Good tasting vegan protein powder. I drink this as my breakfast smoothies. Adding frozen fruit to the mix makes an even greater drink. Definitely recommend this [SEP] I like that this product is natural veggie protein. For those who are sensitive or trying to avoid fatty protein this is a good option. The flavor is nice and chocolatey! It tastes good on its own mixed with milk, or I mixed it in a banana, peanut butter smoothie and it was delicious!! It blends well once shaken or mixed good. I really like the thickness quality and flavor. I would recommend if you are looking to try a new protein product. [SEP] Im not a chocolate drinker but the flavor is pretty good.<br />It's just like most vegan/plant based proteins -slight grit but overall consistency is great, flavor is good.<br />Expensive but worth the purchase. [SEP] Was nice and thick in texture but the flavor is way too sweet and artificial tasting.",3,True

My package came disheveled. The salt package was open, and salt was everywhere. There was a tiny crack on the bottom of the inhaler. Watch out for that! I contacted Amazon, and they refunded my money right away. [SEP] I have only had this product for 4 days.<br />After using it for 2 days I had great relief from my allergies.  On the 3rd day I woke up with my combo migraine/ allergy headache that I get from junipers this time of year.  Because of this inhaler I was able to function & get out of bed.  I would have normally had to stay on ice & flat in bed because I could not function with that pain.<br /><br />This was & is the only thing that has ever stopped that pain from continuing!  It stopped it dead!!  I am amazed!!<br />Try it! [SEP] great [SEP] Was a relief  but had to do more to get well.

All I know is that I'd much rather deal with these symptoms than the severe shortness of breath I have had previously..  Something has happened.<br />It will be a while before I use this again, simply because the sore throat was intense and very unpleasant.

"WELLVO 5pcs Clear Mask Inner Bracket Support Reusable and Washable 3D Soft Plastic Mask Holder for More Space Comfortable Breathing, Mouth Nose Lipstick Protection (5)",[],[],,3.7,85,1090,"In the description, you get ""Easy to USE: It has two fixing clips on both sides, and you can hang the 3D bracket on the face cover to prevent sliding. Then put on the face cover as usual."" No, you can't. Further down you will see that they recommend either sewing it in place or using double sided tape. I was able to wear mine without any complications. [SEP] This is a nice idea and concept, but the execution doesn’t work for many faces. This ended up putting a lot of pressure on the bridge of my nose, which isn’t particularly huge or anything, but this definitely is made for people with tiny noses with a very small or low bridge. If that’s not you, you’re not gonna like this. Very uncomfortable, and the little hook bracket things don’t connect to anything, so they don’t stay in place. [SEP] These are great. They help me breathe better in my mask.  I keep one at work, in my car and in my purse. Highly recommend if you have masks that hug your face too tight. [SEP] I use these inserts to give college tours-- they make my voice loud and clear, and I have no issues anymore. [SEP] This does help a little to make my speaking voice less muffled, and allows me to breath better without the mask fabric being sucked in every time. I generally don't need to secure it with anything - I just put it where I want on my face or on the inside of the mask and put the mask on.<br /><br />I'd not call it comfortable, but it's not exactly uncomfortable either. It's just not pleasant. After wearing it for about half an hour, I'd start to sweat, and I'd wish this were made with some sort of fabric material or covered by some cotton or fleece fabric where my face contacts it. I don't like how it feels against sweaty skin.<br /><br />It is also way too small for my husband, and barely fits me. I think this is probably more suitable for women than men. [SEP] Awesome!<br /><br />PROS: Lightweight, flexible enough to slip inside the pocket of home made double layer masks & washable. There are holes to secure the mask frame in place if you choose to do so. We personally chose to not attach them but leave them loose for cleaning / sanitizing purposes because we have to switch masks multiple times a day during long shifts. These are so comfortable & they actually keep the cloth away from your mouth & nose area so lipstick doesn't get smeared everywhere making it so much easier to breath without the mask getting sucked into your nose & mouth! Several of us work in management at healthcare facilities & have long shifts during which these exceeded our expectations. Another key thing we noticed is that it's easier to talk to people & have them understand you when compared to wearing a mask without the frame!<br />Update 1/12/2021: I officially love these even more as I have become lazy & started washing these in a linen bag in the washer with my masks in hot water & then hanging them to dry, lol. I ended up buying more so I had enough to allow one frame for each day of the week for each household member with a few extra for washing days. Basically once a week I throw a few large linen bags in the wash with them & our masks instead of having to wash them all every day or every few days all week long & they are just as good as the day I bought them!<br /><br />CONS: The only con we found is that it is almost impossible to slip the mask down under your chin without touching the parts of the mask you aren't suppose to. We solved this by just temporarily unhooking & dropping one ear loop so that it left the mask hanging off of one ear if needed & then all we had to do was use the ear loop to reapply without touching the yucky face of the mask.<br /><br />UPDATE: 8/29/2020<br />We are expirementing with attachment & so far like loosely tacking the mask frame on with several stitches, after removing the tab portion that sticks up a bit, for a more permanent application on masks with no pockets. For a less permanent attachment we have been using small cloth or elastic loops shaped like a U attached at 2 points in the appropriate place marked on the mask after mock fitting. The last method is better for washing, removal & possible adjustments but it is also a bit more involved in creating the pockets / loops. Both methods work for an entire shift & they are still comfortable sitting on the face. It will be your personal preference as to whether or not you want the frame covered with cloth in a 2 layer pocket style mask or attached or not etc.<br /><br />Overall this is a good product thus far. I will update if things change. Please see pics with my review for reference. I did receive this product for free but that has in no way influenced my review. I depend on honest reviews to buy the best products I can within my budget & I do not have the time or money to deal with inferior products as I am sure you don't! I personally choose, test & use all products I receive & try to be thorough in my reviews. (Sometimes my entire household tests items as well.) If this review helped please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button! [SEP] What I liked was that it keeps the material of the mask from touching your nose or mouth. What i didn't like was the rigidity of the insert. I thought it would be more pliable. But it does the job. [SEP] Depending on the type of mask you are wearing, these can be quite helpful. They do not diminish the effectiveness of your mask, but they do you keep the cloth or filter paper away from your mouth. Maybe they even improve the functionality of the mask? No real idea on that, though. [SEP] I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these.  I was pleasantly surprised by them.  They are soft and flexible.<br />They are not invasive and give you a little breathing room.  Great for someone who has trouble breathing inside their mask.  I also wear lip gloss which gets all over the inside of my mask, and smears onto my face.  This completely eliminates that issue.  I was very happy with them.

This product works great for cleaning my daughters face. She has acne and wanted a item like this so this was great for her. She likes the vibrating feature it really helps get her pores clean. It is soft and gentle on her skin but does a good job in cleaning it thoroughly. Charges fairly quickly and hold a charge for several uses. [SEP] I like these types of facial cleansing devices.  I have 3 of them now and really like using them to exfoliate dead skin cells off my face.  This one is gentle works well.  I don't know how long it will hold a charge but my other two that are very similar hold a charge for a long time.  I don't use any electronic facial devices except for this one and I think it does a good job at gently loosening up dead skin cells. [SEP] I had never used a device like this and did not know what to expect, but my first impression of this cleaner brush was positive. It is cute; for example, the charging port is disguised as a little shell. So far, so good. The good stopped there.<br />The instructions are in such tiny print they are hard to read even with reading glasses. When I read them, though, it got worse. You are supposed to remove your makeup before using the brush. Excuse me, but removing makeup is one reason I would wash my face. They want me to clean my face twice?<br />Then I tried to use it and found it is not well-designed for using on the face. Faces have hollows and ridges and need something flexible to get to them. This device is rigid and will not reach many areas of my face other than my forehead and cheeks.<br />This might be a comfy way to massage my neck, but this is not a product I would use for my face. [SEP] make my skin greatlove this product [SEP] Cute cleansing brush. It is comfortable to use and good size to cleanse and massage your face. There are a few particular features that I am not a big fan such as the plug to charge it and the way you have to remove the little cap on the back to charge it. However, I think this is a great tool to integrate into your daily beauty routine that can be used on a daily basis to ensure you are completely cleansing your face and removing dead skin.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Soft silicone<br />* Comfortable to hold<br />* Adjustable vibration<br />* Waterproof<br />* Portable<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Short USB cable<br />* USB cable has a very specific plug, does not use a standard micro USB cable like many other devices. So if you lose this cable, you will not be able to recharge it.<br />* The removable little cap that protects the area to plug it, can get lost in a blink. It is tiny and does not have a strap that ties it to the device.<br />* Price, I think is a little overprice considering all the above. I have seen other cleansing devices for the same price that offers features such as wireless charging and different textures to cleanse and massage.",3,True

That's fine, I don't mind. I have some breathing issues (COPD) but I don't run around with fake notes from fake government sites trying to get away with not wearing a mask.<br />These seemed like a good idea for five or ten minutes then someone took a closer look. Other styles of these inserts have clips or hooks molded into them so they can easily be attached to the disposable paper style of mask. These inserts lack any means to hold them in place. You're expected to stuff this under your mask and wish or hope it stays in place. It won't, it's going to slide around while your mask goes another way. If you're lucky it won't pop out and fall to the ground.<br />Breathing while wearing a mask isn't fun. You can do it. Doctor's do it with much more restrictive masks for half a day or longer. but this insert. . . you're literally blocking off 50+% of the surface area inside the mask with plastic that blocks air flow. I sat quietly for five minutes trying this mask out, it became uncomfortably warm inside the mask. I started to sweat. When I tried to talk the insert slid about under my mask. I had to take this off. It was horrible. According to one of the product images in the listing This product will:<br /><br />Realive you from the Bellow Problerms<br />• Mask Stick to Lipstick - Did not test, probably works.<br />• Not Breathing Smoothly - This hindered smooth breathing.<br />• Fogging of Glasses - If anything these worsen how badly glasses fog.<br />• Sultry Wearing a Mask - This insulates and blocks airflow. Hot & stuffy.<br /><br />These were and are a terrible idea. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. . . unless I really didn't like them. [SEP] These just don't serve any purpose at all. I got them to try to alleviate the eternal fogging up of my glasses while wearing cloth masks. Unfortunately, the foolish things won't stay on my face, they keep sliding down and pull the masks with them. Really, I'm done trying. [SEP] No CAPARISON = WITHOUT or WITH this bracket.<br /><br />This is a pliable / thin silicone bracelet that can lay between a regular mask and face<br />It's not intrusive - honestly, you don't even know it's there except for<br />improved breathing and closing the gap so glasses DON'T fog like usual.<br />4 1/2"" wide - 3 1/2"" tall - 1 1/2"" deep<br /><br />You DON'T need to have a mask with an opening = the silicone stays in place against the face.<br />However - if you do have masks with opening - this bracelet fits very well inside with lots of extra room.<br /><br />The DIFFERENCES this bracket can make.<br />PROS<br />1. Much improved breathing<br />2. No fog OR hardly any on glasses<br />3. An extra layer of protection<br />particularly helpful if you using a two layered mask.<br />4. If the ear elastics have a tiny bit of give / or are a bit loose, this can make them perfect.<br />5. Silicone is comfortable on face<br />6. Can be cleaned and disinfected after use.<br />7. Washable / reusable<br />8. Since they don't HAVE to go inside. Pretty much a universal compatibility.<br /><br />CONS<br />1. IF a mask already fits snug = this may make it TOO snug.<br />2. If adding inside a mask, may let that inside flap - flap against the face more than usual.<br /><br />To me - I see this as a game changer.<br />And can't believe I'm saying this = but these are trying times were in = so YES<br />WOULD make a good gift. [SEP] I'm a bit torn about these mask brackets, to be honest. They do work to hold the cloth masks I use away from the face, providing extra breathing room, which is nice especially when you have fabric that can sometimes tickle your nose or lips. That said, the silicone of these masks is very, very thin, and I actually tore one bit of the mask when unpacking them, though I was being careful. They're sturdy once you get them settled, and stay in place on the face with a mask anchoring them on, and they don't cut into the face or leave marks or hurt in any way. That all said, the plastic of the mask, over time, started to feel clammy with my breath, and it started to feel warm. I do think that the bracket functions as desired, though it's a bit easier to tear than I expected, but personally, I don't like the feeling of the plastic against my face for any real length of time. These are great to try, however, and see if it's something you'd like to use, I'd think. They're definitely an ingenious idea to help make mask-wearing more comfortable. [SEP] I thought perhaps I could squeeze this into the little pouch designed for a filter. It's just weird how it just sits inside the mask.  It was more trouble keeping it positioned than not having it in.  If I needed to take my mask off, I had to catch the bracket.  I did not find that these added value to my mask wearing.  Thank you. [SEP] DmHirmg New Silicone 3D Bracket for Comfortable Wearing by Creating More Space for Breathing Ideal Ma<br /><br />My face felt warmer, when wearing the silicone 3d bracket.  I wear masks that have at least 3 layers of material, and it felt like the air pocket created by the mask built a humid layer of air around my mouth and nose.  Despite the initial discomfort I wore the mask for ~8 hours during a work day.  Wearing a mask in uncomfortable, but for me, using the 3d bracket made it more uncomfortable.  I don't wear makeup, so I can't comment on how the 3d bracket works with makeup.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product.  Amazon sent me this product for review. [SEP] Pros<br />Easy to clean with in the dishwasher or UV sanitizer<br />Thin<br />Affordable<br />Comfortable (subjective)<br /><br />Con<br />Yet another item to remember to take with you<br />Requires some maneuvering to keep in place while placing mask over<br />Does not work/fit with all types of masks, Tommy Copper and level 1masks -yes.....average size flu mask—nay.<br /><br />I honestly wouldn’t bother. I found it to be not worth the hassle and awkward. [SEP] I wear glasses and with the mask requirements, i thought this would be a great item to have to stop my glasses from fogging up.  Nope, didn't work.  still same problem as before.<br /><br />I will say the mask is comfortable and i don't normally notice it when i have it on.  I have had problems with it staying in place.  i would notice it starting to slip down if i was talking a lot. [SEP] These are hard not soft and if you don't sew them in your mask they fall of and out, and are uncomfortable [SEP] This works better than I expected, but has room for improvement.<br />First, one size does not fit all - this was a little too short for me from the tip of my nose to the bottom of my lip when my mouth is open.  It's OK when I'm not talking, but gets a little clumsy at times when my bottom lip bumps it and I have to occasionally readjust the position.  Which isn't good, as that means I'm putting my hand to my face.<br />But this works wonderfully to help maintain a gap when you breathe in, ensuring you get cool air.  My biggest complaint in wearing a mask is how hot and uncomfortable it can get, and this nearly solves that problem completely.  It's still a little warmer than not wearing a mask at all, but only if you focus on it - I really don't notice it unless I think about it.<br />An added benefit in wearing this is that my glasses don't steam up anywhere near as much.  They still can, depending on the circumstances and how heavy I'm breathing, but it's not too common and it clears quickly.<br />One tiny complaint is that it's a little heavy to wear with the really flimsy masks, making it stretch out the elastic strings of those masks in no time.  This is probably a little thicker than it needed to be.  Perhaps they wanted more rigidity?<br />Overall, I'd recommend trying these if wearing a mask is simply too hot and uncomfortable for you, or if you wear glasses and have problems with them steaming up.  I give it 4-stars and I'm very happy I ordered some - I really don't mind wearing a mask as much now.<br />If you find this review assisted you in making a purchase decision, make sure to click ""helpful""!",3,True

They shorten drying time and soften clothes. BUT these particular drying balls are the smallest I’ve ever had. I recommend you browse this site for other wool dryer balls and get some bigger ones. Also, these are imported and made of New Zealand wool, but there is no indication they were made there. I’m disappointed that information isn’t given. Four stars. [SEP] These balls have been tossed around in the dryer for a couple months now - big and small loads, bedding and clothes, towels and slipper loads. They definitely have made a difference in sheets and towel drying - no more twisted up sheets, and no more uneven dryness. I have not noticed any excessive wear or damage on clothing after being in the dryer with the dryer balls. The balls do not have any scent, whether wet or dry. Overall, I've noticed my dryer loads dry more evenly and with less twisted up mess of garments and sheets. [SEP] Love this product. Drys my clothes faster and keeps them soft. They can be a bit on the noisy side though if you are doing small loads of laundry, so keep that in mind. Overall, I have fallen in love with this product. Would recommend to others. These wool balls are so much better for your machine and the environment. [SEP] These dryer balls work better than I expected. They are large and help reduce the drying time. They help soften the clothing and reduce static buildup. They also double as a juggling set when you are bored since there are three per pack and about the right size.  The only downside is that they don’t add a scent to the laundry like dryer sheets.  I think the benefits out weigh this minor issue. Overall these are worth trying out especially if you don’t like using dryer sheets. [SEP] I have been using wool dryer balls for years and generally no longer use dryer sheets.  They seem to speed the drying time and they somehow also soften and help a lot with static.  In the very coldest part of winter I still do get a little static cling but only when the air is exceptionally dry.  This three pack appear to be good quality and have no odor.  My old ones still seemed fine but have lost a little of their fuzzy-ness so I have replaced them with this fresh 3-pack. [SEP] These are much better than dryer sheets for several reasons: they are reusable and they help dry my clothes faster. I add a few drops of lavender essential oil to each ball before drying and it leaves my clothes smelling extra fresh. [SEP] I love this product as a concept.  It is great to have something reusable to replace a disposable product.  It's great for the planet and great for my dollar.<br /><br />I have only used these on three loads of wash so far.  Every load I do is different, and I haven't been taking down stats so I cannot comment on whether these shorten drying time.  However, they are effective for reducing static and in that way are a viable replacement to my traditional dryer sheets. [SEP] These wool dryer balls does help with softening clothes in the dryer, and you can use them multiple times. These are very easy to use and no mess or breakage. A good alternative to dryer sheets.<br /><br />Katiebabs [SEP] I love these so much! Not just to help with drying time, they catch hair so well! They are large so it's easy to sort them out of the load and havent discolored at all. We dont use essential oil with ours, but you totally could if you wanted added scent. [SEP] It’s been a long time since I’ve used wool dryer balls. These are an amazing quality and definitely work to help dry my clothing faster. They work great with drying bedding as well. I didn’t notice any static and I like that I can add essential oils to them to make my laundry smell good naturally. These are very good size and it does say to use all three when drying anything. I am very pleased with these! I also really like that this saves a ton of dryer sheets from ending up in a landfill.",3,True

I'm also not a fan of swallowing pills and having to measure out liquid for each dose also wasn't appealing. These gummies arrived sealed and you get a decent amount in the bottle. There was only a slight odor to the gummies but it wasn't overpowering. The gummies actually taste good with only a very slight bitter taste.

Third, it heats up very quickly and evenly as far as I can tell. The temperature settings make sense - that is, there is a clear distinction between settings.

[SEP] Large and thick heating pad. Heats up to a decent hot at level 6. Appreciate the long cord and thick soft pad. Also appreciate that it can be machine washed once a year and the cord detaches. Drawbacks, the portion where it connects to the pad is large and thick plastic which can be a little uncomfortable if you’re sitting on it. The other drawback, which concerns me, is the controller stays warm to the touch when plugged it, no matter if the pad has been turned on or not. I like to leave my heating pad plugged in, and turned off, while not in uses so I don’t have to bend to get to an outlet. This pad I won’t feel comfortable leaving plugged in due to the heat the controller emits even when the pad has not been in use. Would recommend as long as you don’t leave plugged into an outlet. [SEP] Very light and thin. Not weighted at all. I would not recommend as a weighted heating pad. [SEP] I absolutely love this heating pad. Its soft and huge. I like that it shuts off by itself. I usually fall to sleep with it on. Nice feet warmer too. [SEP] I have chronic lower back pain and this heating pad is large enough to cover my back without having to reposition every 20 min.

A USB-C Port, a Battery, and a Carrying Bag",[],[],,4.2,27,174,"[[VIDEOID:752a3f345a077dbdb43549e1706fa53e]] This is the 31st BP monitor that I have tried and ordered through Amazon either via purchase or the Vine program and is a basic monitor. Almost every single monitor takes my BP within a few points of each other and this one's accuracy errs on the lower side by a few points but is still within an acceptable range. This one has two user modes which supposedly store 90 readings per user. Note that I did not take 180 readings, so this is unverified. After the reading, it displays systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse. It averages the BP after three successful BP readings but the AVERAGE recall is not marked as an average. Most monitors identify an average with the AVG notation. It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.  There is one large cuff provided that will fit most people. There are two power options available and INCLUDED and that is four AAA batteries or via a USB type C cable. Time settings are in the 24-hour clock (military time) only. Voice assist is available but it comes with a heavy Chinese accent.<br /><br />INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One BP unit<br /><br />- One BP User Manual and one digital pamphlet<br /><br />- One large cuff<br /><br />- One carry pouch<br /><br />- One USB Type C Cable and 4 AAA Batteries<br /><br />FEATURES<br />- Up to 90 numbers can be stored for each of two users in memory.<br /><br />- Date and time settings are available in 24-hour clock only.<br /><br />- Setting the date and time or selecting the user is a matter of using the set and memory buttons per the instruction manual.<br /><br />- The LCD Display readout is large for easy reading.<br /><br />- The cuff is 22 to 42 cm (8.66 to 16.535 inches), which is large enough for muscular arms or the slightly obese.<br /><br />- Clearing all the BP settings is just a matter of holding the MEM button for three seconds and then pressing the set button until ALL EE appears.<br /><br />- The display is large.<br /><br />- Accuracy is ERRs on the side of the low range compared to my gold standard monitors but is still acceptable.<br /><br />- Switching user modes is a longer process than other monitors. Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.<br /><br />- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.<br /><br />- The date and time settings are NOT remembered after the power is removed but the BP numbers are remembered  -- I tested after one minute of battery removal.<br /><br />- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />- It has an irregular heartbeat indicator.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- The accuracy is off by several points on the low side compared to my 5-star monitors.<br /><br />- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator.<br /><br />- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed. The big negative is that the accuracy is not as precise as my god standard monitors but is still within range, and the cuff is thin.<br /><br />Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.<br /><br />In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. There's an irregular heartbeat indicator.  The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.<br /><br />For those who are interested, I attached some notes about the other monitors I have tried.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KPQB2N Omron Series 5 Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors and one I purchased a few months ago on Amazon.

It was always higher at home then in a professional medical setting, and that should probably be the opposite. This is a nice compact cuff and we have USB outlets on the couch, so it’s easy to sit there and take a reading. The readings on this are much more in line with readings we get other places. This comes with four batteries also which makes it completely portable. Simple, and easy to use. The voice option was a little annoying, so we just turned it off. We’re happy. [SEP] This was a good blood pressure monitor. Neatly packaged with clear and visible measurements. It also has light measurement to show green to red ranges. The setup instructions were a little confusing for I was able to figure it. On/off was quick and you can set 2 profiles for measurements. This monitor also has a speaker function to call out your BP numbers. However, it had an accent which took a second for me to clearly hear the voice but it was nice and loud. [SEP] I’ve been using a wrist monitor for many years, mainly because the upper arm monitors can be so bulky and awkward to use.  This Antrolife machine is so easy and there’s only one tube which makes it perfect.  Actually, my doctor said he’d prefer if I used an upper arm machine.<br /><br />I like that the cuff is large enough for me.  There is no inconvenient power cord to worry about.  Needing to find a place to sit close enough to a wall plug always annoyed me with previous models.  Not so with this one.  A Battery, USB-C connection, and soft storage/travel bag are all included in the package.<br /><br />The readout is a large LED and backlit module.  I find I can depend on the accuracy. [SEP] This unit is light and easy to pull out and put away. The cuff is plenty wide enough that would fit various body build (me: 5'3 110, hub 6' 240). The measurement matches closely to what our normal ranges are.<br /><br />This unit can use both usb power and battery. We have only tried the battery setup as that provide the portable experience. The screen is well lit and the font is big, clearly displaying the result. It's a quality unit that helps us with self care during all the closures. [SEP] Using this to keep track just in case. Seems accurate compared to what is measured at doctors office. [SEP] I got the Antrolife AES-Ui121 for daily measurement of daily blood for my mom.  It came with everything one needs to get started right out of the box. The box came with detailed instructions along with how to use guiding pictures on the box. It contained a sleek rectangular white unit, with a large display that rests nicely on a flat surface at 45 degree angle. The box also comes with 4 AAA batteries and a USB cord to power the unit, a large high quality blood pressure cuff with a guide steel rod for circling the cuff around the arm, and a nice pouch to easily carry the unit.<br /><br />The blood pressure cuff is large and made up of quality material and it can fit most arms without difficulty. Once my mom learned how to wear the cuff, start and turn off the unit, it was easy for her to use it by herself without needing a help from someone else. The unit has very large, senior-citizen-friendly display screen with just 3 buttons – one for setup, one for start/stop, and one for memory.<br /><br />I really appreciated that it came with 4 AAA batteries, and it was made in USA. In addition, a note by the company in the box says they are part of campaign to plant several billion trees in USA and part of their revenue is donated for that purpose.<br /><br />My mom has used other machines but found this to be nicer, sharper to read, and easy to operate, and easy carry in the pouch while visiting her friends. [SEP] About two weeks ago, I was offered a free Antrolife's Blood Pressure Monitor for review via the Amazon Vine Program, and I accepted.<br /><br />My blood pressure (BP) has always been a little high.  It's great to be able to track it at home with a straightforward, compact, lightweight, easy-to-read, easy-to-use device like this.  It is SUPER easy to use.  The most difficult part is putting the arm cuff on, and that's easy!  Once you have the arm cuff in the correct position, slightly above the elbow, attach the hose to the main unit and press start.  The built in voice guidance is fairly good and understandable.  The cuff will inflate and your BP will register on the bright, crystal clear screen.  When the reading is all done, the unit will read the results aloud and give you a prognosis.  Depending on what you're shooting for, your interpretation of the numbers may be a little different than what it says though.<br /><br />The unit itself is lightweight, but feels like it's well made.  I like the clean design a lot, too.  The edges are all rouned so it's easy to handle and hold.  The LED screen is super crystal clear and easy to read... in fact, I'm not 100% certain, but I think it may be OLED.  There are four rubber feet on the bottom along with the the speaker.  The cuff is easy to insert and remove.  The design is great.<br /><br />It comes with a nice little carry case that fits the main unit, the arm cuff and a USB-A to USB-C cable for using it without batteries (and it includes 4xAAA batteries).<br /><br />Overall, it is an excellent quality device at an incredible price point.  I gotta say that at this price, everyone should have one of these along with a fingertip blood oxygen monitor and maybe even one of the new ECG (EKG) readers.  Take charge of your health.  The first step is knowing your readings.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Just a little side note:  One of the most important things in taking an accurate BP reading is to be relaxed.  If you look up info on the proper procedure, you're really not supposed to be doing any activity for at least 10 to 15 minutes prior to the reading and certainly you wouldn't take a BP reading for hours after any strenuous excercise.  BP is very sensitive to both physical activity and stress.  IMO the best time to do it is when you're relaxing at home, maybe even just prior to going to bed.  When you put the cuff on, try to stay calm and let it do it's thing.  You can throw off a reading by a lot just by being tense. [SEP] I love this blood pressure monitor and how easy it is to use. The cuff is comfortable and the reading numbers are big and easy to read. I also love that the display is backlit and that the system also has a voice assistant function. The only reason that I gave this 4 stars instead of a 5, is because they advertise that it includes a 36 month extended guarantee. However both the box that it came in and the literature inside the box state that it only includes a 12 month warranty. [SEP] When I first started monitoring my blood pressure the machines were so expensive but now they are very affordable.  I can't comment on the price of this unit because its currently not available but I can comment on the reliability of the numbers it put up.  The numbers are big and this unit has a back light on the display that allows you to see it well.  It comes with a USB-C cord, a battery and a carrying case, the case is great if you decide to travel with it.  The cuff on this unit says it will fit just about anyone it says it fit from 10cm to 50cm, nope I have a very big arm and it barely fit me.  My suggestion would be to measure your arm prior to purchasing a blood pressure cuff.",3,True
"Electric Foot Callus Remover Kit, JAZZZNAP Rechargeable Foot File Professional Pedicure Tools with 3 Roller Heads for Dead, Hard Cracked Dry Skin, 2 Speed, White",[],[],,4.4,27,8628,"Just burns when i use it! Maybe if my pain tolerance was higher i could try but too painful for me! [SEP] As a drum sander like roller, this thing works well to sand down my calluses and get my feet feeling smooth. It's honestly good that they use a USB charging cable that's more standard than something proprietary.<br /><br />Unfortunately it is the older micro USB standard and not USB C.<br /><br />I wonder what will happen when I run out of the rolls and need to get a refill since those aren't listed unless I missed something.<br /><br />The roller itself could use a very slight increase in length but it's serviceable as is. [SEP] I absolutely love this callus remover. I actually did my whole feet and it took all the dead skin off. My feet felt like a baby’s butt. I had to do my husbands feet after mine just so he could feel the difference and it took his calluses off and made his feet feel so smooth. Definitely worth the money [SEP] I use this in conjunction with a foot file, and foot repair cream lotion and they all work so well. This works very well and comes with 3 different rollers that are easily interchangeable. It is a nice weight and works well without hurting your feet although it does tickle quite a bit in my opinion so be warned. If your feet are gross rough and cracked like mine i definitely recommend this device! [SEP] My husband's heels are so tough and thick  and this thing seems to be a match for them. A LOT of skin came off when I only focused on his heel. I thought it may be particles from the sander part itself, but it seems to stay intact and is still very rough, so I'm sure it's his skin. After a couple of treatments, his heel is much softer. I also was able to get something out of his heel that has been in there for a long time. It would take a long time to do the entire foot, even both feet! I guess it's better that it's gentle and slow, but one will really have to work at it to get the whole foot smooth if it's in a really bad state. We will continue to use [SEP] Perfect foot sander!<br />The 3 heads all work well depending on what your needs are<br />Battery life is great and we get multiple uses out of each charge<br />Unit is easy to hold and operate<br />Plenty of power to tackle the worst foot [SEP] I use it tonight I really like it, It came charge and I didn't have to plug it to use it. Has 3 roll I use the white one it seem less abrasive. My feel somewhat soft and not hard. I dont like getting pedicure as I dont like it when they use the file thing as it bugs me. I decided to get this to try if I be ok with it and yes it didn't bug or hurt me. I wasn't sure I would like it but guess I am gonna use it for when my heels need a little attention. Wasn't that loud and pretty easy to maneuver.  I don't have much of hard or crack skin so I didn't use it long and saw a slight difference but I'm sure for people who have hard skin it may be a wonderful tool to have. I will be getting one for a family member who I feel would like this as they have difficulties with their heels being rough and looking dry. I believe it would be a gift that would be useful for her. [SEP] I wanted to give this tool a try because I've been using a manual one and it's not the easiest thing to use. After using it a few times and getting the hang of it I have to say, it works quite well.<br /><br />The only negative thing I have to say about this tool is that it takes a very long time to charge up. Their listing states it takes 4-5 hours to charge and the initial charge for me was just over 4 hours. To me that seems like a long time to charge something so small but on the positive side, I haven't had to charge it up since the initial charge. I haven't even noticed the motor getting slower after using it a handful of times.<br /><br />I love how they include three different rollers with different degrees of roughness. The roughest roller is used for aged stubborn dead skin, the medium head for normal dead skin, and the finest roller head is used for daily care of the feet.<br /><br />The tool is very light and easy to hold in the hand making it very easy to use. If too much pressure is applied while using the tool it will stop working to protect your skin, which is a great feature. I'm not sure how long these rollers will last but I did see that there are replacement rollers that can be purchased. A quick search shows there's a few different versions which should work with this model.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with this callus remover especially because it's so much easier to use than the manual one I have. I do wish it didn't take 4-5 hours to charge but it does last quite a while once charged. Do read the manual before using because there's helpful information inside. [SEP] Easy to use foot file with helpful directions and comes with three different roller heads. The tool is comfortable to hold, has two speeds, and is easy to maneuver around the foot. Charges quickly. I also use a moisturizing foot cream afterwards to get my skin even smoother, as is recommended in the directions. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:f084d52c41c165473a1c5a6a95be5e59]] Imagine charging this all day, unplugging it and then using it the next day just for it to die within 5 minutes. It's taken me 2 days to do my feet and they still arent done because this tool can't hold a charge.",3,True
Viva Naturals Glucosamine with Chondroitin and MSM; 240 Capsules,[],[],,4.4,709,420,"great price, works as expected [SEP] as advertised [SEP] I have used these for about 2 months now and I  really like them, I have had a torn  rotator cuff and these help some with the pain as well as some exercise to keep it fluid! I just do not want surgery as I know of a friend of mine who had the rotator operated on and it really did not help! I will keep taking these and see in another month how I do. I'll come back and update then! [SEP] I've been taking these for years. I've been recommending them for years. Those that take my advice keep reminding me months later what a knee miracle it is. 2-3 days does the trick.<br /><br />Painful knees? This is the interim fix before you fold to the orthopedist. [SEP] Hubs swears by this stuff.  He used to always complain about his neck being stiff and sore and says it's been fine for a long time since taking Viva Glucosamine every day.  He even asked me to put it on regular re-fill order.  I take it when I can remember too and it seems to help my crackling knees. [SEP] I started taking this supplement about 2 weeks ago.  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, as well as Osteoarthritis in both knees.  Recently, I have developed tendonitis in both shoulders, so I thought I'd try this.<br /><br />It gave me the absolute WORST HEARTBURN ever!  I try to stay away from heartburn medications, but Pepcid is my &#34;go to&#34; for occasional hb relief, but even this would not relieve it!<br /><br />I will not buy again, nor would I recommend it to anyone. [SEP] See disclaimer below:<br /><br />This Glucosamine Chondroitin MSM combination is great! I wanted to try it because I have a lot of joint pain and am seeking a diagnosis for Ehler's Danlos, a connective tissues disorder, so I'm trying to find things that will support joint health and maybe help relieve a little of the back and knee pain I experience. I know that this company has really high-quality products and I've been very pleased with this one. The gelatin capsules are so much easier to take than the big pills I've bought over the counter in the past and there is very little smell and no taste. I have to take a lot of medicine already so that is a huge plus for me. It also helps cartilage health, immune system, and hair, skin, and nails. So it covers a lot which I appreciate. Less supplements to take is always better in my book. I highly recommend this product, especially for the joint health as I have begun to notice a difference in my knees particularly. [SEP] Glucosamine from Viva Labs is an excellent product with triple strength, I am so happy I got this product at an excellent price of 2.99 and free shipping, it is unbeatable. Try it and you will experience the difference. [SEP] Great product i thought the bottle was glass not plastic. But i love that its not easy to break and looks very expensive. Easy to swallow.

As far as the bovine-sourced Collagen goes, this is one of the best in regards to taste and gummies are very convenient to take.

Also, I didn't feel any different while taking these, my energy level didn't change.<br /><br />Frankly, I'd rather just take a pill. If you hate pills and are vitamin b deficient, you might like these more than I did. [SEP] I’ve tried most flavors from this brand and overall I really like them all. The b complex isn’t my favorite flavor but I’ve never had a liquid B complex not have a bit of aftertaste. This is the most palatable one I’ve had. I notice a difference in my day if I skip this. Love the company, packaging and feel their products are very affordable and convenient. [SEP] I am a long time fan of liquid B complex and I can attest to almost immediate effect when taking my normal brand which I usually take in a 1CC sublingual dose a few days a week. No miracle, just a little boost of energy, usually in the afternoon allowing me to push through the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately after using a week's worth of these capsules I can't say that they worked (or didn't).  I cannot say that they didn't provide ANY benefit but they definitely did not do what I normally get from similar products, give a little burst of energy.  I didn't feel a thing, which doesn't mean that it didn't provide some of the benefits of B vitamins to my body, it just didn't do anything that I could feel or measure.<br /><br />This is to me the equivalent of taking B vitamins in pill form.  You know they probably do something but you can't say for sure.  The whole point of taking sublingual B complex is the immediate and noticeable effects.  Did you get that with these. [SEP] I love that these come in individual little servings so they are more portable and sanitary than carrying around a full bottle. The suppliment works great and I can definitely feel an energy boost when I take it but boy is it awfully sweet!  I suppose sweet is better than tasting like earwax or something, so Ill take it... but it is definitely sweet,<br /><br />I will definitely order again and I do recommend this suppliment. [SEP] I love the delivery system. Its quick to take and convenient enough to throw in your purse and take anytime. Great alternative to big oversized pills or sugary gummies. I also like that this product is vegan and free from soy, gluten, dairy, GMO’s, and has no artificial ingredients.<br /><br />I am not fond of the smell or the flavor. The packaging suggest it is strawberry flavored but the smell is off putting and it’s almost tasteless. I also wished the twist tubes had some kind of labeling on them. It’s hard to swallow drops from un-named tubes but it was a little reassuring reading that this product was made in the USA in a FDA registered facility. I didn’t experience any change in energy but I think it did help my mood. [SEP] I really like this. I love taking B complex when I need energy or I'm feeling low. This is a great way to carry it with me. [SEP] This is the weirdest thing. It smells pretty bad. When you are opening the tubes it’s gross and you can smell it for awhile. The scent? I can’t place my finger on it. It might be wet dog?  Really can’t say, but once mixed it’s ok. Somehow it has a decent fruit flavor that’s agreeable in plain water or juice or whatnot. It’s convenient with its little tube that is resealable, and see thru to judge if these’s liquid left in it.<br /> I recommend for anyone who likes vitamins in liquid / soluble form. I would have given more stars but the smell is to much to go unnoticed. [SEP] The size is what’s best about this product. I prefer and usually take my vitamin b from a ""max dose"" dropper but more often than not I forget. These can be easily stashed just about anywhere and work great as backups or for on the go.<br /><br />I have a hand full in my backpack and they’ve come in handy numerous times. [SEP] I been taking it for a month now and I think it does work. I haven't felt any side effects from it, so I would recommend it",3,True
"Shower Steamers Aromatherapy Gift Set Pack of 6 - Mother's Day Gifts for Mom - Shower Bombs Include Natural Eucalyptus Lavender Fragrances,for Stress Relief,Great Gift for Men and Women",[],[],,3.9,70,6150,"My box says ""showen steamers."" So that sort of negates these being gift quality IMO. There are 3 menthol/eucalyptus and 3 lavender. They are individually wrapped and the set includes a tiny plastic device to cut through the wrappers and a tiny purple bag to place the steamer inside while in the shower. The bag is more the sort you use for gifting jewelry. I recently tried some other steamers and the mesh bag was far more appropriate for the product.<br />The steamers themselves are nice. The colours themselves give the impression of gentleness. I could smell them through the box. I placed a steamer in my (other) mesh bag and placed the steamer at the edge of the shower water. There was a pleasant release of steamer scents during the shower. Easy to clean up. At the current listed price, these are on the pricey side. [SEP] Very fragrant shower steamers!<br /><br />Long lasting, usually last through two showers.<br /><br />Beautifully wrapped! Perfect to give as a gift or keep for yourself to enjoy.<br /><br />Beware, there's a major spelling error right on the front of the box, they call it a showen steamer not shower.<br /><br />Would have given a 5 if the box contained more at this price point, and the bad labeling.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful. [SEP] I love these shower steamers.  I feel like I'm getting a spa treatment.  I find the scents to be pleasant and relaxing!  They also make great gifts. [SEP] The best part about this product is the presentation: It comes as a set of six individually wrapped tablets on a very nice box. One caveat is the box reads ""Showen Steamers"" and not Shower Steamers, which I take is the name of the Product as this apparent misspell also appears on their product pictures. Minor detail but worth mentioning<br /><br />The instructions tells you to don't put them under a direct stream of water but at the same time they have the name bomb on the product and show a lady on a bathtub. This is confusing as these tablets are clearly not bombs but just a way to make your shower smell good and have some nice smelling vapor while you shower. Using it as a bath bomb will be a failure and not the intention of the product, but I can see some people will use it this way, with the expected poor results<br /><br />Smell is good but very faint, and it will depend on how sensitive you're are to perfumes. If you get allergies or are easily affected by any fragrant -like me- you will like these steamers. In the other hand, if you're looking for a strong perfume and long lasting fragrance, these are not for you [SEP] Melted very fast! Not much aroma [SEP] These shower steamers only smell good in the box. Great scent, but I could smell little to nothing while showering, as compared to other shower bombs I have used.  If you like light scent, then this might be for you. [SEP] These last way longer than others on the market. [SEP] It comes with six shower steamers: three lavender scents and three eucalyptus scents, a sheer purple sachet bag, and a small hanger. The scents are very fragrant and smell amazing. Per instructions, these shower steamers should not be placed directly under water, rather they should be placed more to the side. I am currently still using one tablet and so far it has lasted a whole week. [SEP] These are nice shower steamers- not the strongest smelling I’ve used but definitely adds a nice effect to the shower. At the price they are definitely worth the purchase for yourself. However, I can’t recommend these as a gift since the box says “showen steamer.” I would be embarrassed to give it as a gift with the typo personally. If it doesn’t bother you though they would be a nice gift otherwise. [SEP] I am totally head over heals infatuated with these shower steamers! The aromatherapy touch it gifts me when I step in a hot stream of water is not only pleasantly pleasing to my sense of smell, but it is lavishly inviting to the body.",3,True
"Tattle Natural Pre-Workout Powder - All Natural, Nootropics, Nitric Oxide & Organic Caffeine for Focus, Endurance & Energy, Natural Flavors, Monk Fruit Sweetened, No Stevia (Berry Hibiscus, 30 Serve)",[],[],,3.1,26,1604,"NO2 supplements with all the added ingredients are a definite boost. This formulation includes some primo ingredients. Quite happy with the assay.<br /><br />Better than advertised. Tastes fine. [SEP] I think this mix did give me a little extra energy the other day when I had two tennis practices nearly back to back.  I have tried this mix several times and though I haven't noticed a jolt in energy, I didn't get overly fatigued either, especially while playing in the hot sun.  It mixes well with plain water though it seems to settle out a little bit if left to sit in the glass for a while.  The flavor is not all that good - it has a strong, almost bitter flavor that I don't really care for.  I have since started mixing this with another electrolyte mix that has a sweeter and more pleasant flavor.  I like the combination and it really keeps my electrolyte level up when sweating and exercising in the heat. [SEP] I've reviewed a lot of pre-workout supplements over the years and I'm always amazed by how few of them want to admit that their primary boost is caffeine. The next question is how much caffeine is included, which they almost never acknowledge in light of the daily recommended amount (400 milligrams, in case you're wondering). Tattle gets props for listing the amount in the ingredients.<br /><br />130 mg for one scoop is a little more than one-fourth of what's healthy for you, so this is a significant boost -- not counting any tea or coffee or soda you drink during the day. I'm sensitive to caffeine so I only take a teaspoon and that's plenty of energy for me.<br /><br />The bigger problem is how dry it tastes. I'm guessing it's the ""dash of Monk Fruit for a tart, berry flavor."" I'm not a fan. Still, I mix it with the rest of my shake in the morning and although the taste was initially a shock I've gotten over it. [SEP] This preworkout tasted good and mixes easily into my preworkout shake. I has a noticeable boost of energy and focus during my workout and hit a new best of 32 minutes of in the zone training during my workout. I am happy with this product. [SEP] It does as labeled and it taste good. Is a good pre-workout and I definitely recommend it [SEP] Sometimes products meet right in the middle with their quality and usability. I have used ""sweet"" preworkouts in the past, but most of them use terrible ingredients as artificial sweeteners. I am personally a fan of stevia and think that it may have been an ingredient that was missing with this. That said, I can't be sure because I have NO idea what this is SUPPOSED to taste like.<br /><br />Let's start with monk fruit, which is an ideal sweetener. However in this case there either is not enough or what is enough is countered by some of the taste of the nootropics and other preworkout ingredients. Would the addition of stevia helped this? Would those who are for whatever reason opposed to stevia had been more open to this had there been a better taste because of it?<br /><br />I am not sure, but I do wish that there was a better flavor for this as the ingredients ARE good and they DO help once you choke it down....but I am not willing to choke something like this down when there are numerous alternatives on the market. [SEP] This is a great energy booster for a good Workout. I inadvertently took it too late last night and slept terribly. I figured it out late into the night. Haha!<br />  Get your blood flowing and boost your Energy and Focus. This has all Natural Flavors,Sweeteners and is good for Vegans too. I’m still waiting for Tattle to post their Testing and Manufacturing processes but, I have to say I enjoy their products and hope they add that information in the near future.<br />  Enjoy and Stay Healthy Everyone!😁 [SEP] [[VIDEOID:8fa932d41331e1789a697562db34d8cc]] I have started working out more and I study on a regular basis as well, so I needed something for my mind and body. I needed all the energy I can get, and I like that it has lions mane mushroom in it.<br />Pros:<br />*It does give me energy and I feel like I can mental process things faster. I like it better than coffee that gives me energy but also comes with the coffee jitters and this one doesn't.<br />* The color is beautiful to say the least. It looks like it has pink glitter in it or something and I keep wondering what that can be from. If you look at the video, I posted you can see the shimmer and swirl. No, it doesn't affect the inner workings of it but it does make it aesthetically pleasing.<br />*My favorite part- It is only 5 calories per scoop. This is great because the less calories I add the better since we know a lot of our calories are gained through liquids.<br />*It uses green tea extract as its caffeine source. I drink green tea sometimes and this seems to give me more energy, so I am not sure the energy boast comes only from the caffeine or if it is from everything combined. However, I like the effects without that crash that this gives me.<br />Cons:<br />*The flavor is just not good to me. I feel like a child taking medicine every time I drink it. The flavor is just so similar to a medicinal flavor that I started drinking it with a straw. Not horrible but not enjoyable or anything. (minus a star for flavor).<br />*Less of a con and more of an annoyance but the minerals and ingredients keep settling at the bottom if I don't drink it all right away. I have to keep stirring it every time I drink it to make sure it is evenly mixed before consuming.<br />Conclusion:<br />*I would recommend it because I did feel like it gave me more energy, but the taste is just what i couldn't take when drinking it. I understand all the things it has in it though and next to the protein powders and bars and wheat grass and everything else I have been adding this is in the same ballpark. I do like the energy from it though and the fact that it is 5 calories per scoop.<br /> Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. [SEP] The first time I tried this product, it tasted really bitter and didn't do anything for me. I thought it was a fluke and that perhaps it was because I had just brushed my teeth. The lack of energy I chalked it up to me simply being extra tired.<br /><br />However, I have since revisited the product again just a few days ago and I couldn't even finish it. I took two sips and it was like drinking the rind of a grapefruit. Super bitter. Yes, hibiscus is bitter, but not to the point of tasting like rind. The flavor is supposed to be berry hibiscus, but there isn't any hibiscus or berry flavor. Also, this pre-workout is supposed to be sweetened with monk fruit, but there's not a hint of sweetness anywhere. This product isn't tart, it's bitter.<br /><br />Lastly, I didn't get any energy from taking this product... at all. Usually I'm sensitive to caffeine and can only get away with drinking half a scoop of a pre-workout, regardless of brand. Anything over half a scoop leaves me feeling like a jittery, anxious mess. This product however did absolutely nothing for me at all.<br /><br />Based on my experience I would have given this product 1 star, however, I really like their ingredients list and how simple and natural it seems to be, bumping up my rating to 2.5 stars because I like more natural formulas and products. [SEP] The boost of energy I got from the pre-workout pushed me through my workout. I liked that I didn’t feel jittery like I have with other products I’ve tried. The flavor isn’t the smoothest but it does the job!",3,True

All the rollers seem sturdy and have certainly survived my Kids for playing with it. In terms of their actual use, it's a really comprehensive set for all aches, muscles pains, and hard-to-reach spots. Would definitely recommend it! [SEP] My wife loves this!<br />She uses it on her legs quite a bit... even when her legs AREN'T bothering her.<br />It is lightweight, easy to use, has a snug fit, and the round discs are not made of hard plastic (they appear to be of a very firm -but spongy- foam that gives a deep massage without rubbing you the wrong way.<br /><br />Highly recommend this massager [SEP] This massage roller makes legs massage much easier.  The roller are good quality and very easy to roll.  It fits better for medium or large size people.  The roller is a bit loose for calves, but very good for Legs muscle. So, depends on size and which part of body you need to massage more often, this massage roller can be very helpful. [SEP] This massage tool is interesting in that it uses counter pressure to wrap around your body part (arm / leg) to squeeze and roll-rub the tissue. I've used this a few times and have come to the conclusion that it works very well to rub the calf muscles, especially if you struggle with leg cramps like Charly Horses. This helps circulate blood flow to all the right areas and help overall soreness. I do see a potential problem for some folks with this if they have very big / thick calfs, thighs or arms. Call it fat arms or legs, or muscly - whatever your body structure - it may not work for you as this tool only pulls apart so far to be able to wrap around your leg or arm. This tool is easy to use on either leg, but I found it hard to use on a single arm as it requires arms to operate up and down...or someone doing it for you. [SEP] This works better than I thought it would.  You have to get a little creative about how to use it in a particular area, e.g. it's a little hard on the shins but that's easy to work around.  The rollers give a bit -- they are made of a high-density foam.  The frame provides a reasonable amount of pressure that you can easily adjust with your hand.<br /><br />I got this mostly for my calves.  The first time I used this the experience was quite painful -- I had knots in my calves that I hadn't been aware of.  Over the next few days, just using this once a day, things got better.  I've also tried it on my upper legs and my forearms, just to see if it would work, and it did.<br /><br />I don't know how well this would work if you have a lot of fat on you, but if you're fairly lean, it works great. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:679a599be50ae0dcfe62f1d6acb2fdec]] This is a cheap alternative to get a soft tissue massage at home. The massager is lightweight, the rollers are soft but firm. The arch is flexible so I can apply the right amount of pressure for each body part. I mostly use this on my legs after I jog and it helps relieve muscle pain and cramps. I have chronic neck pain so I tried to massage that area too but there isn't enough range of motion to get an effective massage around the neck. I tried it on my arms and I was suprized by how easy it is to navigate the massager with one hand. I though I would need my husband's help but I can do it by myself. I recommend using it right after working out while the muscles are still warm. Otherwise the massage can be painful. Once you figure out where to position the rollers and how much pressure you want to apply, there shouldn't be any discomfort. [SEP] This roller is great for working out stiffness and muscle pain.  It does hurt to use it.  But you get that hurt that helps!  I used it on my calves.  But it was a little too much for my boney lower leg.  It was much better with lightweight leggings on.  I was able to roll it up and down and then change directions and roll sideways.  It has two handles on the sides and one on the top.  I found I was able to roll it on my upper arms by holding one side handle and the top handle.  I was able to roll it all the way around my arm.  I am hoping this also works kind of like a fascia roller.  I have cellulite on my arms that I hate.  Time will tell on that part.  This felt the best on my thighs.  So much more relaxed muscles afterwards.  I even rolled this up and down my lower back.  You don't get the same deep massage because of the way it's made.  But it does help.  I could roll it up and down my hip as well.  I get very painful hips.  This seemed to work out some of the pain.  It's so simple.  But, it does help. [SEP] This roller is amazing for my forearms. It fits my forearms well. Very easy to use. Just place on your leg, or put arm between the rollers and pressed down. I wanted a deeper massage on my arm so I just push it against a couch moving it up and down, and that did the trick. No need to have someone else press down for me. I have only used it for a few days and already feel relief.",3,True

[SEP] Absolutely love this trimmer. It's sleek and ergonomic, easy to hold and manipulate into trimming edges. Battery is very nice compared to others I've used. The only complaint I have from it is the guards for the beard trimmer pinch my hairs and pull them out. At first, it did it ALOT but now I know how to detect it before it pulls it out. Granted, I have thick, curly beard hair, but it does snag one or two just about on every run through. Other than that, it gets the job done nicely. [SEP] Great item [SEP] Arrived quickly and packaged securely.  I have had a lot of these types of clippers.  This one is by far the best I have owned.  I like the accessories/charger base.  The main thing I like is, if you look at the picture you can see the long black button close to the cutting head, this is a slide type button to adjust the depth to 3 different short cuts without using the guards.  A lot of power to cut and the charge lasted a long time.  The silver round button gives you the option of locking it on cruise control or just pressing the button to cut and release and press to cut again. [SEP] The razor is nice but some of the attachments won't attach rendering it junk. [SEP] Sending back.  This thing pulled my beard hair like crazy. Also I can't get a couple of the attachments to clip on.  I see some other people have the same issues so the quality control must be no good. [SEP] Not sure how this has so many 5 star reviews, I bought it based on those recommendations and now I'm sure those top reviews were bought and paid for. Partly my fault I suppose, I should have done my research and realized that this is a cheap, Chinese made piece of garbage and that those reviews were likely written by people who are paid by the company.<br /><br />For starters, this thing feels really cheap and poorly constructed. Switching attachments can be tricky, you almost have to force them into place. And speaking of the attachments, they're crap as well. The nose hair trimmer and beard trimmer literally do not work at all. The other trimmers are constantly pulling at my beard as I try to trim it, it's extremely annoying. Will be returning this and I'd advise anyone else to avoid it. Go with a reputable brand, not this knock off Chinese trash. [SEP] Not as great as the reviews say. [SEP] Quiet and works well.

Wow! What a difference. This reduces the overall noise level to protect your hearing, yet you can still hear with enough definition to have a conversation with someone and understand what they are saying (assuming they’re speaking loudly of course). With the other kind, everything sounds muffled, so you can’t really do that. Added bonus: these are so comfortable. I’ve never worn earplugs as comfortable as these. There’s no pressure or ear ache at all! Best earplugs I’ve ever used. No wonder they have a special little carrying case. [SEP] My daughter plays snare drum in her marching band and she teaches drum in her teacher's studio so there's a lot of loud harmful noise that needs to be greatly reduced so she won't lose any hearing or develop tinnitus later in life.  She likes these earplugs and says they are definitely 5 stars.  They fit in her ears well, cut down on a lot of damaging frequencies and are comfortable to wear. [SEP] These are definitely not as magical as it might sound in the description- while the sound reproduction on these are pretty good, these are not as great as some of the higher end options I've tried in higher price ranges.<br /><br />Listening to music through these headphones, the volume is reduced significantly, as you'd hope for, but you're definitely losing detail, particularly in the mids and bass. Highs remain pretty strong, but the rest of the music definitely becomes more muddy, and the overall effect is almost like listening to music through the wall from the next room. [SEP] They don't seem to stay in place for me. Not sure if its a size, shape, or material thing. My other ear plugs aren't ""glossy"" smooth, and seem to stay in place better.<br /><br />They don't seem to cancel a LOT of sound... but that means what I do hear is clearer than what I hear with my ""better working"" ear plugs.<br /><br />The container is nice, but since its metal and bulky, it won't get used on my motorcycle key chain. But I'll find a use for it.<br /><br />With that said... everyone's ear are different. Everyone has different needs and expectations. This is a great set of 3 different types of plugs... so its a great place to start ""trying something new"" to see if they work for you/your needs. [SEP] These ear plugs are the best I've ever tried for high noise areas. Ive used them at a concert where I was working, not attending, and on an airplane. they were comfortable and dulled the noise to a very comfortable level. I love the waterproof carrying case too. I got an extra pair for a friend who is an airline pilot, after a few trips he told me that they have come an essential item in his work flight bag. High praise. [SEP] These are great for concerts. They are comfortable and they block some of the sound to take the edge off, but don't distort and muffle it like some earplugs do. [SEP] They definitely muffle the sound and I can see where they'd be helpful at a concert but in my living room with my hard of hearing husband, it's not enough. The sound is good/clear but a little less than normal [SEP] Flexible and comfortable. Reduced noise adequately. [SEP] I like these Zilly ear plugs okay.  They do a good job of making painfully loud events bearable and not painful.  I got them after going to a concert several months ago that was so loud I couldn't enjoy it.  These will be effective to avoid that situation next time.  As far as fidelity and clarity, they're so-so.  They are better than a pair of foam earplugs that just muffle and dampen everything, but they're not noticeably great on clarity and the claims of high fidelity seem exaggerated to me.  Overall they're good for sound reduction but only fair on sound quality. [SEP] My husband works in nightlife, so by default, he's always surrounded by very loud sounds. Normally he uses those disposable foam ear plugs, but I wanted to get him something more sturdy. These are great as they still allow him to hear some things but help protect his hearing.",3,True

We love peanut butter flavored anything. I'd even try a soda flavored with it. The bars were slightly small but that kept calories. . . reasonable. Plenty of energy and help me feel full. A little melty in Florida heat so maybe not perfect for summer hiking. Definitely good taste! [SEP] These are actually really tasty.  I use them for a quick breakfast on a busy day and honestly they keep me full until lunch.  I also like these for those exhausting workout sessions.  Perfect for and all day hike also.  Taste is like a peanut butter cup with a smooth chew texture.  Easy to break into 1 hour portions if your on a grueling day and want to portion this out.  Great protien content and calorie ratio.  This is a real winner [SEP] We got the double peanut butter flavor.  My husband and I split one so we could each sample the product.  To me it tastes just a little bit like a Snickers.  Very good.  Easy to chew and swallow.  Nice taste.<br />My husband promptly took the rest of the box off my hands and said that he wants the rest of them.<br />I recommend these bars because they are made by a reputable company, taste good and have ingredients that are good for you. [SEP] I loved the peanut-y flavor but it can be too caloric, 210 calories per 5 bites sounds a little to much to me. If you dont care about it, go for it, tastes amazing. [SEP] These are not candy bars, but endurance bars and one should not eat it like candy, but use it when exercising.  Although, they taste so good (I really like the chocolate and peanut butter) you could eat more than is necessary.  I enjoyed the taste of these as I have had other Clif products that I didn’t care for.  Being a runner, these will certainly come in handy. [SEP] My son bikes to school, takes gym and after school sports, and bikes home. He is super active and sometimes has difficulty sustaining energy. I gave him these and they helped him stay up during the day. He usually eats a bar around 9:00 or 9:30 am and that keeps him going until lunch/ He has another energy snack around 3 as well. [SEP] So opened one of these today and was pleasantly surprised at the taste.  First of all it's moist, so unlike some other bars, your jaws don't get a workout trying to eat it.  The taste (even though the bars were warm) was quite nice and it really does have a nice peanut taste and peanut butter texture to it.  There's also a hint of salt to keep things lively in the taste bud department and to give it a balanced taste.  They only downside is that these are extremely ""moreish"" and you'll want to practice good self control to stop having a 2nd or 3rd one if you're hungry.  Even though there's 210 calories per bar, there's 6G of protein and the bars are also certified organic.  I just wish they had a GF version. [SEP] I'll be honest. I never buy stuff like this of my own volition. Just seems like it's intended for other people, like I'm not the targeted consumer.<br /><br />These, however, are quite nice and will find their way on my shopping list from time to time I'm sure.<br /><br />Adequately sized bar proportioned into soft and chewy NOT CUBE sections - why sections? It's so gooey it flops about while you're eating it, sections are pointless - manage to be quite pliant without being sticky, and the whole thing is made up of stuff that a creative person in their kitchen could whip up with a food processor in a few minutes. Nothing gratuitously over-processed or refined. Just simple and enjoyable.<br /><br />Flavor is great, I often found myself eating more than one at a go and had to train myself to nibble at the CLEARLY RECTANGULAR SECTIONS so that I didn't just gobble them all.<br /><br />As to energy? Meh. No comment. I've already got plenty of energy, I just like to snack.<br /><br />Give'em a try. [SEP] Pros: soft and chewy!<br />easily digestible<br />Small and compact<br />Super delicious<br /><br />Cons: only con is that they can make the wrapper fold over so it would stick and you then can reseal the bar. [SEP] I have a busy lifestyle. I have 2 kids under 5, a full time job AND I squeeze a workout in almost every week day. So a QUICK and EASY energy bar is my JAM. I like this one but I am trying to watch what I eat(especially my sugar intake) and I don't workout more than 30 min a day which means I am not able to justify all the extra carbs this bar provides. BUT - if you need a quick and easy pick me up after a hard day at work and before a quick 30 min workout in the evening, a couple of these cubes will give you the energy you need. I split the bar with my husband on days I need the energy and i am able to complete my workout without stopping in between. I wont have this as a pre workout every time i workout though. The sugar and calorie are super high for my lifestyle. This may be OK for a very active,athletic teenager. 4 stars.",3,True

No chalky or gritty taste like some gummy vitamins. I only had the 7 day bottle, so i can't say if it made a difference in my skin or anything, but i wouldn't doubt it would if taken longer term. I love all tula products i have tried!! [SEP] Really like these.  I hate to swallow a pill, so gummies are perfect.  These contain Biotin, Folate, Vitamin C, organic inulin and active strains of Bascillus Coagulan -- plus organic fruit extracts.  Vegan, with NO artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, preservatives, soy or gluten.  Very palatable.  During this time of Covid-19, anything that promotes better health appeals to me.<br /><br />Instructions are to take these at night with food.  I take these with my supper.  No digestive issues or side effects.<br /><br />Cons:  none [SEP] This actually is the best tasting vitamin type gummy I ever had and I’ve tried a ton of diff gummies. Some are too sweet or has a sugar coating or taste too dry. This one is sweet but not too sweet. It’s perfect. The only issue I have  is the bottle only has 14 pieces! It’s a tiny bottler. Also the directions doesn’t say if I should take one or two a day? So I have no idea and been taking just one. I wish they would update that. [SEP] I love this brand and have used numerous products from them. This is the first product I've tried from this brand that hasn't completely blown me away. For one you only get a week supply which is pretty lousy for a biotin vitamin even a gummy. The other is that the taste is not great. I've tried countless biotin gummies and other vitamin gummies in the past and this is definitely the worst. It's not instantly terrible but it does have that cherry cough syrup taste that seems to intensify after you've already eaten them. The other thing is that you absolutely must take these with food. I usually like to take my biotin gummies in the evening and if I haven't eaten recently they will make me feel sick. So all in all I don't think I would repurchase these again but I still do love the brand. [SEP] I love me a good gummy vitamin! These vitamins are very sweet. The consistency is a bit sticky which  is probably because they're all natural. No gluten, soy, preservatives, no artificial sweeteners etc. I've seen and tried many vitamins for hair, skin and nails but I'm quite impressed that these also have the added benefits of the superfoods and probiotics. [SEP] I like these gummies! Before this one, I was trying out some other ones and it felt like I was chewing on taffy. It kept getting stuck on my teeth. This was easy to bite through and chew without worrying about it getting stuck. It has all the similar ingredients to promote hair, skin and nail health to make them stronger. And it has probiotics to keep my gut healthy. [SEP] These Tula probiotic gummies not only taste amazing but I noticed after a few days that my nails grew quicker and stronger and my skin looks brighter. [SEP] Tastes amazing!! I needed something for my hair skin and nails and I just ran out of my probiotic  so this was meant to be! I will definitely be getting more! [SEP] I got the 14 count - 7 day supply to try out. These vitamin gummies are pretty smooth to chew, unlike some that just break into chunks. I found the taste to be fine, not great - like a cheap fruit snack.<br /><br />It is recommended to take both gummies at once, in the evening, with food. I followed this most days. On the day that I did not take them with food, I had some stomach issues. BUT I'm not a fan of having to eat later in the evening, especially not right before I go to sleep - which is when I typically take my vitamins.<br /><br />Also, by about day 5 I was getting a pretty significant breakout on my face and this was the only change in my routine (no different foods, skincare, cleaning, etc). I can only tie it back to these. For that, I probably won't be continuing these and will look for other vitamins. [SEP] The flavor is good without an after taste. Has probiotics",3,True

The fragrances are, orange, lavender, frankincense, rosemary, mint, lemongrass, vanilla, seasalt, kiwi, rose, coconut, and papaya.<br /><br />I tried the papaya. When it was first plunged into the water (see video) there was fizz and no suds. Before I could even put the foot bath onto the floor to bathe my feet, the entire bomb fizzed out and dissolved into tang colored water less than 30 seconds later (see photo). Also, the fragrance was hardly detectable even though they smell good in the package.<br /><br />Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I used this in a foot bath. The water turned an orange color and that color adhered to my skin and stained my towels but did not stain my foot bath.<br /><br />In summary, these bombs perform terribly, are staining, and are barely fragrant in the bath. The current price of $19.99 is expensive but still competitively priced for this as it comes to $1.67 per bath bomb, which is about what I would expect to pay for bombs of this size. However, at that price, I also expect these to perform and they do not. These are super lackluster and an utter disappointment. I am surprised others rated this 4 or 5 stars. I doubt the other reviewers even tried this in the bath. In the box they look impressive but If they had used at least one, they most likely would not be so impressed. [SEP] I get these for my daughter bevy as it’s the only way I can get her in the bath. She was lightly scented and didn’t stain my fiberglass tub. They melted like any normal bath bomb and has cute presentation. [SEP] Got these as a gift for my wife. They are nicely packaged and come in a wide variety of colors. While each of them is a different scent, I don't think I could distinguish each one to be the flavors they supposedly were. They're also a slight bit smaller than bath bombs I'm used to - perhaps bigger would be better for presentation and longevity of the scent. The stickers of a few of them had come off during shipping and were lying in different places in the box - something to pay attention to.<br /><br />Otherwise, they fizz well and dissipate into the water, aren't bad for moisturizing (I mean how good can a bath bomb be for that purpose) and they present well enough as a gift for the price. [SEP] They smell amazing and are quite moisturizing [SEP] This is a really nice set of bath bombs. They are slightly smaller then average but they smell great and work well. The scents are nice and they really do relax you. For current cost of $20 for 12 bombs I think its a great deal. Your are bound to like a bunch in the set. [SEP] These decadent bath bombs deliver an explosion of gentle suppleness that loves away my dryness of skin! It unleashes a radiant glow of moisturizing essential oils, transforming my steamy bath into an inviting warmth of affectionate grace. And the end results? Softer, more nurtured skin!

Body Brush,[],[],,3.0,10,211,"This brush is two-sided. The only thing I like is that the bristles on the brush are relatively soft on the back. However, I would have preferred a larger head so that there are more bristles and larger puff.<br /><br />The other thing that annoys me is that the handle is too short and I have to stretch to reach my entire back. In addition, the rope loop in the middle of the brush is ridiculous and annoying during washing. Why they thought this was a good thing to attach to the puff is beyond me. There is already a hole in the handle for hanging.<br /><br />A self-adhesive hook is provided for hanging although I did not use that.<br /><br />In summary, this is functional but is the least favorite back washer I tried so far. Also, the current price of $14.99 is outrageous for this. [SEP] This is very small, far too small for an adult, but it's also not very good. The cord to hang this in the shower is on the little loofah, making the loofah very uncomfortable to use. the other side is too small to use. It's sized for kids to early teens and is not good enough for anyone to use. This is a hard pass. Buy something else. Good luck in your search. [SEP] I was not impressed at all with the quality.  Judging by price, I was definitely expecting more.  The handle was long enough to reach from the top, then hit the other spots from the bottom.  The  plastic feels brittle and like it would not hold up well.  Bristles feel cheap.  I have bought better from the dollar store.  The scrubber side started coming apart already. I would not recommend this especially at this price. [SEP] I liked this brush at first, for a while, and then it didn't wear well and the loofah didn't hold up after only a couple of weeks.  It's still usable but feels like it's going to break any moment.  But who wants to use the same loofa permanently for months?  I'm curious if I can easily replace the loofa side with a new one once I'm ready.  It's nicely made otherwise.

BIOLabs PRO Pain Relief Cream - One Month Supply,[],[],,4.7,16,25719,"This herbal muscle rub relies primarily on good old camphor and menthol, supposedly in the maximum dosages available in such a product.<br /><br />Like all such products, it seems to afford some relief to my shoulders, which can ache when I overdo it at the gym.<br /><br />One thing I definitely like about the cream is its smell -- nicer than Ben-Gay or the generic Walgreen equivalent I've used before.<br /><br />As I write this, the manufacturer seems to be offering a Buy One Get One Free deal -- two containers for $17. At that price, I think it's a decent value. $17 for one container, however -- I'm not so sure.<br /><br />So if you rely on camphor/menthol muscle rubs and would like one that smells better than some of its competitors -- and you can take advantage of the BOGO offer -- I think you'll like this stuff... [SEP] Just a squirt of this pain relief support cream works well for my achy, annoying pain in one hip.  Perhaps it works by replacing one sensation with another, more pleasant one.  So far, I'm only using this twice a day. The instructions state not to use this cream more than 3 or 4 times daily.  When I apply this cream, it does have a cooling effect and my muscles do feel more relaxed after a few minutes.  I haven't felt any warming.  The smell is pungent - it's not bad, but the smell is certainly strong.  The active ingredients are camphor 2% and menthol 6%.  Clove bud oil, eucalyptus oil, peppermint oil, and sweet birch oil are included in the inactive ingredients.  Since this cream is effective and it gives me relief, my rating is 5 stars. [SEP] This herbal muscle rub is primarily based on camphor and menthol, allegedly in the highest dosages available in a product of this type. It appears to provide some relief to my shoulders, which can ache when I overdo it at the gym, as do all such products. The smell of the cream is one thing I really like about it; it smells better than Ben-Gay or the generic Walgreens equivalent I've used in the past. I like that it's made with natural ingredients. It is an excellent choice if you want to avoid potentially harmful ingredients such as parabens. I also like that it is made in the United States. [SEP] It was ok [SEP] Like many people these days, I tend to develop lower back pain after being on the computer all day. It's not something I want to take a pain medication for, so I usually just suffer through it and hope that it eases up somewhat throughout the evening. This BIOLabs PRO Herbal Soothe product is the perfect solution for me. This comes in a 3 ounce (85g) bottle with a pump dispenser, and the label says the bottle will deliver 60-70 pumps. One pump for each side of my lower back provides plenty of creamy ointment to completely saturate the area. It absorbs quickly, so there is no concern of greasy stains on my shirt after I apply it. The cooling effect from the menthol and camphor begins immediately and lasts for quite some time. I can feel my lower back muscles relaxing and the achiness simply melting away. The camphor and menthol can be smelled, but the scent is mild and pleasant, not like many other muscle rubs. So nice to have such quick relief in a topical format that I can use whenever I need it without having to worry about the side effects of an oral pain medication. This all natural cream currently lists for $19.97, and I consider this definitely worth it for the wonderful relief it provides for my aching lower back. [SEP] This pain relief cream goes on very smoothly and a little goes a long way, so use sparingly. When I applied it to my aching wrist tendonitis flareup, I felt an immediate cooling sensation but not much else. After I few minutes, though, I noticed that the pain in my wrist had lessened some and the tendon seemed to ease up a bit. It's not magic but it seems to help some. The camphor and menthol smell appropriately medicinal, and the odor is helped along by peppermint, eucalyptus, and some other things. With the 2 for 1 deal and $5 off coupon that is currently available, it seems like a good value if you like camphor/menthol products.",3,True

The block most of the light. I have found that a little light still comes in around the sides. They are comfortable to wear during sleep. I tend to forget to bring one with me when traveling, so I'm putting one of these in the pocket of my small suitcase so I have it with me. [SEP] I've had insomnia for 2+ decades.  Its bad enough when it happens at home but it always happens while on vacation in a hotel, even when I'm in a room far from elevators, snack machines, etc.<br /><br />Last week we went to Atlantic City for a few days.  I was lucky enough to get a room away from both the elevators and snack/ice machines but I knew that wouldn't be enough.  I took a silk sleep mask and the pair of earplugs that came with the masks along and hoped for the best.<br /><br />On the first night, I was exhausted from driving and walking around all day/night, yet I couldn't sleep. Then I remembered I had packed the mask and ear plugs so I climbed out of bed and got them from my bag.  Boy, did the mask make it nice and dark!  The earplugs blessedly gave me total silence as well! I did not fall asleep immediately, but sleep DID come and that RARELY happens for me on vacation.  I usually spend the first one or two nights wide awake. What a nice surprise to actually be able to get a few hours of sleep.<br /><br />The mask darkened the room tremendously. Even the next morning when I woke up to a sunny, bright and cloudless day the room was still dark for me thanks to the mask.  The mask was nice and soft and the mask itself was comfortable. The band that went around my head was very tight and took a bit for me to get used to.  The earplugs did a glorious job of drowning out my husband's horrific snoring.  On the second night, I was able to fall asleep fairly quickly and stayed asleep through the night, thanks to the mask that kept the light out of the room and the earplugs which, by the way, are very comfortable and flexible and soft , that kept the horrific snoring sounds as well as the maid's cart noises from the hallway silent!<br /><br />SO glad I had the mask and earplugs with me. I was actually able to sleep while on vacation and rest and relax thanks to them~ [SEP] I had recently bought some inexpensive sleep masks and instantly felt the difference in quality when I received these.<br /><br />These are so much softer and silkier than my other pair, they really feel like a little pillow on your eyes. The strap to adjust the tightness in the back doesn't look the nicest but it's functional.<br /><br />They're very opaque so they block out the light well and don't feel heavy on the face. They're also a good size so no light filters in through the top/sides/nosebridge Definitely comfortable to sleep in/travel with.<br /><br />The fact that they're silk is an added plus for anyone concerned with damaging their eyelashes or even eyebrows in their sleep.<br /><br />Great sleep masks! [SEP] I have used these several times now. It fully blocks the light while being very conformable.  It worked for me laying down in bed and sitting up on a very early flight. It let me get the best sleep I have ever had on a plane. The soft silk does not add any distraction like other sleep masks I have tried. [SEP] These silk sleep masks are soft and stay on without being too tight. I only use a sleep mask when traveling, to help reduce light and to signal that I don't want to be disturbed.  I find these sleep masks to effectively block out the light. [SEP] This package came with two silk sleep masks and a pair of foam ear plugs. One sleep mask is black on both sides and the other has purple on one side and black on the other.  The fabric is smooth and soft against the skin. The elastic band that holds the mask on is doubled over and is adjusted by sliding the fastener (rather than with a bulky snap or velco closure). I find this closure/adjustment method more comfortable than my current sleep mask. The mask is thick enough to block light, and the mask does narrow (as in, has a ""cut out"") in the nose area for a somewhat better fit. But there is no molding or pillowed area to hold the mask above your eyes or fill the gap created between the cheek and the nose, so light does get under the mask. The mask lies directly against my eyelashes, and I don't really care for that. The stitching is neat.<br /><br />The mask measures 8.5"" across by 4"" high (or 3.5"" high where it dips up at the nose area). The elastic can be adjusted between about 8"" to 15"" of length, for a total mask + elastic length of 16.5"" to 23.5"". [SEP] Nice well made sleep masks.  Soft fabric, light as a feather.  Comfortable too. [SEP] I love to take a nice weekend nap, but our house gets a surprising amount of sunlight. Also when taking a day nap, my eyelashes end up all squashed and wonky, with no time to try and tame them back to un-smooshed length and curl.These silk sleep masks solve both of those major nap issues. They keep the light out, while being oh so comfortable to wear. I don't notice them, they are light not too tight and don't shift. The silk also keeps my lashes from squishing, they just glide over the silk.<br />So comfortable, so nice looking and feeling, I feel like a 50s screen star, I'm just a glamorous napper. [SEP] I find the width of the band if too thin can be annoying and irritating...not sleep worthy.  This has just the right width.  adjustable for larger heads and silky soft mask that kisses the eyes without that feeling like your being abducted.  Nice that there is two in the package [SEP] These are very soft and quite comfortable. I've tried eye masks before, but they always bothered me because I don't like the feeling of being constrained around my eyes - if I make it loose then they don't stay on, but if I make it snug then I feel like my eyes are being taped shut or something. These were surprisingly comfortable and they are also effective in blocking out light.",3,True

These aloe jelly sticks are a treat to eat.  I love the texture and flavor and I like knowing I'm getting the health benefits of aloe.  I can't find anything negative to say about them. [SEP] I have been trying aloe vera supplements for a while. My main problem is the taste - some of them need to be chilled just to be palatable.<br />Not Univera I'MMUNE Aloe Vera 3-in-1 Immune Boost Jelly Stick - is is slightly sweet and tangy.<br />It comes as a small wrapped stick that you can take and enjoy anywhere - yes, you can actually enjoy its taste. [SEP] I love aloe products of all kinds so I was eager to try these. I have a sensitive stomach sometimes so I was excited to have these on hand for whenever I wasn't feeling fantastic. Tried one to test and could not even finish it. It is so gross and it's not just a texture thing which is similar to jello.<br /><br />After looking at the ingredients more closely, they aren't even healthy:<br />high fructose corn syrup aka the bad type of sugar, 2nd ingredient<br />glucose which is sugar again<br />processed food ???? with more sugar ingredients in parentheses<br />glucose again<br />processed sugar<br />glucose again<br />stevia<br /><br />I know they are trying to make it appealing but I am betting I would like it much better without all the extra junk. This is coming from someone who eats seaweed for fun. Will be giving these away. [SEP] I have never tried aloe in this form before so i was really anxious. First of all it comes individual packets (14) which make it really convenient. Per the instructions i chilled them before I consumed them. The recommended dosage is one pack per day. I got the green grape apple and it is really good. After being chilled it firmed up and was quite pleasant to eat. I have several digestive issues so i wanted something natural to help calm my stomach and get me back on track. It has a very high quality concentration of aloe which I like. Aside from the healing properties in your gut, it can also help with skin such as helping with elasticity as we age. This is an excellent side benefit. I highly recommend this product and i will definitely keep a supply in the fridge. [SEP] The box was a little roughed up when it arrived, but I love these little immune sticks and so do my kids. Really impressed with all the univera products I've tried so far and this one is probably my favorite. [SEP] I love adding some sort of immunity to my daily routine and was very excited for these.  Others talked about how good they tasted so I thought I would give them a try.  Sadly, these tasted horrible to everyone in our house.  We could not even take a full bite of the gel like substance before the taste would hit your tongue.  It was awful.  We all spit these out.  These are a no from us. [SEP] My 7YO daughter had a major palate surgery and had trouble eating and swallowing afterwards.  These little sticks of aloe were a lifesaver.  We put them in the fridge and she put little chunks in her mouth to soothe her palate and promote healing.  She used them before and after eating just because she found them so soothing.  Plus, the pain medication causes constipation, so the digestive benefits of aloe were appreciated.  I'm ordering more packs today because they have been such a benefit.  This brand is one I trust, which is important when considering what I use with my helth compromised child. BRAVO!<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] Fast shipping, tasted good! [SEP] It’s effective. For the first time in a long time my stomach is quiet and peaceful. Not to mention the delicious flavor. Univera always makes dependable products so I believe in this one. My only initial concern was the price but I can say with confidence after seeing the results that it’s worth every penny. Highly recommend.

[SEP] [[VIDEOID:9c031ea1bf8ce8939c7a1f7de02174e]] The bristles on my Sonicare toothbrush were finally wearing down, and I only have one official C2 replacement brush head left. I didn't want to pay nearly ten bucks a pop for official brush heads again, so I decided to get a big pack of off-brand ones. These are a RIDICULOUS value--at basically a buck a piece, they're like 1/10th the cost of the official bristles.<br /><br />In terms of firmness, I'd say it's about identical to the C2 brushes that came with my toothbrush--medium firmness, not gentle bristles. The size is slightly larger and less angled, but it doesn't leave me feeling wanting for the official ones in any way. [SEP] Bigger and firmer than the proper Sonicare brushes. But the fit is good as is the price. Maybe just fine for folks with bigger teeth. Mine are definitely on the smaller side. [SEP] Fit toothbrush base with no issue.  Seems to hold up as well as the brand name [SEP] A nice well-made brush head for my Phillips ProtectiveClean (HX6871) brush! The name brand replacement heads are so ridiculously expensive. The electric toothbrushes definitely are following the razor blade theory! Get people hooked on one, then switch it out or make the replacements cost a fortune!  These brush heads are comfortable, though a bit more toward a medium than a soft, but these clean nicely just like the orginals. They also have the blue reminder bristles, which is nice, and they come with each having it's own protective cap!<br /><br />For the price, you can't go wrong... these make it worth it to own the Phillips electric toothbrush! [SEP] These toothbrush replacement heads are OK. They are a bit too soft for my tastes but for what they cost, they are a good value [SEP] I was worried these would not be good, but I am happy to report I  was wrong.  The head fits flush with my Sonicare white model. [SEP] These fit my Sonicare toothbrush perfectly, I can't tell the difference between these and The Originals that came with it.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with these and will continue to order more.

"Metatarsal Pads for Women 6 Pcs, Extra Thickness Silicone Gel Metatarsal Cushions Foot Pads Ball of Foot Pain Relief, Ball of Foot Cushions for Women",[],[],,3.0,22,22424,"Update: A few days after my initial review, my mother relayed that while she still finds these cushions to be effective and helpful, and she appreciates that, since they fit between her toes and around the sides of her feet, she doesn't have to worry about them slipping or changing position. However, there is one problem that she's noticed: these tear super easily. So you have to be extremely gentle with them or just one tear can render them just about unusable. Other than that, she still highly recommends them.<br /><br />I got these for my mom to try because she has numerous issues with her feet and is always looking for products that can potentially help.<br /><br />She was a little wary at first because these pads are much thinner than she expected them to be. She hasn't ever had any problems putting these on her feet since they stretch so that they can fit comfortably. To her great surprise, these do actually help relieve some of the pain she has on the balls of her feet and the surrounding areas. She even compared these to metatarsal pads given to her by a podiatrist, and she greatly prefers these because they do make a noticeable difference in her how her feet feel throughout the day.<br /><br />In all honesty, my mother absolutely did not expect to like these pads at all because she's been disappointed by so many similar products in the past. That said, these actually do what they're supposed to do, and they help her feet feel better. So these pads have wound up being one of the few foot-related products that she would highly recommend. [SEP] Similar to other options, these are closer in thickness to the non-reusable pads my podiatrist recommended. I like that they can be washed and re-used over and over. It's best to use with powder. [SEP] These slide back and forth on you feet and stretch a lot.

Opticaps Advanced Vision Formula Softgels with Lutein & Zeaxanthin Plus Bilberry from Basic Vigor,[],[],,4.3,15,2070,"I have no idea what Bilberry does so let me say that first!  We take these for general eye health and vision issues such as night blindness affected us ppl who are older :).  The Lutein and the Zeaxanthin were both recommended by our eye dr.  There are 60 in this bottle so it gives a one month supply to us.  Both are made from marigold extracts! [SEP] These did help somewhat for dry eye, but not enough for the price. [SEP] This is a decent eye health supplement that is high in lutein, and reasonable in its zeaxanthin content (typically there is a lot less zeaxanthin than lutein when they are paired together in nature).<br /><br />Both carotenoids are present in the eye and supplementing with lutein can help with overall eye health and possibly prevent certain eye diseases. There is a very little bit of bilberry extract in this, but not enough to do much.<br /><br />The price is a little high for a lutein supplement, but it's not too bad. Overall, this is a good eye health formula. I recommend it, especially if you don't eat a lot of foods high in lutein (like kale). [SEP] These seem to be high-quality supplements with no weird chemical ingredients. They're easy to swallow and don't leave any aftertaste. As with pretty much any supplement, you'll need to take them at least a month, maybe two, before any improvements are noticeable.

Havent been taking for full month yet but am interested in seeing how much of  difference time will make. [SEP] Lutein and zeaxanthin are “carotenoids,” or plant pigments. They are also found in high amounts in the human eye where they filter out harmful light. However, the body can’t make them naturally, so you need to get them from food sources.<br /><br />Unfortunately for many people’s taste buds, lutein is found in high amounts in kale, spinach and other greens (collard, turnip). So, unless you’re Popeye, you’ll likely need supplements to maintain optimal levels.<br /><br />Bilberry is another supplement that has been linked to eye health. However, I am less sold on the effectiveness of bilberry. But, there’s so little here that it won’t do much anyway.<br /><br />This formula provides 20mg of lutein, 2.2 mg of bilberry extract, and 1mg of zeaxanthin in a safflower oil base. It’s a good amount of lutein, but a little weak on zeaxanthin. Make sure to take it with a meal, since lutein is fat soluble.<br /><br />The price is a little high, but you do get a 60 day supply. And, 20mg is a good amount of lutein. They use FDA GMP standards, but, as I’ve said in countless reviews, I wish they also did third party testing to ensure quality.",3,True

I can even get an appropriately-sized tiny cake in this box. Overall, I think these are classy and well-made but they are thinner than I expected. Therefore, these are for lightweight items only. Also, I would recommend using tissue paper or foil on the bottom before using to carry treats to stabilize the box a bit. The current price of $17.99 is competitive as it comes to $.60 cents each box. [SEP] These PackQueen 6”x6”x4” square champagne gold boxes are attractive all occasion boxes. These are practical as they ship and store flat and are quick and easy to assemble. These aren’t made of heavy duty cardboard, but the materials are more than adequate for lighter weight gifts and they make a good impression in the gold color with a crisp white interior. They hold their form best when I take a moment to bend the creases before assembly.<br /><br />The bottoms are formed by interlocking flaps that fit together well and lay fairly flat, but these aren’t heavy duty, strong boxes. While not necessarily needed, I do like to add a little tape inside to reinforce the bottoms. It doesn’t show, and the bottoms feels more sturdy. But I have used a couple without tape, and they haven’t collapsed as they feel more secure once I add tissue or filling with a gift and tie a ribbon around the box or wrap it.<br /><br />These boxes are perfect for lightweight items like cosmetics, candles, a special ornament, small clothing items such as slipper socks, lingerie or a tee, and small accessories like gloves or a scarf. These are practical and pretty when finished off with a nice ribbon or bow. I find it convenient to already have these on hand as the need for a box arises, and the champagne gold color looks elegant. These make a good impression and exceed my expectations at the current price of $18.99 for 30 boxes ($.64 a box). Recommended. 5 stars. [SEP] I really like these for packaging!  Well made and high quality!  Thank you! [SEP] I really like these boxes [SEP] The order comes with 30 of the 6x6x4 gift boxes. The color is absolutely gorgeous. It's in champagne gold and has checkered texture on the surface. The boxes are small size so keep in mind what sized content you plan to put in. The box is thin and lightweight, so also consider the weight of the content. Once it's assembled, it's pretty sturdy but just make sure you are holding the box bottom in case you have heavy items.<br /><br />It's a one-piece box. There's not a separate top for the box. The box is easy to assemble. There's the 2D to 3D box assembly and each box comes with the fold lines to follow for the top. However, no matter how tightly I fold down along the lines, the top does not seem to close all the way. There's always a small gap either on the sides or on the front, which is really unfortunate because it makes it look like the boxes were opened. Othewise, it would have been the perfect gift box.

JJ Autumn 100% Vegan All Natural Dental Floss - Waxed Corn Starch Thread with Soothing Mint Oil - 54.6 Yard - 2 Pack,[],[],,2.8,20,1792,"I have yet to find a floss that is comfortable as Glide. Sadly, this is yet another one that fails to feel comfortable to use. I managed to get it to work for some of my teeth but it got caught through other gaps that were too narrow. It also started shredding on the first use! Lastly, I don't think the packaging is hygienic - most floss packages have an outer flap or covering but this one allows the floss to exposed to the air even before you open the package. I wanted to toss away the ziploc bag that encased the box, but found that was impossible given that the naked package would get dirty sitting in my bathroom cabinet. Not recommended. [SEP] What a great idea: Dental floss that is eco-friendly and contains zero plastic. This earns high marks alone for being one of the few earth-friendly dental flosses out there, but the real test of dental floss is does this work. The answer here is yes, it really does. It's not as silky smooth as my mass-produced brand, but it still does a great job. I got this as a freebie but plan to buy only this brand of floss in the future. [SEP] The dental floss is made of corn starch,  a coating of candelilla wax from a plant grown mostly in Mexico, and also has peppermint oil.  All natural ingredients.  The floss itself is very strong and very thin.  Unfortunately, I couldn't taste the subtle mint flavor at all.  I could smell it in the little box that the floss comes in, but not in my mouth.  Speaking of the box, it is not strong at all.  We received two boxes, one crushed in transit.  These are the ""holders"" for the floss and are made of a thick recycled paper but flimsy for their intended purpose.  I taped the crushed box together, but not sure how long either box will last, though they are biodegradable when the time comes.  The boxes are almost 2 1/2"" tall, and each side 1"", and hold a little over 54 yards each.  Actually, the dental floss did it's job pretty well, but with some bleeding...perhaps that was masking the mint?!!!<br /> * Unfortunately, dropping a star from 3 to 2, and now the floss is breaking too often, and a piece got stuck ...not happy with the performance, was hoping for something worthwhile. [SEP] Broke three times in a row. Three and out. [SEP] I am a big fan of vegan products and that goes from my hair and skin products to my teeth and mouth products. I am done with the big corporation style dental floss I like this brand with the earth-friendly packaging and it dispenses easily. a lot of people aren't conscious of the floss but I figure it's slicing into your gums it may as well be all natural [SEP] This all-natural corn starch dental floss product comes in 2 compact rectangular-sized boxes.<br /><br />Each box measures 2-3/8 inches tall (not including the lid, which I removed) x 1-inch width x 1-inch depth.<br />I like taking this dental floss with me when commuting; this box does not take up much space in the center console of my car.<br /><br />Each box contains 50 meters of dental floss. The floss is unraveled from the top.<br /><br />I find this floss is not as sturdy as my usual brand. If I used the same area of floss to go through 2-3 teeth, the floss will break. But, if I move along the dental floss area in between each teeth, the floss holds up well.<br />So, the end result is that I use more lengths of this floss during my normal oral care routine, than I would my usual brand.<br /><br />I can't really taste the mint-flavor as I am flossing; but, that's not a big deal, as I am more interested in cleaning my gums and in-between the teeth.<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% corn starch PLA, natural plant peppermint oil, candelilla wax<br />This floss is vegan and biodegradable; the box is made of 100% recyclable material.<br /><br />While this product is made in a manner that is friendly to the environment, the strength of the floss is weaker than the other brands I use. But, it is a functional dental floss, and I do like using it. [SEP] I had great hopes for this product but it failed on the first try in my molars. It broke and I had to rescue the stuck pieces with regular floss. Sadly, I'll keep looking. [SEP] DO NOT BUY. This floss breaks constantly and damages your gums. You won't be able to get your back molars. Terrible, terrible product, if I could give 0 stars I would.",3,True

I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] I got the medium gloves but they feel like SMALLs, and I have normal sized (male) hands.  Please take that into consideration when ordering.<br /><br />Aside from them being tight on me, I have no other complaints.  I like how they are LONG gloves, which really provides protection against stray water (if washing dishes) or dirt (if gardening).<br /><br />They are about as comfortable as other gloves I have used in the past, and they seem a little more durable.  (I think these would be a little less likely to tear than typical yellow dishwashing gloves that I have used in the past.) [SEP] They are great gloves. Comfy durable and protect your hands very well. I clean vacated apartments professionally and can get into some nasty stuff and these are great. They keep my hand completely clean no matter how bad it is. The reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 is because I prefer the large because they come up my arms farther other than that they're great! [SEP] I have two sets of these, and they are both really nice.  The sizing is accurate, and they're thick enough to not have to worry about cleansers or other products working their way onto your skin. [SEP] These gloves arrived nicely packaged and they're thick, soft inside, and durable. My only complaint is that they fit weird because of where the thumb is placed. Otherwise, the fingers fit well, if not a little big, but the thumb needed to be placed more to the outside edge of the palm section in order to fit properly. I think for $15 for 4 pairs, it's a fair deal, but I'd like to find a pair that fits better. [SEP] I bought these thinking they were lined but they’re not. They also run small, got stuck to my skin and hurt when I tried taking them out. [SEP] EXCELLENT gloves!  Durable quality. OUTSTANDING fit. The lining makes the gloves easier to get on and off while cleaning.  These gloves are completely waterproof.  They provide excellent protection for your hands.  These are the best cleaning gloves I have used in a long time! [SEP] I really prefer cleaning gloves that extend up my arm, and these are great. I like them because they have a much softer, smoother inside than the usual yellow gloves I have bought at Wal-Mart in the past. They are also a bit thinner, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  They go on and off easily. The size M fit me really well. This is the size I usually would buy for winter gloves.  I like that these gloves come in fun colors other than the usual blue or yellow. What's great about this pack is that you get 4 pairs of gloves, so they will last quite a while. I think this is a good price for the 4-pack. [SEP] Inside material sticks to your fingers and does not come off easily [SEP] The other day I did a deep clean of my bathroom, and I was very happy I had these gloves on hand.

These hearts are about the size of a US penny and maybe two to three times as thick. They are perfect for what I wanted, so much so that I ordered two sets of the red ones from the same supplier. They will work perfectly with my Eldritch Horror game (and a few others I suspect as I scope them out). The effect (like the use of metal coins) is much improved over the cardboard chits supplied with the game. Great price as well. P-) [SEP] The Marrywindix 15 Packs 0.8 Inch Healing Crystals are a really nice set of heart stones.  Each stone is different.  There are different shades of green and different patterns within each stone.  I think this adds to the beauty of them.  I love the green colors.  I set these out in a little basket along with other stones and they look great.  You should note the size of the stones as they are small and should be kept out of reach if you have children.  I really like this set and recommend. [SEP] Fantastic little boy's treasure chest find! Wwe're using them as rewards. There is quite the dilemma over which one will be chosen each day since the banding produces enough distinct looks to develop favorites. It's such a little thing bringing so much focus and cheer! We'll definitely be getting more colors and hopefully branching out to natural cut rocks and minerals next. [SEP] We love the diverse group of green agate hearts. The product details provides an accurate measurement for the hearts. The hearts match the pictures shown in the product details. Of course, due to the vagaries of natural agate, the appearances will vary.  So, you cannot be certain of the specific coloring or patterns.  You can be certain that you'll receive an attractive assortment, though.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference. You can clearly see the range of colors and patterns of the green agate.  The hearts are nicely polished, resulting in a shiny and shooth surface.<br />The green agate hearts are exactly as described and depicted in the product details.  They are lovely.  As such, this product earns a 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation. [SEP] Marrywindix 15 Packs 0.8 Inch Healing Crystal Natural Green Agate Heart Love Carved Palm Worry Stone Chakra Reiki Balancing<br /><br />The hearts are nicely cut, but the colors just aren't great.  I know that these are artificially colored, but they didn't do a good job with it.  See attached picture for more details.  I expected more, and that's because the stones looked so pretty in the product information.  Unfortunately the stones aren't anything at all like what's shown there.<br /><br />The price isn't bad for this quantity of stone hearts.  But be aware that you likely won't get the nice, smooth, pretty stones that are shown in the product information. [SEP] These are the perfect size for soap toppers.  I am a soap maker and I like to do crystal gemstone soaps.  They fit perfectly on top of a 1inch bar of soap!  Definitely recommend [SEP] I thought these were so cute.

"Set of 12 Gift Bags - Non-Woven Reusable Shiny Bags with Glitter Texture for Weddings, Birthdays, Party, Includes 12xThank You Hangtags, White Twine & 12 Cardboard Inserts- 8x4x9.7” Size (Mix Color)",[],[],,4.4,47,1788,"I loved the look of these bags - very blingy with three different kinds of glitter - silver, gold, rose gold. They are not made of the usual thin paper and are meant to be re-used, not just thrown away after one use, making them environmentally friendly, which is a plus.<br /><br />The bags are on the small side, however, so they seem best suited for swag bags or intimate gifts of jewelry rather than large birthday or holiday presents. This impression is solidifed by the fact that the bags come with tags saying ""Thank You' on them. I wish there had been other tags included as well, like ""Seasons Greetings"" or ""Happy Birthday!"" This kind of limits their usefulness but it's easy enough to include your own tag. Overall these are great for gift-giving. [SEP] These gift bags fold a little weirdly and only have a rectangle base once you place down the cardboard insert. Even then, the front edges are still going to be rounded. Although I like the colors, I don’t care for the bag’s texture (it’s itchy) or the very visible heat crimped glued sides. Maybe if I were giving someone a Steampunk gift I would use these bags. Otherwise, they look more industrial than blingy. [SEP] These bags are great to keep on hand for gifts, especially for the holidays.  They are also very well made and and can be reused.  The set comes in three colors, gold, rose gold, and silver, all with black handles that are sturdy and attached well so they wont break.  They also have little tags so that you can label them.  I plan on using these a lot this Christmas. [SEP] I really like these gift bags, they are great quality and just a step up from paper gift bags. I can’t wait to use these during the holiday season for gift giving. They are going to look great under the tree with the silver, gold, and rose gold. In the past when I’ve used paper gift bags they tend to get smooshed - these are sturdy and since it is not paper, will not have that issue. Great gift bags, highly recommend them - just make sure to get the right size so measure before purchasing! [SEP] The colors are vibrant! No worries about the glitter coming off. Not the most durable bags. The bags are made of decent quality. Depending on how much you place in the bags you would probably just get a few uses out of these bags. The bags are not very structured. You receive a thin white board that is suppose to act as the base. [SEP] These are pretty sturdy little bags.  They are strong enough to support a book without the bottom falling out.  They aren't overly thick but for standard gifts most or many items will fit in these.  The Rose Gold color and Silver are much attractive then the regular gold one.  They don't shed a ton of glitter over everything and are sturdy enough to be re-used by the receiver if they like.  Mini card are also included.  Pretty handy set to keep for last minute wrapping needs. [SEP] So cute! Very sturdy and reusable! My friends loved the bag for their gifts! [SEP] Used for my daughters mall scavenger hunt birthday party. Excellent quality. We were very happy with them! [SEP] Great bag for gifts  my business for my customers. Beauty and beautiful bag they go together. I will get another few sets.",3,True

[SEP] This is my first exposure to Bath Bombs. I've heard of them and wondered if they really fizz away during a bath. They do! I threw one into my running bath and the bomb start swirling and fizzing away as it ""melted."" It takes a while for it to completely dissolve away. I used the time to enjoy a nice warm soak in the tub. It doesn't leave a film or oily mess in the tub, which is a plus for me. There is a little smell to it but not much. The  Bath Bomb's scent is not overpowering at all. I love these and will continue to use them. They look homemade, but they are wrapped in plastic. A great gift idea! [SEP] They smell amazing and they are just great in general [SEP] Before I had a deep discussion with a colleague who has a beard, I didn’t realize, that in fact, beard balm is a thing!  There are specific oils that make your beard softer and can help making it smoother.  I got this beard balm set for him as a gift and he was thrilled.  He said this worked better than his previous stuff he used, and plans on switching brands! [SEP] I got these bath bombs because my kids love bath bombs but they are pricey. These were a bit cheaper so I wanted to give them a try going they didn't sacrifice too much on quality.<br /><br />The box they come in is purple bit otherwise uninteresting. Inside there are three types. One that reminds me of a tigers eye, one that is all white, and one that is green and white. I was a bit disappointed in the lack of variety. Each one is shrink wrapped which is annoying to open and bad for the environment.<br /><br />But the actual performance was pretty good. When you first put it in the water they expand and slough off a cocoa butter layer. The rest lasts a long time! Like 10 minutes. Much longer than expected. [SEP] This is a set of handmade bath bombs that come in a nice box that you could give as a gift. All of the bath bombs are individually wrapped so you can take them out and use them as you please. These bath bombs have a great natural scent that is very pleasing. You could enjoy all of these yourself or share some with friends. [SEP] These bath bombs are a nice size and they’re heavily scented. They’re fizzy and the colors change the color of the bath water. I like that they’re in a nice gift worthy packaging as well. [SEP] This would be a nice gift set. It comes with 12, large bath bombs, with 3 scents, lavender, mint and vanilla. They do have a good smell to them, relaxing as far as scent goes, but the yellow and brown bath bombs, and the green make the water gross colors...if they went with more natural colors or pastel...or pretty....ots not very appealing to be left in a brown water mess...like I said, presentation and size and scents make this giftable...but otherwise not picturesque. [SEP] I ordered the beard kit, whichI haven't given yet. But, it came in a bath bomb box. At first I thought I'd gotten the wrong item, but when I opened the box it was the beard kit.

Youthology™ Premium Resveratrol 1000mg | Anti-Aging Support + Cellular Support + Cardiovascular Health + Immune Booster + Powerful Antioxidant | Premium Trans-Resveratrol Supplement,[],[],,4.1,18,6152,"I can't take a lot of supplements due to the ingredients which end up doing more harm than good. I took these (and taking these) and have had zero problems. As for benefits, I can't say that I've noted any (unlike PQQ).<br />Resveratrol has many health benefits and I was happy to give it a try. We are all different, perhaps others noticed a difference.<br />This is made in the USA and GMP certified (I always look for that). This is a vegan capsule which is great. I don't get the addition of lemongrass but perhaps I'm missing something...<br />There are 60 capsules here but the recommended dose is 2 per day so in reality this is a 30 days supply. [SEP] Have been using Reveratrol products for years now.  Have had nothing adverse happen from starting this brand. I take it to help my heart health. Hope this higher foes will indeed give me some immune support. [SEP] I first became aware of Resveratrol when researching immunity-boosting strategies to cope with our current pandemic. As I didn't have specific problems to address, I can't say that this product has made any substantial change in the way I feel, but I'm still glad to have it in my system. The pills are easy to take with no unpleasant taste or odor. Packaging was secure and seemingly airtight. I'm happy with these and will keep using them as a daily supplement! [SEP] The bottle of capsules didn’t have any issues,and no ill feeling or side effects.I feel a bit of foggiest lifting off after a weeks of initial use,time will tell if there is a difference or improvement in my health. [SEP] It seems resveratrol products are finally becoming more commonly available, and from various companies. Further, trans-resveratrol, which is the 'active' component is being marketed (derived as a resveratrol extract). This product is an interesting variant which is composed of resveratrol extract (50%), yielding 250 mg of trans-Resveratrol per capsule.<br />While the suggested serving is 2 capsules, I would advise starting with one capsules and build up to 2 capsules per day. As with other supplements, give your body a chance to assimilate to the new addition to your diet. Also, see how your personal biology reacts. And, since this is an extract, it's more concentrated than normal resveratrol.<br />The two important badges on the bottle note Mae in USA, and GMP certified facility. These are comforting and confidence inducing aspects.<br />This supplement is very competitive in the resveratrol marketplace. So, beside being a 50% extract, it's also a decent price value.<br />As with many supplement, and especially with products like resveratrol, the benefits are not readily apparent. You ingest many supplements like this in quest of long term benefits (some supplements do provide relatively quicker benefit/effects, though). So, I can't comment on the efficacy of this specific product.<br />The product does match the descriptions and depictions in the product details.<br />Overall, the product earns a 4.25 - 4.5 star rating ,with a high level recommendation. [SEP] I first heard about resveratrol when Dr. Oz mentioned that it was a benefit of red wine.  The resveratrol in red wine comes from the skin of grapes used to make wine. Because red wine is fermented with grape skins longer than white wine, red wine contains more resveratrol.  Researchers believe that resveratrol activates the SIRT1 gene. That gene is believed to protect the body against the effects of obesity and the diseases of aging.<br /><br />My wife and I started drinking red wine and probably felt that if a little is good, a lot is better.  We are finding out during the pandemic that you can have too much of a good thing.  This seems to be a good alternative.<br /><br />We have been taking this for a week with no side effects.  It is hard to tell  the benefits so far.  Research does suggest it might help protect you against heart disease,cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's.<br /><br />The price is very reasonable, and these capsules are easy to swallow.  We take them daily, but we still feel like it is a good idea to occasionally supplement them with a glass of red wine just in case. [SEP] Fountain of Youth, check back with me in 10 years.<br /><br />Yes, research shows it may be helpful in slowing down the degeneration of telomeres. Research finds resveratrol had pro-telomerase effects which could counter the development of adverse post-MI remodeling. Therefore, resveratrol could be a useful therapeutic add-on drug to prevent cardiovascular disease.<br /><br />However, impacts accumulate slowly, so hard to measure. I don't think you'd be able to get this much resveratrol from red wine because you wouldn't be functional. [SEP] Resveratrol was discovered to be one of the key ingredients in the health benefits of red wine.  Is even claimed to slow down cell aging and support longevity.  This seems like a good supplement.  Would have benefitted by including more information like whether is non-GMO, vegetarian capsules, etc.",3,True

It has a decently high concentration, with each capsule providing 600mg of turmeric, 50mg turmeric extract (95% curcuminoids) and 5mg of black pepper (with the latter essential to ensure good uptake of the turmeric). The suggested dosage is 2 caps per day. I use this for arthritis inflammation relief, and take 3 caps for the dosage I need. As such, this is a one month supply for me at 3x per day. The price is decent for a one month supply, and even better if you need just 2 (or 1) per day.<br /><br />The capsules are reasonably sized and not difficult to swallow. The bottle I received in May 2021 has a use-by date of October 2022.<br /><br />A good turmeric supplement at a decent price that is made in the US. No complaints.

Considering the relatively high price for curcumin, I would like there to be a more noticeable benefit.<br /><br />I measure two pills having 1330 mg of powder in them, which is close to what I expect from the claimed 1310mg of ingredients. It means these capsules have minimal to no fillers, which is what they advertise.<br /><br />You are after the curcumin, not the turmeric, so the 100mg of turmeric extract is the important number when price comparing.

However, with these, I<br />immediately knew that they were working because of what I was not feeling, which was stiffness<br />and joint pain. The recommended dosage is two capsules, which I love because many other<br />turmeric supplements require three or more. There is no strange aftertaste or staining of my<br />fingers either. But, the thing I love most about these supplements is the price. It’s around $10.00<br />a bottle, and that is amazing, because they do work well. I will continue to buy these as long as<br />they’re available through Amazon at this price. Five stars [SEP] I gave it all five stars because it’s easy to swallow, helps reduce inflammation which reduces the amount of pain that I’m in in a daily basis [SEP] Easy to swallow capsules. Good dosage at 1200mg. Primarily curcuminoids, which is what you want with the black pepper for absorption.  This hits all the buttons at a good price. [SEP] I've used Turmeric for years for everything from pain relief to cancer risk reduction. This is an organic product with the best of turmeric and black pepper to aid in absorption but I don't see a lot of pain relief increase. I do like I get the best benefit from these concentrated elements so I recommend it for those that don't like to eat a lot of natural turmeric in their foods. [SEP] Well, as I always say... if you’re putting it in your body, research it first. Don’t just accept another’s advice, your needs are most likely different . That being said, turmeric is good for so many things and the root powder has the same benefits as the the extract BUT not on the same scale as the extract. Pay attention to the amount of capsules in a serving also. In this price range you will usually get only 50 mg of extract per pill and the dose used for most studies is about 500mg a day. So, in this case you need 10 pills a day.  Big numbers and unexplained claims are the norm in supplements. But....,  this may be enough for you, if you’re not suffering badly from inflammation. I’m not isolating this product, as you are getting what you paid for and I use it along with cooking with root powder and also sprinkling the powder in my meals. Try it and decide for yourself, but please do 10 minutes of research on turmeric powder vs extract . No complaints really, you definitely want to take curcumin, just understand what you’re getting . [SEP] I received these B'LEAF NATURE Organic Turmeric capsules in April of 2021 with the expiration date being October of 2022, so 18 months of shelf life left. These turmeric capsules are manufactured in the USA, and they are vegan, gluten-free, and non-GMO according to the label.<br /><br />I'm very pleased to find this in such a convenient dose, as it saves me from having to take multiple pills. I especially like the inclusion of black pepper, which has a synergistic effect on turmeric.<br /><br />I'm an habitual user of turmeric. A close friend talked me into taking turmeric when I was desperate due to having been knocked down my two humongous Standard Poodle boys (76 and 89 pounds) who decided to play bowling for humans one day and added bruises and pulled muscles to my chronic pain. I was dubious, but I tried it. That was my introduction to how much turmeric can knock down aches and pains. It worked better than Tylenol and hydrocodone. And it had a lot fewer side effects.<br /><br />Since then, turmeric has been one of my go-to supplements for pain relief and it has helped me to fight inflammation for the several years. I’m expecting this brand to perform as well as the others that I’ve used, and I will come back and amend this review if it doesn’t.<br /><br />As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart.

But pressure hurts [SEP] I was just diagnosed with migraines this past year. I have other chronic diseases, and one thing I've learned from them is that you need a variety of home remedies. What works one time, might not work the next. With that in mind, I got this device, because I always get a stiff/swollen neck with nausea and pain. If I can alleviate the neck pain, I can sometimes stave off the full-blown migraine. This hits the exact right spots along the tendons of my neck. It's big and cumbersome and not the most comfortable, but it's worth it to not have to try to hold and direct a massage wand or something similar. Just lean back and let the magic happen. Recommended! [SEP] One thing that massagers like this have always done to my skin is rub it raw... the mesh fabric over the knobs are often rough. This massager's mesh is cushioned and less rough, but it is still a bit too harsh on the skin. I would not use it over bare skin, still.<br /><br />The flap, you said? Yes, there is a flap to cover the mesh fabric. However, the flap is a bit short and it's not very securely placed when the device is on, which makes the flap a bit useless. It just gets in the way, actually. I wish there is something to help secure the flap, and that the flap is just a couple of inches longer.<br /><br />Overall, I like the small size. It'll be great for traveling, and I can place it under my thigh and it's strong enough to keep going. I'd recommend this! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:b5145ee1c5a65f56aba4c3d50ed6dc2d]] This product is a life saver. Working remotely causes some to have stiff neck muscles. This sweet addition to my office chair has been amazing. My husband did have to add extenders but that’s bc I didn’t check the measurements. Otherwise it’s perfect. [SEP] I’ve used this many times and it’s an excellent massager. It’s easy to use, the perfect size and it’s VERY affordable! [SEP] I love it",3,True

Not too sweet nor too bitter.  It makes taking this supplement easy to remember. [SEP] With this pandemic I am in search of products that will help boost my kids immune system. I read about great stuff about elderberries but my kids don’t like the syrup kind.<br />This is very yummy! My picky eater eats this without a problem and would eat the whole container easily.<br /> (I told him only 1 a day) I tested this myself and I love it!<br />It’s not so soft, a bit of a gummy (chewy) kind that we all like.<br />I like that this is made in US and have a sealed under cover when I first open it.<br />Please note that you have to keep this away from your kids coz the lid is not kid proof.  if you have a kid who likes this a lot and can access it, they can open it without a problem.<br />Will definitely buy more when this is gone coz there is only 45 pieces and I have 2 kids. Wish they offer more amount than this since the bottle/container is big. [SEP] I teach in a public high school and everybody around me is sick. I was very nervous so I started taking all of these supplements.<br />I literally haven't had so much as a cold since in months. In addition I was losing some hair due to menopause and/or stress and it's growing back.  I'm also on a diet so for me popping two of each of these gummies everyday with a glass of water sort of satisfies my sweet tooth. [SEP] Less sugar, more Elderberry. Great taste, and easy to take. I like the fact that they also contain Zinc and Vitamin C, both in impressive amounts for each gummy. I keep them near my door so that before I go out, I take one.  I consider these tasty gummies a great help in the quest to stay healthy in these times.<br />The price is reasonable for this One Per Day supplement [SEP] [[VIDEOID:b0f00731dafa8ce738ec5a0553b74237]] These don't taste great and left my stomach upset. These haven't been evaluated by the FDA either so the bottle can basically say that it contains whatever they want it to say. Gummy vitamins or gummy supplements are literally just candy. [SEP] Good flavor and gummy texture. But the bottle seems half-filled. I'm sure there is the correct amount, just wonder why they'd use such a big bottle. Other than that, a good choice. [SEP] I have tried several brands of Elderberry gummies and I like taking them to stay healthy, especially during cold and flu season.  However, I tried one of these and the rest went straight in the garbage.  I take Elderberry to stay healthy, yet these have many added ingredients which are not all natural.  The big one that really disappointed me was that they contain sucrose.  I'd rather just have real sugar than a substitute.  If ingredients are added which are not natural then how healthy can they be? [SEP] We've tried a number of elderberry gummy  products, trying to find one my son liked and was willing to take. Most of them were too tart or had an aftertaste he didn't care for. He really likes the flavour of these gummies and takes them regularly without complaint. We will be repeat customers, as his allergy symptoms are definitely improved by the elderberry supplement, and he's satisfied with the flavour and quality of this specific brand. [SEP] Perfect elderberry gummies. we've been using it for awhile now. We like the flavor and it is really works by keeping our immunity strong and healthy, preventing from getting sick. [SEP] These are not my favorite elderberry chews but they are pretty good.  I like that I only need take  1 vs the 2 I need with my other brand.  I also like that they are a little less sticky than other brands.  On the negative side the taste is not as great as my favorite brand (though better than others I've tried!)  Packaging is also excessive.  It comes in a big jar that could easily hold 3x as much as it does.  That makes it wasteful and it takes up far more space than it needs to in my cabinets.",3,True
"Bath Bombs，Handmade 6pcs Bath Bomb Gift Set Bubble Bath Fizzies Spa Kit Christmas Gifts for Women, Mom, Her, Kids",[],[],,4.4,41,182,"[[VIDEOID:6b4542d087f033717ca59d96de1a56f5]] There are 6 individually wrapped large bath bombs in this set in the shape of pastry shop delectables. Each bath bomb is fragrant but smells the same to me.<br /><br />I tried the one with the plastic rainbow on top. I had to be careful that the rainbow did not wash down the drain. The fragrance came through in the foot bath. The bomb dissolved in about 10 minutes. The performance was good with suds that lasted about 10 to 12 minutes. The end result of the bath was almost clear water that was a bright pink. There was no staining to my skin, my towel, or to my foot bath; at least the color of the one I tried did not stain.<br /><br />The current cost of $13.76 ($15.29 minus 10%) for 6 bombs comes to a competitively priced $2.29 per pastry bomb. These are nice bombs and definitely giftable. Performance is good enough and they are very fragrant. [SEP] For 6 bath bombs these are on the pricey side, but they are such fun. These were an instant hit and after opening, it was impossible to pick which one to use first.<br />The box wasn't that fancy and really didn't promise much inside. The box is pretty enough colour wise but it's not fancily wrapped.<br />These bombs look good enough to eat which probably explains the caution inside that they are NOT to eat. There are six different shapes colours and scents. Each bomb is individually wrapped too. There's a cupcake with sprinkles, what appears to be a glazed doughnut, a blue heart with gold paint strokes, an orange macaroon with a white centre,  a multi coloured star and a round one with glitter and a rainbow on top.<br />Performance wise, the fizz was long-lasting compared to other bombs I have used. Anyway, lots of fun. Kids may want to use these all at once, so hang onto them. [SEP] Love the shapes and colors, they smell really good and are a lot more moisturizing than expected [SEP] These bath bombs are great! Perfect as a gift, super fun for kids, and smell great! Highly recommended! [SEP] They smell good [SEP] This gift set consists of six cute bath bombs in assorted shapes and colors. The cover of the box has pink on the left blending into lavender in the middle and blue on the right. It has a white silhouette of a female soaking in a bathtub getting ready to pop one of the many bubbles floating out of the tub. The sides and back of the box have the same color scheme. The back includes directions on how to use the bath bombs and a generic list of ingredients, which are sodium bicarbonate, citric acid, sodium sulfate, organic shea butter, sea salt, essential oils, and FDA approved colorants. When the box is opened, the contents are covered by bright pink crinkle cut paper. Removing the paper reveals the six bath bombs, each individually wrapped in plastic, resting on more pink filler paper. There is no plastic opening tool. The six bath bombs are each different shapes and colors. One is a green and yellow doughnut with lemon scent. One is a pink. blue, and yellow star with cotton candy scent. One is a blue heart with gold glitter brush strokes that has a rose scent. One is an orange macaroon with a white center and with a ""milk"" fragrance (smells floral through the wrapper). One is a cupcake with a lavender cupcake wrapper, white icing, and tons of multicolored sprinkles on top that has a lavender scent. The last one is a round ball with blue icing and a rainbow on top sprinkled with blue glitter. The scent for this one is sweet orange. These bath bombs have natural and organic ingredients. The bottom of the box clearly cautions ""Do not eat!"", although the online information says the ingredients are ""edible grade."" I suppose this is just a reassurance in case I accidentally get any glitter or other ingredients in my mouth. These little bath bombs are almost too cute to use, and I'm going to put them on display in my bathroom for a bit before I indulge myself with them in the bathtub. This set of six bath bombs currently lists for $16.99, and I consider them a good value and very giftable. [SEP] This is a cute set of bath bombs, all really sweet designs and they are well sized so they give off a nice scent and color to even a large bath tub!<br /><br />This set contains 6 unique designs , each with its own scent that for the most part, correlates with the associated design! The orange and lavender scents are my personal favorite.<br /><br />They dissolve well and not too fast and make for a great bubble bath! Great deal and great set!",3,True

I have only added a few drops and have not tried it with just plain water. [SEP] I did not notice anything different, but the liquid is clear and does not taste bad. [SEP] So far it reduce my appetite. [SEP] Like many weight loss products, the effectiveness heavily depends on how much effort you are putting into it. This will mildly to moderately curb your appetite, more so if you aren't consuming a lot of foods that give you cravings for more, like sugar, refined carbs, high sodium or processed foods, etc. Food like that makes you lose touch with your body's natural signals, and it would take a pretty powerful (potentially dangerous) weight loss product to cut through that and still kill your appetite.

Some day's I need to have a large intake of carbs yet due to allergies what I would need to eat would be MASSIVE so bam I can drink this and I am good to go.<br /><br />Flavor isn't bad I enjoy it.<br /><br />Like every other powder mix I have ever tried the best way to get this to mix well is take 1 to 2 oz of hot water, dump the powder in and shake/stir until dissolved then add super cold water and you shouldn't have any clumping or powder balls to deal with.<br /><br />No caffeine is great since I usually have to take this at night and I don't want to be up all night.<br /><br />Price point, For ME, isn't bad since I am not taking this daily.  Overall, it does exactly what it says it will do but I highly recommend reading the label to make sure it will work with your diet choices. [SEP] I ended up giving this away as it was not for me.  So why I am giving this four stars.  It tasted really good and I am sure it will do what it says it does by providing energy.  This just had too many carbs for my liking.  I am on WW and really like lower point drinks for recovery.  This had seven points and it was just not worth it for me.  If you are looking for the extra carbs, this is a great option. [SEP] The electrolytes work awesome, but they don't dissolve. Some powder at bottom no matter how long it sits or how much shaken. My husband love this product. Every day for his pre-workout. I found this product effective eliminating muscle cramps. No caffeine, so no jitters.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!

I don't think I will use this before a workout, but it is something I use on the regular.  5 stars for taste and effectiveness. [SEP] Great product [SEP] Unfortunately this product turns into a solid mass when introduced to liquid and doesn't dissolve until somewhere around 3 hours. Completely unpractical and useless, I'll stick Liquid IV for now. [SEP] I take a lot of medication that causes dehydration to the point of needing sports type drinks with electrolytes etc. this is a rather wonderful lemonade beverage that prevents my extreme cotton mouth/ dry mouth symptoms entirely. This is wonderful for me and my needs at the moment while I need to take these terribly mummifying pills that I swear I get dry cotton mouth and prune feeling lips without! [SEP] Good",3,True

[SEP] [[VIDEOID:d404e9e526d9d3558a46ec7f6c3ee3ee]] This product was amazing, the colors may not be very vibrant, but I other wise we love them so much. Each night my little brother picks one out and watches it dissolve in the water and it is probably the highlight of his bath. He always enjoys watching them dissolve and we always talk about what color we want it to turn out to. There is no scent we quickly ran out of them and now we are off to buy more.<br /><br />The only thing I don’t like is it’s not that fizzes so much unlike other brands. But all in all is a good product. [SEP] I got this gift specifically for myself, but I think the quality control of the bath bombs need to be better. On several of the bombs I got they were chipped off or missing completely. If this was a gift I'd be really sad to not get something that tip top quality. The bombs itself are decent and do let out a nice fragrance. The bombs come housed inside a box with flowers and each of the bombs are individually wrapped. I think the kit works if you want something cheaper compared to lush or some higher end bath bombs, but overall the set is decent. [SEP] A girl can never have too many bath bombs, and this set of bath bombs is really......the bomb dot com! They come in a cute little gift set, smell amazing, and break down fully once being placed in the tub. The scents are really nice, not overpowering, and it does not leave any sort of weird film on the sides of the tub after emptying it out. Overall, definitely recommended and perfect for gift giving! [SEP] Got these for my girlfriend. It's really nicely packaged which is the best feature of this in my mind. The bath bombs are good, not premium quality, but good for regular baths. They're decent at moisturizing, but not the best. The big heart is cute, but otherwise nothing terribly special.<br /><br />As a gift item, it's great. If you're looking for yourself, I'd get something that gives better value, or is higher quality. [SEP] The packaging is extremely cute. It would make a beautiful gift.<br />It wasn’t very moisturizing though so I docked a star [SEP] they smell great dissolve a tad slower than others. comes in a cute package.<br /> this is a great gift for all ages/gender. [SEP] The big heart bath bomb is super cute.<br />They don’t fizz very fast.<br />The scents are nice. Not too strong.<br />Would make for a great gift! [SEP] I use a lot of bath bombs, almost everyday. I have to admit that I am a bit picky about them and look at several different areas. Lyskiycyn’s Handcraft Bath Bombs（XXL-5.7oz) ended up being about average for me. While they were okay in some areas, there were other areas they could use some improvement.<br /><br />Presentation: The box itself is slightly above average. It’s fairly sturdy. The presentation of the bath bombs inside the box was nice. Aside from the ball bath bombs there are a couple different shapes, including a large heart with the word “Love” on it,  that make the set a bit unique. The ball bath bombs had botanicals embedded on the top, which is always a nice touch. There were also several silk (?) flowers, which is definitely different. It was a pretty touch, although I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do with them. They do smell nice, so maybe use like a potpourri. Several of the bath bombs had areas that were crumbled however. The petals fell off some of the flowers while removing them from the box. For my own personal use, those aren’t really big deals, but it does drop the product down as something I’d want to use as a gift.<br /><br />Scent: There is a nice scent when opening the box. The scent of the bath bomb in the water is only a fair plus. I can smell it, but just barely. The scents of all the bath bombs together nicely. I keep a basket on my countertop filled with bath bombs to use, so that’s important for me. They keep my bathroom smelling nice and fresh. I’d give them a fair for scent.<br /><br />Fizz/Bubbles: These bath bombs leaned more towards bubbles than fizz. They do fizz, but the bubbles are more obvious and hide the fizz while they are dissolving. The bubbles didn’t last long past the bath bomb dissolving. I’d give them a fair plus on this one.<br /><br />Moisturizing: This is a key area for me. The moisturizing effect was on the light side. I could tell there was an additive in the water, but I didn’t leave my bath feeling my skin was really soft and smooth. I got more good skin benefits from the soap I used. I’d give them a fair minus in this area.<br /><br />Water Color: This is the least favorable area for these bath bombs. The water barely changed colors. I did not get pretty, relaxing colors for my bath water. I’d give them a poor in this area.<br /><br />Clean Up: They did very well in this area. Cleaning the tub was a breeze. They didn’t leave the tub slippery or slick. They also didn’t stain the tub. Yes, I have had some bath bombs stain the tub, so this a potential big deal for me. I’d give them a good in this area.<br /><br />Price: When I got these bath bombs, they were selling for $12.99. The current price, when writing this review, is $20.99. I feel the price of when I got them is more reflective of the quality of these bath bombs. At the current price, I’d be pretty disappointed since my expectations would be higher.<br /><br />This is an average set of bath bombs that are probably more appropriate for children (except not really child themed) or teenagers. It proves that bigger isn’t always better. [SEP] I am always looking for interesting gifts to have around in case my kids need a birthday gift for friends. These are very pretty and gift great.",3,True

It mixes well with water. He does use a blender for the job. He usually adds some frozen blueberries. It's palatable. It does taste a bit ""green"" as many other plant based protein powders do. He says it's filling and satisfying. [SEP] This is vanilla and it isn't bad, but I found it to be somewhat grainy and that's even blending it in a smoothie.  Still, I am in my 60s and don't think I get the protein I should have in a day, so having a tablespoon on yogurt or in what I call a ""tea smoothie"" (ice, tea, milk and some of this powder), I feel I'm boosting my intake and keeping me healthier.  It's not bad - just a bit grainy to me.  Maybe others would not find it grainy - it really is something each person has to decide on their own. [SEP] This powder mixes in well, although the directions say to mix in two whole scoops. It tastes pretty good, except that it does have a bit of that protein flavor.<br /><br />All in all, it's pretty decent for the price. [SEP] I start off every day with a protein shake to get me going and stave off cravings until lunch. I prefer to use a protein that includes a superfood blend like this one. The ingredients in this mix are fantastic and it is exactly what I'm looking for to start the day off on the right foot. Unfortunately, like most proteins with pea protein as one of the main protein sources, it has kind of a chalky flavor/texture. If you're used to using pea protein products, you know what I'm talking about. I wasn't wild about the flavor just on it's own. With a little tweaking though, it's not bad. I've found if you blend it into a smoothie using coffee that's been frozen into cubes with coconut milk and a splash of your favorite coffee creamer, it's actually pretty delicious and tastes like a frappe. The price is also pretty reasonable for a protein with ingredients this clean. I would order this again. [SEP] This meal replacement drink is very delicious and has lots of nutritious, healthy ingredients.  The cost if it is very reasonable.<br />It's a lot less expensive than some other protein drinks I've tried and taste just as good or better. [SEP] The direction say to add two giant scoops to 10 to 12 ounces of water.  The scoops are pretty big actually – so that is a lot of powder. I went with two scoops and 10 ounces in the blender just to see what it tasted like.  I have already tried their Carlyle Plant Based Chocolate powder which was waaay toooo sweet for me as I do not like sweet drinks – the chocolate is cloying.  Thankfully, their Vanilla flavor is nowhere near as sweet.  I couldn’t tell you it was Vanilla flavored but it tasted nice.  The sweetness here is almost like an aftertaste – a hint - quite pleasant.  It foamed up nice too – but it was a bit starchy to drink – not grainy at all – just starchy – but I think that is due to the amount of powder used.  I put it back into the blender – added a banana, some kale, and some ice – and boy it was so pleasant that way.  The starchiness dissipates greatly with other stuff added.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] We added one scoop for a large (24-ounce) smoothie with bananas, strawberries, and orange juice.  The directions on this bottle say to add two scoops of powder to just 10-12 ounces of water.  Even at our very diluted rate, the vanilla totally drowned out the strawberry, banana and orange juice flavors.  It's just way to strong for our taste.  If you really use 70 g per serving, the large bottle will only give you 15 servings, at a cost of $2.47 each.  Not bad for a whole meal, if you can handle it! [SEP] Ordered this for my son as he needs a healthy snack/meal before games. He loves this in milk or mixed in a smoothie with bananas and strawberries. He’s had no complaints about aftertaste, chalkiness, or bad flavor. [SEP] I recently received this protein powder for review.  Having consumed a wide variety of protein powders, both milk and plant based, I have a large pool of powders to compare this to.  This Carlyle powder is quite good.  It bears no resemblance in taste to products from Orgain, but does remind me in both texture, grittiness and taste to Vega's products.  It also has some texture and taste similarity to the Purely Inspired line of plant based protein powders. Carlyle's powder is, however, thicker when mixed with the recommended amount of liquid.<br /><br />I mixed one scoop with 6 ounces of water, and found it a bit too thick for me.  When mixed with 8 ounces, it was quite a bit thinner and more to my liking.  The taste is definitely plant based vanilla protein powder, and if you drink it right after mixing, it is gritty.  Let it sit for a few minutes and the grittiness greatly diminishes.  As for clumping, I couldn't get it smooth with just a spoon, but in a shaker bottle (without a blender ball) it mixed up perfectly clump free.<br /><br />I really appreciate the high fiber content in this, and while there is a bit of an aftertaste, it isn't unpleasant.  The powder is quite sweet, which may not be to everyone's liking, but mixed with a bit more liquid it diminishes.  I also really like that it has a variety of plant proteins, although the main protein is from peas, adding to the grittiness.  There is a nice vitamin and mineral profile in this powder which adds to its value and health benefits.  If you're already high on consuming those vitamins though, you may want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />I've been liking this as a breakfast drink and it tides me over until lunchtime just fine, with a satisfied feeling without bloating.  Nice protein, but at it's current price, it's a bit expensive when compared with better known brands. [SEP] I'm a vegan and focused on getting a good amount of protein in my diet.  For me, anything tasty where protein grams exceed carbohydrate grams (as this does 30 to 24) is a winner.<br /><br />The taste is great - I add this to a cup of 8th Continent Vanilla soymilk and it's a very good shake.<br /><br />The only issues I have are:<br /><br />1. at 20% of the USRDA for sodium, this is high for me and<br />2. despite mixing it in an electric drink mixer, it is chalky.<br /><br />The ingredient list is impressive and I do enjoy this shake.",3,True
"Electric Shaver for Men, Keenhot Travel Men's Razor with PopUp Trimmer, Mini Shaver for Car Wet & Dry 2 in 1",[],[],,3.5,28,2098,"This could be a useful mini razor for traveling. I say ""could"" since I can't say how well it shaves -- I was never able to get it to turn on. I initially thought it was shipped with a discharged battery, which is sometimes the case with rechargeable products. However, after letting it charge for a few hours, it still would not turn on. The shaver got rather warm while charging, and the charge indicator light turned on, but those were the only indications of life.<br /><br />The design is something I've not come across before. It's a rotary shaver, but the heads are arranged in a straight line. The heads are smaller than is customary on a rotary. The construction is all plastic and feels rather cheap. Still, it has some nice grip points and feels pretty good in hand. As a travel shaver, the lightweight nature and the smaller size could be plusses.<br /><br />Since it failed to turn on at all, the only rating I can give is 1 star. A shame, since I would have liked to see the shaving performance of the linear-arranged rotary heads. [SEP] Small and convenient, this is the ideal travel shaver.  It shaves cleanly,  quick to recharge, and easy to clean.  Convenient for travel as well as home use. [SEP] I ordered this shaver for my husband to try, and we’ve had nothing but problems with it. It wasn’t charged at all upon receiving it, it was completely dead.  We put it on the charger for several hours as the manual recommended and it worked.<br /><br />While charging there is a red light next to where the cable plugs in, and the light stays lit all the time  even after the shaver is charged. So you never knew if the battery if fully charged and whether or not it will overheat.<br /><br />The shaver manual is not much help and in fact makes this product more confusing. The printed manual and writing on the shaver box have conflicting charging instructions. The manual says to charge up to 8 hours and advises no longer.  The box says 1 hour for 60 minutes of shaving. This is kind of confusing because my husband was never able to get 60 minutes of use after charging.  He was only able to get 2 shaves each at about 7 minutes before the battery went dead and had to be recharged.<br /><br />So…. my husband will not be using this shaver since the battery keeps going dead. And the rotary blades are weakening from pressing the shaver against his face.  This shaver is a no-go. [SEP] My son uses this when he travels for work.

It is best for travelling. It is really very tiny and has a great battery life. It shaves great and it is easy to clean. It doesn't provide with precision but it is a great shaver [SEP] This shaver is small but works well for travel. It can handle a few days growth but does need to be emptied often.",3,True
Car Rack & Carriers Universal 2 Pairs J- Shape Rack HD Kayak Carrier Canoe Boat. Surf Ski Roof Top Mounted on Car SUV Crossbar,[],[],,4.2,420,7997,"These work just as intended.  Drove the shoreline of Michigan carrying our kayaks!<br />The knob will back off over time. [SEP] Easy assembly and works great! [SEP] The rack itself seems ok. The materials are a little flimsy but it should hold ok. The bolts they supplied are garbage, stripped from the factory. Could not assemble both racks. Will have to go buy some. [SEP] This product dod require assembly.  It also attaches to the roof racks with a nut and bolt, which requires a tool to put up and take down every time.<br />Otherwise, the racks do the job required and hold the kayaks. [SEP] Fits on top of my husbands Jeep Patriot perfectly! We use them every summer now! Very durable! [SEP] These are working for our two lighter kayaks but the heavier kayak keeps bending the bar allowing the straps to come loose.  So, I would say they are not bad for cheaper smaller or very lightweight kayaks.  But for serious kayakers with larger heavier kayaks beware, the metal doesn't hold up. We hit a couple of bumps in the road, and almost lost one kayak. Since it works for 2 out of three I gave it 3 stars but really wanted to give it 2 1/2 stars. [SEP] Works great.  Easy to install. [SEP] It works on the roof rack I bought, but the picture shows straps, and mine didn't come with any. [SEP] 2nd time I have ordered these... One set for my SUV and one set for a trailer to ease loading.  Can now carry 4 kayaks at once! [SEP] Hindsite I would have went with somthing more solid and better.",3,True
"JKZ White Noise Machine Adaptive Sound Technologies High Fidelity White Noise Sound Machine with 48 Relaxing Sound and USB C Cable, 4 Gears Ambient Nightlight, Continuous or Timer, Sleep Timer",[],[],,3.3,65,1783,"This is one of those odd products that were clearly made by some tone-deaf, perhaps mom and pop company in China. I normally don't associate ""mom and pop"" with Chinese-made products, but the range of quirky sounds that come out of this sound machine have a ""homemade"" quality that are bizarre, to say the least.<br /><br />This machine boasts supposedly 48 sounds, more than most sound machines. Unfortunately it includes a number of sounds that I have a hard time believing would help me sleep. There is something called ASMR which is the science of producing soothing, repetitive sounds that cause a tingly or comforting sensation in the listener. However, someone seems to have misread the concept, for the ""ASMR"" section of this machine includes the sound of someone moving furniture around, swallowing and then gurgling water loudly, and munching a bag of potato chips.<br /><br />In addition, there are weird combinations of sounds - instead of a crackling fire, it has a crackling fire while music plays in the background (as if you were inside a restaurant) and the murmuring of people chatting and moving around in a coffee shop. If I wanted sounds like this, I would just keep the TV on all night.<br /><br />To top it off, the ""music"" function includes lullabies sung in English by a Chinese woman with a thick accent. She sings ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" but her English is so bad it sounds like ""Tinkle Tinkle Litto Star."" It's followed by her off-key rendition of ""You Are My Sunshine"" with a breathless voice that reminds me of a bad karaoke session.<br /><br />Then there are the lights, which I could not for the life of me figure out how to control. It has a light on the bottom and a light on the top. It seems almost entirely random which light goes on and off and I had a hard time dimming or turning off either light.<br /><br />The controls require some pressure or strong tapping in order to work, so this would be frustrating for someone used to sensitive controls or an elderly person with limited finger strength.<br /><br />I like the fact that the display shows the temperature and humidity, but there is no clock setting.<br /><br />While it does have the usual quotient of sounds (ocean waves, birds chirping in a forest, etc.), even these sounds lack sharpness and comes across as rough (just like everything else about this machine). Because of the bizarre sounds, however, I wouldn't feel comfortable gifting this to anyone unless I made it clear it was a gag gift. [SEP] This machine works decently.  You can cycle through the sounds (many of which are... bizarre?  Who wants to go to sleep hearing someone eat?  Yuck!) and you can use it as a nightlight.<br /><br />However, the buttons on the front are atrocious.  They're barely pressable - you can't tell whether you've hit the button and I've often found myself accidentally hitting it twice and having to tediously cycle through weird noises again.  The power button is equally challenging.  And, the lights!  I've had to absolutely smack the thing to turn off the aggressively bright night light that comes ON at the slightest brush.<br /><br />The real killer, though, is the display light.  When you have the machine on, it constantly lights the display (showing what settings are chosen) in BRIGHT BLUE.  This is widely reputed to be the worst light color to sleep near, and it certainly causes me to have difficulty relaxing.  However if you press something over the display, like tape, you can't tell where the buttons are.  And if you cover it with a pillow case you can't hear the sounds properly.  Awful design. [SEP] I was really excited to get this white noise machine with night light but sadly I will be returning it because the white noise sound is the only sound not on this machine and the volume doesn’t turn up high enough. [SEP] I was intrigued by a sound machine that also displayed the temperature and humidity.  And, this product does indeed prominently show that information. Maybe the next innovation will be incorporating a clock with an alarm (with option to sue the various sounds), which would be fantastic. But, the temperature/humidity works as advertised.<br />There are few buttons, which would normally indicate ease of operation. However, in this instance, it could use at least one more button. There is a power button, a long press turns it on/off. Below that button is a control for volume. Unfortunately, it the only button for volume control. You cannot selectively increase/decrease volume. You need to go to full audio before you can begin lowering. Separate buttons for up/down makes more sense on a sound machine. At the very least, some manner to control the direction of volume.<br />There is a time button, that allows selection of 20, 40 or 60 minutes, with the default being no timer setting.<br />On the right side of the display, the top button has a lock icon. This button will lock the settings.  Press this button and a single tone indicates lock state, another press with 2 tones is unlocked.<br />Below that button are two buttons, that give access to the categories and sub-group of audio files.  The speaker system is surprisingly good for a sound machine/night light. Unfortunately, the audio/sound files do not seem to be the best quality or wise selections. For example, the water sounds are not soothing. One sounds like water dripping, which may be more like torture than sleep inducing. I went through a majority of the sounds, and couldn't find any that I thought would be conducive for meditating or sleeping.<br />The manual is close to useless. Perhaps the only value of the manual is to see the listing of all 48 sounds contained in the machine. I found that most of the functions were discovered by trial and error.<br />Case in point. the manual shows that there's a button with a light bulb icon, that controls the lighting on the machine. There is no such button. But, touching the speaker grill on the top of the device will cycle the lighting scenarios.<br />Now that I figured out the buttons and lighting, I wish the sound files were better.  Based on these observations and considerations, this sound machine earns a 2.75 - 3 star rating. [SEP] this large white noise is terrible. the sound quality of the noises is really low and quiet. even at max volume. it can barely be heard.<br />getting to a certain sound was annoying too.  it in the playlist. there 6 playlists, each one has 8 noises. you gotta cycle to see which ones you like.<br /><br />the light is a nice warm brightness. [SEP] Junk, weird noises. Trashed [SEP] Has touch sensitive buttons. Sometimes not responsive, or will not register inputs correctly and will do it's own thing<br /><br />Sounds recording selections are very odd. Some tracks have duel tracks going at the same time and does not really meld well together.<br /><br />There should have been more quality control on this product. Would not recommend [SEP] I've got tinnitus and use white noise or relaxing sounds to help distract from the constant ringing in the ears. I recently got a fan-based white noise generator that lets you adjust the tone and volume and have been using that in the bedroom to help sleep. I had been curious about some of the electronic white noise generators and thought to give this one a try, thinking I would use it in my office.<br /><br />Probably the best thing going for this device is that it looks nice. It's about the size of an Echo Dot, looks sleek, has a nice speaker on top, and a great looking screen. First impressions were very good. Actually operating the device is another story. There are 6 touch buttons on it (no tactile feedback) - power, volume, timer, lock, category, sound. Operating this should be easy, but it is really not pleasant. For instance, to adjust the volume, you can't simply press volume up or down, there are no such buttons. There is just a single volume button. You can hold it, and the volume will change in 1 direction. I guess it cycles to the loudest sound, and then back down to the quietest sound? Strange.<br /><br />Then there are the scenes/music you can cycle through. There's a category button, and a sound button. You can press category to cycle through categories, and within each category you can press the sound button to cycle through the sounds in that category. There's no indicator on the screen of which category or sound you are in. So you can cycle through things like nature, animals, life, etc. Some of the options are very strange, like there is an ASMR category which contains sounds like eating potato chips, or drinking water. There are some genuinely good sounds in here, but I find it very strange to navigate around. I wish there was some visual indicator of the category or sound, because I have to look at the instruction manual to try and figure out which category I am in. I suppose if you find a favorite sound and don't want to switch to others it would be fine, but I still don't like the process of navigating the sounds on this.<br /><br />The thing that is most baffling to me is that this is called a white noise machine, the manual calls it a white noise machine, but there are actually no white noise options to choose from on it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Looks nice<br />- Decent speaker<br />- Screen is good quality<br />- Displays temperature/humidity on screen<br />- Battery powered<br />- Can work OK if you find a sound you like and don't want to navigate around<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Single button for volume control is bad<br />- Navigating scenes/sounds is not intuitive, it's hard to tell where you are and where you're going without referencing the manual<br />- It's called a white noise machine but doesn't actually have any white noise option<br /><br />For all it gets right, the stuff it gets wrong is enough for me to not recommend it. [SEP] Not many sounds. It’s a glorified Bluetooth speaker. Sounds are useless and it’s not worth the money [SEP] It was a gift but she likes it",3,True
Teeth Whitening Kit - Safe for Sensitive Teeth & Braces - Effective Whitening Treatment - Non Sensitivity Gel Bleaching Kit - Complete Home Whitening System - Includes LED Accelerator Light & Tray,[],[],,3.4,28,145,"This teeth whiting kit has everything in this , it’s complete.<br />My husband is a coffee and tea drinker, even though we get our teeth cleaned ever<br />4 to 5 months, ( we are older) He doesn’t like that his teeth are not as white as they should be.<br /><br />He has used this teeth whiting kit 3 times, and his teeth are looking whiter, although<br />This cannot get teeth as white as the dentist does.<br />My teeth are very sensitive , and I won’t try this. [SEP] I prefer whitening strips, it’s hard to get toothpaste placement according to the directions. I really don’t like holding the tray in my mouth for 30 minutes. [SEP] I was excited to try a tooth whitening product at home. when I first received the package I noticed it said FDA-registered and not FDA-approved. Those are very different designations. anyone can register with the FDA, there is no criteria. Approval requires something entirely different. Against my better judgment I decided to try the whitening kit and I regret it. I used it exactly as described and was very careful not to put too much whitening product in the trays or allow any to overflow onto my gums. unfortunately some of the peroxide solution must have snuck out of the trays and burned my mouth so badly that I have a blister larger than the size of my thumbnail inside my mouth. I had to toss the product and did not experience any whitening from the three sessions I completed. [SEP] This kit is easy to use, doesn't cost a fortune, yet works really well. My two teenagers both used it effectively and we have ordered more. Recommended. [SEP] So this doesn't work. The flaw is in the mouth tray. It's slick and flat. The tray needs to have better indents to hold the whitening product. As soon as you put the whitening gel on and put the piece in your mouth, the gel slides down and ends up not even being on your teeth. I even tried with putting the whitening gel directly on my teeth and then sliding the tray in and it would do the same thing. Since the surface is slick and straight as soon as you put the tray in your mouth and your teeth hit it, it pushes all the whitening gel to the bottom. If the tray had some type of indents to keep the gel in place on your teeth then I think this would work. I used this for a full 7 days straight and because of this defect/flaw in the tray, my teeth were exactly the same color and not even slightly whitened. I wanted to return it but I couldn't since I had tossed the plastic wrap that has the scannable bar code. I would recommend getting a different whitening kit, one with a better tray so the whitening gel stays on the teeth like it's supposed to. [SEP] Using this whitening kit is a little tedious because molds are large and cause your mouth to salivate, then the gel from molds get mixed with saliva. Then you have to put the light against your teeth and hold it with your lips which further increases salivating 😑 I honestly think the gel gets diluted with all that saliva and have a hard time telling is there any difference. My teeth are sensitive and I usually have to deal with pain when using whitening kits but this one wasn’t painful at all. [SEP] This product is easy to use and it really works. My husband and I jhave one for another version that use to burn out month but this one is safe.

B-12 Drops,[],[],,4.0,27,744,"I suffer from consistently low levels of Vitamin B12 due to a pancreatic issue that I have.  I already get monthly shots, but my levels remain low, so I decided to get this liquid version for a quick pick me up outside of my daily vitamins.  I will admit that I noticed a bit of a pick me up from these, when added to my diet.  The raspberry flavor is pretty strong, but I always follow it with a drink of something else that has a strong flavor and it's fine.  I'm very happy with this supplement though and will be picking these up again when I run out! [SEP] I wasn't sure what to expect with this as I usually take pills for my B12.  The taste is good.  My only real complaint is a dropperful is supposed to be 1mL, but I have yet to be able to get the full 1mL in the dropper.  The most I can get it to go is to .75mL. [SEP] These B12 drops don't taste quite as good as some others that I've reviewed, but they pack a lot of B vitamins per ml.  These drops contain B2, B3, B5, B6 and B12 which make for a very good complex.  I have found from personal experience over the past few years, that a high daily dose of B12 significantly improves my cognitive abilities.  I haven't had brain fog in a long time and my memory is sharp when I take a good B complex, especially B12.  I think these are excellent drops though they aren't as candy flavored as some others but they don't taste bad either.  These drops are very easy to use and are an excellent alternative to pills. [SEP] I seem to have a problem with fatigue.  I am older and I can be sitting for an hour and start yawning to the point I nearly fall asleep.  I can get up and move around a little which does wake me up for a few minutes, but if I sit back down the yawning starts again.  I've taken these drops for three days now and have not had the yawning/sleepy problems like before.  Not sure if I ""use up"" B vitamins more quickly or what, but a couple of squirts of this raspberry flavored liquid and I'm good for several hours!  It is a bit sweet, but considering I'm only taking a little and the flavor disappears fairly quickly, I'm okay with it.  If you suffer from fatigue, these drops may help you, too - they sure are working for me! [SEP] Personally, less sweet would be okay with me. The flavor is very good and tastes fruity much like raspberries.  This is actually a great product with all the other combined B Vitamins added. The bottle says 60 servings. I am taking a half dropper a day because of all other vitamins I take every day.  The bottle dropper works good and no leaks in cap rim as I shake it every time before using.  Still, I think it is critical to get enough B12 especially for us older folks.  This product also has a long expiration marked on the bottle. This brand deserves high marks except for being a bit oversweet. I still recommend it and feel it is a good value. [SEP] I like that these B vitamins are methylated (I have an MTHFR mutation and need to take methylated Bs) and I like the variety of B vitamins in them. Unfortunately, the flavor is terrible. It tastes like berry cough syrup. Yuck. [SEP] I picked this up only because my doctor said my numbers were low. I think it's helping. I feel a bit more energized. I just take the recommended dosage. It's easy to use and has a nice, sweet flavor. Just fine on my stomach. I guess I'll only know if it helped, for sure, on my next bloodwork appointment a few months out. Meanwhile, it's probably helping since it's what I needed, I noticed a change (for the better) in symptoms and my doc was ok with me taking it. [SEP] Taste good with natural raspberry flavor, although it's a bit sweeter than I like,<br />the Stevia is apparently an ample amount. (almost too sweet)<br />This is a thin red liquid, with an easy to use dropper.<br /><br />I've always heard it's better to take a combination of vitamin B's for balance<br />rather than just one of them. That's what this product is = 4 other Vit B's plus Vit B 12.<br />So this is a pretty good combination that includes 5 of 8 Vit B's.<br /><br />Shake well before use = serving one full dropper daily (one ml) [SEP] As other reviewers have said, this tastes just like cough syrup, which I happen to like.  I can't really know if the vitamins are making a difference with my health, but I certainly haven't seen negative effects.  Any vitamin is good, especially B vitamins.  My only complaint is the dropper does not effective suck up the liquid all the way, nor does it squeeze into my mouth very easily.  I usually do two half droppers and make it work.  Not a big deal, though, and still worth 5 stars. [SEP] These drops are delicious making taking your vitamins so much easier.

There are no instructions included. After doing some research I found they need to be renewed approximately once a month in sunlight for 2 hours. So first I placed one in each room. Not that I had any glaring odors. I did have a bag of yarn that I was given that has the person's perfume scent on it that gives me asthma. Put the largest bag in with the open bag. No change. Going to put the whole set in with it and see if it helps but not holding my breath. The two with buttons and attached loops are my favorites. Updated: they totally worked in the yarn bag. I can now use the yarn.<br /><br />Be careful if you cut open the bag. I cut both bags. [SEP] I like this particular set of charcoal bags because they include the small ones with the button. Those are pretty cute and look decorative versus the plain versions. They still work the same, but being cute just means I can display it instead of hiding it. What I don’t like is how this set is presented. Charcoal bags usually come in thick, clear plastic which is great for storage as you switch them out. The Nature Fresh ones are just loose in a dusty, dark mailer. [SEP] Product came in a shipping bag with no instructions.  There are 8 charcoal odor bags:  4 bags measuring approx 6x7, 2 bags with strings for hanging measuring 4x6 and 2 rectangular bags measuring 3x7.<br /><br />Off the bat, I smelled the bags and it’s odorless.  I’m not sure how the charcoal activates…just by taking it out of the package??  Since there was no instructions, I’m clueless.<br /><br />I use the largest bag in a dirty laundry closet for over a week and I also have the rectangular bag in my fridge.  Honestly, I have not noticed a big difference in odor.<br /><br />The listing page says once saturated, place the bags outside in the sun once a month for two hours.  Too much work and time to keep these bags, IMO. [SEP] The two that have little buttons and attached string for hanging are super cute and stylish.  Easily – you could hang these in a closet that gets wet (with wet raingear or something) or musty – you can just hang on a hanger.  Easy to hang from a beam in the attic or basement too.  Even the garage if you have a problem there.  They are cute – so I would reserve them for someplace you will see them.  The others all have grommet holes so that you could easily hang them from a hook or loop some string through.  The pair for shoes can be helpful – especially with sneakers – and especially when you get caught in the rain with them.  Very helpful!<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks!

[SEP] I’ve had these Nature Fresh bamboo charcoal air purifying bags for a couple of months now, and I’m happy with them.  Our house has a couple of areas that always smell musty, although we can’t figure out why, and I put two each of the biggest bags (there are four of those) in each of those areas, and they’ve helped reduce the odor in there, and make things smell a little fresher.  I also put the medium ones in a couple of our closets, where things get a little stuffy.  It’s a little harder to tell whether those are having any impact in there, because there weren’t a lot of smells to begin with anyway, just kind of stuffy.  And I wouldn't really expect these to do much about ""stuffiness"".  But they certainly haven’t hurt anything.  And finally, I put the other two in my ""Ugg-like"" boots that I keep at work, for when my feet get cold.  Those are a real smelly challenge (!), and the charcoal has helped with the smells from those too.  The fabric the bags are made from is nothing spectacular, but it’s pretty, and they are well made and look nice.  So, all-in-all, I’m happy.<br /><br />There are a couple of little issues with these, though, just to be aware of.  The wall-hooks in the first picture aren’t included, although the two with the little buttons do have the strings on them.  (I have no idea why two of them have buttons and strings and the others don't.)  And, when they were shipped, the bags came just all tumbled together, and I had to come back to the website to re-read how to rejuvenate them.  That’s by putting them in the sun for a couple of hours every month or so.  I live in southern California, so that’s a viable option for me, but I wonder a little bit about folks who live in rainy or snowy climates during the winter.  It might make sense to offer a low-heat oven option also, if there is one.  I’ve rejuvenated them once, by putting them in the sun for the afternoon, and although I wasn’t really sure if they had stopped working, they definitely seem to still be working.  And I’m about to do it again, after a second month.  I’ll come back an update my review if they seem to stop working at some point.<br /><br />All-in-all, though, these Nature Fresh charcoal bags seem to do what they claim to do.  And although it would have been nice to receive some hooks or something to hang them with, the product webpage doesn’t say any hooks are included.  In fact, most of the pictures show them being used without hooks, so I’m not going to take any stars off for that.  (If I could do half-stars, I might have taken a half-star off…but it’s not worth a whole star.)  Finally, please note that I received these bags for free from Amazon’s Vine Voice program, in exchange for my honest review. [SEP] It is just bags of activated charcoal which is an effective way to purify air naturally. I think these bags look better than in photos. The 2 bags with buttons are kind of cute.<br />I was surprised these bags came thrown in the Amazon shipping bag without its own packaging and without instruction or information sheet. Perhaps this was a returned item, but the bags smelled clean and immediately had the effect of deodorizing the air.<br />The 2 tubular bags are suitable for inserting into shoes. I am using the rest in small clothe and towel closets and they are working well.<br /><br />The web page says to rejuvenate by pacing the bag outside in the sun once a month for at least two hours. I am not sure how that is going to work in the winter time and during rainy period. Well, the bags are reasonably priced so I could buy more and rejuvenate when possible. I guess it also depends on how bad the air is. We will see, but it works well for now.",3,True

Now I just let my kids use this to help me do light cleaning and have them clean their room instead. [SEP] I took this out of the box and it almost seems used.  The container where the cleaner goes looked fine but the outside of where the tank attaches – the white part had gunk all over it.  It seems fine otherwise – so maybe not used.  I don’t really know.<br /><br />My issue with this thing – is not even that at all.  The handle feels sooooooo cheap!  The way it is made – is terrible.  First it is not long enough for your whole hand really – like you can not fit all your fingers on – the handle definitely needs to be LONGER.  Also – the way the trigger is made – there is a large gappy hole (where the trigger attaches) – that has a jutting out plastic lip – this hole and lip are always pressing into your pointer finger while in use – maybe even middle finger too.  Soooooooo uncomfortable.  Am I supposed to keep my fingers on the trigger the entire time I am using it – as that is terrible.<br /><br />Sure, this mops – but not comfortably.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] This spray mop is simple, easy, and comes with the instructions printed on the side of the box it was packed in. There's really no need (sorta) for paper instructions, except ...<br /><br />This is not particularly difficult to assemble, but I was stumped when it came to filling the bottle. First, the was no apparent cap, you couldn’t unscrew it because of the shape of the bottle (it wraps around the handle), and I could not pull it out. As it happens, pulling it out is exactly how you remove the bottle to fill it with a cleaning solution. The carton just says ""fit the bottle onto the mop"" but it was already fitted onto the mop handle when we got it, it was trying to figure out how to take it off without breaking it that was our issue. Pull hard, the bottle is held in place with an ""O"" ring. Make sure you have additional O rings (available at any hardware store for a few pennies), eventually this one will wear out.<br /><br />The cleaning pad looks as if it was obviously not made for this mop; they are too wide and too long. But I believe that it was designed this way on purpose, perhaps to prevent the plastic pad holder from scratching furniture or walls.<br /><br />This comes with three mop heads and a tool that hangs on the handle. I believe that that tool is for cleaning the mop heads.<br /><br />What this is, essentially, is a giant water gun. You squeeze the trigger, and you spray water, like a toy gun. When we first put on the pad, we placed it with the excess in front; it turns out that this was a bad idea since the spray does not go very far, and most of it was absorbed by the pad. So we learned to place the pad so that the excess was in the back.<br /><br />We have another one of these, not made as well and it only shipped with one pad and no pad cleaning tool. My original review said it was a toy and I was going to toss it in the garbage, but we soon found ourselves using it often and we now rely on it for quick cleanups. I was going to edit my review, but that product is no longer available. This brand and model is much improved over that one, and we will use it in one of our other homes. The aluminum tubes are thicker and denser, the plastic fittings are better and the mop heads (you get three, not 1) are softer and more absorbent. The mop head swivels up, down, to the side, etc. You will have no problem getting into spots and when hanging it up, you can make it very compact by swiveling the head.<br /><br />For an insanely cheap ""Swiffer"" type cleaner, this is really a very good product. We just put some cleaning solution in the bottle and you never need to worry about the battery being charged. Sometimes, simpler is better.<br /><br />I'm rating this 5 stars because of what it is. It's certainly not a Swiffer or other more costly product, but for what this costs, it's an excellent value. Don't be a jerk and judge it out of the box (like I was with the first model), give it some time and I think you'll really enjoy having this around.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Review of: Spray Mops for Floor Cleaning,SZBJSMF Microfiber Dust Mop with 3 Washable Reusable heads. [SEP] I have tested several spray mops and this one works about the same as most but feels a little flimsier in terms of build quality.  The mop pad is a bit thin and does a better job of pushing dust around than of picking it up.  I strongly suggest you sweep the floor super thoroughly before using this as a wet mop.  It should be satisfactory for occasional use of small room areas. [SEP] This is pretty cheaply made, the materials are not of the best quality. The scraper that came with it was useless not even worth adding it. The liquid bottle for the cleaner is small and has to be refilled frequently. The sprayer is nice, but it requires quite a few pumps before it actually sprays. After about three sprays and mopping you have to stop because it will no longer spray because the cleaner is bubbled up too much to spray. You can not spray at and angle the handle needs to be straight up. I purchased a better name brand one that works a lot better. The pads are too soft they really don't do a good job getting anything stuck on the floor off. We have young kids that are constantly dropping and leaving stuff on the floor. We also have bunny rabbits that occasionally don't make it to the litter boxes and if poop gets smeared and dried it will not come off. I do not recommend this product, it might work for a small apartment with very little foot traffic. It did not work for our high traffic farmhouse. [SEP] This spray mop is functional, that's why I rated it two stars instead of one. But it is very light-duty.<br /><br />As a wet/spray mop, it's ""okay."" It does the job, but I wouldn't expect it to do much in the case of tough jobs.<br /><br />Everything about it is underwhelming, as far as sturdiness goes.<br /><br />This will work in a pinch, but it's not likely to last long. [SEP] I got this mop mainly for my hard wood floors and tiles in the kitchen. It does a good job with light cleaning,  doesn't do a good job on stubborn stains that require more elbow grease. Product was easy to assemble is is very lightweight. [SEP] This spray mop is okay for light to moderate cleaning.  I like it because it's easy to put together plus I can use my own cleaning solution (50% vinegar and 50% water).  The mop head, which is a large flat pad that attaches to the bottom of the mop, is large about 15.5 inches in width.  This comes with 3 mop heads.  An interesting feature is a plastic comb-like tool that attaches firmly on the mop handle for cleaning the mop head or, as suggested, cleaning tough spots on the floor.  To be honest, I use a mop so hopefully I don't have to bend over and clean much on the floor.  On my floor, which was quite dirty, I did have some spots that I cleaned using another scrubbing item I already have which is why I state this is mop works best for light to moderate cleaning.  The cleaning solution bottle is easy to use.  It just pulls out where it fits in a position that to me seems upside down.  The bottom is a small plastic lid which twists off.  When filled with the desired solution, it just goes back on the mop handle.  I found it does take a small push to get it properly fitted into place.  To spray the solution when mopping, there's a trigger-type lever on the top part of the mop handle.  The solution sprays out several inches in front of the mop so care is needed if one doesn't want to get woodwork, doors, and such wet.  My rating is 3 stars for this is not cleaning as effectively as I hoped for especially with the roughness of the pads which should have helped with 'scrubbing.' [SEP] This is a good spray mop, but the way the bottle is sized and angled, it fills with bubbles as you use it. Then when you try to refill it, the bubbles come pouring out and all your floor cleaner comes with it. You need to let it settle for days between fillings or say goodbye to most of your floor cleaner.  I did like the included microfiber pads, though, and that there were three of them.",3,True
"Facial Cotton Pads Square - Premium Square Cosmetic Cotton, Soft And Thin Makeup Remover Pads For Toner And Skincare Product (200 Count)",[],[],,4.1,77,17268,"These cotton pads are thin and rough. They are not soft. I didn't like the feeling of getting scratched on my face when I used these. Not sure why they are like this in the first place. After wetting them with water and massaging these cotton pads, they became a little softer. I guess I won't be using them for nail polish remover, alcohol, or anything else. There's not enough absorption in them. They look a little different from the listed pictures too. 2 stars because I can still use them. [SEP] I ordered these to use to remove my Color Street nail polish. These are so much better than I expected! I cut them into smaller pieces and put nail polish remover on them and then clips. The mail polish slides right off! I feel like I could reuse them if I chose to wash them. [SEP] i really have never used something like this before but i had just run out of cotton pads so decided to give these a shot and i really like them. at first i tried them exactly as i would a cotton pads with my astringent.  then i tried them like as a washcloth or a make-up wipe.  i didnt really love that was so i am just using them as cotton pad replacements and i really like them.  i get a lot more real estate by folding and and unfolding and such, so its great because i can use one vs 2 or 3 small pads.  they are pretty sturdy and don't catch or shed.  they work great as part of my facial cleaning regime. [SEP] This is a review for: MISICH Facial Cotton Pads Square - Premium Square Cosmetic Cotton, Soft And Thin Makeup Remover Pads For Toner And Skincare Product (200 Count)<br /><br />I've always used the cheapest cotton pads I could find. Some were ok but the last batch was pretty bad... The cotton pad would pill, disintegrate and leave cotton pieces all over my face. It would also have some very larger, hard particles that scratched my face.<br />I wasn't happy with these so I figured I'd try out MISICH facial cotton pads.<br />These are about half the size of my usual daily facial towelettes or other makeup remover wipes, which is a perfect size since I thought the wipes were too large for single use.<br />The cotton pads are thin but not too thin, strong and won't tear or get damaged when wet.<br />It doesn't leave any residue when used and hasn't caused any redness, irritation or other issues.<br /><br />Overall quite happy with the product! [SEP] I am not happy with these cotton pads at all. The are hard to the touch or at least are hard to my touch. I was expecting something more like a cotton pad and these are more like paper towels. If they came in a large size I would think they were paper towels.<br /><br />I do not much absorbency as well because they are very thin.<br /><br />Not the best. You do get a lot for the money but I do not think the money spent is worth it because of the product itself. [SEP] I bought these reasonably-priced cotton pads to use in my face masks.  I have used them either bunched up or folded a different way than they came then inserted them in the pouch of my face masks.  Either way seems to be very effective and adds to the protection of a face mask.  I am happy that I discovered these and they work really well. [SEP] Very soft with no scratchy edges. These feel wonderful on your face. Thickness is between a tissue and a cotton round.  Great for blending makeup or removing nail polish.  They are big enough to use one, they are thick enough to use both sides, and they are strong enough it does not start to fall apart all over you like other brands. Other brands fall apart when you use them and you end up picking many small pieces up.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] I like that these come in a Kleenex sized box.  I use tissue mostly for removing my makeup along with cold cream.  These cloths do hold up nicely for makeup removal.  I think they also hold up nicely if used to remove nail polish too.  There are a lot of cloths inside this box and it's nice that it closes up when not in use as well.  I feel it's priced well for the quality and quantity you receive. [SEP] I tried using these for skincare, but I’m not wearing makeup right now ant they’re too large to apply my toner so I started thinking out of the box.  I decided to try them for nail art and am now using them for that and to clean nails in between steps in creating nail enhancements. They are almost perfect for this purpose! You can also lay one on your work surface and use it to remove extra product from your brush as needed. Perfect! I don’t think the price is too high for these but I haven’t compared them to similar items. [SEP] I was really expecting these to be more of a cotton like material but really they look more like gauze sheets. The size is perfect for the compartment I needed and they are very soft and cover a good area once opened up fully. I did try them to remove a full face makeup with miscellar water and they did the trick.",3,True
Guerrilla Nine - BCAA Amino Acids - Post Workout Recovery Drink for Men and Women - 30 Servings of Strawberry Lemonade Flavor - Muscle Recovery Through Amino9 an Essential Amino Acids EAA Powder,[],[],,4.0,4,8676,"I like taking BCAAs and EAAs after a workout, to provide some protein replenishment after working out. Plus I like drinking something flavorful to hydrate myself.<br /><br />This is an interesting formula. Not only does it contain essential amino acids, but it adds ashwagandha, and I'm not sure of the reason for that. Ashwagandha has a relaxing impact, but also may have a positive impact on testosterone, so I am not sure of the point of it.<br /><br />Given my preferences for a post-workout, I add taurine powder to this.<br /><br />The flavor is pretty decent, but I have very few standards with workout formulas, so I may not be the best person to ask on these things. [SEP] I use a BCAA or EAA everyday with my workouts and also my rest days.  I love trying new to me brands and flavors.  This one is ok.  I tried both the strawberry lemonade and the blue raspberry.  I did not get a very strong flavor from either.  I enjoyed them mixed with another supplement I am using though.<br /><br />The downfall for me is the expiration.  Both say to use within 60 days after opening.  I personally do not love using the same flavor everyday.  I like the mix it up.  I use a few different ones at a time.  Unless you plan to only use this one and use it everyday, it will be expired before you finish it.  Most of the ones I have use a two year shelf life (some one year).<br /><br />This did mix well though with no clumping.  I just wanted more from the flavoring.  I do not really see what is different between the Base and the 9 as both are recovery essential aminos.  This formula has a finer powder, but the flavoring is about the same (tried strawberry lemonade in both). [SEP] I have taken other BCAA's and many here complain about the taste, however I am not taking this for deliciousness-more of just a necessity to down quickly.  When mixed with protein powder and a banana for example, you can get it to taste a bit better but for BCAA's in general they are a bit bitter.  This one softens that a bit.  Overall, about the same value as other leading brands, works fine I would think and flavor is just OK.  But, in general I don't take this solo and if you do-just shoot it!

I hate having to do hot compresses when I get a stye and I don't feel like they help much. Usually my styes are gone in 4 or 5 days but this last stye was the worst I have ever had.

I recieved this product on Sunday and it is now Thursday and it is already almost gone. The biggest bonus is that the product has caused it to drain with no need of heat compresses. Also a little goes a long way. The instructions say use three drops but I have that one is way more than plenty to get the job done. This was well worth the money! It is also better than the prescription that I got from the doctor which would burn my eye if it got on it. [SEP] This product does not work.  You’re not waste your money as it doesn’t make your eye greasy and it doesn’t change it at all… Snake oil product do not buy use hot water compress on a washrag 2 to 3 times a day as hot as you can stand it and it will remove it [SEP] still trying this but feels good [SEP] Didn't care for this Goodbye styes serum....I still have the stye and am scheduled for to see an eye surgeon next.

"Makryn Adjustable Plantar Fasciitis Feet Inserts-Orthotic Shoe Insoles-Arch Support for Men&Women-Flat Feet,High Arches,Relieve Metatarsal(Green, Small)",[],[],,3.8,29,66,"My daughter likes to wear stylish sneakers that don't have a lot of arch support. She recently came home from college for a visit and only brought the shoes she wore with her which happened to be a pair of these shoes. She was using our home elliptical machine and complained afterwards because the shoes weren't very supportive. I ordered these for her to see if they would help. These inserts are customizable. They can be trimmed for fit and then there are little pieces that you can add under the arch area in case you need to increase the arch support. She says that they do improve the arch support, but she would prefer one with extra cushion support in the heel and other areas, too. Overall, she does like these and is much happier with her shoes since she's added these. [SEP] They make my arches feel better. Feet hurt less [SEP] They're pretty comfortable.he full length insoles are definitely a bit more comfortable over long periods of time. The only drawback is the difference in price. As far as pain goes, it's what I needed. I don't have plantar fasciitis, but I do have flat feet which causes extensor tendonitis and joint pain sometimes all the way up to my lower back. I bought new insoles because my joint pain started flaring up, which is a sign for me that I need to replace them. As I was hoping, within a week or so my hip pain cleared up (and I imagine it would have been faster if I'd actually been wearing them every day). It did what I needed it to do, but I can't speak to its effect on actual plantar faciitis. The guide lines for trimming were pretty accurate, but didn't exactly match the toe of my shoe and needed some adjusting. Actually cutting, inserting, and removing the insoles was easy [SEP] These inserts help with my heel pain, however the support pads shift so I wore them for a short while with my sneakers only for the heel cup. Need better design for arch support. [SEP] These shoe supports are easy to customize to your preference.  I wear womens size 9.5 and mine fit well inside my shoes without any cutting.  I did use a few of the softer, yellow pads for additional arch support, but they feel very hard and like a rock under my foot at times. There are also a variety of orange pads that are harder pad material. These make my foot feel sore initially while wearing. They seem to get a little better as I wear them a while, but for the most part these inserts  feel more hard than. They give support,  but my feet get tired after I am on my feet for a while. [SEP] I thought the idea of being able to customize these to my own specific needs would be great- the next best thing to getting custom-made orthotics.  Turns out, it's not that easy to get the exact right placement and combination of the pads to suit your foot.  You can stack multiple pads to get the height of arch support you want, but for me I could feel the star-step edges of he pads as opposed to a smooth built in arch of a normal insole.  Also, the support you get is more of a ""cushioned"" support than a ""stiff"" support.  All I all, these did not give me the support I'm looking for.  I will stick with the pre-formed rigid arch supports. [SEP] These are decent in soles, a little pricey for what they are. Couldn’t figure out all the extra foam pieces that are supposed to be to tailor to your fit. [SEP] I bought these to wear to work where I stand for about 7 hours of the day. These worked worse than the original insoles that came with my shoes that I've worn for over a year. To me, these are a waste and I'd rather spend much more money on something that works. [SEP] I don't write reviews, but these inserts work. As lab worker I am on my feet all day, my feet did not hurt after a long shift! [SEP] Received these today and was so excited to open the box and get them into my sneakers. They were the exact size I needed so I didn’t have to cut them down. I have been playing around with the additional support inserts that come with it and will work through those the next couple days to see what feels the best.

I don't use water and I get some times scents in my home. [SEP] These have and excellent mix of fragrances with strong scents that are great for aromatherapy. One or two did smell a little like alcohol, which makes me wonder about additives, as well as the fact that both Rose and Jasmine have their fragrances removed through water soluble methods more often than oil or fat soluble ones, so I also wonder if those are real. But I don’t really care too much, so whatever. Smells good. It’s not like I’m eating it or anything. [SEP] This is a nice assortment of essential oils.  I had a couple of other brands on hand and so I did a scent comparison of several of these.  The eucalyptus is about the same as two others I have; the lavender is not as strong; and the peppermint was about middle-of-the-road.  Overall, I think these are moderate strength scents:  not the strongest, but better that some others.  I do like the nice assortment of 12, although the 10ml bottles don’t hold that much, so they won’t last very long.  Hands down the jasmine is my personal favorite, and also the cinnamon which is not very common in essential oil assortments.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.

All smell good as expected, except bergamot and ylang ylang since I don't know what those two scents are, I cannot compare them to any other brands of essential oils I've had in the past. The oils are decent quality and last a long time with a few drops when used in a diffuser.<br /><br />The peppermint is a bit weak compared to how strong it smells before using it. I wasn’t a huge fan of the rosemary oil but it smells like rosemary so that has more to do with not liking the scent rather than any complaint with this brand.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these oils as they seem to be good quality for long lasting scents when used in a diffuser. This pack can also make a great gift for sure. [SEP] My wife loves using essential oils for a lot of ailments and other things.

I noticed that some sellers have subpar oils that are very lightly scented and if you put them in the diffuser that you can’t smell anything. These oils are not like that at all. My wife commented how much she has enjoyed using a few of these new ones when added to some of her staples.<br /><br />This is a great set; we are thinking about getting another one for my sister-in-law as she loves using them as well.  With so many great oils in here make it a great gift for those looking for a gift. [SEP] Lovely set with a great variety of scents; avoids significant overlap (some sets will have multiple citrus scents which is annoying). Scents smell of what they should. Nicely packaged. Each bottle is sealed. Would make for a nice gift. At $33, or $2.75 each, it’s reasonably priced but not the cheapest (some sets can be had for around $1.50 each), and I haven’t seen much difference between brands. Overall, pretty happy! 4/5 stars. [SEP] Pros:<br /><br />The individual scents are all pleasant and what one would expect for each scent.<br /><br />Price - it’s probably fair for what you get, but you’ll have to decide that for yourself.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The vials are very small. But, it’s what was advertised, so I can’t blame the manufacturer at all. All I’m saying is, be sure to take note of the 10ml vial size and make sure you know what a 10ml quantity is before you buy, else you may be disappointed versus your expectations.<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />Good product. Buy it if this scent selection appeals to you.<br /><br />If you found this review to be of any value whatsoever, I would appreciate it if you would click on the ""Helpful"" button below, to let me know that I’m not totally wasting my weekends by writing these reviews.

They had a very expensive machine. Being cheap, I looked at various machines and settled on this one. Works like a champ and glad I bought it. Because of the 5 yr warranty and being stateside was the clincher. Have used it many times on a regular basis. 2 days on and one off. Easy instructions, cant go wrong. I threw in ton of salt to see what would happen alarm went off and reset it. Use very little salt. Great product and fast delivery. Worth it. [SEP] Good [SEP] Came a day early. Everything was intact, nothing broken. Seems to work just fine. [SEP] It seems to help despite the negative reports.  It appears to have helped get my ph where it belongs. [SEP] I am pleased with the IonizeMe ionic foot bath machine.<br /><br />I found this device to be of solid, quality construction, in addition to being as effective as other, far more expensive outfits I've used in professional foot-bath spas. The IonizeMe is straightforward and easy to use, and the five-year warranty is reassuring (though, I have not had to make use of it, so I can't comment on the quality of warranty service).<br /><br />Thanks to all involved in producing and distributing this device. I have benefited from it. [SEP] Very easy to set up, the salt warning was a little confusing but one read directions it was clear [SEP] I like this item very much but had to do away with the round arrays, for what ever the reason I have yet to find a round array that works as well as the rectangle ones do. [SEP] Received within the designated time and in excellent condition.  Works as expected. DVD was very thorough and easily understood what to do and expect. [SEP] First, know that some of the color changes in the water are a result of chemical activity, not all stuff oozing from your feet.  That said, this is a relaxing way  to detox acids from the body so it becomes more alkaline.  On my first try, I, too, had problems with the alarm and was not clear about the purpose of the dials.  I sent an email to the company and received a speedy reply with detailed instructions.  Also, I mis-ordered and received the spa machine without a foot bath and a few other necessary items.  The company was glad to correct my mistake and only charged me the small difference between my wrong order and the one I wanted. Once you figure out your correct dial and salt setting, this is easy to set up and use. [SEP] Nice to have for a detox session that you can do yourself.",3,True

All monies raised by and for Unravel will go directly to the fight against pediatric cancer. [SEP] These multivitamin gummies are great for women's health.  I like that they contain many daily vitamins that I don't get much of otherwise.  The gummies taste good although I'd prefer it wasn't coated in sugar. [SEP] I’ve been taking these for about a week now and I’ve noticed some changes I have more energy now and my overall health feels much better. The flavor of the gummies are great. [SEP] The women’s multivitamin gummy‘s taste like strawberry and are easy to eat. There are 60 gummy‘s in a container and you take 2 a day so this last for a month. It has the nutrients that you need in a day. They are made in Nashville, Tennessee. [SEP] I usually prefer gummies over tablets and this one worked perfect. The flavor is good and easy to chew. Overall, a good gummy for everyday vitamin support. [SEP] I am not quite certain why some vitamin manufacturers make vitamins with 100% of the RDA for some vitamins, but then ignore or skimp out on others. The fact that this is marketed for women instead of men, makes me think it has perhaps more calcium and iron. But those ingredients are not included at all! While some fat soluble vitamins like E are at high doses, while the water soluble vitamins are under-dosed. There probably are populations of women who need this specific dose (too much calcium can be bad for people who get it in abundance), but this is marketed for all women. I don't understand the dosing philosophy at all and thus subtracted two stars for not being more clear about this. I also deducted one star because of the taste. The gummy is too sweet and has sugar crystals coating the entire  gummy. that is a lot of unnecessary sugar. I would think a light honey coating would be sufficient for people already vested heavily in what goes into their body. As another review said, regardless of who you are, your age or your gender, please take vitamins that compliment your diet and needs. What is good for one person is bad for another, and vice versa. Be safe. Choose wisely. And feel free to ask your doctor. [SEP] Overall, these aren't bad but every single gummy is covered in sugar.  I'm sure there have to be ways to keep them from sticking together without sugar.  I've tried many other gummy vitamins & supplements and these are the only ones that are sugar-coated.  The flavor is technically strawberry but the sugar makes it mostly sugar-flavored.<br /><br />If you have small kids that might find your vitamins, hide these very well.  They are literally gummy bears coated in sugar, in appearance and taste.  I know adults who've made themselves sick by eating too many gummy vitamins - but a kid is going to think these are actual candy if they see them.<br /><br />As of this writing, they are no longer available for purchase, which is probably a good thing.  No one needs more sugar in their life so I wouldn't buy these no matter how inexpensive they were. [SEP] Overall, these aren't bad but every single gummy is covered in sugar.

I have a problem with the vitamin C (20%) &D (8%) being so low on these but vitamin E is 100%? Vitamin E is fat soluble so the excess doesn't flush out, where vitamin C is water soluble so any excess will flush out of your system so I have a real problem with this vitamin line up and I won't be getting these again. I should have looked more closely. [SEP] Love the packaging, it's a really creamy gummy and I love that it has so many different vitamins and supplements to keep me healthy. Would make a great gift.",3,True

[SEP] Love it [SEP] Since Greemix is not a name brand, it's hard to know the quality of these D3 gel tables.  I normally get the Nature's Bounty brand, which has been around for years and has a good reputation, but I ran out of my current supply and decided to give these a try.  I don't think I will be ordering them again.  First, they contain two ingredients that are not present in the Nature's Bounty brand or other brands I have tried: titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide.  I don't know what this stuff is, but I am looking to get as close to pure D3 as possible, and since other manufacturers don't include it in their ingredients, I'm dubiuous about its presence in these gelcaps.  The other issue is the price.  You can get 240 Nature's Bounty 5000 iu D3 gelcaps on Amazon for $13.64, so at $12.95 for 90 capsules, the Greenmix price is unacceptable. [SEP] My wife got these to try out but became concerned with the ingredients on the label.  Isn't Titanium Dioxide found in sunscreens?!  I think she is going with a different brand and paying closer attention to the ingredients' labels now.",3,True
"Vitamin D3 + K2 - Max Strength Vitamin D3 5000IU Cholecalciferol Supplement with K2 mk-7 - Vitamin D Supplement with Calcium for Bone Strength, Mood and Immunity by Vitamorph - USA-made 60 Veggie Caps",[],[],,4.2,26,2126,"I think this is a very good D3/K2 supplement. It seems to be very reasonably priced (as of this review a bottle of 60 veggie caps costs $16.19 giving you a 3 month supply). One capsule delivers 125 mcg of D3 and 100 mcg  of vitamin K2. 210 mg calcium is also included which is only 16% DV. I take at least 5000 IU of D3 each day and usually more since it is such a powerful anti-viral and is so good for brain health. And in combination with K2, needed calcium is stored in bones and being 63, I don't want to get soft or brittle bones as I age. I think this is a very good supplement. [SEP] If I could only supplement with two vitamins, they would be D3 and K2.  D3 is so important for so many body functions, and is hard to get in the diet.  It is lauded for immunity support and strong bones.  The problem with D3 supplementation is the potential for the increased calcium absorption to end up as bone spurs, calcium deposits in blood vessels, and calcification in soft tissues.  K2 is absolutely essential to take in tandem with D3 to ensure your not doing more harm than good.  K2 will assist in placing calcium where it belongs in teeth and bone, and not in soft tissues.<br /><br />I love this product not only for combining D3 with K2, but also including bioperine.  Bioperine helps the body absorb certain things such as turmeric.  While I'm not aware of its possible assistance in absorbing vitamins, I do use it every time I take turmeric, beet root, or other herbs.  This product saves me money by combining three things I deem essential for my supplement regimen.  Thus, it makes this product about one third the price as all these supplements combined.<br /><br />Great Value! [SEP] For about 18 bucks (at the time of this writing), you get a 2 month supply of the critical vitamins D3 and K2. There's even a little calcium in this. Both D3 and K2 are critical for the absorption of calcium and D3 is a critical part of the immune system. With summer nearing an end, a lot of people will not have the needed sun exposure to produce the Vitamin D they need (many don't have it even in the summer).<br /><br />You're getting needed vitamins at a decent price. What's there not to like!? [SEP] Every formula of D3 and K2 is different so you need to be sure of what you want in the formula. Some have higher doses of D3 and some have more K2. Some add calcium and maybe the black pepper for absorption or even coconut oil. I prefer a lower dose of D3 as I take a D3 supplement. And the calcium in this brand is not enough for your daily dose, but it’s something . I also like a little more of the K2. But I can easily adjust my other supplements to balance my needs. I suggest you read and decide also. I am fairly new to this combination,  but I’m sold on the fact that together they are better then alone. The calcium in your blood needs a mechanism to steer it away from your heart ( calcification ) and into your bones . And that is the magic of D3 and K2. So whatever your formula needs are, add this combo to your life. It’s a good thing. This is made in the USA, non GMO and the contact info is on the label . This is a 30 day supply and your price will vary according to the formula. [SEP] In addition to a multi vitamin, I take one of these d3+k2 per day.  The label suggests 2/day but when combined with a multi vitamin I am good with one.  I also have d3+k2 in drops and gummies so I am constantly rolling a new one in.  Not the prettiest bottle but they get 5-star for being made in the USA. [SEP] Vitamorph’s D3/K2 preparation is a well balanced formula to promote strong bones as well as bolstering the immune system. All of us north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn need to supplement our Vitamin D levels and D3 is the best to accomplish that. We simply can’t absorb enough “D” from the sun to secure a robust immune response. The amount of D3 in the recommended 2 capsules per day is enough for most adults. The calcium along with K2 and bioperine promotes strong bones and teeth. The K2 is critical as it enables your bones to more readily absorb the calcium from the bloodstream. Bioperine is included to make the other ingredients more bio-available. A very complete supplement at a reasonable price. [SEP] A good inexpensive source of vitamin D3and K2.<br />I almost never get a cold or the flu and one thing that I always do is take Vitamin D3 during the winter months. [SEP] This one-a-day vitamin D3, K2, and calcium carbonate combo is just what my husband was looking for.  While the amount of calcium is small, the D and K are just right. One cap supplies 125 mcg - 5000 IU - of vitamin D and  enough K to keep his tendency to bleed just a little too easily completely in check.<br /><br />He is very happy with this reasonably-priced supplement and recommends it. [SEP] There is nothing that frustrates me more than when a supplementanufacturer uses ""Servings 1,"" but then somewhere else on the label recommends you take two-a-day. Let's just be upfront and let consumers know that this 60 capsule bottle will only provide a 30 day therapy. That makes this an incredibly expensive D3 supplement compared to other quality supplements. I don't like to be mislead. I will not recommend this product.",3,True
"Evolution Advance Nutrition BCAA Formula for Men and Women – Branched-Chain Amino Acids Supplement Support for Muscle Breakdown, Muscle Protein Synthesis and Energy Boost (120 Capsules, 500 mg)",[],[],,4.2,21,2982,"This is a quality natural product and non GMO. I have no complaints and no side effects.  BCAA formulas are working good for me. I have been taking them over the years but not every day. When I read the ingredients, this brand has a lot of goodness. I don't work out a lot other than using a treadmill and brisk walking, but being older I like this product because it helps with muscle fatigue. In my opinion this is a value brand compared to others I had purchased in local stores costing almost double in price. [SEP] Seems to be helping me after my workouts [SEP] These white pills are your average size so they're pretty easy to swallow.<br />No particular odor or any cons to them.<br />Have been using them in conjunction with my other supplements and have been seeing slight gains so I'm pretty happy with this product<br />If there's any changes I'll be sure to revisit this and add any other info I have. [SEP] I use BCAA after almost all of my workouts, especially if I know I'm going to be sore the following day. These have helped with my muscle recovery and the healing process. I am able to notice a difference when I do not take these. These are great if you are just getting started and even after crazy workouts. I know these mean a huge difference when I started CrossFit and I was continuously sore. These pills are easy to swallow and are pretty standard for BCAA. I've also done powder form but I find the pills more convenient. [SEP] I bought these on sale and would definitely buy them again! Great value for the price! [SEP] It’s hard to judge of a supplement is working or not unless you’ve been taking it for a long time, especially if taking multiple supplements. After a month of taking these my strength has increased so I’ll take that as a good sign. I take two capsules after a workout they are easy to swallow and have no taste. So I think I will order more and continue to take them. [SEP] Es eccelente para la energia y la recuperacion de los musculos cuando se entrena en el gimnasio, no siento dolores musculares despues de entrenar [SEP] There was a period of time where I pretty much stopped working out. For me that's unusual because I've been working out since I was 16 years old and I'm now in my early 40s. I always like to keep in good shape and these days concentrate on achieving a good physical condition to keep my health as a priority. I took an 8 month hiatus from working out, for no particularly good reason really. Needless to say, when restarting, it's always challenging at the beginning, but I'm glad that I did. After working out for about a month, and slowly working my body into the stress of physical training, I decided to get some supplements in order to help my now 42 year old body generate muscle mass. Along with other supplements such as protein, and oftentimes a pre workout drink, I decided to take the BCAA, to help me develop muscle mass and break certain plateaus of my training. I was pretty pleased with how I was able to achieve good gains in a reasonable amount of time, and I feel very strongly that the BCAA did a good job at helping me recover and build muscle mass. I would take two before workouts, two after my workout, and two with dinner. In the month that I used it, I did notice significant gains in muscle mass, as well as shorter recovery times. It's not a miracle worker by any means, but it does give you a nice edge to help with your training. My experience with it was very positive, and so I would recommend it if you're somebody who's looking to improve their muscle mass. [SEP] Excelente [SEP] Excelente producto.

[SEP] These are excellent boxes for gift giving, especially if the box needs to be kind of fancy (not like re-using old Amazon boxes) to match the occasion.  The come flat but are very easy to fold into a box and no instructions are necessary.  The boxes are textured and are a lovely white color. [SEP] Easy to assemble and decent construction. These boxes will be perfect for holding party favors or small beauty products for a beautiful unboxing experience. I used some of these for an event and others for giving out graduation gifts and they all looked great no matter the occasion. [SEP] I have added a photo of how I reinforce the bottom from the inside with clear packing tape. It's very subtle and helps for heavier items.  Very reasonable price for when you need gift boxes in a hurry. These boxes arrived quickly, well packaged and in great condition. The color and texture are very attractive. They are easy to assemble. I make candles, jewelry and use gift boxes with curly confetti packing paper to enhance gift presentation and pleasure in the customer when they open their gifts. I use tape to reinforce the bottom connecting points because of the heavy nature of candles and the need for added strength and insurance that the bottom will not give out. These are fine boxes and a good price. [SEP] Great product but flimsy [SEP] Great boxes!  We used these boxes to pack items for sale.  We will definitely purchase them again. Thanks for the great service and fast delivery. [SEP] These are really nice little gift boxes.  The 8x8 inch size makes them good for small gifts and baked goods.  I got these to package cookies and smaller cakes in and so far, they have been great.<br /><br />These come flat and are easily assembled for each use.  They seem pretty sturdy but I add a cake board for extra support for heavier items.  The only downside for baked goods is that they don’t have the nice display window.  These would work very well for gift boxes too [SEP] Like the box advertise's these are not designed for heavy gifts.  The boxes, are super easy to assemble.  The card board / card-stock is decent for jewelry ./ bakery items etc.  These will dent/ get crease marks or bent if not stored flat.  Overall, these are what I expected.  They didn't rip with normal handling which is nice. [SEP] So... these are not my favorite.<br />I did like that they are textured and they look really nice (once I figured out how to assemble it). However, I did not like how flimsy it was. I got these in hopes to use them as bridesmaids gift boxes but it wasn’t going to be possible without reinforcing with strong packing tape on both the I side and outside bottom. I felt like this made the box look tacky. You could definitely pay a bit more and get better quality but for the price & quantity you get with these, you can’t beat it. [SEP] This 10 pack of PACKQUEEN Gift Boxes are very elegant looking, they have really nice looking texture around the box with a nice layer of gloss over them. They close really easily and are really easy and quick to built. They do come all flat in a package which is awesome for storing until you are ready to actually build them. The bottom of the box does look a little weird... Like it’s not put together right, I did undo it and do it the other way and realized I did have it right the first time, so changed it back. So if you are going to be putting something kind of heavy in the boxes, a little bit of tape on the bottom would help reinforce it form anything falling out. Overall these boxes can be used for so many things and are very practical and easy to personalize them for any person or event. I highly recommend this 10 pack, and I will be purchasing again in the future!",3,True

I read carefully looking for that. I mean there are some places that should be obvious like anus, genitals, nipples and ears. But you also can’t use it around the head or neck and this was purchased to use on the neck. [SEP] Seeing significant results in first two weeks.  I was initially somewhat afraid to use this product after reading the micro-print instructions' list of contraindications, but decided to give it a try.  I was a bit startled the first time the laser discharged thinking the product was shorting out, but I quickly adapted to how it works. I have sensitive skin with a medium complexion. I use it on high and have not experienced any burning.  I follow my treatments with fresh aloe vera gel and moisturizer. [SEP] I've undergone laser hair removal from a professional salon before so I knew what I wanted from this device. The product is advertised as ""Permanent Hair Removal"" but after several months of using this product at the highest setting, I still have no evidence of any permanency. The hair does get thinner over time but it always grows back.<br /><br />In addition, the included instructions say there are areas of the body on which this should not be used. Such as the neck. That should have been mentioned on the product description page.<br /><br />The product is advertised as ""Laser Hair removal"" but it's simply not. No laser here. It is IPL technology (Intense Pulses of Light). The product description also implies that it is FDA certified. This is misleading. There is only only FDA certification for the general process of using high intensity light for hair removal.<br /><br />Misleading product information is bad enough in my book but more importantly, the product simply doesn't work. That is, unless your goal is to regrow thinner hair. In that case, it's marvelous. [SEP] 5/30/2022 - I am done with this. It has been in use at least once a week since December 28. There is no thinning no slowed growth. By now there should be some results, the hair is still back to above skin stubble within 24 hours  of shaving. After 6 months that means this doesn't work AT ALL. Zero stars.<br /><br />5/15/2022 - I have been using this once a week for almost 5 months now.  By now, I should start seeing slower hair growth and thinner hair. That's not happening.  I am sometimes zapping twice a week at level 4.  Level 5 hurts and I'm not ready for it.  It's not showing any results.  I will update this again in 2 months.  I do expect slower results but right now we're looking at NO results.<br /><br />This laser hair remover was definitely worth trying because covers a range of skin tones up to medium dark and most hair colors.  It’s an important factor as many of the at home units will only treat lighter skin tones.<br /><br />What you need to know:<br /><br />I am rating it for:<br /><br />Hair: medium, medium-coarse, coarse<br /><br />Skin:  Medium brown<br /><br />Areas:  Chin, jawline, upper lip, neck and legs<br /><br />Now let’s manage expectations:  This is an at-home product, it will not work at the same speed as professional machines for that price.  If professional sessions would work permanently in 6 months, I expect this to take double that time or a little more.  This little machine is costing less than a single professional treatment so I don’t expect it to work like my dermatologist’s monster unit.<br /><br />It is super easy to use.  I barely read the instructions (not recommended).<br /><br />The auto-zap setting is very convenient.  I prefer it to having to press the button for each inch of treatment.<br /><br />I have spent thousands on laser removal at a dermatologist that specialized in people of color skin tones.  It worked meaning that the hair fell off and took longer to regrow BUT after 6 months of treatments, I stopped and not only did all the hair grow back, but some of it also grew stronger and I got more in areas that had very little before.  Now it is very likely hormonal, and I could understand new hair growth but not in the areas previously treated over months.<br /><br />Week one, Level 1–daily treatment (not recommended).  I noticed some bald spots on my legs after use (probably from some of the hair being burned off.  I am doing it daily because I know that the mild zapping cannot and will not kill the hair root if left to a normal 4-week schedule.  My skin can handle it.  Do not take this as advice.<br /><br />I am now at week three and Level 3 – level 2 was easy and pain-free for me.  I can feel the zapping more at Level 3, I would not consider that pain.  My facial hair is still growing at its normal rate and looking the same.  I am not expecting visible results for another 3 to 5 weeks.  I am now zapping every 3 days.<br /><br />I will update this review when I have more to offer in terms of results or lack thereof.  For me, because I have so much facial hair, this is an expense I could justify whether or not it works in the long term.  It’s one of those things I had to try, because if it works, I will save thousands (that I don’t have anyway). [SEP] [[VIDEOID:e814c5008226f1a80eec317b315b584d]] This artistically sleek laser hair remover was an excellent find! It comes with a set of cool looking shades, that protect my eyes. The massive amounts of flashes you get from the quartz lamp of this marvel are almost a million; more than enough for three lifetimes and then some. With five levels of intensity, there’s simply not a pesky strain of hair on my body that can withstand this powerful, yet nimble handheld marvel! [SEP] This is an excellent entrant in the IPL market genre.  It follows an often used design form, that allows for comfortable handling and application.  The operation is deceptively easy, just keep in mind that the light energy is powerful, so use it cautiously and wear the provided protective eyewear.<br />IPL is Intense Pulses of Light, that is a treatment primarily for 'permanent' hair removal, and also in certain scenarios for skin treatments.  In this case, the product is designed for treating hair follicles with the eventual goal of permanent cessation of hair growth.  ""IPL treatment is administered through a handheld flashgun device that emits pulses of light, which are absorbed by the melanin pigment in hairs. The light turns to heat that is absorbed by the skin, resulting in damage to the follicle effectively removing hair and slowing down regrowth significantly.""(online reference).  After repeated treatment sessions, the regrowth cycles is disrupted to the point of no further hair renewal.<br />To be effective, the subject needs to qualify according to skin color and hair color.  Basically, light skin color and darker hair color are the ideal combination.  This is due to the intense light affecting melanin, the pigment. So, the contrast is necessary, and you want the light energy to affect hair pigmentation, and not skin, obviously.<br />Operation of this device is straightforward.  Plug in the AC power adapter cord.  A long press of the power button (with the power icon) will activate the IPL device.  The fan will start, and you'll see the display showing the number of flashes remaining, the intensity level (default is set at lowest), fan icon.  The display will also indicate if it's in auto or manual mode.<br />The user manual does a very poor job (actually non-existent) at explaining the manual mode.  In this mode, the user actually triggers the flash.  The significant other tells me that everyone uses the automatic mode because it's easier and faster.  Anyway, the large button above the power button switches between automatic and manual mode.<br />In automatic mode, when you press the flash window on skin it will trigger the flash. Then you lift it and move it to the next, adjacent target. Lower the flash window, touching the skin, which automatically triggers the flash again. This process is continued until you cover the targeted hair region.<br />They warn against overlapping and missing areas.  I wondered how a user can ensure that there is no overlap and avoid missing areas, when the flash window is not flush with an edge.  This is not an issue specific to this product, but to IPL devices in general.<br />I like the overall presentation and quality of the product.  Besides the IPL device, it includes a generic straight edge razor, protective eye wear, AC power adapter/cord and user manual.  While the user manual is adequate, I feel it could have been better, more informative.<br />Based on initial impressions and observations, this is a very competent and capable IPL device.  It is exactly as depicted and described in the product details.  It earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] After a few weeks of using Fidac's IPL hair removal device as directed, I haven't noticed much of a change in the amount of hair that grows back in a given area but the overall texture of said hair is much softer now. From the research I've done regarding IPL machines, hair removal is accomplished in stages and diminishing of hair coarseness is indicative of the IPL mechanism doing it's job successfully.<br /><br />The operability of this IPL device by Fidac is fairly easy to grasp, without much effort needing to be pursued but attempting to follow the provided user manual is pointless and confusing. I wound up watching a ""How To"" video to effectively master the proper steps in IPL and it was easier to understand because visual supports were provided. There is the added convenience of choosing the laser's energy level according to your preference, which is important because choosing the wrong level can lead to some major skin irritation and pain. As much as I wanted to love this product, I wasn't made aware of the multiple places on your body you cannot use the IPL device on, which I felt the company should disclose initially, as to not deceive customers and create an issue that could've been prevented.<br /><br />If there is anything you MUST do correctly, PLEASE follow all safety protocol in place and wear the provided protective eye-wear because those intense light emissions can cause retina damage. Due to the company failing to inform customers about areas to not use this device on before purchasing, in conjunction with a poorly written user's manual that should guide customers, I deducted 2 stars. Complete product disclosure and effective instructional guides should always be prevalent when selling a product to the masses, it's just good business and facilitates trustworthiness/ [SEP] [[VIDEOID:a7c6f4b5af92b028ac8dd2cce33d1435]] I had a previous one I like almost identical to this one and my daughter took off with it.  After a few uses, I have genuinely seen results. My leg hair has become thinner and it doesn’t grow back as quick as it used to. Also is not painful, you may feel a slight tingle if you use the highest intensity all the time. This comes with a razor and glasses to protect your eyes.  Definitely would recommend [SEP] Not powerful enough, slow, takes many “shots” to do anything, targets skin as well as hair, did very little on my hair unless I colored the surface hair black.<br /><br />There are a number claims in the advertising of this device that are doubtful or plain incorrect. When advertising is exaggerated or erroneous, I start to doubt all of the claims. Here is my observations and test results:<br /><br />This laser hair remover is NOT a laser. IPL Technology is not laser hair removal. IPL based systems use xenon flash lamps that emit full spectrum light. You can see the xenon lamp in the treatment window. Even one of the ad photos and the body text says it uses a quartz lamp. So obviously, it is not Laser Hair Removal even though it says so in the title.<br /><br />No type of IPL or Laser hair reduction techniques have been found that result in permanent hair removal.  At best hair regrowth is slowed and limited for 6 months to several years.<br /><br />The primary principle behind laser hair removal is selective matching of a specific light wavelength and pulse duration to obtain optimal effect on Melanin in the hair follicle with minimal effect on surrounding tissue.<br /><br />There is no information provided on the pulse duration or output power. The window on the device is rather large while the claimed treatment spot size is 3 square cm.<br /><br />There is no FDA certification for this device.  There is only FDA certification for the general process of using high intensity light for hair removal<br /><br />Not enough power to do much of anything on my hair color and skin color. Even after 8 shots at maximum power on the exact same spot the surface hair was untouched. If it can’t damage surface hair on top of the skin there is no way it is going to do anything on hair follicles under the skin. It did make my skin slightly red after 8 shots and it started to sting on the last two shots. It burnt my skin about the same time as it burnt my hair.<br /><br />I ran various tests on several different areas. It was most effective on my darkest arm hair.  I circled an area to use as demonstration with a black magic marker before I realized that the black color was the thing that made it work. Hair I colored with the black “sharpie: vaporized after several shots, even the marker on my skin vaporized and disappeared after several shots.<br /><br />Other experience:<br />The LED display is not evenly lite.  The center section is quite dim compared to the outside edges.  This makes it difficult to read.<br /><br />The tool is very slick.  Whatever I set it on it wants to slide off.  It will not stand up on its face because of the curve, you can’t lay it down because the cord comes out of the side it is stable on.<br /><br />The instructions are confusing and not clear.  You must hold down the “fire” button to get “automatic” repeat shot mode. On low power, shoots one shot every 1.5 seconds.  On max power, it is 1 shot every 3 seconds.  Very slow to treat a large area like my thigh.<br /><br />Overall, makes bright light flashes that are highly unlikely to result in permanent hair removal.  Doesn’t work on me. I won’t buy again. [SEP] I’ve used several home laser hair removal devices since they became available to the public. compared to the other ones that I used before, this one is easy to use, compact, so I can even keep it in my desk at work, and seems to be as effective as my largest, most expensive name brand one that cost three times more.<br /><br />Just be aware that it take multiple sessions to be effective as hair follicles alternate, some being dormant while others are active, so you think it's not working because hair keeps growing, but those were the follicles that were having a rest when you did the first session. also some stronger hairs will need a couple sessions, or stronger burst of light to die.<br /><br />Point being, it could take up to a year to be 'hair free' but you should start noticing significantly LESS/thinner hair in the treated area within a few months of use after treating all follicles while active.",3,True

ROOVJOY TENS Unit Muscle Stimulator Massager Pain Relief Electronic Device Dual Channels 22 Modes Electrical Therapy Electrodes Tens Machine,[],[],,4.3,81,55,"Even when sitting the tabs come off.  They don't stick well.  The TENS unit stimulates like it's supposed to, but even when just sitting still the pads come off. they need better adhesive.<br /><br />The unit isn't rechargeable.  You have to use batteries.  You can buy rechargeable batteries for it. [SEP] With 8 adhesive pads and two channels, and any number of operating modes, this unit does it all, and does it well. I love that I can run different programs on different parts of my body. I love how much better I feel after a treatment.  This TENS unit is wonderful. I'm tossing all the rest of mine. [SEP] I've been experiencing a lot of neck pain lately and was excited to try this TENS machine to see if it would help.  I am happy to report that it feels great and my neck feels better during treatment and for a few hours after treatment.  I use this machine most frequently at night, a couple of hours before bed.  It feels great on my muscles and provides pain relief.  I'm trying to avoid using medicinal pain relievers.  My doctor said that I have a bit of arthritis in my neck and that poor posture is exacerbating the pain.  I've been trying to be more aware of my posture and while that helps, this TENS machine provides extra relief on bad pain days.<br /><br />I found this machine easy to set up and begin using.  The manual made little sense to me though and I had to figure out how to set it up on my own.  I used a TENS machine many years ago, so I had a base of past knowledge to understand the set up, but it's not enough for people new to these machines.  As of the time of writing this review, the manufacturer has added a video showing how to set up the device.  I wish the video contained verbal or captioned instructions.  It's just music now, so if the manufacturer is reading these reviews, please add caption to the video! [SEP] After more than a decade of using TENS machines and this is my third. Frankly, I have been very happy with all of them and this one is no exception. While a TENS treatment does not cure permanently but it does give such relief and it’s so reassuring to know that you have this tiny, portable machine that can make a such difference. (I don’t use either EMS mode nor massage mode, but they are available in this machine).<br /><br />What I like about this one is that it has a size and shape that easily slips into a pocket. It is so intuitive to use you almost don’t need the very clear and almost perfect instruction booklet. I say “almost” because there are some things left unexplained. They weren’t explained in my old unit either but I had hoped to gain some insight now and didn’t.<br /><br />The cables that attach to the electrode pads have red and black tips. Like with jumping cables, red is positive and black is negative. The placement diagrams give no explanation as to why sometimes polarity matters and sometimes it doesn’t. Another gap is that no explanation is given as to the difference between program parameters. My old machine had 4 program modes, this one has 6. I’ve always assumed that P1 is weaker than the higher levels, but it’s never explained.<br /><br />Other than that, even if this is your first TENS machine, you’re going to find it easy-to-use and you will be comfortable with it from the get-go. It is logical and doesn’t waste your time having to choose a body part like other devices. This is a ridiculous choice. Once you set the time, the program mode, and the intensity of treatment the machine will provide the exact output you selected anywhere you place the electrode pads.<br /><br />The treatments are excellent—deep and intense--but, if you’re used to another device, the output modes are not standardized between devices. An output mode (strength of the pulsating current) set to 5 on this one is the equivalent of a setting of 15 on my previous one. This unit  has a feature that allows you to set the duration of treatment, although I’ve found the default of 30 minutes is ideal. It provides the relief you need, a longer time doesn’t really seem to add any benefit.<br /><br />It comes with two channels which means that two cords can be plugged in with two sets of electrode pads placed on different parts of the body. Maybe you want to treat your neck and lower back at the same time. Or you can use both sets of pads around one painful area. This is a scenario in which the positive and negative charges come into play, so check the diagram for that body part or the shape you want to use (like containing your painful area within a square).<br /><br />I have a pacemaker. While my doctors didn’t feel that the TENS waves would interfere with it, I still took the unit to my cardiologist’s office and had the technician check. They ran the pacemaker interrogator without the TENS and again with the TENS placed at shoulder level on the opposite side of the pacemaker and there was no interference. You might want to take a similar precaution for your own peace of mind.<br /><br />Other than the info I wish had been included in the booklet, my only other objection is that the sticky pads have to be stored on easy-to-lose transparent thick paper holders. If you drop it or put it on your desk, you lose it. A thicker, plastic holder should be provided. These pads are expensive and must be protected. For these two deficits, I’ve deducted one star to an otherwise close to perfect TENS machine—probably the best I’ve had when it comes to performance. [SEP] Nice unit that if used daily long term will help.  Not going to be an immediate fix.  I liked the price was not too high and the quality was pretty good. [SEP] The last time I used TENS units was when I was playing football in college.  Fast forward quite a while and now I have this unit.  I love it.  There are already some detailed reviews up but let me add this:  even though I had never operated one of these on my own, I was able to figure it out thanks to the directions and the presets on the device.  Thus, if you have never used a TENS unit, I can recommend this one to you because of it's ease of use. [SEP] While this should be a simple unit, the instructions are so badly written that I still haven't figured it out. Sure, I plugged it in and got power, but I have no idea how to change things, adjust things, or what the 3 different programs are or how they function. The good news is that it is powerful and that it works. The bad news is I still have no idea how to use it. So 5 stars for quality, and 1 star for function. [SEP] I admit I was nervous about trying this out but once I got the hang of using it, I have been utterly and completely thrilled with the pain relief it provides! I have degenerative discs in my neck which cause incredible discomfort, especially in the morning. But now I can simply attach the electrodes to my neck and program the unit and relax. I slowly build the intensity as my muscles become accustomed to the sensation of the current. There is no discomfort at all, just a kind of buzzing, tingling sensation. The only settings I found were not to my liking were the massage settings...they felt like tiny pin pricks from a showerhead set to too hard of a ""rain"" setting, but that could just be me. Overall, I highly recommend this unit and think it will prove to be very valuable for anyone with muscle pain or stiffness looking for an alternative to pain pills. I love it! [SEP] Okay, my Mom was a physical therapist and she swears by tens units.  However, her units that she'd come up with had like two simply knobs - strength and frequency.  Dead simple.  This thing is complicated and I found the directions very difficult to follow, so I've barely used it. [SEP] Compact",3,True

Speaking of smell, these are low odor.<br /><br />Duration? Because my nails grow out so quickly,  I am changing my manicure every 7-10 days.

[SEP] I've recently discovered the wonders of gel manicures! No drying time and they last for weeks? Sign me up! I love the colors included in this set! They are very vibrant and bright! The colors go on fairly thin so it takes a couple of coats to get good coverage. The glitter polish is a bit on the chunky side, which is pretty, but rather hard to get it to look even. The polish arrived nicely packaged in a box with foam to hold it in place and a color dot on top of each bottle to quickly identify the colors since gel polish arrives in black bottles.

The color ones out nice looking. This has the top coat for those who like shiny and the matte effect. When they were done they looked beautiful.<br /><br />Dislikes: The gel polish takes a little longer than others I have used to be cured using a UV lamp. The gel came of of my daughter's toes only after 3 days which surprised me. I dehydrated her toe nails, filed them and did all the necessary steps keep them clean and dry for longer lasting coverage of the gel polish. Most of the gel on the toes are completely off while a few are just chipped and others are full on. I have had her in the house for the past 3 weeks so there is no reason the gel should have come off.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone looking for a gel polish that will last you at least a week because only after a few days. [SEP] Vibrant Colors!!! [SEP] This is a great holiday color palette, the greens and reds especially for Christmas, but you can still use it for Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, etc. I also like that the tops of the bottle caps have the colors on them already, making it easy to pick out the color(s) you want to use. Plus with the 3 bonus coats, you really can't go wrong with this set. [SEP] This gel nail polish set is awesome. The colors are perfect for Christmas holiday. [SEP] Our family has a house full of fingernails and toenails that are always being painted.  Finding a set that provides colors we all like, economical options, long lasting finishes, and full kits with not just the colors, but also the base and top coats is a challenge.  There are many options online and at the store, and Pine brand gel nail polish has become a favorite of ours. We like having the base coat, a light colored finish coat, and then the option of ending with either a glossy or matte finish coat, all from one kit and from one company.  I have used other company’s products from start to finish and while mixing the brands from base to finish coat, and the gel nails still look nice.  Using the products in this kit, and then also with other Pine brand colors, simply provides a long lasting finish that is much cheaper than going to the salon.  Pine advertises that they can provide a high quality finish with just one color coat, and that is true, however, a two-coat color finish is much better.  We typically get two to three weeks on our fingernails, and even a bit longer on our toenails.  I like using the matte finish on the green colors, but the rest in my family prefer the glossy and pinks.  Regardless, Pine provides a great product and this kit should definitely be part of your supplies.  We love them, and so will you! [SEP] My favorite polishes so far!

In addition they do provide a COA on their website, although I would have preferred to have seen a scanned PDF rather than just a  table. In the end though all that stuff is pretty hard to verify, but the fact that they went out of their way to put it on the website is a good thing. I also appreciate that this company pushes the sustainability and vegan angle.<br /><br />I'm going to be using these in conjunction with cilantro for detox. I'm early in but no issues yet and I feel better about using these due to what I mentioned above over a random brand that doesn't have a COA, is sourced in china, and doesn't care about veganism/sustainability.<br /><br />I am taking off a star because the marketing was using some kind of annoying tactics - for example, "" it also can contain protein, vitamin b12, iron, vitamin C, vegan omegas, fibre and small amounts of magnesium, zinc, copper, potassium, calcium, folic acid and other B vitamins.* "" Note ""can contain""... classic ""weasel wording""...  Ok, well if you value third party COA's, why not actually verify the nutrient percentage in these batches? [SEP] These are a good, basic way to take chlorella that's more convenient and less messy than powder.  We take chlorella for a few reasons in our house, in particular to help remove lead from our bodies.  We have an old house with lead paint on surfaces as well as in the soil around the house. Our kid was tested with slightly elevated lead levels, and on the advice of a doctor we started taking chlorella.  Even though our exposure to lead probably hasn't stopped, kid's lead levels have stopped going up and started declining.<br /><br />These capsules are easier to take than powder, and less messy.  Chlorella will leave grass stains on light fabrics if it gets smeared in there.  These capsules are a nice bright green, and smell fresh. [SEP] The thing about supplements is they are hard to prove or disprove. So many factors. Was your body already in the healing stage? Did you stop sitting on a certain couch that was causing it? Did it really work?<br />I'm a realist. Unless I can say with 100% proof positive conclusion; I'm not saying either way.<br />I got these for myself, my wife, and our dog. All 3 of us are experiencing joint issues. Have they cured any of us? No. Have we been on them for months? No. Do they work? unsure. Is it worth a try? YES!!! Does pain hurt??? YES!!!<br />unless I can prove something doesn't work I rate it 5 stars. Because I don't want to smear any brand's good name.<br /><br />So the best anyone can do is the following:<br />1) limit sitting time! Sitting for too long can cause these same issues. Your body needs exercise, and until you give it said exercise, expect to continue hurting. Of course there are exceptions, but that's just my findings. In times (like during snow storms) when I find myself watching a lot of TV or playing a lot of video games, I experience pain in the joints. Its conclusive. The 2 go hand in hand.<br />2) Use a cain to get up if necessary, and exercise WISELY. Don't over do it. But don't do nothing either! A good steady walk down my local main street at night enjoying the lights seems to help.<br />3) Research any remedy. The ingredients on this look promising. Its exactly what my research suggested I needed, so I'm taking it. Time will tell.<br />4) For the pooches the same rules apply. They're just like us only covered in fur.<br />Hope this helped somehow. [SEP] Terrible cramps & diarrhea!<br />Spent two days on the toilet!<br />Worse gas pains ever",3,True

However, I will say that we saw no really change in her overall health including her gut health and going to the bathroom. In my opinion this is one of those things that you take everyday because someone tells you too... but you don't really have a way of knowing if they are really working or not. [SEP] I have a kid who is always sick, and her tonsils are enlarged so she catches everything. She has been taking these and well I don't see a huge difference. She is sick as we speak, and she still has some constipation issues. She says they are tasty and easy to take which is a plus, I gonna let her finish these out before I decide to buy more. [SEP] Getting kids to eat healthy is not the easiest chore in the world and they need good gut health as much as adults do.  I think these chewable probiotics are a good way to get some extra probiotics into your kids.  I have teens that won't drink my home made kombucha or kefir (loaded with naturally occurring probiotics) so I like to give them probiotics in a chewable form and these were a big hit.  These have a high CFU which are derived from 5 strains of bacteria.  There are probiotics in pill form that have a much higher CFU count from many more strains, but most kids balk at taking pills. [SEP] My kids are super picky. It's like they know they are eating something for their health and immediately is ""bad"", BUT these are great! They love eating them. The flavor is not strong, but enough to be tasteful for them. They have a great consistency and are chewables.<br />They are sugar free and thats really a plus.<br />In times when health is so important this probiotics are the best.<br />Like them! [SEP] My boys love the taste of these probiotics and I love that they keep them healthy, regular and are sugar free! Total mom win in my book!! [SEP] These are easy to consume for children. The flavor and texture weren't that great. It was a bit too chalky. Haven't noticed any gastrointestinal benefits yet. [SEP] This is a good probiotic for kids. It tastes good and what's important for me is that it includes a hefty dose of probiotics, at least for a chewable tablet: 5 billion CFU.<br /><br />The formula also includes inulin, which is a good prebiotic, i.e. food for the good bacteria. I look for this when buying a probiotic.<br /><br />For my 8-year old daughter, the real issue is taste, and she really does like the taste of this, so this product is a winner by my definition. [SEP] My kids love the flavor of these probiotics. They are crunchy and taste like mixed berries. They help with tummy troubles (especially after a course of antibiotics) and we've had fewer digestive difficulties since we started using them. They come in individual blister packs that are very easy to open. Because they like the flavor it is much easier to get them to take these probiotics than the sort you dissolve in water. For that reason, I recommend these for kids. [SEP] I like it and it's potent, not my favorite one since it still makes my daughter sick but hopefuly she'll get over the probiotic stomach bug soon. The price is good too. My daughter likes the taste. [SEP] These are pretty much identical to the culturelle chewable probiotic. As with any probiotic, there is some risk of infection in vulnerable individuals,  but as a chewable there is less risk than those formulations with free powder. The flavor is good and the size is about the size of an m&m. I have no real issues with these.",3,True

That means at $20 a bottle (at the time of this review) that you would be paying $60 a month to take this supplement.  I am not sure it is worth that.<br /><br />COUNTRY OF ORIGIN?<br />This says on the bottle that it is manufactured FOR a place in FL and FORMULATED in the US, but it does not say where it is actually made that I can find on the bottle.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this helped me some at a lesser dose than recommended, if taken as it says, it is pretty expensive.  I am not sure it is worth it to get 3 bottles a month.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />THREE STARS.  Although it does work, it is a bit high priced and the bottle contains so little compared to monthly recommendations, I can not rate this higher than 3 stars. [SEP] I kind of consider this supplement as a back-up to my other supplements and vitamins because although it contains very good things, it doesn't contain some of them in high enough quantities for me.  For instance, I normally take at least 250mcg D3 10,000 IU) daily, and this supplement only contains 3.3 mcg which is a mere fraction and that requires 2 capsules.  But, I like a lot that it contains 167 mg of quercetin, and 167 mg of elderberry, both extremely important in keeping one's immune system strong and healthy.  Overall, I think this is a very good supplement for the immune system but more D3, C, and zinc should be taken along with this. [SEP] Review for: Potent Garden Immune Support -Quercetin with Vitamin C and Zinc Elderberry Supplement C<br /><br />These capsules contain a lot of things to really boost the immunity. They are fairly large but still go down ok. My only concern is the dosage. In one place on the bottle it states that the does is 2 capsules per day and in another it says to take 6 per day. I guess everyone would need to assess the situation and take what they think is right by reading the % of daily values on the bottle. Other than Vitamin D, this combination does seem to have everything that I take for immunity.<br /><br />The bottle says that the product is formulated in the USA but not where it is made. When I read something like this, I usually assume it is made in China and the company does not want to state that. In this case, I would only be guessing on that information. [SEP] I have been taking several different supplements and found this one to contain a lot of the supplements that I have been using so instead of taking a bunch of those, I thought I'd try this one.<br />The only drawback is the cost.  I haven't calculated it out yet to see if the cost outweighs my bulk purchase on my other pills but it's more convenient.  Just needed to up the dosage a bit [SEP] I got this for the Quercetin, Vitamin D and Zinc but realized it also has Vitamin c which is a great extra boost, Tumeric is supposed to be good for joints, ashwagandha, selenium and zinc is also supposed to help boost your health.  You should take 2 a day but can take up to 6 to help if you are not feeling well.  I feel good taking the booster have not noticed any side effects.  Seems to be about average cost for a vitamin boost.  I recommend this as it seems to be a good health booster which is needed during times like this.",3,True
"[2 Pack] Fiber Gummies for Adults and Kids - Prebiotic Fiber Supplement Immune Booster, Digestive Support, Constipation Relief, Gut Health, Vegetarian Formula",[],[],,3.9,34,2101,"These are OK fiber gummies. Each serving provides 5g of fiber, which is decent but not outstanding. Additionally, a serving consists of THREE gummies, so a bottle of 60 will last only 20 days. The taste is fine (sort of a berry-ish flavor mostly) but there's 3g of added sugar per serving (sugar is the second most common ingredient), which is rather high. The consistency is firm bordering on rubbery, and it sticks to my teeth, which is annoying.<br /><br />The fiber is from chicory root which is the usual go-to source for fiber in gummies. It uses natural flavors and natural colors, which is a plus.  The country of manufacture is not listed on the bottle, which can mean that it's not made in the US.<br /><br />Weighing all the factors (taste, formulation, serving size, cost, ease of use) puts my rating at three stars (average). It's not a bad fiber gummy, but it's not outstanding compared with other similar options that are available. [SEP] I love having a fiber/probiotic in my routine.  These are easy to take and taste great.  They are a chewy and firmer gummy which is what I prefer.  I love that everyone in the house can take them as well to help with gut issues. [SEP] these are way better then expected, got these as a second choice. these are much better then the ones i originally wanted. will def purchase again [SEP] Sweet gummies to that have fiber?  Sweet!<br /><br />The package contains two bottles of 60 gummies for a total of 120 gummies.  Recommended daily dose is 3 gummies a day, so the package has enough gummies for 40 days.<br /><br />They have a lot of claims with their gummies: reduces leaky gut, enhances immune response, decreases toxins in your blood, lowers risk of intestinal infection, and betterlevels of good gut bacteria.  No,idea how to rate their claims, but it’s pretty remarkable that a gummy can do all that.<br /><br />I do know that they do stick to your teeth. The taste is fine, even sweet enough for kids to like. They are Gluten-Free and have no milk, eggs, or peanuts. So they are pretty allergy friendly.<br /><br />But it’s a little disappointing that when taking the recommended daily dose of 3 gummies a day, you are only getting 5 grams of fiber which is 18% of recommended daily intake. I guess as a supplement, that’s okay.<br /><br />I have lots of digestive issues and found them to cause gas and discomfort. My grandkids tried them and didn’t have any issues. So, they are now part of my grandkids daily regimen. [SEP] My diet isn't what it should be; I eat on the run, I eat late- and I eat ""junk"" when I am on the road (which is frequently the case in my work). I use these for two reasons- keeping everything ""moving"", and because fiber helps with cholesterol. I like and eat high-fiber foods, but when I am on the road? Salads and oatmeal don't lend themselves well to eating-whilst-driving.<br />Fiber gummies are easy and convenient. [SEP] I love having a fiber/probiotic in my routine.

I do not like stuff like this to be in a box that could get smashed, waterlogged or otherwise damaged. A dedicated pouch with a string as a hanger would be much more practical<br />- the temperature switch (on the cable) is very touch sensitive - this might be a defect of my particular eye mask: when I set it on HIGH, and I just lightly move the cord by the magnetic attachment, it will turn off entirely. So in order to not disrupt the heating, I have to set it on MEDIUM or LOW for it to work (because everyone moves around a bit....)<br /><br />AND MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT:<br />- the mask stays on 15 minutes at a time, which in my opinion is a very short time - it should be longer!<br />- THE DESIGN IS WRONG! No matter how I shift the mask, the cutout shape for the nose is too small meaning the mask is sitting either mostly on the top of my eyes and I can peek from under the mask and see daylight (and my nose is nicely cleared), or I push it over my eyes, and then the mask and its padding pushes onto my (rather large, I admit) nose and sinuses and makes wearing it VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.<br />I have to say, my head is truly somewhat larger and so is my nose, so this discomfort might be due to the proportions of my face features, I don't know....<br /><br />So all in all, mostly because of the awkward design and therefore the uncomfortable fit, I hardly ever use this mask.<br />Wasted money for me, but this could probably be a good fitting mask for someone who has a more delicate face with a smaller nose, and whose cord isn't too touch-sensitive where it just shuts off.... [SEP] [[VIDEOID:8647017f2488f16ab2dd184cc05ef32d]] Sadly I've dealt with migraines most of my life and this has helped immensely! Cancels out all light and the warmth is incredible. Any time I feel one coming on, I slip it on and it eases up. Nice soft material. Fits nicely across the nose and around the eyes. I HIGHLY recommend it! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:8965b91328a590c5b87d78bc425d90c0]] This heated eye mask is a fantastic way to soothe your eyes and get some much needed relaxation. This is for dry heat only, something to keep in mind if you need moist heat therapy for your eyes like I do, but I still enjoy this for relaxing while I listen to my audiobook.<br />The fit is decent, although I do notice that it goes pretty far down on my nose when I line my eyes up with the “holes,” making nose breathing a little awkward while wearing this. It gets a good light seal when lined up properly, but that’s the position that breathing is weird in for me.<br />The heat is nicely distributed along the edges of the mask as well as over the part that goes over your eyes (the “eye holes”), but for myself I can only feel the heat when this is turned onto its max setting, to me it feels like it should just be an on/off switch because the lower two settings I don’t feel like it’s actually on.<br />The magnetic power cord attachment is a really cool feature that adds safety in case you fall asleep in it, but also makes attaching the cord very easy if it accidentally comes off while you have the mask on.<br />Overall I do enjoy this mask for relaxation, but I still have to use moist heat on my severely dry eyes that this cannot provide. [SEP] To start the eye mask wraps around and wasn’t comfortable on my ears. The mask itself is comfortable and the pockets make it nice so the pad isn’t sitting on your eyelids. The temp gets warm but I wish it got just a little warmer. So I gave this an average score because unfortunately that’s what it is. Average. Nothing fancy. [SEP] So this mask is nice. It feels well made, fits my head well. You do have to have it plugged in which means it would be inconvenient to nap with, and my only complaint is that the heat seems to be concentrated directly over the eyelids, but since the mask itself is formed with ""protruding"" areas over the eyelids, that part of the mask doesn't touch your face so you can't feel it. There is very slight heat in the rest of the mask but even on high it's really not enough to have any effect [SEP] I tried many eye masks, but this one stands out because the fabric is really comfortable and smooth. The temperature heats up fast and consistently. My tolerance stays in medium heat which is green. Red is too hot for me. I really like the magnetic charging cable. When I fell asleep and turned my body, it disconnected easily without waking me up. The cord is long enough either for my nightstand USB plug or sometimes I just use a small power bank under my pillow. Also, this is very affordable. I love this eye mask! [SEP] Small, more navy blue than black, does not feel quality, gave me immediate headache. It barely connects on the velcro. Not modern looking. Power cord is thin and weak. Does not ""charge"" you have to use it plugged in unlike other sleep masks. There are much better options for the same price on Amazon. Sorry. [SEP] This mask comes with a charging usb no block, earplugs, the mask and instructions on use. It is easily adjusted with a velcro strap.<br /><br />I found this heated mask to be the most comfortable mask I've ever wore to bed. The heat was comforting and helped my sinuses a bit. This mask keeps out all light and the material is soft and easy on the skin.<br /><br />I highly recommend this mask, it's just fabulously comfortable and comforting. I love it [SEP] I’d say this product is pretty decent for the price. You’re getting what you pay for with this one. It comes with a usb cable to charge the mask which is a very nice inclusion. However, the material the mask is made of is not pleasant to wear for long durations of time, but it is manageable. I’d recommend this product if you’re looking for a quick, cheap option for a heated eye mask. Overall, I give this product 4 stars because of the material used [SEP] Soft.  Cups over the eyes without touching the eye ball.  Fast shipping. Those 3 attributes are ok.  The strap goes over the ear which feels weird.  The heat is lame.  Inadequate for treating my MGS dry eye.  They did some due diligence in design with the magnetic cord attach point.  And it's ergonomic eye cup contour.  If what you want is a lukewarm fuzzy for your eyes, go ahead and buy this.  If you want 104 degrees F. for treating your dysfunctional meibomian glands - look elsewhere.  Returning the item was easy so I gave it 2 instead of 1 star.",3,True

Though, I've tried it on my ""it's winter and also during Covid times"" upper leg hair, and it works okay, but it pulls hair quite frequently, and that hurts! Like all others, I thought I would be able to use it in the shower, but apparently, it's a risk to do so according to the written instructions. So, I won't be using this thing in the shower on my *bikini* area where I intended to use it...where it says it's intended to be used. I'm not quite sure what will happen if I do, and I'm not one for taking chances.<br />I don't like the thought of an unknown catastrophe with a lithium battery, nor do I like my hair being yanked from its roots. I do like having clear and concise specifications and directions. There are none to be found here. So, if you're like me, pass this one by. Otherwise, go for it! [SEP] I ordered this to try for my legs. That’s the only part of my body that I use shavers.<br />It was a nice surprise that it is very easy to use. Comfortable to grab. Does not pull the hairs, it cuts them.<br />My legs were smooth after using it. It did not irritate my skin.<br />Easy on the knees! Weird place to shave!<br />I really like it.<br />I did not feel like my shave lasted more than when using the regular shavers.<br />And it definitely not as sturdy as my husbands. It’s on the middle of a razor and my husband machine. But that’s ok with me. Anyway they don’t last forever.<br />The battery life is very good. And the charging time is short.<br />My legs are smooth and ready for summer! [SEP] This works great for when you're in a pinch and need to quickly shave without getting a shower. I've used to quite a few times on my legs already. It works well and gives a pretty close shave. I feel like it is a little bit ""pinchy"" but not enough to actually bother me and maybe that's just user error. I love that it's re-chargable and you don't have to replace any batteries. [SEP] I have tried several electric shavers and none have been able to give me as smooth and close a shave as a basic manual razor does. This one comes really close. You get a pain free close shave in record time. The shave has a nicely shaped body that makes it easy to hang onto even with wet hands. It has not caused me any skin irritations.<br /><br />The shaver comes with a charging cable and a brush for cleaning. Mine had a good charge when it arrived and recharging is done in 1-2 hours if it is totally dead. [SEP] It works!  I used to watch my Dad shave with an electric razor and thought how come women don't have something like that?  I guess I had never seen one for us before.  I jumped at the chance to try this and I'm happy I did, now I can shave anytime and it's nice if you're in a hurry.  This works well and takes the hair down.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the quality of the razor is really lacking... It's cheaply made and I honestly don't know how long it will hold up.  The charging port will probably break first.  The battery lasts as long as I need it to and it charges quickly.  It's so cheap you can afford to get another one if it breaks.  However, I would say to invest in a better quality one. [SEP] This cordless razor for women has a nice design, but has performance issues. It seems to have a decent battery, but the overall power is rated at 3W. Compared to cordless hair clippers that are rated at minimum of 5W, and most are much higher than that. This could account for the suspect effectiveness of the device. Also, like many electric razors, the hairs should not be long. Long hairs tend to get pulled in most electric razors, that's just the tendency of long hair and moving blades. So, at best, this works best with fine, short hairs. If you use it daily, there will be less pulling, and a more comfortable shaving experience. Is this ideal? No, but that's the best circumstance to use this device.<br />The product details mentions in some spots that this is a 'wet/dry' device. The user manual explicitly states to keep this device away from wet conditions. Huge discrepancy. If someone just followed th product details and not carefully read the user manual, there could be serious issues. This serious misinformation negatively affects the ratings.<br />The product details also says it has a lithium battery. The product states it has a Ni-Cd battery, huge difference. There are more discrepancies, but these two major items suffice to note that the product details give inaccurate (and possibly dangerous) information.<br />Based on these considerations and issues, I would caution anyone considering this product. [SEP] This rechargeable electric razor does look and feel cheap as others have mentioned. I do like the shape of it as it is easy to hold. I wish there was some texture on the body to provide a better grip. I used this to shave the bikini area and I thought it did a great job. The size of the shaver head was perfect for me for that area (much easier to maneuver compared to my old battery standard sized shaver head which I'd been using for years). I didn't experience any snagging of the hair as others have mentioned. The hair was pretty long but I just went over it with a light hand until it got short and then I got a close shave. I like that one side of the blade is curved for the under arms and bikini area (although I did those areas just fine with the straight side too). I think the biggest thing that I don't like is the way the blade/ foil is removed in order to clean. Mine was a mess inside because there was some kind of lubricant/vaseline type substance in there and the hairs were all stuck. I had to wipe all that gunk out. It wasn't the easiest the clean compared to my old shaver. I feel like this new one is not really meant to be cleaned or it would've had a better design to open up the shaver head. Another issue is that this is not to be used in or around water which is kind of inconvenient. I think the only thing I would put under water is the blade/foil once it's removed from the body. I wouldn't trust rinsing it under water while attached to the body like they show in the product video. On my unit when the blade/ foil is removed, I see a little piece of sponge/ foam in the center and underneath that it looks like it's opened into the handle. Definitely don't want to get water in there. I wish there was an included protective cover like my other shaver. I like that it is rechargeable by using the included micro USB cord. The handle glows red when it's charging and turns off when it's done. There is more to be desired but it gets the job done so it's not a total waste. I also don't know why the box says 'epilator' because it is not. [SEP] This electric shaver is simple in design, making it easy to use and maintain. The cutting power is surprisingly good, as it shaved my long leg hair down to smooth in no time. The shaver head can be easily pulled out for cleaning. IT made easy work of arm, chest, and leg hair. The real challenge was going to be the bikini area. It performed well! very minimal, if any, snagging of hair down there, and the end result is very close to baby smooth, save for a few stubborn grains of hair. I highly recommend to give the MHSY Electric Razor a try. [SEP] This has got to be the best electric shaver I've ever ordered. I have tried lots of them. It has a sturdy handle making gripping nice and easy especially as it's a wet and dry shaver giving you a firm hold even when it's wet. It gives a lovely close shave and it's great for using on all different parts of my body. Great razor I'd definitely recommend it! [SEP] Doesn’t cut very well.",3,True

This is aimed to provide you with flexibility, a good vitamin/mineral supplement and herbal supplements. [SEP] These pills are big, and 2/day is the recommended dosage.  I think they are good, but if I'm swallowing that many big pills I would like for them to contain more vitamins and minerals than they do.  I know they aren't supposed to be a mulit-vitamin, but a good mulit-vitamin contains all that and more.  i've been taking them for about two weeks and have not noticed any negative side effects or stomach upset. [SEP] I love the premise of this; vitamins to help you feel good during practice and contribute to keeping you fit and limber. This line has such a wonderful array of products and this is no exception. I've only been taking them for a few days but so far I like them a lot and recommend giving them a try. [SEP] This isn't really  a ""yoga"" formula per se, and more of a joint and mobility formula that may help keep your joints feeling good. It contains very small amounts of a few vitamins and minerals. The main ingredients are the ""proprietary blend"" which contains glucosamine sulfate (which is the good form of glucosamine - avoid the HCL version), MSM, and Chrondroitin and a few other nutrients that may help ease pain and strengthen joints. I have been taking many of these ingredients for years and it could be the reason at 40 I still am able to run 80+ miles a month pain free.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of these ""blends."" Just tell us how much of each ingredient is in there. I take glucosamine and MSM regularly and it would be nice to know! Also, it's hard to find out anything about this company. A lot of these supplement companies start up and are basically importers of Chinese ingredients (not bad per se, since most raw materials are made there these days). However, it would be nice to know more about the company.<br /><br />So, overall 4 stars, and not 5 for the reasons I listed above. [SEP] As a yoga instructor, I don't know if these will make anyone more flexible, but they are a nice blend of B vitamins and Zinc and others vitamins and minerals commonly lacking amongst active women. They are also very easy to swallow and only require two tablets a day. [SEP] I honestly didn't really notice a difference, I guess that doesn't mean that the benefits weren't there.  I was hoping to have some added flexibility, but I didn't really notice that.  I am a daily yoga person and have been trying to improve my flexibility to master some new moves, this didn't seem to assist in that. [SEP] this is a larger pill so if you have trouble swallowing this may not be for you.  I've been taking this supplement for a few weeks with no ill effects.  Hard to judge the efficacy of anything like this until you use it for some time but so far so good. [SEP] So I'm not really sure why these are marketed to yoga in particular, but it effectively got me to take a second look, so there's that. Anyway, a quick glance at the ingredient list tells me that the active ingredient is glucosamine chondroitin which has limited evidence of efficacy, but does have some evidence. I had no real problems with them. My only constructive criticism would be that these would be better packaged as a capsule than a tablet as the taste as it hits the tongue is not appealing. That is really only worth removing one star though, because the taste is so momentary anyway, and it is otherwise a fine product. They are a bit large, but I was able to swallow them. [SEP] I have been using this vitamin this past month to help with mobility and flexibility. I have been experiencing knee and ankle issues for over a year. As a result, I have been in physical therapy for the last 4 weeks and I have been taking this. This past week, I started to feel okay again. My physical therapist said that she felt I was healing much more quicker than what she thought would happen and I believe its because of this. [SEP] I will advocate for the effectiveness of these ""Yoga"" supplements - and I don't do yoga.  I'm sure that if you are a yoga enthusiast, this formula will be effective for you also.  They worked, however, to help alleviate my tendonitis and bursitis in my right shoulder, and after a day where I worked out extra hard, it left my muscles and joints less sore the next day.  Effective over a course of time also!  I would definitely recommend these.",3,True

I have both 50:1 and 40:1 trimmers.<br /><br />I did the math and found 4.81 milliliters gets me the 50:1 mix with 8 ounces of gas, and 5.91 milliliters gets 40:1 with 8 ounces of gas. Allows very precise and clean mixing. I use an empty Seafoam can or similar as the screw cap seals well and to avoid having lots of unused 2 cycle mix sitting around going stale. I use a measuring cup with funnel to get 8 ounces of gas spot on from my gallon container.<br /><br />50:1 requires 2.6 ounces of 2 cycle oil per 1 gallon of gas. 8 ounces is 1/16 of a gallon. Divide 2.6 by 16 to get 0.1625 ounces of 2 cycle oil. Convert ounces to milliliters and you get 4.81.<br /><br />I used the same formula for 40:1, substitute 3.2 ounces, divide by 16, get 0.2 ounces, convert to milliliters and get 5.91. Ratios stay the same and my trimmers are happy. [SEP] Needles are not in sterile packaging, so if you need that, you will have to autoclave yourself or use other antiseptic/sterile measures. Great for ink cartridges and vape cartridges though! [SEP] Excellent quality and great for filling fountain pen cartridges. [SEP] Yes i needed to get leftover ink from my pen...  i like my pen!!!  But worked like a charm.  Guess not usually a normal reason but the hole is too small for anything else and this worked like a charm.  Thank you!! [SEP] More then I wanted however worked perfect.  I burnt out coils in some of my cartridges before they were half way done.  But after a new atomizer and this product I was able to salvage everything I thought I would be throwing out [SEP] Worked good. Good price. Good delivery time.

We actually grow a few moringa plants in spring and summer as it’s warm enough for the plant. ( north Georgia ) And we bring them inside for the winter. We simply add the leaves to whatever we are cooking. Now the organic powder is available many places and it couldn’t be easier to add this to your diet. This “ tree of life “ as it’s called is packed with vitamins, minerals and amino acids and is used all over the world for health. This is a clean, organic powder with carefully sourced ingredients. I simply keep the bag on the table and sprinkle it on my dinners . We have also enjoyed moringa in capsules and as tea, so whatever your choice, get some moringa inside you. This bag is 7.4 ounces and 30 servings, but it seems to last a lot longer than that. There is no recommended daily amount, as it’s a plant and you can indulge. Definitely try it ! [SEP] I love powdered supplements like this one because there are so many options regarding their use. This moringa  leaf is excellent  - I've added it to oatmeal, tea, smoothies and even soup. It has an extremely mild but pleasant plant flavor that isn't noticeable in anything but the most bland drinks. Moringa is loaded with nutrients and antioxidants for good health, appearance and immune protection. Highly recommend. [SEP] The packaging is eco-friendly and ensures that the contents will stay as fresh as possible. It gives the company story which makes me feel good about using this moringa. It's a good value. There are 30 servings in the package. Unfortunately, this is not the freshest tasting product I've ever had. I love that it's organic. I love other things about it though.

Cocoa Bean Facial Scrub,[],"['Crushed cacao nibs gently polish away bumps, flakes, and dullness. We source the highest quality organic and fair trade Ecuadorian cacao, which contains beneficial antioxidants and natural caffeine to reduce redness and promote a soft, glowing complexion.']",,3.0,21,358,"Maybe my skin is too dry or too sensitive because I just didn't experience many positive results from 100% Pure's Cocoa Bean Facial Scrub. The scrub is contained in a tube with a screw on/off lid.  Reminds me of toothpaste as it is fairly thick and dispenses rather firm. Does not lather. Contains small cacao 'nibs' for exfoliation. Has a pleasant chocolate scent that is not long lasting.  The scrub is supposed to exfoliate, polish away bumps, flakes and dull spots, calm redness, promote a balanced tone and make skin glow.  The only result I experienced was soft skin.  And I do mean soft.  But there was no glow to my skin, the red patches (dryness + eczema) didn't go away and dull spots remained. Softening my skin was a nice benefit but not enough to warrant continued use of the scrub. I have no plans to purchase /use this in the future. [SEP] This facial scrub is chunks of cacao nibs and the hydrating mask. The pieces of nibs are so large they mostly just hurt my face, its like rubbing pebbles on your face. The hydrating mask feels very nice, but I can't get over the pebbly nibs. [SEP] I loved how this made my skin feel after using. No unexpected reactions from my sensitive skin. [SEP] I have tried a few different facial scrubs and was very disappointed in this one.  I have another tube of ""scrub"" similar to this one that I refuse to use.  I will be purchasing my favorite REAL scrub when my current tube is nearly out.  It is about half gone now so it shouldn't be too long.  What I like about MY facial scrub is that it has plenty of ""scrubbies"" in the paste that I put on my face.  That way I can get all the dry, flaky skin off my face, clearing the way for new, clean skin to be washed with a gentle soap and then moisturized with a light facial oil.  I have dry skin as I am older - I don't have ""dual"" skin with oily and dry patches.  I have dry skin, period.  The ""scrubbing granules"" in my favorite facial scrub ensures that all the old skin is gone.  This product is so wimpy - it has barely anything scrubby in the paste meaning I would need to use about half the tube just to get enough scrubbies on my face to get rid of the dead, dry skin on my face (especially on my forehead and around my nose).  Just not worth it for my particular skin. [SEP] This cocoa face scrub has a very short list of ingredients, which shows how “clean” this stuff is. I didn’t see it posted on this Amazon page so I had to do some extra research and this is what I found.<br /><br />Ingredients: Glycerin, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Extract*, Tocopherol *Organic Ingredient<br /><br />Short and sweet!<br /><br />While I do love the ingredients, I found it to have a little too paste like consistency and not enough grit. I prefer a rougher scrub with more “stuff”, like ground up nuts or something that will at least scrub the built up gunk from my face. There were some but it wasn’t much. I kept squeezing more paste onto my hands so I could get more grit, and probably ended up using more than I needed, which is a little wasteful. I don’t dislike the results though as my face felt clean, soft, and moisturized afterwards. It smells like cocoa, a light scent, not at all overwhelming.<br /><br />I personally prefer more grit in my face scrubs. I do love this brand and how clean their stuff is but this scrub is way too gentle for what I need. I would highly recommend this if you are looking for a gentle scrub with less grit. [SEP] I have been using this facial scrub once or twice a week after the Cocoa Cream Cleanser from the same brand. I find it easiest to use while in the shower. It smells absolutely amazing, just like chocolate! The product is fairly thick with gritty stuff in it for exfoliation, though there was a lot less of the grit than I was expecting. My skin felt clean afterwards, but I think it would have been better with more grit. My skin can be sensitive to some products, and this cleanser hasn't bothered me at all, which is nice. I enjoy this product because of the great scent, but it's just not as effective of a scrub as it could be. [SEP] This scrub is made of clean, simple, and organic ingdredients which I appreciate ( Glycerin, Cocoa Extract, and Tocopherol ). The scrub is on the thicker side and I find that it takes a bit of effort to get it to come out. Once it is out and on the face, it doesn't fee too much like a scrub. It has a pasty feeling that needs a bit more grit. I have found an easy solution, ground up oats or a bit of finer sugar and this scrub is amazing, (if you have a small container of sugar or oats in the vanity next to the scrub it doesn't become a hassle). It has a nice chocolate smell and is quite nourishing. [SEP] Very nice facial scrub!!! I love coffee and I like the way my skin feels after I use it!!! [SEP] I'm just not a fan of this, there is hardly any exfoliation bits in this. It's thick and applies creamy. It rinses away easily and very messily, getting dark brown all over my shower.

I personally prefer traditional lavender scents. This one smells more floral than lavender-y. It did bubble and fizz, which created  an inviting bath. [SEP] I am new to this brand Joon X Moon and find them very giftable.  The packaging is beautiful and their scrubs and bubble bath fizz formulas would cheer me or my friends up at the end of a long week.<br /><br />The Bubbling Bath Fizz has a lovely scent which permeates the bathroom for a while as well.  I tried both the Lavender and the Champagne scents and loved them. The instructions don't say how much to put, so I put 2 capfuls and this was enough to give gentle bubbles and a lovely scent.<br /><br />The lavender is strong but not medicinal and the champagne has a slightly fruitier almost lychee undertone.  Both are lovely and not overly sweet.  The bubbles are soft and plentiful and the scents are relaxing and make me feel like I am somewhere else.  The minerals in the bath also feel soothing.  Overall, it feels very pampering and helps to wash away a tough week.<br /><br />I love the way that these bottles look in the bathroom as well.  Another reviewer mentioned they'd prefer to have them in glass containers, but it feels safer not to have glass in the bathroom where it might slip or get knocked off. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:d5de4359fbc270ab6862848538dad116]] I’m a real bath bomb aficionado and this I think is better than bath bombs. You can pour in the exact amount you want for bubbles. It has a very very light scent that I found hard to discern as lavender. That said it makes for a lovely relaxing bath. It’s moisturizing and soothing and I would absolutely try more in the range. The bottle itself is plastic so you don’t have to worry about keeping it in the bathroom and it’s pretty enough that you can leave it out. [SEP] At the time of review the bath fizz was $15.99 which can be a good value or expensive depending on how you use it. There are no instructions and it's totally up to you to add as much or as little as you want. The fizzing and scent will depend on the concentration of how much was added.<br /><br />So there are a couple benefits to this. You end up controlling how much you put into the bath so if a bath bomb is too much and your skin is sensitive or you are sensitive to strong scents you can tone down to where you can enjoy it and start with a little and add more rather than having too much in a single use and just empty the tub to start over.<br /><br />We found the scent to be pleasant and overall mild with a couple cap fulls that provided scent, fizz and a pleasant feel to our skin after a soak. One thing I would note is if there is confusion on if this is a bubble bath. It is not. It's more like the dying of an alka-seltzer tablet so a gentle fizz. I'm sure if you add more and get more fizz the bubbles would build up, but the bubbles are mostly in the water, not on the surface like a bubble bath. [SEP] Good fragrance and it was a soothing feel to me skin. [SEP] This lavender scented bubbling bath fizz does fizz but as a bonus it has bubbles!  That was a delightful surprise I wasn't expecting. The scent is lovely... neither too strong or two weak.  The bubbles lasted an hour while I soaked in the tub and I swear I didn't want to get out of the bath.  After I toweled off I could smell the light fragrance on my skin and it lasted all night... I still smelled good after waking up in the morning.  I love this bath fizz! [SEP] I never got so many bubbles from any bubble bath as much i did from this bath powder! I wasnt expecting i would love it like i do! It also moisturized my skin alot. I recommend this everyone! [SEP] Nothing beats a hot bubble bath after a long day of work. I have a Jacuzzi bath tub. I enjoy bubble baths from time to time. Mostly I use liquid form bubble bath. I found that this bubble bath powder works just  as well. Once I turn on the Jacuzzi, I don't need a lot, just a couple of caps. There will be a lot of bubbles. The water becomes smooth, to a point that it is a little bit slippery. The lavender scent is very soothing. This is just a great bubble bath product. I really enjoy it. [SEP] Love this scent and it is perfectly bubbly and my skin felt so silky and moisturized after! Would order again for myself or purchase as a gift, definitely want to try some of their other scents as well [SEP] It does the trick",3,True

This eye mask has been a game-changer for her nighttime routine, as it quickly heats up and stays warm for a long time, providing her with the perfect amount of relaxation and comfort.<br /><br />One of the things that stands out about this eye mask is its 3D ergonomic design. It perfectly contours to her face, blocking out all light and allowing her to completely relax. The graphene material used in the mask is top-quality, ensuring that the heat is evenly distributed and that she remains comfortable throughout the night.<br /><br />The magnet suction wire is also a great feature, as it keeps the mask securely in place without any discomfort or slipping. My wife also loves how breathable and soft the mask is, which helps prevent any irritation or sweating around the eyes.<br /><br />Overall, the Heated Sleep Eye Mask by CareFor is a must-have for anyone who struggles with migraines, dry eyes, or just wants a more relaxing and comfortable sleep. It's also perfect for nap time or travel, making it a versatile and useful addition to any routine. Highly recommended! [SEP] Perhaps it’s a me problem, but this mask doesn’t fit my face well. I think my head is too big and my nose too short. The velcro strap is barely hanging on at the tip because it’s too tight around my noggin otherwise. The foam section at the base is very thick and practically sits in my eye sockets because of my stubby nose bridge. The heat is okay, but the fit is just uncomfortable for me. The listing is a little unclear, as I thought from the video I would also be getting a rechargeable attachment in addition to the cord that has to be plugged in to work. But nope, that’s not included. [SEP] I wish this had its own power source like a battery. But this does work. It’s comfortable as well. [SEP] Made of pretty soft and comfortable materials. Heating feels pretty good too. One drawback is that It is not battery powered, so it has to be plugged in to work. The magnet wire connection can be accidentally pulled if you move the head while sleeping. But, some can consider that safety feature. [SEP] This eye mask feels soft and comfortable... There are 3 heat settings and even on high its not overly warm...it is a soothing heat and is good for sore , tired or dry eyes...the cord has a good length and the controls are simple to use and understand...the mask fits nicely and blocks out all !ight...its great for migraine pain relief as well! [SEP] It is a bit small for my large head, but fits my wife well whom is most likely to use this anyways.  It has a nice storage bag and arrives with all you'll need except for the USB power adapter.  If you are like me you already have extras of those.  It is certainly nice that it does not have a battery to add weight and that needs recharging before use, but having a cord attached is not ideal either.  The magnetic release works, though you will want to be sure the cord is routed so it does not drag items off your night stand before the tension is sufficient to detach it.  I won't hold that against it since I knew that when ordering it, just something to consider.  The cord and controls are sufficient while remaining light and compact.  I think the price is reasonable for a heated sleep mask of this quality. [SEP] This mask is pretty comfortable.  The velcro band makes customizing fit perfect.  It blocked all of the light.  It provided a good amount of heat to the eyes, in the three different heat settings.  Low feels pretty good, just a light heat.  High power and it was all over really warm.  The power port has a very strong magnet which seemed to stay in place, even with moving around.  It also has timed settings from 15, 30, 60, 90, and  00 that  automatically shuts it off.  This also came with a blue gel insert that you can get cold for a cooling the eyes.  It also came with a set of foam earplugs in their own little case. [SEP] Very comfortable and lightweight with an adjustable new type Velcro strap where the hook side is smoother and isn't clawing at my hair. The back side of the mask is a contoured memory foam that is very comfortable against the face as it doesn't push against my eyeballs, but still provides heat to the area.<br /><br />There are three levels of heating or if preferred, there is a gel pack that can be frozen for a cold mask instead. I prefer the heat function even though I have to be close to a power source and had to dig around for my USB extension to enjoy it on my bed. [SEP] I’ve had the opportunity to test quite a few face masks.  This one would be near the bottom of my list.  Let’s start with the good.  It is very lightweight.  It has a nice formed foam and doesn’t rub on my eyelashes.  It comes with a cooling gel pad.  There are several issues as far as I see it.  First and most important, it doesn’t fit well.  I have it set to the very end of the Velcro and it is still tight on my head.  I do not particularly have a large head.  As a matter of fact, I can wear some youth baseball caps set on the largest setting.  This elastic tugs far too much to be comfortable.  The next issue is that this thing has a cord that isn’t much longer than 3.5 feet.  That means you have to be close to your power source.  You can use a usb battery but they are expensive if you don’t already have one.  With regard to the heat, this mask on the hottest setting just got lightly warm.  Most of the heat seemed to be in the raised areas where the eyes go and not the part that touches your skin.  It means that it has to heat up the air between you and the eye area in order for you to feel the warmth.  It’s just not warm enough for me.  Since the cord has to be attached to the mask via magnet, with such a a short cord, basically I have to sit perfectly still.  No way I could actually wear this to sleep in unless I found a way to mount the usb battery near my head. [SEP] This needs to be plugged in while using so an outlet must be available. Overall the warmth of the heat felt very relaxing and helped me fall asleep. It has a timer and different heat settings. It also came with a gel pad, fabric case, and ear plugs in a case! Good for travel",3,True

I like some of ingredients in this supplement but wish the vitamin C had been liposomal and not ascorbic acid.  The zinc is in the form of zinc oxide, which is the least bioavailable.  Most of it won't be utilized by your body.  All the other ingredients are good and I always like to see Elderberry included since it is a powerful anti-oxidant and virus buster.  I take over 1500 mg liposomal vitamin C each day plus extra zinc (citrate/gluconate) so I don't think the 180mg of vitamin C (in this supplement) will do anything to help your immune system fight off Covid.  I'm giving it 3 stars and think that is being generous. [SEP] This supplement has all the products in it that I like to take and have been taking separately.  And better yet, it adds a probiotic Lactobadillus Acidophilus so can’t ask for more in a daily supplement.  I love this product!  Immune Blend has so many great ingredients that have been proven to have immune and other health benefits – Vitamin C, Zinc, Elderberry, Echinacea, Garlic Turmeric and more.<br /><br />I do want to comment that since this product has turmeric and garlic and both are known to have blood thinning capabilities, I personally would stop taking this product several days before any type of surgery.  And by all means talk to your doctor about taking any product that contains these ingredients if you take blood thinners.<br /><br />My final thoughts: I am thrilled to find a product that contains such a great blend of ingredients to help us stay healthy and fight off viruses. [SEP] This is a 30-day supply since you take two a day. I love the ingredient deck here. I've been taking a number of these separately so it's very nice to be able to get them all in one easy to swallow pill. There's no weird taste and so far no upset stomach issues have occurred. I would absolutely purchase this one. [SEP] These easy to swallow pills are a great boost to any immune system. I have been taking one a day with my daily multivitamin and they go fine together. Good natural heath boost and price point. [SEP] This has just about everything I want in a supplement.  Vit C, Elderberry, garlic, vit B.... if it had calcium, it would be perfect!<br /><br />I also appreciate that you only have to take 2 capsules a day and that at $15.00 it is reasonably priced. [SEP] These capsules contain a variety of ingredients to support immune health. Antioxidant vitamins along with minerals and herbal extracts are included, plus the lactobacillus acidophilus probiotic. Each of the ingredients have a link to immune health, which shows how complex immune functioning is - it depends on a variety of elements to prevent illness. These capsules are made with vegetable cellulose and no additives. There are multiple companies now selling immune formulas that are pretty much identical to one another, perhaps capitalizing on the current wave of infectious illness and public interest in natural remedies for prevention. This one is reasonable priced and has a good combination of ingredients. Using this type of supplement while maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding overeating or other stresses on the body can certainly help prevent illness.",3,True

It is a fragrance oil or blend, not an essential oil. There's no such thing as vanilla essential oil. And, there is no evidence whatsoever that this is any type of certified organic anything. Real organic actual essential oils have to be certified. In the world of vanilla, there are vanilla absolutes, vanilla extract, vanilla flavoring, and vanilla fragrance oils or blends. Please do your research before purchasing this product. This is a vanilla fragrance oil or blend that is not meant to go into a diffuser. The price is also an indicator that this is not a true vanilla absolute, which is what would be used in a diffuser or in soaps. Vanilla absolutes are expensive. These are cheap and they smell cheap. They do not smell anything like vanilla at all. They smell like perfume. Not a good perfume and not a vanilla perfume. I would not recommend whatever kind of oils these are at all. [SEP] Fraud. This stuff is nothing but essential oil fraud. First off, there is no such thing as actual vanilla essential oil. 100% vanilla essential oil does not exist. Don't believe me? Research it & be enlightened. I thought this perhaps was an absolute. Upon arrival no information was on the boxes or the bottles. Another red flag for essential oil fraud which is incredibly common. A quality essential oil will provide the botanical name, extraction method, & country of origin (COO).<br /><br />Without knowing any of the above, your nose would immediately alert you that this is fake. It smells nothing like vanilla. I work with whole, 100% pure organic vanilla beans every day. I can't even begin to describe what this fake garbage smells like.

XDS Disposable Protective Mask 3-Ply Ear Loop Safety Face Mask for Personal Health,[],[],,3.8,28,223,"These disposable masks are like every other 3-ply disposable mask of this type that I tried so far. They have comfortable ear elastics and the mask is pleated and moldable to the nose with the interior wire.  <br /><br />There are 50 masks in this package.  The current price of $8.99 is a great deal for 50 which comes to $.18 cents each.  Since these are disposable, they are not designed to last, obviously. [SEP] Use for Fog and haze weather,Gray sky,Fog weather, Dust weather, Snow weather, Building site Etc.Not for Medical use. It has 3 layers and covers my whole face. I feel like it will protect me and those i come in contact with; and the price was right.  The ear loops are comfortable and the nose piece keeps my glasses from fogging. [SEP] XDS disposable face masks 50pk<br /><br />These are as good as other 3-ply disposable face masks I've purchased on Amazon - better when used with a bracket that keeps the mask off my nose and mouth; better when used with a strap extender so the ears loops are not pulling on my ears; loops require reinforcement (staples) so they don't just pop off the mask. [SEP] These came sealed in a plastic bag and came in a box. This is a good value for 50 masks @ $8.99. I have not seen this price at a local store. I have a small face so the mask is a little big but all I do is tie a little knot at the end of the elastic and that makes a difference and it fits perfectly (I don't like twisting the ear loop because it leaves gaps on the side of my face), by making a knot at the end of the loop, it fits snug like how a mask should fit. The nose piece is essentially a twist tie but it holds it's shape. I'm used to the medical grade masks where the nose piece is an actual flat piece of metal (I work in healthcare so we don't purchase masks outside of medical supply places - there is a difference in the level of protection, that's why most masks that the general public can purchase at the stores say ""not for medical use""- these masks say the same). You can't go wrong with these, it's a great deal so there's no excuse. Wear a mask (cover your mouth AND nose at all times in public), wash your hands frequently for 20 seconds, social distance of 6 ft and be safe!

They're of the large size. I usually wear women's large size, and these fit well. They were easy to pull on and off, including the one that did not have cotton lining on the inside. They fit close enough and are flexible enough that I could do chores that require some dexterity. The gloves cover your hand, wrist, and part of the lower arm. I'm very pleased with these as I usually have trouble finding gloves that fit well, are easy to get on, and don't provoke my latex allergy. [SEP] As someone with sensory issues and needing motivation to clean anyway, these gloves worked well. Pacific PPE's 2-pack of household gloves are unlined and a bit thin, and this pair was sized large. They ran very large, particularly for my medium hands.<br />They were perfect for bathroom cleaning. They are quite long and came above my hoodie sleeves enough to protect them but also so that I didn't have to worry about pushing my sleeves up. My gripe about most gloves is they aren't long enough, so fluids get into them anyway. Didn't happen at all with these gloves. They were protective from cleaning chemicals and water.<br />They are quite thin, so I wonder how long before one tears. Likewise, not knowing much about this material, I wonder if they will  become brittle over time, particularly from chemical contact.<br />In all they are great gloves and worth every dime. [SEP] These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] Update - while the vinyl is still more durable and puncture resistant than latex, I'm going to have to ding this a solid 2 stars because of a couple of issues:  1) The PVC hardens after a few weeks, from exposure to grease or detergents, I don't know, but definitely not as supple.  2) The PVC is more slippery than latex.  Still, we have had more than a few latex gloved ruined from goof-off or other solvents which the PVC is somewhat immune to, so there's definitely some advantages.<br /><br />We used to use latex gloves for cleaning and dish washing, but they tend to be somewhat delicate, lasting only a week or 2, so we switched over to heavy nitrile gloves. These last far longer but the rubber is comparatively stiff and not nearly as comfortable as the latex. We also use ""true blues"" PVC gloves, but these are quite heavy vinyl so are really just for heavy cleaning tasks. When I first tried these on I was surprised as the feel was nearly identical to the latex gloves. Sizing is accurate. [SEP] Love live live these gloves. I do hear y duty cleaning on a daily basis at my job and these things are great. So thick and protected for just normal rubber gloves. They do all I need them to and more 5 stars! [SEP] First, I was given this product in return for my impartial and honest review.  Thanks, Pacific PPE!<br /><br />Rubber gloves, what can one talk about?  I mean, aside from some curious movies?  I asked for a pair of both flocked and unflocked, just to see the differences.  I must admit, the flocked are much more comfortable, at least short term.  They both seem to be of reasonable thickness and durability, although I have not tested them in difficult environments.  I suppose the ""latex-free"" can be important; they are reportedly made of PVC.<br /><br />My unwarranted and unfair complaint is that they really don't fit.  Most gloves do not : my fingers are long (I am 6'3"").  You might be able to see in the photo with the background light where my fingers actually fit.  But if you have standard hands, I suppose they would work just fine.  Whether there are more reasonable alternatives is up to your searching. [SEP] Pacific PPE's 2-pack of household gloves come with a date of manufacture of October 2019, and list a shelf live of 3 years from DOM.  Each pair comes in a separate, sealed package.  These gloves are unlined.  This review is of size L, and I usually wear size M or L; these are a tiny bit loose on me.<br /><br />The gloves are light weight (thin), and are made of PVC.  The gloves gave off an odor when I opened the bag.  Because they are so thin, they're not suitable for heavy duty cleaning chores, or tasks where sharp or rough objects are involved .  These are best suited for dishwashing, and maybe bathroom cleaning.  At $9.98 for two pair, I think you can find a more durable option. [SEP] Very good quality and unbelievable durability. [SEP] I mainly use these gloves for common household cleaning like doing dishes and cleaning household surfaces. I haven't used them for more heavy duty purposes or with very abrasive cleaning materials (like steel wool). For my purposes, they have worked very well in terms of durability. I would put them as being at least on par with Playtex living gloves in terms of quality, possibly a bit longer lasting. They have about the same tactile qualities as those gloves which means they are good for medium-duty work, but not finer work as you can't feel a lot through them.<br /><br />I liked the fit and found them easy to put on and take off. I'll note that I generally experience chafing and dryness in my hands from wearing gloves like these, but haven't had that experience with these gloves. The lining seems to ""stick"" less to my skin which I really like. [SEP] They are definitely good quality......EXCELLENT ..<br /><br />They are soft inside for comfort and I sure needed them to be!<br /><br />They go pretty far up you arm providing extra protection.<br /><br />I had to use on ancient caked on wallpaper removal, falling apart ceiling  and more .....it was a nasty , hard job  these gloves endured through it ALL and were used again after washing them!<br /><br />They are also very sturdy and can endure extremely hard jobs!!<br /><br />They allow your hands protection but you can still feel the things you are working on with these<br />from bathing dogs to repair work to deep cleaning and more ....<br /><br />Extremely versatile !",3,True
LIBUS 10 Pairs Reusable Earplugs Quantum Hearing Protection for Professionals Noise and Sound Cancelling Earbuds (Earplug Corded),[],[],,4.0,17,23510,"mostly i use this earplugs for camping and it does a good job with the noise reduction when i go to sleep in the woods. works well for me and i really like it. thanks [SEP] The earplugs are soft and spongy. They use a few thin rubber gaskets to create a complete seal from air, ensuring that no water can pass through. Sound will pass through, but the volume will be reduced by at least half. They are not the most comfortable earplugs, but they are reusable and can be washed and sterilized for use again and again. The belt box is well-made, and it keeps my pair clean and free of contamination. It is critical because germs and viruses can enter your system through your eardrums. The mini box is secure enough to give me peace of mind that my earplugs are clean and germ-free when I need to use them on public transportation. Loud noises amplify my tinnitus. These ear plugs aid in the reduction of traffic noise. [SEP] This is handy to keep around my neck when power washing, cutting the grass, weed whacking, etc. the rope doesn’t cut my skin it’s actually pretty silky soft. The rubber stays into my ear fine. Good for reuse if you clean them. [SEP] Rubber is a little too soft making it hard to insert into your ear. You get what you pay for. Don't work as well as better quality ear plugs. [SEP] I often wear ear protection at work.  The corded plugs we use there are very high quality, and cost about a buck apiece.  My only complaint with them is that they have a plastic cord that likes to stay coiled up.  I saw these string corded plugs and thought they might be better.<br />The flexible cord is indeed nice.  No issues with it coiling itself.  Doesn't make noise when you are out in the wind, either.  It's just barely long enough to tie to a button hole on your shirt to keep it handy.<br />Unfortunately, the plugs themselves are made from a very soft grade of rubber.  So soft they can be very difficult to insert in your ears properly.<br />They also don't have near the noise reducing properties of the plugs I'm used to.  They work, just not as well.<br />These plugs also cost a buck apiece, but they are roughly the same as the 25 cent plugs.  That's about what they're worth, too.<br />Guess we'll stick with what we have.",3,True

I sometimes add it to smoothies, sometimes I make a quick iced drink (shaken), sometimes I just want a very quick cup of coffee and the taste of instant can be pleasing to me. More often, I add it to a cup of brewed coffee. Get an extra boost (flavor, caffeine)!  And that is primarily how I drink this. I make myself a cup of dark bold coffee, blend a packet of this in, and enjoy. I like the light vanilla taste, and the sweetness level is on point for me. I dont often sweeten my coffee as I prefer it black, but I do enjoy some sweetened coffee with cream on occasion.<br /><br />Prepared as is? The sweetness level is more pronounced, as is the vanilla. Wish ""no sugar added"" products that use sugar alternatives would use less. So made alone is a tad much for me.<br /><br /> I like that it is super quick and easy to make, can be made with hot or cold water, and is well packaged. I like the added supplements. The amount of collagen peptides is low (3 grams), where my typical scoop of collagen powder always offers 10+ grams per serving.<br /><br />You decide. It uses SUCRALOSE as its sweetener. I have found it used in ""keto"" products, but I also see many keto products omitting it and using something else. I am not on a strict keto diet, nor any keto diet. I am just reducing my sugar intake, and by doing so I tend to buy things that end up using sucralose. SO FAR, I have not had any issue with weight loss. It is October as I write this, and I have dropped 50 lbs since April, and I haven't tried all that hard. Just dropped sugar laden desserts and have been moving more. Maybe my weight loss would be further along, but I still take down half a pizza every week. But massive calorie reduction from dropping desserts, and using sugar free alternatives.. which happens to include sucralose. I'd like to see less of it used across the board, but in mean time it doesn't seem to be a hinderance to my health and goals.<br /><br />I do not rate on price as we all have different budgets, needs, interests. The price is posted, and not a surprise, so I just focus on my experience and perception of taste, quality, and how it lines up to the product description. THOUGH, I do comment.. and this really is ridiculously priced. I have some good instant coffee products with similar nutrition profile where each pack is in the upper $1 range (and people still freak over price). So for me, this is a bit prohibitive for daily use, but that is just me and my budget.<br /><br />The packaging is cool though. Might make for a nice addition to a food or coffee or keto themed gift basket. Nice looking packets tucked into a tray with a slide on cover. Then it is wrapped in plastic. Has a retail look to it. [SEP] I will use this coffee mix and mix it with a mug of coffee for the benefits. If I need to add creamer, I will do that too. With me mixing it with my coffee, this should also cut down the taste of the instant. [SEP] The taste is good. The ingredients are healthy and keto-friendly, other than Sucralose. I have consumed Bulletproof coffee regularly for years, so I am used to this type of coffee. One issue is the price, which is currently $3.50 per cup. If you have four cups per day, that is $14 per day and this pack will only last five days. You can make coffee at home, add your own butter, MCT oil and, collagen at a cost of $0.40 - $1 per cup. Where this product makes sense is when you are away from home, such as in the office or while traveling. For that use case, this product is good. Spending $3.50 on a cup of coffee is too much though.<br /><br />The other issue is that this product is not keto-friendly since it has Sucralose, which will spike insulin. The amount of Sucralose in this is not disclosed. [SEP] It’s easy to make and the flavor is quite good [SEP] Good taste [SEP] Omnite has combined my two favorite pastimes: instant gourmet coffee with good texture & healthy weight loss! Great tasting is just a perk. Hot or cold you get the same healthy benefits! (I enjoy both ways, myself… depending on the climate). My energy level gets boosted with each delectable sip from my coffee cup. These French vanilla flavored sachets are a terrific addition to my active lifestyle of eating healthy and muscle building. I feel like I am being rewarded for enjoying my daily cafe time. Keto status has never been so easy to achieve! [SEP] I'm not on a keto diet, but I like stuff such as bullet proof coffee and I love coffee in general so I decided to give this a try. It seems to have the recommended daily amount of collagen (3000mg) along with the healthy fats. I was not happy with the flavor though, and who really cares about the other benefits if the taste is just not that good. It tastes like artificially sweetened International House of Coffee, or like those espresso drink machines at gas stations. I was really hoping for that ""good cup of coffee"" flavor that was mentioned in the product description. The artificial sweetener taste is just overpowering and there's not enough real coffee flavor. Luckily, I got to try it for free in exchange for this review. Otherwise – first of all I'd never have even considered purchasing it for $70 for 20 servings, and second, even if I paid $20 I'd be extremely disappointed in this product. Two stars for having potentially healthy benefits, and that's it. [SEP] I was surprised at how good it is. Initially tried it as a cold brew. Blended the suggested 6-8oz serving with my electric wisk. Had a great coffee scent off the bat, taste was more a vanilla cafe/cappuccino. I added a small amount of monk fruit because I like it extra sweet. Taste was great. There were a few unblended particles in the mix but nothing bad. Hot blended better. Both are great keto morning pick me ups! [SEP] Me encanta este cafe y mas aun que es keto lo cual balancea  mi dieta y ayuda a darle energía a mi cuerpo.<br /><br />Me encanta los ingredientes y el precio es muy competitivo.<br /><br />El producto es muy facil de abrir y se puede llevar a cualquier momento. [SEP] I'm not on a Keto diet, but I got this Keto coffee because I love coffee that is French vanilla flavored. It arrives in an interesting box. To open the box, you slide the top part of the box to the right, revealing the tray underneath. There are 20 packets of instant coffee in the box. Each packet contains added vitamins and other nutrients in addition to the coffee itself. To make a cup of coffee, mix a packet with 6-8 oz of hot or cold water. I mix mine with hot. By itself, the coffee is just so so. However, I drink all my coffee with French vanilla coffee creamer, and once I add my creamer, this coffee is absolutely delicious. While I will gladly enjoy the rest of the packets in the box, the current list price of $44.95 is a bit too pricey for me to want to reorder it.",3,True

I don't think I'm allergic to latex but I used to get some horrible zits after going to the dentist so maybe I am. These latex-free gloves feel flexible yet seem durable to last a good while. [SEP] These gloves come in two varieties, the lined, which are a solid color, and the unlined, which are dual-tone, white with colorful fingertips. The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] Pretty basic gloves. These are not as thick I was imagining so for pruning rosebushes and such a better option will be needed.<br /><br />They are thick enough to reuse for everyday cleaning and other basic household chores. [SEP] I really like these gloves, as they are thick enough to use with very hot water, but flexible. The raised pattern provides a good grip, which is particularly helpful, when you're dealing with wet dishes or something like that.  My husband thinks I'm silly for wearing these to load the dishwasher (because, as he says, you can just wash your hands), but I really enjoy not getting nasty stuff on my hands, and I just wash these, after use, and hang them up to dry. [SEP] The inside is cotton lined and it is very soft. It has an anti-slip pattern. I ordered a medium size and it fit perfectly. My hands are small so I say this runs smaller than other gloves. [SEP] I was afraid these gloves are going to be very thick and I will hate using them then probably completely void because I can’t get a good feel and I just never feel things are clean unless I get a good sensation in my hands. I hope this makes sense. However, these gloves are not one of those thick rubbery gloves that numb your sensation for touch. They are still thick and durable but feel more like a silicone then rubber and allow my hands and fingers to have a good sensation to touch. I have medium sized hands and M fits me well with a little extra room too. The fingers are not too long and the overall fit is very good. They are even decorated and have a little trim design around the hand opening. They are not too deep, see photo. They come about half way to my elbows. The palms and fingers are textured in a cute way and this allows for a better grip when holding something in a soapy water. I received 2 pairs, white with blue fingers and plain purple and both colors are cute if that matters.<br /><br />Bottom line, I always hated rubber gloves but I use these without dreading it,  it’s a first. Good pair of gloves. [SEP] These are very nice gloves.  A medium will also fit an average mans hands though barely.  Material is nice and colorful.  The non-slip ribs/treads are also a nice touch.  Very servicable.  Now to see how long they last.  :-) [SEP] There thinner then I thought they would be. The reviews said they block the heat of the water but I feel it completely everytime I do the dishes. [SEP] The sizing here is clearly Asian. The large is no better than American medium and the medium is definitely small. So if you really need large, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a nice inexpensive two-pack of serviceable gloves. They are thin and we don't expect long life. But for the price, it's what you might expect.<br /><br />Overall we'd prefer to buy gloves that are properly sized for the American market and more durable. We'd be willing to pay more. We don't especially recommend these gloves. Three stars. [SEP] These are nice, flexible gloves. The only problem is that the thumb placement is a little short for my average hands, but the gloves are still quite usable. The flocked gloves seem even smaller because they're thicker, and I think I might do better with a large. The top of the unflocked glove is thinner than I'm accustomed to, and it has collapsed and/or folded over on itself, allowing water to get inside while I cleaned my cat litter boxes. I think these are durable enough to last a while provided they don't get cut. I do prefer them to the brand I buy at Wegmans.",3,True

Very easy to use, helps if you steam your face first to open up your pores. Always start on the lowest setting (YX) and never just leave it on one area very long can cause hickey or bruising if done. Has helped to unclog my pores in those hard to reach areas. My skin is alot clearer and blemish free since using this product. Loved it!<br /><br />But the only thing I don't like about this product is that it didn't come with the filter inside. I have an old blackhead remover before and that one has a filter so that it's easily for me to clean it. Nontheless it's a good product.

I understood why the instruction said not to leave it on one spot but keep it moving.<br />The result speaks for itself(see picture)<br />Overall, I am satisfied with the product but I gave it a 4 star because even after using it, some of the blackhead that had deep roots didn’t budge even at the suction power of this product. [SEP] The device arrived and all was as it should be I presume.  I fully charged the unit and gave it a go after a quick skin cleanse.  Nothing came out and the suction is VERY weak with this one.  So I tried another approach the second day where I steamed/soaked my pores for 15/30 min to open them up and make everything soft hoping this would give the device a better means to pull out the ""stuff"" and sure enough.... NOTHING.  Tried all tips, tried some suggestions from online and it did nothing to add to my routine.<br /><br />Not something I can recommend at this time. [SEP] I've been seeing suction cleaners in so many ads lately that I thought I'd try this for myself.  This model is well designed to fit the hand comfortably.  The instructions were easy to follow.  There are many multiple-sized caps so you should find the one that's right for your condition.  Overall it delivers on all its claims. [SEP] This thing really works!  I love this so much!

[SEP] Material are mostly plastic and it has a vacuum to collect hair while it's trimming. it works great i have no problem using this trimmer to cut my husband hair.<br />But the price at $40 i think is a bit on the expensive side other than that everything works great and works like a trimmer should. THANKS [SEP] This cordless body trimmer helps me stay looking my best. From my straggly chest hairs, down to my delectable sexy parts that stay hidden, my confidence level is always glowing. So whether I’m wet in the shower or dry, standing before my bathroom mirror, I depend on this handy trimmer to eliminate those pesky hairs and to maintain my groomed appearance. Plus, the detachable guide combs allow me to trim closely and accurately along my tan line and much more. And the vacuum feature is SPECTACULAR to have at my intimate disposal! Yes, sir! I’m in love!! [SEP] I have to say I was super skeptical that this product was going to work UPSIDE DOWN, but my boyfriend said it work perfectly!  he buzzes his head at least once a week with no guard on the clippers.  he also does his chest and sometimes, when im forced to... I do his back for him.  I asked him last night how he felt about the product and he said he LOVED IT.  after he buzzes his hair he always has to take out the vacuum and do a whole big cleanup on the floor... not last week!!!  he said the clipper caught almost all of the hair and there were so few that made it to the floor that he just left them b/c I wouldnt even notice them.... and I have to say... I didnt.  less mess in my bathroom... ahhhh yes please!<br />u get 3 guards total.  2 of them flip over so thats really 4 settings and 1 fader.  the fan has 2 speeds and the clippers plug in using a usb cable, which is provided, but no wall plug.  in my opinion, the machine was pretty quite for both clipping and vacuuming at the same time.  I have to say that I expected it to be much, much, much louder than it actually was.  I hope this was helpful. [SEP] I've been hesitant to use this type of specialty product - body hair grooming device with built-in vacuum/suction.  I figured that I already have cordless hair clippers, with a variety of hair guides.  And, after using that to trim, shave body hair, could brush off hair debris and take a shower.  But, having used this I can see the possible benefit of the combined features.<br />It creates less mess, with virtually no cleaning up (depending on the length and amount of hair that is handled).  And, cleaning the device of suctioned hair is fairly simple and easy.<br />Maybe because I'm not very experienced, but i felt that I needed to use the top suction power level to handle the sparse chest hair that I shaved for the test.  When I first started, with the lowest suction level, I wasn't sure if it was suctioning the hair. I didn't feel at ease until it was at full power.<br />I didn't feel that the device was very ergonomic, with the grip area far from the shaving action.  I felt that I had much more control using my cordless hair clippers than this device.  Attached are photos to show real world images of the product, with a ruler for size reference.  Different angles are shown for a good overview of the device.<br />Overall, it does a credible job at cutting and suctioning hair bits. The blades perform well, cutting the body hair with ease.  At the top speed, it did a competent job of suctioning.  To be honest, I'm not totally convinced of the efficiency over my previous usage of cordless hair clippers.  Based on initial impressions, it garners a 4 star rating. [SEP] The vacuum isn't strong. But it's enough to make sure hairs stay in the compartment they're supposed to. The blades aren't the best, but again, it gets the job done. I'm impressed. [SEP] I got this trimmer for my dog because I liked the vacuum suction on it. When I trim my dogs, dog hair gets everywhere. This suction power actually works and actually sucks the hair back into this compartment that you later on empty. There are three different guards. There is a 1 mm, 3 mm, 6 mm, 9 mm, and 12 mm guard. There is only one angled guard. It is not very loud when it is on and it recharges by a USB cord. [SEP] Barbers have become pricey for my taste.<br />I had a job that paid acceptably decent paying job, a few years ago.<br />The heavy overtime made it a great job. However, Saturday was a bad<br />day to secure a seat in the barber's chair, if any. So, I shaved my head.<br />If I don't do it on a regular schedule, I have a difficult time with my razor.<br />Solution, I use this clipper with a vacuum. This sets up my head for easy<br />shaving. The vacuum holds the clippings & I can dispose it later.<br />Barbers may charge about $15-$25 plus a tip. I saved after I shaved.<br />That's MONEY in Da BANK.!

"Makryn Adjustable Plantar Fasciitis Feet Inserts-Orthotic Shoe Insoles-Arch Support for Men&Women-Flat Feet,High Arches(Green, Medium)",[],[],,3.5,21,571,"I have high arches, but have some shoes without any sort of support, and so I find slipping in a support like this can help for long term wearing of super flat shoes. The appeal of these for me is that due to my high arches and the fact that these come with ""height adjustment"" padded pieces, I can be sure to create a level of fit and support that is good for my feet. These are cut to fit, and have additional padding pieces to make for better adjustment in fit, feel, and support. They fit well in shoes, sneakers, boots.. and do well staying in place. I will consider buying these again. [SEP] I found these to run smaller than the size chart. If you have wide feet, I'd suggest sizing up and cut accordingly. Better to trim than come up short and narrow.<br /><br />For support, there's adjustability if you need more arch support. I thought these were great for two of my pairs of shoes. The third pair wasn't as good as a fit. The shoe is 2e width but since these supports are thicker than my original sock liners, I found my toe in the toe box barrier.<br /><br />I tried a different arch support by Walk Hero which was thinner at the toe box area. Both of these seem better than the rest I've tried and reviewed. I purchased extras of both brands. But I think the Walk Hero brand may offer more metatarsal support unless I can use one of the included discs to add more metatarsal support.<br /><br />For the money, seems the most expensive isn't always the better support. Some are abrasive. Some are too soft and slippery. But this one  features a top finish that's not slippery but sweat wicking and resistant to foot odor. [SEP] This is a great product, and while it might seem a bit expensive, I will share with you why it is not:  I have *very* flat feet, and have two sets of custom orthotics (obtained from a podiatric specialist).  Those orthotics cost in excess of $500 each.  They work well, and last 10 years plus.  They have done well for me over the years and are what I use in most of my shoes (since they are removable).  But here is where they fall a bit short, and where these inserts step in (no pun intended):  My custom orthotics are hard/rigid material with a cushioned top.  Unfortunately, for some shoes it doesn’t work well - usually because I can’t remove the sole insert in the shoe OR there is still some sort of arch support built into the shoe.  This insert gives you the opportunity to make adjustments to the fit based on your own specific needs, as well as taking into account the limitations with the shoes they will be going in.  You get two sets of ‘pads’ that you can use to adjust the insert wherever it might be needed.  Each set contains 3 different sized pads, and the sets are differentiated by how rigid the pads are - one set is much firmer than the other.  They are pretty easily moved around so that you can experiment with them to get them just right.  The only downside is that if you are using the pads to adjust the fit/feel based on some limitation of the shoe itself (for example, if you can’t remove the existing sole insert), then they aren’t as easily moved from one set of shoes to the other.  From a size standpoint, I wear a size 10 (men’s).  According to the size chart the Medium fits sizes 8.5 to 10.  I almost decided to order a large and figured I could cut it down but opted for the medium and am glad I did.  It is true to size, and it fits my size 10 shoes perfectly with absolutely no trimming needed.  If you wear a size 8.5, 9 or 9.5 you would need to trim the medium accordingly.  But ultimately, the sizing guide the seller provides is accurate.  I am extremely pleased with the fit, the customizable nature, and the comfort.  Too early to make any judgment on longevity though.  I hope this review is helpful to you! [SEP] I love the fact that they come with extra pads to build up the arch support and u can cut the insert to fit ur shoe. [SEP] This is a versatile and effective insole/orthotic. There are pairs of inserts that you can affix to the insole (or the inner sole of the footwear, thought placement would be tricky). They vary in size, but have the same height. You can build up to achieve your personal need by placing smaller insert on top, creating a dome-like shape. The orange inserts are 'normal' and the yellow inserts are 'softer' cushioning. You can stick with one form, or mix them. For example, a firmer bottom insert with a softer upper piece.<br />A word of advice: If you plan to use the cutting guide, and not the existing original insole as a template (maybe it's glued in and can't be removed), then cut larger than you think is necessary. Then you can fine tune the cut for a perfect fit. If you cut too short, there's not much recourse.<br />I like that you can start with this product as a cushioned insole, and gradually build up for arch support. Further, appreciate the option to customize the softness of the arch support. I put this into my winter boots, with soft arch support, and it feels great. My shoe size is mens 8.5, and it's near the lower end of this product's Medium size. I think I cut along the lines that measure for size 9 (checking that it seemed larger than the existing space). Lo and behold, it fit perfectly into the boot. Maybe boots have extra space, more than sneakers or regular shoes. But, this is the very reason I advise cutting larger and then fine tune your adjustments.<br />Overall, the product appears to be constructed of quality materials, similar to other insole/orthotic products. It is not as stiff as other orthotics, which I prefer. (I don't require an orthotic, even though i don't have normal arch levels. So, i use cushioned insoles which give a gentle arch assist/support.) I used the softer insert, for a gentle slope and support. At this point it's difficult to assess durability. It seems to be made with quality materials, similar to other insole products. However, if it deteriorates quickly, or affords less comfort/support, i will amend this review.<br />I like the concept and implementation of the assorted shapes and stiffness of self stick inserts, with a cushioned formed insole. This product earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation. [SEP] I dont think you could ask for much more from an insole. I love that you can customize each foot. My only complaint is the adhesive isn't very strong so I dont anticipate the pads sticking for very long since I move them from one pair of shoes to another often. If you buy enough for all your shoes then it shouldn't ever be an issue. [SEP] I have truly awful feet and have used podiatrists and surgeons to help, who do some good.  These inserts and their ilk do help, though nothing can make these feet of mine truly comfortable.  But I'm grateful for whatever help these provide. [SEP] I wanted to try these inserts because of the adjustable arch support they provided.  I was disappointed in the actual insert.  It does have slightly better support at the arch than what comes with your new sneakers, but the rest of the insert was thin.  The foam at the heel and under the ball of the foot were not enough for me.  The adjustable, with the included 3M stickers, was not intuitive to apply.  I prefer the inserts that I get from Dr. Scholl's  better than these.  I am on my feet all day and these were not enough. [SEP] My husband has been looking for thin inserts that will still give him support like the thicker ones, and we finally found them, He's a 9 in work boots and the medium was perfect he only trim very little. I will update later to see how long they last but so far he likes this a lot. [SEP] Seem comfortable. I did have to cut them on both ends to get them to fit right but it was easy to do.",3,True

I've taken various blends of glucosamine, chondroitin, etc. for quite awhile for moderated age-related arthritis and found it helpful.  Though this is a good formula, unfortunately I am not a fan of the flavor.  It's sickly sweet with a medicinal flavor that's just not very palatable.

This one is a really great version of the classic tool.<br /><br />This tool comes in a nifty drawstring bag, and probably its best feature is that it breaks down in two so it can be stashed away in half the space. It locks up nicely when you close it, and when opened it has a secure latch to keep it that way.<br /><br />The rubberized grabbers and the comfortable pistol grip combine to make this easy to use, and quite capable of gripping just about anything.<br /><br />I don't use a grabber on a regular basis, but I can honestly say there is one time I need it when it is indispensable: when I drop something behind my dryer. When a sock goes down there, you'd have to have arms the length of Manute Bol to grab it off the floor. You can move the dryer but that's a lot of work, so the grabber comes to the rescue. Other than that, I keep it with my emergency kit, patiently waiting for a hurricane, tornado, or earthquake when I'll use the grabber to get things out of the pile of debris.

It's a precision and high quality tool. It folds for easy storage. The is wide enough to get larger items off the high shelves but delicate enough to easily get a pencil from under the couch. The tip is also magnet which is a great bonus. I've used many grabbers in my day but this is, by far, the best. [SEP] I am “vertically challenged” at 5’3”. Not many days pass that I don’t have need of a grabber tool: reaching for items overhead, in the back of cabinets, even unfurling a wind-tangled flag on the flagpole just out of my reach.  I’ve had other grabber tools that worked fine, but I really like that this one is collapsible and makes storage easier; the loop for hanging on a hook is great, too. The ability to rotate the claws is nice and the rubber grips are very helpful with securing items. I haven’t found anything to dislike about this tool. [SEP] This is really helpful to have around to easily grab things that can't be easily reached. I like that this grabber is foldable and that it not only has a grabber, it also has a magnet on it. The magnet is really a helpful addition. While the grabber is strong enough to pick up many things, it is not as sturdy as I had hoped.",3,True
Sport Roll On for Instant Relief - Made from Organic Hemp Seeds Oil - Amazing Cooling Gel for Post Workout Recovery by Alter Native - Made in The USA - 3 oz,[],[],,4.3,38,2100,"This is a decent cooling muscle rub. It's a roll-on, so it's easy to apply even on areas such as my lower back. It's far less messy than the creams/lotion formats. It goes on wet but soaks in fairly well, and doesn't leave a greasy residue behind, which is a major plus.<br /><br />The scent is menthol and, while it's clearly noticeable, it's not as strong as other menthol-based rubs I've used. It has more of a minty/menthol scent than a strong menthol-only scent. I would stop short of calling it an enjoyable scent, but it's at least non-offensive.<br /><br />The cooling performance is light but still effective. It takes a few minutes to build up the cooling. The cooling is not as strong or long-lasting as others -- I find that I need to re-apply this more often than other options.. Still, the lack of greasiness, lower odor, and the ease of application balance that out.<br /><br />The addition of hemp seed oil doesn't make a noticeable difference compared with formulations that lack hemp seed oil. That's to be expected since it does not contain CBD, but rather just hemp seed oil. It seems more like a marketing strategy to capitalize on the hemp trend (and justify a higher price) rather than an addition that actually impacts efficacy.<br /><br />The scent, ease of use, and non-greasy nature are all 5 stars; the cooling impact is 4 stars; the price/value is 3 stars. Overall rating of 4 stars. [SEP] I detect the menthol and camphor scents mixed with a wintergreen type scent. Reminds me of my Mother who always had Wintergreen lifesavers in her purse.  The mixed scent is not unpleasant. I am using it on my knees. It provides a cooling effect and the scent together give a feeling of well-being. Not a huge pain relief exactly but does assist in feeling better. However that occurs is good in my book. [SEP] I wanted to give this a try to see if it was any different to your average icy hot. To me, this is very similar, except icy hot actually lasts much longer, it seems. The scent of the product is minty and pleasant, and it isn't too overpowering. It does last a very long time, though, so if you are sensitive to scents, this product may not be for you. You definitely get the icy part first, then the heat. Product does work as it claims. I will likely use this, but I don't think I would reach for it again, simply because the strength isn't strong enough for myself, personally. [SEP] Love this hemp sport roll-on lotion. The lotion spreads on evenly - a thin, clear layer when you roll the ball over the painful parts of your body. The picture of the hand is showing me applying the lotion on a finger that was previously dis-located and causes a lot of pain. I also use it on my knees. I have been an avid runner my whole life and my knees have taken a toll. This works great - just roll it on and let it dry. My dad had hip replacement surgery and sometimes it causes him pain. He said it helps him to forget all about the pain...until it comes back! ;) So I take that to mean it works but it's not permanent! 5 Stars! Smells good, easy to roll on, and it relieves muscle soreness and pain! [SEP] I always like trying alternative medicine so I gave this a shot. First thing you will notice is the smell which smells like a wintergreen certs. This is very pleasant to the senses.<br /><br />The roll on feature I liked for a 'balm' because I hate having it stick to my hands when rubbing on so I looked forward to apply and forget approach.<br /><br />Well I used on some pain spots and honestly didn't feel much of a difference in pain relief. I liked the smell but didn't get any effect to actual pain. [SEP] This has been working pretty well for my mom with arthritis. She used it on her hands and back basically and she said has helped very nicely when applied at the morning and night.<br />She feels an instant cooling effect that last a few minutes until it dries.<br />The roll-on presentation is pretty convenient, just applied and ready.

"MONQ Essential Oil Blend, Roll On, FOCUS - Enhance Clarity - Increase Productivity - Improve Visual Acuity - Feel Focused - Pure Essential Oils in a Carrier Oil Blend - Topical Aromatherapy",[],[],,3.6,41,16229,"This roller oil I could go either way with.  It is a bit strong and not something I would truly enjoy wearing most of the time. Sometimes it smells like citronella to me.  Sometimes it does not.  Like most essential oils, it also doesn't seem to last long on bare skin.  So I guess that is at least something if you think it may be too strong for you.  Also, when I first opened it it was very tough to get the top off.  After I did - I saw why.  The roller ball was in the cap and not on the bottle.  I couldn't get it out at all so I just kept putting the cap on tightly until after a few times the roller ball finally attached itself to the bottle.  After that the cap still seems to stick a bit but the roller stays put on the bottle.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] I wanted to try this blend because the main oils that were listed are scents that I like and Spearmint has been tested to show effects on focus.<br /><br />However I was unclear that this blend has a ton of other stuff in it than the main ingredients, I'm going to list them below:<br /><br />Bergamot, Black Pepper, Caraway, Cinnamon Leaf, Clary Sage, Coffee, Eucalyptus, Frankincense Carterii, Ginger, Grapefruit, Holy Basil (Tulsi), Juniper Berry, Litsea, Melissa (Lemon Balm), Nutmeg, Organic Jojoba Oil, Peppermint & Sugandha Kokila<br /><br />Especially the inclusion of coffee is kind of concerning for me, if it could have caffeine I wish they would mention it. I also really dislake citrus sent and although it is very muted I can smell the bergamont/grapefruit.<br /><br />The smell is minty but I think due to the inclusions of a bunch of other stuff it does smell a bit more artificial. I can tell it's not artificial though because otherwise I'd be getting a migraine. However I just don't understand why it's needed to throw in that many additional ingredients. Just stick to the 3 listed and jojoba oil. As others have said the scent dissipates pretty quickly. I do feel that I feel a little more awake with this but I think that you can get a similar effect by putting peppermint oil in a diffuser.<br /><br />I would say just do a higher percentage of the main oils to make it last longer and cut all these extra random oils that don't add to the scent. [SEP] This Focus essential oil roll on is a blend of rosemary, spearmint, and cardamom in a 10ml (0.33 fl. oz.) dark glass bottle. I applied some to my wrist, and was immediately captivated by the light, fresh, wonderful scent. The scent fades very quickly, but I can still smell it if I lift my wrist to my nostrils, and that's actually about the strength I want when I'm in public. This is for my personal enjoyment, it is not meant to be a cologne. Something unusual happened when I put the cap back on and brought it into the living room to take pictures. When I removed the cap again, the bottle was totally open and the entire metal roller ball with the applicator top was stuck inside the cap. I shook the cap, and the applicator top wouldn't come out, but I was able to remove it with needlenose pliers and pressed the plastic applicator containing the roller ball firmly back into the top of the bottle. I've taken the cap on and off a number of times after that to test it, and it hasn't happened again. I had not planned to downgrade my rating because of a fluke occurrence, especially one that was so easily fixed, but I see many other reviewers have had the same problem with the applicator initially coming off. While it is easily corrected, it is a flaw that needs to be addressed by the manufacturer, so I dropped my rating to 4 stars. I like the scent of this rosemary-spearmint-cardamom blend, and I consider this Focus roll on a good value even with the initial hiccup. [SEP] I have been using this for my son with adhd. I do think it has helped some with focus for him for sure. However, it doesn’t smell very well so he doesn’t like using it.",3,True

Misleading<br />I do like the red light therapy with the heat that this device has.  I know red light therapy is great to help with circulation.  Have been using red light therapy for a few years now.  So, I like having a device specifically for my neck area.<br />Does heat up nice and it's soothing.<br />But, if you're looking for a massager, this isn't it. [SEP] There are red lights around the entire inside of the collar and an infrared heat coil over the spine in the back segment of the collar. It's easy to open and slide around your neck (which I tend to do from the front or side, then rotate the collar into place) and then short-press the power button on the front outside of the collar to start it. You can long-press to stop it at any time or short-press to cycle through 3 heats levels. The red lights appear to have only one intensity (yes! I wouldn't want them to dim). Even the lowest heat (#1) is pretty toasty, and I'm a gal who normally runs infrared as hot as it goes. After about a minute, it's too hot to press directly against my neck, but the collar design allows me to shift it slightly back and it'll stay that way. Overall, I'm pleased. Most red light devices don't allow good coverage of the neck, but this one does. [SEP] The Usuie red light neck massager is bringing the heat I need, but it feels like the numbers are mixed up. 1 was super hot whereas 3 was moderately so and that’s not how the instructions say it should work. I also received what appears to be a used item. The box was dirty, there was residue on the massager and a hair. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:e758e2cc630a178425eca5e35ad4686e]] This is a neat little neck warmer.. its not a massager in the sense of vibration. The red light therapy helps to penetrate the muscles and ease pain. It does have 3 light settings to help with comfort.  It's sleek and easy to wear and adjust. I do a lot of house  painting and have to twist in a lot of different directions and this helps to ease my pain after long days.<br />Its easy to charge and work. Only thing I didn't like is they give you a charging wire and no cube [SEP] I was looking forward to using the Red Light Therapy, what the Amazon listing is now calling Neck Warmer Device. When I received the device, on the outside of the package, in small print it states not to use if you have thyroid problems. I opened the package and the card attached said use with caution if you have thyroid problems. Which is it? Use or don't use? There was absolutely nothing on the Amazon description page saying thyroid problems would be an issue with red light therapy. Therefore, I have not used this item. Until I can find research or speak to a wholistic Dr that understands red light therapy I'm concerned if this device is safe to use in the neck/throat area. Not good advertising by USUIE. [SEP] I suffer from cervical stenosis and this honestly helps alot. I love being able to control the intensity. It heats up very quickly and the warmth helps ease my pain. It's also convenient to use and hands free. [SEP] This is a heater with 3 heat settings, not a massager as advertised.  There are 3 sections which light up in red, but only the center that resides on the back of your neck actually heats which may be a malfunction. The left and right sides light up but do not heat. Setting 2 is almost too hot to the skin, so I recommend placing a towel as a barrier between your skin and the heater. It is not a massager.<br />This item does not perform as advertised. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:41826693d0d974801b4420519ed4359f]] Comfortable red light neck therapy brace! If you believe in the power of the red light, this device is for you! Helps with neck soreness to some extent. [SEP] I have ran into several red light devices that say not to use if you have in this case Thyroid or heart problems.  I have thyroid problems, I never noticed the warning in the descriptions.  So if you have either do not buy this device. Others have said Glaucoma.<br />My husband did use it and could not get comfortable.  He said it was very hot on his neck.  As you can see we used all three levels.  It got to the point of too hot.<br />It does lay right on your skin in back.  It even looked hot, seeing him wear it.<br />I cannot say this would be a good item to recommend.<br />I hope this review helped you. [SEP] The battery life is actually pretty darn good. It works in 20-minute timed sessions. Something I don't think you can actually change. I was able to get 6 sessions out of 1 charge so not bad at all.<br /><br />The temp gets pretty darn hot. It was a little too hot for me in its highest setting. I noticed no benefit from the red light therapy but I haven't found any red light therapy device that actually felt like it made a difference. This is/was listed as a messager and it's not. It's a heating unit/red light unit.<br /><br />Just for your information, I hurt my knee while playing a game, minor injury but I did use the neck device around my knee. The heat did feel like it did some good for it. Overall, as a heating device, it seems to do a very good job with a battery that can last several sessions before needing to be recharged.

Other whitening strips made my teeth sensitive while using it, but this one I had no issues with. I will definitely recommend and purchase this item again. [SEP] I’m all about these dissolving strips.<br />No mess, no tray, no goo- just as efficient . I wish I took before and after pictures, I have a nice white smile but these removed surface stains, definitely whitened a shade, and polished. I used once a day (not twice) and got good results. Would buy again [SEP] These are different from the whitening strips I used to get (the popular brand in drugstores and everywhere) because you just stick these on and let it melt in your mouth. There is no peeling anything off after the 15 minutes, which seems to be a better concept than the ones where you have to peel off afterwards. The strips are thin and tiny, should most likely fit the row of teeth. There is no folding or tucking required, no bulky feeling. Once you stick these on, your mouth will feel a dry and the inside of the mouth will be stuck to the strips. I didn't want to move my mouth too much as the strips are working so that made my mouth feel even drier. I'm only on day 2 of these strips and although the instructions say to use twice a day, I am only doing it once a day because I'm worried about teeth sensitivity. After the 15 minutes was up I did rinse my mouth with tap water, and the water did make my teeth feel a little sensitive. It felt fine afterwards. I think these strips are great and I can't wait to see the results at the end of 4 weeks. If used twice a day, the instructions say you'll see it whiten to 7 shades in two weeks. There are 56 strips per box. The expiration date is printed on every foil packet (all 56 packets).<br /><br />My only improvement feedback for this product is they could have packaged two strips in each foil packet instead of one, just to cut down on the waste. I have to say Moon's outer box and the individual strip packaging already seem to use much less material than the big name brands but it'll be even better if they put two strips per package, as most people are going to whiten their top and bottom teeth together anyway. [SEP] These strips work well - although I think they work better *after* a cleaning to maintain your white teeth rather than using these *instead* of a good cleaning.<br />Anyway, they go on easily, and they stay in place.<br /><br />I used these before and after cleanings, I noticed that they did whiten my teeth, slowly but yes they did work.<br />AFTER I cleaned my teeth I noticed  that these not only maintained the shine, but they got into the nooks and crannies of my gum-line and cleaned in there also. [SEP] Teeth whitening. Very disappointed, it said you will notice a difference if used twice a day for 14 days. Well no change in whitening. [SEP] 7I cannot say for certain this product caused my issues, but this is the only different thing I'd done. Here's my story:<br /><br />I had a deep cleaning done at the dentist in September. I've waited about two months since having that done and continued with my thorough dental hygiene routine. I wanted to try to keep my teeth nice and white like after a dental cleaning so I decided to try out these Moon strips.<br /><br />They are all the same, top and bottom. I find them to be a little small. The instructions say to use twice a day for two weeks. I find the twice a day to be a bit of a hassle. I tried doing it about 30 minutes after brushing in the morning and evening. The strips are pretty sticky in your mouth, but start dissolving pretty quickly. It does leave a bit of a film on your teeth once it's gone. The flavor is fine.<br /><br />After 3 days of use, I noticed some discomfort along my bottom gumline. Upon further inspection, the gums at one of my bottom front teeth is now receding. I immediately have stopped using the strips and no longer feel the discomfort but my gums haven't gone back. I didn't notice my teeth looking any whiter after just 3 days. I have another dentist appointment now for December.<br /><br />So, be weary trying these. Even without the issues, I don't think I'd recommend these strips anyway because of the instructions, tedious and inconvenient. [SEP] I really like this product. It works well and you see a difference immediately. The taste is fresh like you’ve just brushed your teeth. The consistency of the strips is hard to get used to, but overall I love the product [SEP] Honestly haven't noticed any whitening after using them as directed, twice a day. Been using them for almost a month. So the strips are very small, like not large enough to cover all your teeth. I won't be purchasing again. [SEP] No results at all. [SEP] These strips are easier to use than the Crest ones. I like that there is no peel off and I can lay down to sleep with them.<br />They do have a lot of sticking power. Maybe too much because they really stick to the inside of my mouth and I fear my tissue ripping every time I put them on. I have used them once a day (at night) for two weeks. I really can't attest to whitening because my teeth are pretty white already. I do like them for maintenance because I am a coffee drinker.

"Iconikal Spray-On Glass & Window Décor, Ice Crystals, Frosted Glass Spray Paint, 5-Ounce Cans, 4-Pack","['Give your windows and glassware a magical Jack Frost look with this spray-on crystalline frost from Iconikal!', 'Spray on clean glass surfaces such as windows, mirrors, and glassware!', 'This product is proudly made in the USA!', 'To apply, follow directions on the side of the can', 'Each can contains 5 ounces (5 oz) of spray', 'Incudes (4) cans of glass frost spray']",[],16.97,4.2,43,611,"SO a couple of things I noticed- I did this on a day where the back half of the house was in full sun and the front was in shade. The windows in the back were super hot and the crystals from this started showing instantly and seemed to come out better. So people with poor results on this might try heating up the window with a blow dryer first or something if it's cold out. The front windows still did decent, just took them some time to dry and the crystals to show up.<br /><br />I can say from experience- don't overdo it all at once on a window! If you do then you'll get runs in your crystals and it detracts from them a bit. So lightly spray the window and let it dry for a bit and once it's dry to touch, decide if you need to follow up with another coat.<br /><br />Pro tip, if you want it to look professional then use a piece of cardboard along the edges as you spray or tape all of your window trim with masking tape before spraying this. Especially around darker window frames. If you have white window frames then it probably wouldn't be an issue. I have dark brown aluminum frame windows and the over spray of this looks kinda junky. It does wipe off though so I just have to find time and go out and wipe the edges down for a cleaner look.<br /><br />Overall I'm truly amazed by the frozen window look these created! I did it for privacy and you can't see past it- it looks great! It's very classy looking. [SEP] I thought I ordered a bigger size but I guess I read wrong. So make sure you read the size you are getting.<br /><br />I got these for my arts & crafts I do in holidays. They seem to be okay & will do the job.<br /><br />Sprays like a nice frosted look. It looks good. [SEP] Works as described easy to apply and take off. [SEP] Has a strong chemical smell. Looks watery when going on but turns frosty as it dries. Looks more realistic when you layer the sprays. One spritz doesn’t do it. Has to be reapplied often when there’s humidity / condensation. Leaves residue when it melts. I prefer spray on snow over this. Much easier to apply and remove. [SEP] This product will produce a frosted glass appearance that should work well for interior use. However, it breaks down rather quickly (days/weeks) in the presence of condensation. Hard objects can also scratch it, but the finish can be touched up. Warnings about using the product in a well-ventilated area should be heeded. The odor will dissipate completely, but the aerosol spray may leave a white powdery residue on surrounding objects (like dust). Also, there are obvious drip lines that form if you do an entire window at once.  Still, my kids love it and it's fascinating to watch the spray turn into an icy frost.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] This is something the whole family, especially the kids, enjoys doing during the fall and winter, around the holidays. When the kids are asleep, we spray this on the windows, and when they wake up, we tell them that Jack Frost stopped by during the night. During the winter and during the holidays, they adore this extra magic, and it also makes the windows appear cool. It is simple to put on and take off. [SEP] This is a fun pack of spray-on ice. Great for kids or for parties, it transforms your windows into swaths of ice, giving the illusion of the cold season. It comes with four cans, which should be enough to cover most or all of your windows. Cleanup isn't bad, just requires water and a towel. If you live somewhere that doesn't experience ice or snow during the winter months, this would be excellent for setting a winter vibe in your home. [SEP] Tested it out on my front door windows and looks like actual frost! Pretty cool! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:eb8ad12f87a3087469e67036b59aeb4]] The package included 6 cans, but one goes along the way.  This spray is not your typical snow, and it is just like ice naturally forms on glass. I'm not a pro and this was simple and easy to use.  Highly recommend [SEP] This spray-on product is easy to apply and coats the windows well, without being difficult to remove. You get six cans in the set I ordered, and I only used one to take care of 4 different windows in my house with some still left over. It may take a bit of practice to get the frost look you want but follow the instructions and you will do just fine.",3,True

Press and hold the SET button (when power is off), wait until the user indicator blinks, and then press MEM to switch to the other user.<br /><br />- It displays an average after three readings but it is not marked as such.<br /><br />- It has voice assistance but that comes with a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />NEGATIVES<br />- The cuff writing is upside down compared to other monitors but that does not affect the performance.<br /><br />- The average feature is nice to have but the average numbers are not marked with the AVG indicator. What happens is that after three readings, the first number displayed is the average. The next three numbers and beyond are the readings. Once I cycle through all the readings, the average is never displayed again unless I turn off the unit and then press the memory button again.<br /><br />- The voice option is moderated by a heavy female Chinese accent.<br /><br />This is an acceptable BP monitor. Operation and setup of this unit is simple once I read the manual. To take my blood pressure, I affixed the cuff around my LEFT arm with my palm turned up. I made sure my arm was at heart level and my feet were flat on the floor. Then I pressed start and after a little bit, I had my reading. I pressed stop to turn off the unit. The systolic and diastolic pressures and pulse are displayed.<br /><br />Blood pressure is never the same from moment to moment, so it is expected to get variable readings within a certain range even over the several minutes. It is important for a user to learn how to take their BP to get an accurate reading or it may appear that a monitor is not working when, in fact, it is user error. There are many great videos online that can help teach this.<br /><br />In summary, this monitor holds a total of 180 readings if using all two user modes. Changing users and deleting old numbers is easy enough as long as one reads the manual. The cuff is large enough for most people and the LCD Display is large and easy to read. It displays an AVG after three readings but that is not marked. The voice assist could be better as it is heavily accented. The current price is not listed but any price at $24 or below would be reasonable for this.<br /><br />For those who are interested, I attached some notes about several of my most favorite 5-star monitors. These monitors I consider outstanding for their features compared to all the others I tested. I listed two 4-star monitors because they have unique features such as Spanish speaking or Bluetooth. Each one of these monitors is accurate and I would highly recommend any of them.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KPQB2N Omron Series 5 Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is known as the gold standard of BP monitors. It stores 100 readings between 2 users. It does not come with a case and it is battery operated but an AC adapter can be purchased separately. The arm cuff on this monitor will fit most people. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00UB5EXNE A&D Wrist BP Monitor Model UB-543]] – This is the monitor I use most often in the winter so I do not have to disrobe to expose my arm. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. It is great for portability, comes with a hard case, and is battery operated. In addition, it has C.P. G. (Correct Position Guidance) to ensure the user does not make an error. That only works if it is turned on. Accuracy is spot on, which is atypical of wrist monitors. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B01AFQK85K HealthSmart Upper Arm BP Monitor]] – This is great if a talking monitor in both English and Spanish is needed. It stores 120 readings between 2 users. In addition to battery operation, it comes with an AC adapter, two very flimsy cuffs, and a case. If the cuffs were better, this would be my favorite arm monitor. (4 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B08HK71G16 Teyiyes Digital Upper Arm BP Monitor]] -This is a great monitor with a large cuff, two power sources (4 AAA batteries or A/C cable), and 2 user capacity 90 memory capacity for each.

The LCD Display is medium but easy to read and color coded in green, yellow, and red based on the hypertension level—which is EXCELLENT. There are two power options. It takes four AAA batteries or a USB Type C cable (both are included). There is an average feature after two readings. There are date or time settings in AM/PM (not military time). The cuff size is large. There is an irregular heartbeat indicator. Accuracy is spot on. (5 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09WGYJRH8 Checkme Arm Cuff Only Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor for iOS or Android Model BP2A 4663]] – This is one unique monitor. The monitor and cuff are in one unit and this is most useful if paired with the iOS or Android app (viHealth). The cuff size is large but the display on the cuff is small. Operation is simple. This is rechargeable and comes with the USB Type C cable for charging. There is no average feature or irregular heartbeat indicator on either the unit or app. There is no user designation on the monitor but such a distinction is possible in the app. In fact, the readings can be associated with multiple users (number and amount unknown). The date and time are automated through the Bluetooth pairing with the app. As of June 2022, the app is quirky and does not always connect. The BP unit itself is accurate and simple to use but this is not suitable for everyone. The [[ASIN:B09WDK7P8Y Checkme Arm Cuff Only Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor for iOS or Android ModelBP2A 0885]] is the high priced version that comes with a muscle stimulation(TENS) option. (Both are 4 stars)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B09NN8VS8G Ziqing Upper Arm BP Monitor Model XB-04]] - This monitor holds a total of 198 readings if using all two user modes.

This does not have an irregular heartbeat indicator.  (4.5 stars) [SEP] Antrolife BP Cuff<br /><br />As a retired cardiac nurse, I must have advised literally thousands of people to check their BP regularly during my career.  Maintaining a normal blood pressure can help prevent heart attacks and strokes.  Until now, I’d just use my manual BP cuff and stethoscope to check household BP, but I can’t do this anymore.  I recently gave my prized stethoscopes to my niece who just graduated from nursing school and is following in her aunt’s footsteps by going into cardiac care.<br /><br />How about accuracy?  Checking BP for myself and my husband, I found this device to be accurate, and the readings were consistent with manual readings.  It has an audible reading of results and only three buttons so is really helpful and easy to use for the vision impaired folks. Be aware that the voice is not only a stilted automated voice but has an asian accent, so is not that easy to understand.  I’ve turned the voice off on mine.<br /><br />For setting this up, the first step is to set user, date and time.  I found it a bit confusing because the year was displayed as 20, then on the next line was 22.  Its possible to track BP for two different users.  After the date is the choice of audible readings and display of BP as mmHg, the standardized measure used mostly throughout the world now, and kPa, which can be turned off.  The device can be operated using four AAA batteries, included, or plug in using the included usb-c cable (charge block NOT included).  The screen displays nice, large red numbers, easy to read, BP and pulse.<br /><br />The cuff seems to be well made.  Packaging states that its one-size-fits-all, but from my experience, this cuff may be too small for some individuals, and conversely, too small for others.  When using, make sure the velcro flap of the cuff meets the white stripe on the inside to be sure its a good fit.  If a cuff is too small, the reading may be inaccurately too high, and if the cuff is too big, the reading may be inaccurate and displayed as lower than it should be.<br /><br />I’d suggest taking this BP device with you to your next doctors visit.  Have them take your BP twice, once with their normal process then with your new machine.  While its perfectly normal for BP to vary minute to minute, if you find your new cuff to be consistently off, up or down, by a few points, then at least you’ll have a close ballpark idea of how your readings at home will compare with your doctor’s.<br /><br />I honestly think every household should have one of these, and used regularly, at least once weekly, about three times weekly if on meds to regulate BP.  I’m very pleased with this particular monitor, and very happy to have it.  5-stars!<br /><br />I hope you’ve found this review to be helpful!! [SEP] After dealing with thyroid cancer earlier this year and having to have half of it removed I've been way more health conscious than ever. My old blood pressure machine was out on its last leg and it was time to upgrade and in came this machine.<br /><br />The machine was easy to use and the numbers on the display were the perfect size. I was able to read them without bringing it close to my face or having to put on my glasses (getting old is so much fun! haha)<br /><br />I compared the results with what I got on my old machine and they were pretty spot on. [SEP] This monitor is easy on the eyes with a big display and appears to be accurate. I definitely think this product is worth the price point and a great thing to have at home as you start to get older or end up needing to monitor your health. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:d048dc3d1986722a838053f4d56cce1c]] TL/DR: This blood pressure monitor does the job, but there are a bunch of little things that need to be changed to make it a five star device.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o Very nice display<br />o Audio readout of results<br />o Large cuff is *really* large, should fit anyone<br />o Tote sack<br /><br />Cons:<br />o Device forgets time and date if using USB instead of batteries<br />o Changing users requires entering setup mode<br />o Memory display does not show date and time.<br />o Limited to two users<br />o Can't delete individual readings<br />o Green/Yellow/Red values don't adjust to age of user<br />o Time of day only uses 24 hour mode<br />o Audible output is intrusive when reviewing old readings<br /><br />My video review for this machine is longer than normal, which is sadly because I found a bunch of things on this machine that are just not quite right.<br /><br />First, let's get one thing out of the way. It looks like it does a decent job of checking your blood pressure. So it is performing the basic function you bought it for, and that's good. It seems to be consistent in its readings, and when compared to the readings of a name brand unit, it looks like they are in agreement.<br /><br />One of the nice things about this machine is that it can operate off USB power, so you don't need to always be changing batteries. However, if you don't have batteries installed, it loses all its settings after a few minutes of disconnected time. So in fact, you have to have good batteries in the unit at all times. And since the time and date are not visible on the display, you won't actually know if your batteries are dead or not.<br /><br />It's really nice to be able to keep track of your readings over time. This unit has a time and date function, so it's kind of puzzling that it doesn't show them when reviewing past readings. Instead, all I get is a number, starting at 1, indicating which reading I am seeing. Not helpful! I need to know the date I took the reading.<br /><br />And it would also be helpful to be able to delete readings - you might take more than one in a sitting, and you want to only keep the middle reading, but there's no way to delete individual readings.<br /><br />Having audible readouts of your blood pressure is modestly useful, but the recorded voice has a very strong accent, which is not necessarily great for the US market - a native speaker would have been a lot better. The audible indicator is actually more trouble than it's worth when you are reviewing readings, it starts speaking every reading as you review them, making for a very intrusive experience.<br /><br />The device supports two users, (and really, is there some reason why it can't be more?), but instead of making it easy to switch between user 1 and user 2, you have to go into setup mode.<br /><br />To earn five stars on a product you really need better execution than we see here. This unit is okay, but using it will not be free of aggravation, and that's a shame.<br /><br />--------<br />I'm honored to be included in the Amazon Vine program, and I work really hard to make these reviews and videos helpful. I put in a lot of effort to try to help you learn the most important facts about the product. Good luck with your decision, and if you do decide to buy the product, I hope the things you find in this review make it easier to use. [SEP] This item is easy to set up.  It's comfortable to wear.  I got generally accurate readings based on what I get in my doctor's office and what I get on my wrist monitor.  I like that it's battery operated as it's awkward to have to take reading near a wall plug. [SEP] I like this automatic blood pressure monitor.<br /><br />Pros:<br />–Fairly easy to set up, decently written instructions.<br />–Option to plug in with USB-C to USB-A cable (included) or to use 4 AAA batteries (also included, and yes, they work).<br />–Fully automatic. All you have to do is strap it on and push a button.<br />–Ability to save readings for 2 users.<br />–The readings will save with date and time.<br /><br />Cons:<br />–It has the ability to read your results out loud (which is actually another pro), but the voice used sounds like it comes from someone who isn't a native English speaker. However, I still found it easy to understand the numbers.<br />–The carrying bag is a little small. I'm planning to use the box for storage.<br /><br />Note that the ""PA"" setting is for turning on the reading in KPa. If you are in the U.S., you're likely used to measurements in mm Hg (such as 120/85). If that's the case with you, you can turn OFF the PA setting. However, if the PA setting is on, it will show the measurement in BOTH KPa and mm Hg.<br /><br />Overall, a decent choice for an automatic BP machine. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5. [SEP] Super easy to use and compact we love it! Hubby had some issues and helps us out a lot! [SEP] It took me a few minutes to figure out how to use it, and I definitely put the cuff on the wrong direction the first time. Once I got everything sorted out though, it worked just fine. It held the pressure for a long time and was kinda uncomfortable, felt like longer than it usually is a doctor's office, but hey, it works! The result was pretty accurate based on what I usually get. I appreciate that batteries were included! It's a good thing to have around so I'm glad I got it.",3,True
Youthology™ Premium Lion's Mane Mushroom Extract Complex | Lions Mane 4:1 1000mg + Chaga 4:1 100mg + Maitake 4:1 100mg + Shiitake 4:1 100mg + Reishi 30% 100mg | Premium Fruiting Body Mushroom Extracts,[],[],,4.0,30,2140,"Hubs and I have been taking a blend of mushroom powder everyday for months and I think it has really helped with our immune system. When this mushroom supplement came up on my list of items I could review I instantly selected it. I like the variety of mushrooms included in this mushroom supplement and am always glad to see Chaga mushroom included.  I buy Chaga separately as a powder because it is so incredibly good for the immune system. All of these mushrooms in this supplement are extremely good for health and there is nothing I can find negative to say about it. [SEP] There are a lot of dodgy mushroom products on the market, which makes the quality of this one stand out even more.  The extracts and ingredients are top notch, and the formula is also excellent.  No filler, no higher quantities of cheaper mushrooms, just the good stuff. [SEP] As a long time advocate/user of mushrooms, in bulk powder and capsule forms, I am impressed with the ingredients in this supplement. Mushrooms have shown potential health benefits regarding antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, immune system boosters and positive aspects relating to brain/neural systems. That and tasting great, at least in my opinion.<br />This supplement provides a good quantity of the various mushroom extracts per capsule: 500mg Lion's Mane 4:1 Extract, 50mg Chaga Mushroom 4:1 Extract, 50mg Maitake Mushroom 4:1 Extract, 50mg Shiitake Mushroom 4:1 Extract & 50mg Reishi Mushroom 30% Extract. And, the company notes these are all extracts from fruiting bodies.<br />The bottle displays certifications/badges for 100% All Natural Premium Ingredients, Made in USA and cGMP (certified Good Manufacturing Practices). The cGMP is the most important badge, to me, because it indicates attention to the purity and integrity of the ingredients and processing. So, check this box.<br />Serving size is 2 capsules, with 60 capsules per bottle. If you consume other mushrooms, or supplements that offer the same health benefits, you could take one capsule/day and extend this supplement to 60 days.<br />Overall, I like and am impressed by the ingredients in this mushroom extract supplement. It matches exactly to the description and depiction in the product details. It earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] I feel like it helped [SEP] Well since the beginning and once you charge your body after 7th day you'll find the best sensation of well being and energy.  A good combination of ingredients well balanced. [SEP] Easy to swallow and flavor free [SEP] I always find mushroom capsules that have everything BUT Chaga...and these have it.  Two a day and you have almost all the daily, recommended mushrooms.  The only mushroom they don't have in here that I wanted...Turkey Tail.  I am super happy with this brand and these capsules!  Saves me money with all in one! [SEP] This supplement combines Lion's Mane with Reishi, Chaga, Shiitake, and Maitake mushroom species for a range of health benefits. The capsules do include silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate so this isn't free of flow agents. For this combination of mushroom extracts this is reasonably priced and this supplement is worth trying for supporting immune health and cognitive functioning. [SEP] Since learning  about the health benefits of mushrooms I have been supplementing with them for about eight months now. I have tried many different brands and combinations of mushrooms and would put this One near the top of the list. Not only are they easy to swallow but since taking I can feel the mental clarity and focus which is one of the benefits of taking a mushroom supplement. I would highly recommend [SEP] Easy to swallow capsules with no after taste. A good quality product that works as described.",3,True
"Hydrogen Water Facial Sprayer, Kinovation Rechargeable Face Steamer For Facial -Portable Facial Sprayer with 15ml for Moisturizing & Hydrating for Skin Care, Makeup, Eyelash Extension, Travel",[],[],,3.1,32,301,"With this mister, you can change regular water into a hydrogen-rich treatment. In addition to hydration, you get the benefits of preventing oxidation. The device is small enough to fit in most bags and is ideal for travel. It's a good way to refresh your skin on the go or to keep it moist between skincare steps. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] This is a rechargeable face sprayer that is easily used. You put your water in. Then you charge via the USB charging cord. Charging two hours will give you approximately 1000 PPB that will do wonders for your skin. [SEP] I was Super excited to try this because I love new Tech things. I am using it though and I can’t really tell any difference. I can see it start to bubble when I turn it on and I know it actually builds pressure in it, because it will leak if it’s not tight enough and it’s full. The problem is that I’m not even sure if it’s making Hydrogen or if it’s even working correctly because the Directions are not very good.<br />  I can’t say I’d refer it because I simply don’t know if it’s working correctly. If I ever see a difference, I will update this. [SEP] Edit: it is now 11 months later, and I own 2 of these bottles, and I now know for a FACT that they do produce hydrogen water, because since purchasing my first one, there is something I use that needs hydrogen water added to it in order to work (can NOT use just plain, regular water or again, it will not work), and the water that this bottle produces works perfectly. That is why I ended up buying another one (as a backup in case this one stops working at some point). Unfortunately, I have also learned that there is something very unappealing (and gross) about these. A month ago the bottle I'm currently using stopped working well, and I came to find out that there was slime mold inside the bottle. I cleaned it out really good (REALLY good). Slime mold is not dangerous, so I was not at all worried in that regard. Since then, I make sure to empty and thoroughly rinse the bottle and lid out every day.<br /><br />Fast forward to last night, when the bottle started leaking all over the place whenever I turned it on to make the water, to the point that the pressure pushed almost all of the water out. When I started looking closely at it and poking around to try and fix the issue, I found that there were big, disgusting pieces of slime mold down inside where the lid screws into the bottle, in that gap there. It was CAkED with it. Once I loosened it up using a super thin, soft tool, the pieces of black and greenish slime that came out SHOCKED me. Keep in mind that I had been rinsing that thing out every single day, but until I went down in there with a tool, obviously rinsing did nothing. I cleaned it super well, and sure enough, it instantly remedied the leaking. I ended up soaking all removable parts in rubbing alcohol, and poured some into that gap and let it all sit overnight, but now I'm realizing that this bottle is going to take some maintenance in order to keep it clean. Now that I know the hiding spots, it's not that big of a deal to keep it clean (I think), so we'll see. It's just disappointing.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I really like this spray bottle a lot. I have been looking into hydrogen water bottles lately, and while searching, this spray bottle came back in my search results. Since I'm someone who uses facial misters ALL THE TIME, I figured I would try the whole hydrogen water thing out starting with this, since it's a lot lower in price than the drinking bottles. I was very excited to get it. It is simple to use, and I love watching it in action, bubbling up and the pretty light colors, etc., especially when I first got it. It feels very refreshing going on. I use it on my face and hands and arms before applying serums and lotions (the same way I use all my other misters) but I said to myself ""how do I know that this is really working/doing anything""? My answer came when I decided to spray one half of my hair with it, just to see what it would do. I have very long hair that is fine and naturally curly, so when left to air dry, it ends up a bit frizzy. Well... the side that I sprayed came back so silky I couldn't believe it. I had to run and show my family. Lol Since then I have loved it even more. Oh! And I also used it to remove a small (un-laundered) stain that I had on a piece of clothing since, I had read that hydrogen water can do that, and it came right out. Of course I can't say that it was this that did it since I didn't try plain water first, but I will do that test again in the future and I will update my review when I do. The first bottle that I received did have a hairline crack on the top near the neck, and even though it didn't affect performance, I exchanged it for another one which is perfect. I use it every day/night and continue to be happy with it.  I am giving it 4 stars since I don't have anything to compare it to yet as far as hydrogen water goes. [SEP] I don't think this did anything for me. It's honestly cool and comes with the charger. Design is nice but I really saw no differences in my skin. [SEP] There is absolutely nothing special about this. This is basically an ordinary water mister. You add water to the container and then press the button and it sprays a mist of water, you don't even need it to be on for it spray water. I thought if I turned the water on that it would heat the water up but that didn't seem to be the case either. This is compact so you can carry it in your purse with ease and that's the only true pro in my option. The instructions are pretty vague and it definitely does NOT improve skin quality as it claims as it is a basic water mister. [SEP] horrible instructions- i asked seller how to use and have not heard back from them- horrible product.. don't buy [SEP] Great for improving skin but there were no instructions. I kind of had to figure it out myself. After I figured it out I tried it and liked how my fast looked afterwards. At first I didn’t think it would do much but my face has a glow to it and appears a bit smoother. Very soothing spray. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:a078c0e92737cc45a9f0703fcffe020f]] Quality sprayer.

"BOJO Animal Kids Face Mask,4 Pack Cotton Children Face Cover (M:Age 7-14)",[],[],,5.0,12,5408,"I ordered these because I can usually wear kid size mask and I wanted something that looked less threatening when I run in my neighborhood with a mask on.<br />The adjustable loops fit my ears fine. The mask itself fits fine but it's almost too small and not comfortable enough for running because I feel that it's not going to stay up over my nose.<br />I think this mask is best for preteens or younger. It's well made and the outside layer feels like a tightly weaved cotton fabric. The inside fabric is t-shirt/Jersey cotton. I can breathe fine with it on despite it feeling pretty thick.<br />The bunny mask bled on the print and now it has a light pinkish discoloration on the white part. All the other mask washed and hung dry fine. [SEP] Got these for my almost eight year old grandson. He's back in school and masks are mandated. It's a small thing but maybe having some new designs helps with the burden of having to wear a mask.  These are soft and cute and cotton is appreciated here in hot and humid Florida. [SEP] These masks are super cute and adjustable.  My 2-year-old daughter is small (around 30th percentile) and my 5-year-old son is large (>95th percentile), and they can both wear these masks.  For reference, my daughter still wears infant hats and my son can wear adult beanies.  I also bought some pleated masks because my son will be starting in-person Kindergarten in a few days and needed more masks.  I like the style of these animal masks much better because they give a little bit of distance between the mouth and the mask.  I'm hoping this means he will be less tempted to lick it or suck it into his mouth, like he sometimes does with the pleated masks that sit flush on his face.<br /><br />I think the images on the front are screen printed or vinyl heat transferred on.  When I pulled them out of the package, the printed parts sort of stuck together, but they washed up just fine and the kids think they're great.  5 stars from my kids and me! [SEP] If your kids are somewhere below teenagers, they will like these fun masks, too. Sure they're mostly fun and don't have a nose clip to prevent glasses from fogging up, nor are there replaceable filters (or any filters for that matter). So this is mostly for general protection.<br /><br />(This type of mask is mostly to capture droplets from the wearer. It does not prevent aerosols from escaping, which in closed rooms can build up to render basic masks like this ineffective.) [SEP] I got these for my kids who range from 4-8 and they’re adjustable on the ears so they fit my 4year old fine even though I got the bigger size. [SEP] These are some of the only masks that properly fit my 10yo's head. She asks to wear these because kids' masks are too small and adult masks are too large for her. And with all the compliments she receives, she will wear them all day without complaint. These fit just fine and better than many varieties out there for her age. We are very strict on mask-wearing, even though we are staying safer indoors, so she has to wear a mask almost every day--so we've tried many. Earloops are adjustable, thick but easy to breathe, and just throw them in the washer and dryer with no fuss.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!

It is very compact (same size as a deck of playing cards), and offers multiple functions. You can:<br /><br />1. Use it as a solar-powered charger: to recharge two internal AA NiMH cells under direct sunlight<br />2. Use it as an USB-powered charger: to recharge internal AA cells from an USB port<br />3. Use is as an USB power source: to recharge cell phone or other gadgets from internal AA cells<br /><br />Upon closer examinations, however, each function turns out to be poorly implemented:<br /><br />1. The solar panel is quite small (4x7cm). Even under direct sunlight at noon time, with the panel perpendicular to the sun beam, the maximum charging current is just 100mA. In real life it will take about 3 sunny days to fully recharge a pair of 2100mAh cells. The case is not weather-resistant, so it should not be left in the open. But when I placed it under the windshield of my car, the charging current dropped by 50% because the glass is UV-filtered.<br /><br />2. When powered from an USB port, the two internal AA cells are continuously being charged at about 125mA. The problem is there is no 'charging done' signal. The little green LED simply remains on forever, even when there are no batteries inserted. You have to unplug the USB cable after about 20 hours, to prevent over-charging of internal batteries.<br /><br />3. When used as a USB power source, the 5V output it generates is limited to 300mA max., which is lower than the 500mA from a normal USB port. I have used it successfully to recharge my [[ASIN:B0024FAC16 Philips GoGear Aria MP3 Player]] and my Motorola W755 cell phone. However, if you want to use it to recharge a higher-power device (such as any smart phone or internet tablet), 300mA is just not sufficient.<br /><br />In summary, the T-5000 Solar charger is still a reasonable value if you can use it as a cell-phone charger. But it is not practical as a solar charger during hiking trips, because the case is not weather-resistant. For smaller size and less weight, you could bring an extra set of [[ASIN:B00003IEME Lithium AA Battery]].<br /><br />By the way, if you need a solar charger and battery pack that can provide at least 1000mA output current, consider the [[ASIN:B005ZSSBYY Opteka BP-SC4000]] instead. [SEP] THIS IS NOT A SOLAR CHARGER. It uses the solar to charge RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES. Even with brand new, fully-charged rechargeable batteries it would NOT charge my phones - I tried two different ones.<br />I bought TWO of these to use on separate phones and neither one works properly. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. I'm returning them both.<br />Also, most of the adapters are for outdated phones. [SEP] Weak at best.... [SEP] be advised the device does not come with rechargeable batteries.  Make sure you compare the cost of batteries when comparing the 2 devices.<br /><br />**update** 2012-10-11<br /><br />Don't buy this product.  It really isn't worth the money. the couple times I tried to charge my cell phone with it, it never worked. [SEP] ok [SEP] This product is something that you will not get to use very often. If you have direct sunlight most of the day, you will have to still wait a while for this thing to charge. I don't recommend it if you want to charge your iPod or other device. It is too much of a hassle. The charging is so slow that it isn't that worth it. Although, if you would like to use it as a battery pack, if you buy rechargeable batteries, it is great if you plug it into your computer to charge via USB and take along with you to charge your phone or some type of mobile device.<br /><br />Overall, your money is probably spent better elsewhere. [SEP] I was excited to get this Charger for my GPS because some of the company vehicles I drive don't have working cigarette lighters to keep the GPS charged during my daily work shift. This charger works until the battery in the GPS gets low, then the GPS will charge about 4 hours with this solar charger on two fuly charged batteries. Two fully charged batteries last about 4 hours for the GPS before it stops charging. Charged my cell phone with this charger too. Need two fully charged batteries or it won't charge your cell phone either. Better than nothing though. [SEP] Works as expected.  Pretty light.  Does NOT include the 2 AA rechargeable batteries that you need to use.  Useful adapters included. Leave on the dashboard of your car on a sunny day, and you'll have a good back battery for your phone. [SEP] i don't know if this charger works or not, because it was advertised on amazon (and on the box) as working with iphones, ipods, etc.  However, the device does not in fact have an iphone, ipod compatible interface. [SEP] This charger is great! It completely charged my ipod in less that 3 hours! However, the connections that come with it don't fit well with some phones. It works fine with USB cords that you already have for your appliances/phones, though.",3,True
"JJ CARE Adhesive Knuckle Bandages & Fingertip Bandages [Pack of 100] Fabric Knuckle Bandages - Elastic, Flexible Fabric Bandages - Highly Absorbent & Excellent Wound Care for Minor Cuts, Scrapes",[],[],,3.8,72,194,"There are a total of 100 bandages in this set. There are two boxes of 50 bandages each and each box contains 26 knuckle and 24 fingertip bandages.<br /><br />These stick pretty well and flex with the movement of my hands. They are also breathable. These are very strong cloth bandages and perfect for those who are always scraping their knuckles or cutting their fingers.<br /><br />The current price of $14.15 ($14.89 minus 5%) comes to $.14 cents per bandage. [SEP] First off I really liked the packaging. Inside the box were two different boxes of the bandages. They are the fabric type bandages. They were enclosed in very sealed packages themselves and were easy to open. The bandages were stretchy so you can form around what you need to cover. The fabric of the bandage was strong. I really liked these bandages and they are well worth the $. [SEP] Its really a pain that you remove the backing the exact opposite way all other similar band aids do.<br />These band aids fray almost immediately.<br />Do not like these at all. [SEP] Review for: JJ CARE Adhesive Knuckle Bandages and Fingertip Bandages [Pack of 100] Fabric Knuckle Bandages - Elastic, Flexible Fabric<br /><br />I have been using these fingertip bandages on my finger and they work very well to cover up a new cut. They go on easily and do the needed job. The adhesive sticks well and the bandaid packages are easy to open.<br /><br />The knuckle bandaids are even better. They allow the finger to bend without the bandage coming off. [SEP] While the bandage seems fine at first on my fingertip, it quickly loses it's adhesion. Unfortunately I can't return them because I passed my return window. Don't buy! [SEP] My husband loves these [SEP] I tested these on a scrape on my knuckle.  The fabric is thick but doesn't have much flex to it.  It was more like a splint than a flexible bandage that would protect but allow the knuckle to bend.  When I peeled up one side of it to try and reposition the bandage for better movement, it would not stick back down and I had to start over with a new bandage.  This would be fine for flat applications but fails at its designed purpose, IMHO. [SEP] Was disappointed with these bandages. They are small and do not stick very well. They shred easily also. You might get a couple of hours use out of them before you are having to replace. If you wash your hands with one on, you'll be replacing it. [SEP] It's always difficult to get a band-aid to stay put on a finger or knuckle. This comes in a box with 2 smaller boxes of 50 band-aids in each box. I did not have any present cuts or scrapes but decided to try one for a fingertip as I did some boxing up of some stuff at my home in order to see if it would stay put.<br /><br />I used my smallest finger so that it would have the best chance of wrapping around upon itself to adhere. I like how it folds around and overlaps with the band-aid's wings. That helped seal the area I wanted covered. It seemed to stick to my skin overall better than it stuck to itself on one side. I made sure everything was cleaned and dry before applying, but one area just kept coming up. It's almost $17 for the 2 boxes so I hoped for slightly better. [SEP] These bandaides are a great value but there’s a huge problem. The adhesive does not work. I’ve tried 3 of them and they do not stick to your skin or to the bandage.",3,True

"Fish Oil Omega 3 Softgels Supplement. Norway Sourced. Helps Boost Brain, Memory, Focus, Cognition. Promotes Cardiovascular and Immune Health. Supports Joints, Eyes and Skin. Essential Fatty Acids",[],[],,4.5,193,288,"Goes down and stays down, no after taste. Currently 56 cents per dose. EPA 900 mg, DHA 600 mg, Other Omega-3 Fatty Acids 300 mg; The company Vimerson Health is new to me and was trademark in 2015 from what I have found. [SEP] These are big softgels, but they are easy to swallow. So smooth. The 60 softgel bottle is a 30 day supply. Just two a day provides 2500 mg of fish oil,  EPA 900 mg, DHA 600 mg, Other Omega-3 Fatty Acids 300 mg. This is a good amount!<br /><br />I have no problem taking this-- swallowing big smooth softgels dont bother me, I get no stomach upset, and not even any fishy tastes. Hint of lemon. I keep it at my desk and have it shortly after my first meal of the day.  I take fish oil for my health, as we all should! More specifically to keep my cholesterol on check. All the other is bonus. I got remiss on taking fish caps. I normally buy liquid as it is usually easier to find the higher amount, and many of the soft gels types that I have tried have been woefully low (like, maybe 10% of this). I was working through some low dose/tiny softgels. I really need to get back to taking larger amounts, daily. The Vimerson Health Fish Oil Omega 3 has allowed me to do that. Sometimes I add in my other softgels later in the day, or take a swig of my liquid fish oil (my doctor said I can up to 5000mg daily- so I can double what I take of this, or just use up my other stuff).<br /><br />Some fish caps and liquids can have a fishy aftertaste/burp. I am not sure what causes that-- whether it is the formula, or when it is taken. I haven't had that issue with these, but I do take them after I eat in the morning.<br /><br />I included pics of the softgels, the measurement, and even of one in my mouth. I suppose one could pop the soft gels and empty it out onto a spoon, or food. But really, these go down super easy... unlike tablets, capsules and softgels tend to be like that. [SEP] The assay looks great. The pills are the larger size as I prefer. All good.<br /><br />There's an excellent coupon included for more.<br /><br />Better than expected. [SEP] These are easy to swallow.  I take them with dinner and do not notice any unusual aftertaste.  I have had issues with other fish oil products where I would burp and get a fishy taste in my mouth after taking them. I have not had this problem with these. I am happy with them. [SEP] This was a great addition to my supplement line. Smooth with no yucky fish taste! Will buy again. I love how Vimerson keeps expanding their product line. [SEP] There are a lot of Omega 3 supplements on the market, and interest in them is rising due to it's immune boosting influences (re: Covid-19). The thing to keep in mind is that they are not all created equal.<br /><br />Typically, when I see an Omega 3 supplement, they iron out to be about 1 gram per gelcap. In this case, it's about 1 1/4. The concentration of DHA and EPA is higher than most that I've seen (those are the two top types of Omega 3 that people look at, with DHA being especially important for brain development in children). There doesn't appear to be any garbage in it.<br /><br />Here's the thing with dosing Omega 3. The label has their serving sizes and that's all well and good. Often times, it's 2 (which is usually about 2 grams of Omega 3). I double it (and if I've just treated myself to restaurant salad dressing, which is loaded with Omega 6, I take even more). Good Omega 3 is something you can add more and get additional benefit. Sometimes, doctors even recommend it (a friend of mine takes 12 per day to help with arthritis based inflammation, it's the only thing that works for her). [SEP] Easy to swallow.  This is the first Fish Oil Omega 3 supplement I have ever tried. As I've only been using this less than a month, I'm not sure how much good it will do me.  But I have used other Vimerson Health products before and liked them, so I decided to add this one to my morning regime. [SEP] One of my staple supplements! [SEP] This product gets 5 stars for now. Vimerson was so kind to send me a free bottle of this product for a fair review. There is nothing much about to say about the capsules themselves. But also nothing negative neither. I will update if something bad happens or I turned into Aquaman. They look like any other fish oil capsules. I'm a regular user of Trader Joe's supplements, so I put them next to each other. If you care about the color: The Vimerson is a hint darker. But it also contains the double amount (2400 mg) to the TJ product. Sniff testing the open bottles the Vimerson smell a bit fishy (no pun intended) while the TJ's are odorless (as claimed on the bottle). Not strong. More like a dozen rubber bands.<br />I'm aware that there is no real science regarding how much fish oil to take, but it's interesting that Trader Joe's recommends one 1200 mg capsule a day, and Vimerson 2 of the 2400 mg. I haven't solved the Riemann hypothesis yet, but one 1200 mg/day worked for me so far.<br />I hope it helps to make a decision. [SEP] These were recommended by my husband’s Endocrinologist. My husband has thyroid cancer and since they removed his thyroid his energy levels have plummeted and though he’d deny it he gets super cranky.<br /><br />These pills are big!  As you can see in the photo they’re one inch but being torpedo shaped he found them easy to get down and he has a narrow oesophagus. You can’t cut them in half so make sure you drink lots of water with it.<br /><br />I’ve attached a photo of the other ingredients so you can exactly what’s in them.<br /><br />I’ve been taking them too and experienced no side effects or fishy burps as I have with other fish oil supplements.<br /><br />His energy has improved some and he’s only been taking them for a few days. I’m hoping they do the same for me along with improving skin and overall health.",3,True

Not only have I noticed I am nowhere near as sore the next day, but as the previous reviewer stated, it keeps your body going much better than Gatorade.  Unlike Muscle Milk, it does not leave your mouth with that ""chalky"" aftertaste for a while.  I really hope the company is successful with this brand because it is one of the best protein drinks I have ever had.  Way to go Attitude Drinks! [SEP] I kept to my same routine but added phaseIII to my life and not only feel better after my workouts, but gained muscle and lost fat, seeing results in less than a month. I will admit that while most of my friends and trainers swear by this product, I'm the only one who prefers the vanilla over the chocolate. The chocolate is still great tasting (not a fan of chocolate to begin with and yet this still tastes good) but the results are the same. Do your research like i did and by comparison alone phaseIII annihilates all other prooducts in every level. From the overall benefits and results to the health aspects. Number charts and facts can be compared and analysized all day long but it's the results that matter. And phase3 trumps them all. In regards to cost, overall it saved me hundreds in the long run compared to other products. But if you cant find it in your local stores (yet...) and do have to order it online, direct from the company or through amazon you get free shipping but i order it online from 30-35 dollars a case with free shipping but those sites dont always have it in stock the past few weeks. i guess because word travels so fast these days. Can't wait for the new flavors and products that are coming out! The gym at the country club where i live sells it at a discount but its not open to non residents and they literally cant keep it in stock because evryone who tries it loves it and gets more people hooked on it's greatness. [SEP] Attitude Drinks scores a hit with Phase III and the American Diabetes Association's interests!  The wonderfully boosted protein levels of this product result in slower digestion and a more even release of glucose into the blood stream from the intestines and liver.  PLUS, at 14.5 ounces per bottle, you get a LOT more for your money compared to Ensure, Slimfast, etc.  Finally, the product tastes terrific... even stretched by adding some purified water after the first few gulps!!!  Real milk makes up the majority of this phenomenal, tasty, meal in a bottle! [SEP] I have been through my fare share of protein drinks and this is by far the best!  Hopefully a banana flavor will hit the market soon! [SEP] I ordered this item on 13 April and it came on 17 April--Quick delivery.  You can try a free sample of this product by going to Attitude Drinks website ([...]) and click ""Investor Information"" on the left. Put in your information and they will send a free sample of chocolate and vanilla (actual bottles). After trying the free sample, I knew I had to have this after my workout-- Great taste. I lift weights and practice MMA.  This is a must have after a workout.  I also like the can because I can reseal after opening-- Keeping in the freshness. [SEP] Overwhelming consensus in our family and other athletes is that this is the best tasting protein drink around with the vanilla next best. To each his/her own! LOL :-P Based on our tastes then it's 5 stars for chocolate and 4 stars for vanilla. Hope they produce the banana flavor they've talked about. Just would like to see the price come down a bit, although the ingredients aren't cheap. CHEERS! [SEP] I ride dirt bikes, typically for more than 4 hours straight in the back woods for sport.  While the motocross/enduro sport is peppered with Red Bull and Monster drinks/ads - they absolutely suck at refueling the body after hours of long riding.  I throw one of these in my backpack and take off on my ride, and after a couple hours I take a break and enjoy(yes the taste is that good) one of these.  I'm amazed at how my stamina is regained and I do not tire like I did previously with just water or a Gatorade/Powerade style product.  This product is similar to Muscle Milk, but doesn't taste like that garbage.  I've had Muscle Milk actually get ""chunky"" and ""clot"" on me, and that was disgusting - never again.  I love that this is in an aluminum can so it can handle a crash without busting open and tastes great - just like chocolate milk!  Great product. [SEP] Ordered both the chocolate and vanilla.  I prefer the chocolate but both are so good.  I like that I am ACTUALLY drinking milk.  Muscle milk ""contains no milk"".  If you're going to call it milk, I think it should actually contain some.  Anyway...AWESOME product. [SEP] Worked out great.  My sister who has blood sugar issues would drink half with lunch and half right before the end of the work day said that they make a noticeable difference in the way she felt later in the day vs when she doesn't drink them.  So, not exactly what they are made for, but it worked for her.  She had a whipple procedure and a couple other problems, so keeping weight on and her sugar up is a problem, she's put on over 10lbs and has cracked triple digits which is still slender for 5'7&#34;.  I doubt it's ALL thanks to the drinks but she feels like they were helpful. [SEP] I ordered a case of this product, chocolate,  and was impressed by how good it actually tastes.  Most ""sport"" drinks have a funny after taste but this one is pretty good.  Once this drink makes it to the stores and becomes easier to buy I think it will become very popular, very quickly.

Atitifope Dishcloths Kitchen Cleaning Cloths Eco-Fabric Multi-Purpose Dry Wipes 3Rolls(150pcs),[],[],,4.0,9,226,"I really love these towels. There are 50 ""cloths"" per roll for a total of 150 ""cloths"" over the three rolls. The exterior design is festive. Starting the roll is difficult because the first piece is glued on real tight. However, once I got the first piece off, I was good to go. I was able to wash the counter with these or clean parts of my cats' litter pans. They are strong and reusable. I do feel the current price of $17.99 ($19.99 minus 10% off) is expensive. However, if these rolls last long and I can reuse more than several times, then it might be worth it because at the current discounted price it comes to $.12 cents per sheet. Only time will tell how long this will last.<br /><br />This would have gotten 5 stars if they were not so pricey. However, this might not be 5 stars for everyone. Since it is a paper-towel like ""cloth,"" when it is wrung out it is hard to unravel. I found myself picking apart the squeezed out cloth. [SEP] These are excellent towels for certain cleaning tasks. They are thin, but absorb quickly and hold a decent amount of water. They can be rinsed, laid flat to dry, and re-used several times, making them go a lot further than a roll of conventional paper towels.<br /><br />They are ideal for certain cleaning tasks, especially windows, glass, smooth tile and other types of smooth surfaces. They are not, however, all that good for scrubbing or use over a rough surface. They can be used for that, but the roughness will shred the towel making it only good for one use. If used on smooth surfaces, they can be rinsed and re-used multiple times.<br /><br />For me, these are ideal for washing windows. I use a few sheets of these towels with cleaning liquid to get the dirt off the window, then use a single microfiber cloth for a final dry and polish. The used towels are rinsed and set aside to dry for the next task. I can usually get 4 or 5 uses out of a single towel before it starts to shred up.<br /><br />My only quibble is that I don't care for the graphics printed on the towels. They aren't bad looking, just unnecessary. Other than that, no complaints. They work well, last a good amount of time, eliminate the waste of using one-time use paper towels, and are a good value compared to other similar towels (as well compared with  conventional paper towels since one of these towels can take the place of many one-time use paper towels). [SEP] I thought these were going to be much stronger and somehow different from paper towels but they are ALMOST like paper towels - just slightly stronger. This is basically paper towels you can hand wash once or twice and won’t immediately disintegrate. I was able to rip these, but once it was wet it was a little bit harder to tear (but still tore when I tried to). These are slightly less thicker than a paper towel. I believe these were meant to be used and hand washed 2-3 times and it should be able to withstand that if you are not deliberately trying to tear it apart. The concept of these is to use it like a dish/cleaning rag but one that is to be washed after use, air dried, re-used, and thrown away after a few uses - unlike using a traditional cloth rag where it gets stinky then you throw it in the laundry. These have cute prints on them but the rolls are smaller than most paper towels.<br /><br />While I like the product, the price of these for 3 rolls was too much and would not be able to justify replacing paper towels for these. [SEP] Atitifope Eco-Fabric Multi-Purpose Cleaning Cloths are very useful and have a place between paper towels and micro cleaning cloths or sponges.<br /><br />My first impression was negative because I was startled to see the size of a roll in comparison to paper towels.  I’ve attached pictures and it didn’t seem to be an economical choice since some brands of paper towels hold up well for cleaning. I soon realized that my mistake was in comparing them to paper towels.<br /><br />Once I started using these Atitifope cleaning cloths my impression quickly changed.  One thing that made a big difference is how they respond to cleaners containing bleach.  Paper towels quickly dissolve.  I’ve attached a picture of one of these cloths after using it for a whole day and then wiping down counters and sink with a bleach product.  It is starting to show wear but is still in one strong piece.<br /><br />This product is ideal for those chores where one doesn’t want to use a microfiber or other material cloth because it would be better to throw it away rather than launder.  Chemicals used in stainless steel cleaners, etc. are not something that I want to put into the laundry with other items.  Now I can have the strength of a soft cloth that can be economically tossed when done.<br /><br />I would prefer that these came individually folded in a flat box rather than on a roll but that is just personal preference since they don’t require the space of a large paper towel holder.<br /><br />Atitifope Eco-Fabric Multi-Purpose Cleaning Cloths are a good choice for strong cloth cleaners that are ecologically friendly and can be easily tossed away after standing up to challenging tasks. They won’t replace either my paper towels or my microfiber cloths but they definitely have a use alongside them and work very well. [SEP] These cloths are nice for dirty jobs.  More durable than paper towels, but still disposable, I think they are good for grimy jobs because they stand up to hard work.  I keep one roll in the car, one in the garage and one in the house for deep cleaning.  I have found that they work well as a cleaning cloth on my floor mop, too.",3,True

While all the probiotics I have tired basically work, there's no question that some work better than others.  This is one of the better products and seems to help more with the IBS than others.  I've only been using for less than a week and it is working good and no stomach upset.  The serving size is 3 capsules, and dosage recommendation on the label is 1 in the morning, 1 during the day, and 1 in the evening.  So this bottle gives a 1-month supply, and the price is reasonable for a good probiotic. [SEP] I have been taking this product daily for about 2 weeks now. I do not notice any side effects good or bad after taking. I do seem to have better digestion and generally feeling more energy. Very easy to take sized capsules. Another good thing is there I do not taste it if I burp afterwards, which is something I have noticed with previous pro biotics. I try to regularly take pro biotics and so far I really like this one and will probably order again! [SEP] Been taking these pills for 20 days with no issues. Seems like good insurance to take probiotics, recommended by several articles/podcast guests that I trust. No weird tastes, no weird reactions, no weird side-effects. Pretty sure it's helping, all systems seem heathy, running like clockwork.<br /><br />But what is weird, is the 1800 billion claim in the Amazon title. What? A little math shows that's the total number of CFUs in the bottle. What? (I did the math, seemed quicker than counting them!) You have to take 3 pills a day to get 60 billion CFUs. Knocked half a star off for that. And then, looking closer at the label, while I didn't see anything bad, Made in USA etc all good, there could be more. More certification, more transparency, more details, more variety. So knocked another half point off.<br /><br />Four stars. Hope this review helps you. [SEP] Product seemed to work well from what I could tell. Easy to take and swallow with no bad aftertaste. [SEP] Great probiotic but it calls for taking 3 per day at morning, noon & evening. I prefer a once a day but this product is effective. The capsules are easy to swallow and tasteless. The product is pricier than I am used to paying but the quality is better if you’re willing to pay. [SEP] If you want me to try a new probiotic, please put allergen information on the bottle.  I take probiotics daily, and the bottle on my preferred Garden of Life brand, (Prostate+ variety) clearly states: Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Soy Free.  These ADDOT WellLife Probiotic Capsules ARE NOT so-labelled.  In my experience, the vast majority of probiotic supplements don’t make the non-dairy claim, and many explicitly say they contain milk.  Because milk is typically the medium on which the lactobacillus active ingredients in the probiotic are grown.  That raised my suspicion, and that’s not a good thing when I’m trying a new product that I’m putting in my stomach.  Because I’m allergic to dairy and gluten.  They both make me sick for a period of weeks, and they take down my sinuses and other parts of my immune system and potentiate sinus infections and other respiratory ailments.  I get severe fatigue and headaches for weeks.  I’m not lactose-intolerant, so I don’t get indigestion with dairy.  After digestion, it gets into my bloodstream and cleansing it takes time.<br /><br />In choosing to order these ADDOT WellLife Probiotic Capsules, I looked carefully to ensure they were non-dairy and gluten-free.  And under the 4th bullet down under About This Item on the Amazon product page, we’re assured that they’re, “Free of gluten, wheat, dairy, sugar, soy, yeast, preservatives, and unnecessary additives.”  BUT THERE’S NOTHING ON THE BOTTLE TO INDICATE THIS.  There is a disclaimer on the Amazon product page, (below the Reviews section) that basically says the actual product may contain different ingredients than what’s on the product page.  And to always read the label before consuming a product.  I’m paraphrasing this disclaimer, so if you’re interested, please refer to it on the product page.  Good advice, it seems.<br /><br />Also, the product page headline banner says they have 1800 Billion CFUs.  Seems odd that’s not stated as 1.3 Trillion.  But the rest of the product page says it’s 60 Billion, but you have to read the fine print ON THE PHOTO of the label to see that’s per serving size of (3) capsules.  With a serving size of (3) caps, 90 caps makes 30 servings and 30 times 60 Billion makes 1800 Billion (1.8 Trillion).  But the TOTAL QUANTITY of CFUs IN THE BOTTLE is not usually the way probiotics state their content.  It’s typically per serving, and if it’s the sum of CFUs for the whole bottle, they say that.  Not a big deal, there’s not room in the headline banner description to qualify it.  But when I’m talking about earning my trust, making me do math until I get the right formula for the stated CFU quantity isn’t your best pitch.<br /><br />That said, I opened the bottle and took a capsule to honestly review this product.  And I had more sinus inflammation than usual the next couple of days.  The increased sinus inflammation may or may not have been related to taking one capsule of this probiotic.  But given the dearth of allergen information on the bottle, I don’t expect to continue testing this brand.  They didn’t gain my trust.  I can’t recommend them. [SEP] These probiotics are excellent and highly effective.  They work just as well or better than others I've used that cost much more.  However the product info needs to be updated.  As of the time of writing, the product title ""1800 Billion CFU Probiotics"".  These are very potent but not possibly that potent. [SEP] While I love that this product is made in the USA, non GMO and supposed to be allergen free, I don't like the fact you have to take 3 capsules and the label states 60 bil but the amazon page states 1800 bil. so this listed is very misleading and should be redone. Where are the companies checkers to make sure the listing is accurate?<br />The product seems to be decent even though the listing is not. [SEP] Easy to take, seems to be working. No after taste, just don’t like taking 3 a day.",3,True

[SEP] Very nice gloves that protect from hot dishwater and soap. I normally wear a small and these are mediums, but still fit well. [SEP] This two-pack glove set is well made, comfortable and durable. The blue pair has a thin flocked lining that feels soft against my skin and the unlined gloves are very durable. I feared they may be too short to reach the bottom of a 5-gallon bucket, but they are plenty long and end about 3"" below my elbow. The size medium was a perfect fit and even though they are thicker gloves they are still flexible and tactile. I recommend these! [SEP] I think these latex-free gloves are every bit as good as name brand latex gloves. They are also prettier with the lace imprint going around the bottom of the gloves. I have worn regular latex gloves a lot, especially when making my hand made soaps but I will be wearing these from now on. I don't think I'm allergic to latex but I used to get some horrible zits after going to the dentist so maybe I am. These latex-free gloves feel flexible yet seem durable to last a good while. [SEP] This is a nice set of gloves and could serve many different purposes. I will probably use one set as cleaning gloves, and one set at kitchen gloves for cutting up peppers, etc. I like that the gloves have some texturing to help give you a bit of grip when needed. They feel pretty well made and hopefully will last for quite awhile. [SEP] I won't do dishes without those gloves anymore haha. I bought a couple of pairs for my mom too [SEP] Great pair of gloves which are very soft and easy on the hands.  The feel of the material is very luxurious and feels almost silky.  Comes in bright white color with soft colors of pink and magenta making it stylish too. [SEP] My hands get super dry during the winter from a combination of the weather, constant handwashing, dishwashing, etc. These gloves have been a gamechanger for me. It's a simple, decades old concept, but I've never used dishwashing gloves before and didn't see the need for it. I totally get it now. Highly recommend if you are in need of some gloves. They fit well, dry quickly, etc. [SEP] These are just wonderful!! They come individually wrapped, which is a nice detail. I took a picture so you can see, but they are longer than my Playtex gloves, which I appreciate. When I wash dishes, I hate feeling the cold water running, but with these I cannot feel the water running. So I really enjoy that they are lined. Pics for reference!<br /><br />**If my review was helpful, please take a (literal) second and press the button below to let Amazon know.

PAGE ONE KF94 Face Mask for Adults Men & Women 4 Layer Filter Safety Disposable Fish Type Face Masks/20PCS,[],[],,4.3,22,759,"These masks are, in my opinion, as effective as standard N95 masks and at least as comfortable to wear. They fold-up very nearly and tend to last me about a week each. The ear strings are comfortable and stretch easily. They're a bit sharp on the back of my ears, but not unbearably. [SEP] I like the style of KF94 masks, they fit my face the best and are comfortable for me to wear all day, if necessary. These masks are made in China. They are individually wrapped in plastic bags, which I prefer. I keep backup masks in my car and bag, and this way I know the masks are clean until I need to use one.<br /><br />These masks have smaller ear loops than other KF94 masks I have used. For me, the smaller ear loops are good -- I have a petite face, and the small ear loops help me get a tight fit over my cheeks and chin. If you have a larger face, the small ear loops might not be a positive.<br /><br />The masks have the expected nose clip, but above the nose clip, the masks have a V-shaped cutout. In theory, the V-shaped cutout should help the top of the mask fit better against the sides of your nose, since it’s not a straight line like most masks. But for me, the sides of the cutout stand away from my nose, so they’re right at the bottom of my view. And I worry they are a spot for air to slide in and out of the mask, since they aren’t tight against my face. [SEP] The superior fit of these masks allows for more protection than the standard pleated procedure masks, especially if you are in an area where others are not doing their part. The material feels a bit thicker, providing more filtration, while still being fairly breathable; the black looks better for professional environments than the white or blue, in my opinion. individually wrapped for better portability and protection from pathogens. See pics! [SEP] Pro:<br />Secure fit<br />Comfortable to wear<br />4 Layers<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cannot think of any !! [SEP] These are good masks.<br />Well made, sturdy. They are comfortable to use. The ear elastic is not too snug, but it holds perfect.<br />They are breathable.<br />They fit perfectly on the face.<br />The did OUR candle test on them and they passed.<br />None of them broke on us. [SEP] These feel well made and build seems similar to the medical grade KF94/N95's. For the price, I wish it was medical grade. It's hard to test or judge filtration ability with these masks. What I can comment on is that they're comfortable. They do sit far enough from your nose and mouth to allow comfortable breathing. It's not laborious to breathe through and even wearing these for hours was not straining my ears. The nose fit and around the mouth seems to provide a decent seal. [SEP] These mask come individually packaged.  These are breathable.  The shape allows for room and lesser contact.  The nose piece is adjustable.  I like that these fold back up nicely when you remove it.  It’s more sanitary than the normal face mask. [SEP] The one honest thing about these masks is the statement ""not medical"" on the front of the box.<br /><br />Honestly, they are flimsier than surgical masks, & do not form an air seal at the top of my nose no matter how much I squeeze.<br /><br />They are more attractive than surgical masks (though that won't do much good if you get Covid!), & the ear straps are more solid.<br /><br />They are thinner than surgical masks, & do not have even half the layers of a true N95.<br /><br />I am aware the KF94's & K95's are not supposed to be at the quality of a true KN95; but in my unofficial opinion, I'd be better off with a low protection surgical mask at a much lower price. [SEP] This face mask is easy to breathe in and comfortable around the ears. The quality of the mask is really good. I didn’t have any problems with it while wearing the mask for three hours. And another thing that I like is that I didn’t experience any fogging with my glasses. [SEP] These masks are definitely good quality and provide a comfortable snug fit around the face. My face is rather small, so many masks don’t fit tight enough around my face. I did not have this issue with this product. However, they may be too tight for people with larger faces.<br /><br />As the product mentions on the front label, these are not considered medical grade and are not N95 masks. However, they are made of 4 layers and provide the level of piece of mind that I need. They are all individually wrapped and I did not notice any damage on any of the masks. Being black, they do look nice and stick out from all the white and blue masks other people a re wearing.<br /><br />Minus one star due to priciness. At a price of $16 for a pack of 20 masks, these cost 80 cents per piece and are priced higher than most other similar quality masks. At a count of 30 or more masks or closer to $10, these would be competitive and a good value in my opinion.",3,True

No response.<br /><br />I'm not consuming a product whose origins remain a mystery. [SEP] I've actually tried several different Keto creamers (MCT Oil Powder, 360 Nutrition KETO Creamer With MCT Oil , and this one). I found this one to less harsh on the system if you actually use a spoonful compared to MCT Oil Powder as you don't have to run to the bathroom right after or during drinking your coffee. This is unflavored compared to 360 Nutrition KETO Creamer With MCT Oil which I like because it does not alter the taste of your coffee. I cannot drink black coffee so I need to use a Keto creamer and sugar in order to get my coffee fix while staying on track with my Keto. However, if I had to choose between this powder and MCT Oil powder. I would choose the MCT Oil powder because I find that I have a hard time drinking my coffee with this creamer and the Keto sweetener I've always used compared to drinking coffee with just the MCT oil powder.

[SEP] First off, I'm going to review this for face/beard shaving. I don't have a bald head (yet, anyway), so that isn't my focus.<br /><br />I have used rotary floating blade shavers for decades (usually Norelco). They work best on my face, especially for the neck region. These shavers have always featured three heads.<br /><br />Well, here we have seven heads. Seven heads!! I have used very similar shavers to this one with five and six-head shaver attachments. This is one more. The question is: Why do the high-quality venerable brands stick to three heads, and these shavers use so many more?<br /><br />The answer isn't quality of shave. In fact, I was impressed at how well this shaver cleared the stubble on my face at the end of the day. It was comfortable, and managed to navigate the nooks and crannies of my face and neck as well as my low-end Norelco (if not better). But it's no match--not even remotely close--to my top-of-the-line Norelco (though that costs about 4x as much, so that's probably not a fair comparison). But--and this is huge--the ergonomics of the shaving heads leave something to desire. First off, there's very little reservoir under the cutting heads for shaved hair (see photos). This means you'll need/want to wash the head (it's water immersible) after each shave. Second, the middle head of the seven doesn't pop up. To remove it, you have to twist it off. It's a bit of a pain--and there's even less room under this head for hair than any of the others.<br /><br />The third issue I have with the cutting heads is that there's no obvious way to replace them without simply replacing the entire shaving head assembly. Based on my experience with other shavers quite similar to this, expect the blades to get dull after a bit of use, and factor in the cost of an entire replacement head unit when they do.<br /><br />In terms of seven vs six vs five heads? Well, the motors in these shavers are effectively the same. So if you have seven heads, the amount of power you provide to each head is less than it is in a five head design. That's going to affect the maximum speed and also the ability to easily tackle heavy stubble. Given that I don't sense a huge amount of improvement with seven vs five (or six) heads, I'd be inclined to veer towards fewer heads.<br /><br />In general, I'd suggest that you can interchange the 7/6/5 head assemblies if you want to get a replacement.<br /><br />In the kit you get:<br /><br />Seven head cordless shaver with LCD readout of charge remaining and touch activation<br />Nose hair trimmer attachment<br />Hair clipper attachment<br />Shaver attachment<br />Two face cleaning attachments<br />Three length guides for the hair clipper attachment<br />Charging cable (requires USB-A power source).<br />Small cleaning brush<br /><br />You turn this particular shaver on/off in a very unusual way. To turn it on, you hold both of the ribbed sides with your fingers. It turns on. If you take your fingers off the sides, it turns off. There is no way to keep it on without your fingers on the sides. I didn't find this very appealing and don't see the advantage over a clipper with a standard on/off switch. I also found myself occasionally accidentally turning it off when I was using it.<br /><br />The non-shaver attachments are a mixed bag. On the plus side, the nose hair trimmer works very well. This is in contrast with the nose hair trimmers that come with clippers, which are worthless. The nose hair clipper here works as well as the dedicated nose hair clippers I've used. On the minus side, the hair clipper is quite mediocre--it operates at a low speed and struggles with any amount of hair. It's about as good/useful as the clipper that's integrated into some shaver handles. Those can clip a bit of trim hair, but they are an exercise in frustration for any serious hair removal. Same here. The face cleaner attachments are probably OK, but I can't imagine using them.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd consider this a decent little kit useful for shaving your face and for nose hair removal. The remaining attachments are, in my opinion, not very useful. While it does a good job of shaving out of the box, my experience is that the heads get dull somewhat quickly, and you need to buy a not-inexpensive replacement assembly. Also, cleaning the assembly is a nuisance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />** 7 head shaver does a good job on face<br />** Nose hair clipper works well<br />** Acceptably comfortable in your hand<br />** Li-Ion battery: 2 hours charge for 90 minutes run time<br /><br />Cons:<br />** The odd system for turning on/off the shaver is not ideal<br />** Hair trimmer has limited usefulness<br />** Face cleaning attachments not very significant<br />** Shaver head assembly doesn't provide much room for hair and will need to be cleaned after each shave<br />** Middle head of shaver attachment difficult to remove for cleaning<br />** Must replace entire shaving head unit when one/more blades get dull<br />** 7th head in shaver assembly does not float like outer heads<br /><br />Note that there is a dizzying number of similar 5/6/7 head shavers sold on Amazon. As far as I can tell, having reviewed many of them, they are all made by a handful of companies and work pretty much equivalently well. The snap-in attachments even work across different models and brands. So shop around for price.<br /><br />To be honest, this shaver would not be my first choice, because of the weird on/off system that requires touching the two ribbed sides. Your mileage may vary. [SEP] A great shaver that gives excellent results. It's design and shape has made it so much easier to get an even all over headshave. It's simple to operate and comfortable to hold and use. The blades cuts cleanly and there's no tugging, pulling or cuts. It has a great battery life and is rechargeable. The recharge time is quick and USB charging cable is included. The shaver also has a LED indicator to show battery life and usage time. The shaver is easy to clean. It comes with a cleaning brush as well as other attachment heads for longer hair, nose, and etc. It's a great all-in-one device!",3,True

These are pretty much what you would expect of cotton balls only they are a bit more smaller (but slightly more dense) and a bit more expensive (currently $4.99) [SEP] These are smaller than the usual cotton balls I've encounter at CVS or Bed Bath or Beyond. You need two for removing nail polish (that's what I use them primarily for). They're OK but because of their small size I'll be using them up faster since I'd need to double up.

It’s been five days and it’s still going strong! I usually use this once a day, at my night time cleaning. It has four different levels but I just use the lowest setting. It works great and I really like the flexibility. It’s easy to use and gentle on my face. It’s waterproof but I have a different face cleaning tool for the shower. This works exactly as I hoped it would! [SEP] This is very small, as to the part that washes your face and the vibration travels down the handle more than up to the face-brush. That wouldn't be so bad except that it takes so long to wash my face with this and it gets irritating to hold it because of the vibration. I've tried so many of these and this one just isn't usable except when turned off. That's ridiculous, so I'm giving it three stars for working as a non-electric unit, but it's not good as an electric, given all the options on the market. Good luck in your search. [SEP] I am not sure why some of these types of machines are so bendy.  I mean you can press either lighter or more firmly on your own with a rigid brush.  I am not a fan of the bendy machines – and this one has some bend to it.  Not as bad as some others – maybe because the neck is thicker – but it still bends more than I would like.  I just do not see the purpose.  Again, not as bad as some others – and it does function just fine.  The brush part of the head is smaller than a lot of others out there so you can be more precise – but not really because of the flexibility.  Again – not terrible – but I do not get the bendability.?.?  It seems to be cheaper in price than many other brands/models out there, though – so that is something.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] Great! My wife loved this one. Said it felt amazing. [SEP] Small enough to travel with and keep in the shower or on the counter for daily use. Compares well with Popsonic facial cleaner except Popsonic has a larger facial footprint and it’s charge literally lasted a year (crazy huh).<br />Very soft silicone and non abrasive on my skin (clarasonic truly did a number on my skin). It cleans beautifully, just wonderful for makeup removal and the brush itself is quite easy to clean. Really love it in the shower. Very good value, gift able also. Recommended. [SEP] This is awesome! It's super easy to use and fun too! It's bright and makes my skin feel really clean! I love that it's waterproof to take in the shower. It works with my favorite cleansers to get me a deep clean! It's a great value product! [SEP] Per the significant other, this is adorable. It's smaller than expected, which works to it's advantage in this case. It is flexible, and not just at the neck of the device. It handle yields, and bends allowing a generous arching.<br />The operation is very easy and simple. Press and hold the power button. This requires a deeper press than usually found on other facial brushes. This is because the device has a generous silicone covering, which establishes the IPX7 waterproof rating. In fact, this rating allows this device to be safely used in the shower or bath. (At the bottom of the handle is the self-healing silicone port for the charging cord. It closes and seals to maintain the waterproof integrity.)<br />Once powered with a long press of the power button. Successive short presses of the power button cycles through the 4 speed settings. The silicone brush is not silent, emitting an audible buzz/hum. The frequency changes with speed increases. The accompanying speed increase does noticeably increase the vibrations felt during skin contact. The sound level might be a bit louder than desired, but it's indicative of the powerful motor. Personally, since the motor/vibrations are robust, I can accept the associated sound levels.<br />We both like the appearance and performance of this silicone brush. I am amazed at the degree of 'bend' capability of this device. (The significant other just yelled to me that it's pink, so it's hers, and I shouldn't use it. Find a buy a blue one. haha)<br />The product is exactly as described and shown in the product details. It easily earns a 4.75 - 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:fc34eec9b9533a3aff06efb484e0ede6]] This thing is AMAZING. So soft and easy to manage. The vibration sound is not loud, almost sounds like the razors men use to shave but quieter. After cleaning my face it felt so soft and cleaner. This is way better than washing your face with your hands. I like it that it bents and it’s super flexible. I will purchase another one for a friend because this is great for any skin routines. [SEP] First of all the price was unbeatable and considerably lower than all of the other similar ones on Amazon. I could not believe the dramatic results after just two days. Removes all of the dry skin that I didn’t even know I had and left my skin glowing soft and smooth. It does not rip or tear my skin like the sonicare did. It’s simple and very easy to use and only takes a few minutes to completely clean and massage my face and neck. [SEP] This cleansing brush is nice and compact.  I was thinking this was going to be a hard plastic brush, but it's actually really squishy and gel-like to its feel.  The charging port is really interesting; it looks like you have to puncture the area to get your connection in, but actually, you just have to shove the connector through and it connects and when you pull the connector back out, it seals itself back up, keeping the waterproof aspect intact.<br /><br />Keep in mind the brushes on this don't turn; it's a vibrating brush so the vibration causes the motion necessary to do the cleaning.  Does a decent job; I own another spatula-style facial cleansing brush that does a better job, but this isn't bad for the price.  Very compact as well; you can carry this in a bag really easy for travels.  Purchase if you need one of these.",3,True
Ultra Clarity Eyeglass Cleaning Wipes - 30 Pack | Safe for Use on All Coated Lenses and Electonic Screens,[],[],,3.6,37,7488,"This company has some kind is problem with their packaging. The wipes I received were completely dry—even crispy dry. I wonder if their moistening machine isn’t working. Definitely not recommended. [SEP] Good to keep a few packets in your handbag, backpack, or glove compartment. These wipes help clean glass okay, but for my eyeglasses, I still get some streaks. They're not perfect at all, I've used much better wipes...but they aren't terrible. They're just okay. Each wipe comes individually packaged. [SEP] Review for: Ultra Clarity Eyeglass Cleaning Wipes - 30 Pack<br /><br />These cleaning wipes are super handy for travel or just to keep in the car. I also keep a few near my reading chair. It seems that when I sit down to read, I almost always notice that my glasses need cleaning.<br /><br />The wipes do a surprisingly good job of cleaning glasses without leaving streaks. Having tried other wipes and found them wanting, I was a bit surprised to see how well these wipes work. I definitely recommend them. 5 stars. [SEP] My experience with these was similar to others:  at least half the packs were bone dry--to the point the paper was crunchy.  The other half was mildly damp, enough to quickly clean my lenses, which was fine.<br /><br />Either this product has poor QC, or they've been sitting on the shelves too long.  Don't recommend. [SEP] works just fine to clean my glasses and i always have one or two wipes in my purse just incase i need it. works well for me and i really like it. thanks [SEP] These seem like maybe at one point they would have been great wipes, but they seemed to have dried out. If they were designed that way then that's a flaw because to get a really good clear I had to use a spray with them and that kinda defeats the object of ready to go wipes. That being said the mini clothes clean the extra spray off really well - which is why I didn't rate it a 1 star but definitely not something I would use. [SEP] I like this cleaning wipes because is easy to carry and fits even in my back pocket of my pants and they don't break easily. they clean very well my sun glasses and my daughters glasses too. they remove any grease, dust or any finger marks on them.  the wipes are strong and it has the perfect moist and dry very fast. I tested one on my phone and leaves it very clean too. [SEP] I have used clothes like these before and these work pretty good.  As others mentioned, do you expect these to be full of moisture or overly wet.  They are just that.  Wet feeling.  They have a very slight wetness and more of a dry wetness if that makes sense.  I do find that I can use these to clean my glasses though.  I have also used some very similar to these so I was not expecting them to be any more saturated. [SEP] Tried a sample and it worked well.  Ordered a box of 30 and the first one came out of the packet all dried out and stiff.  Opened two other packets and they had a little moisture left in them but not enough to do a good job of cleaning my glasses.  Thank you Amazon for such a good return policy.  Decided not to reorder this product because of short shelve life. [SEP] Ultra Clarity Eyeglass Cleaning Wipes - 30 Pack | Safe for Use on All Coated Lenses and Electronic Screens<br /><br />Price has just dropped from $6.99 to $4.99; maybe at this price it would be acceptable. The box was very securely wrapped. Then each package is sealed with a ""tear here"" tab. The wipes smell strongly like ammonia or something similar. The wipes were quite dry - seems like the wipes should have contained a bit more moisture. They did work though. So, at $5.00 - perfect to keep some in your purse or briefcase. 4 Stars!

[SEP] This MCT oil comes in a fancy wine bottle and it is packaged like a fancy wine bottle. It has a slight taste of coconut oil, versus other MCT oils that have no detectable taste.<br /><br />You are paying a premium for the presentation of this oil, not for the quality of the oil. The bottle looks fancy and like a premium product, if that is the look you are going for. Maybe you are buying this for a bar or restaurant where the appearance matters. For the oil to be the highest quality, it would be better if this was 100% C8 oil. Other brands try to stand out by selling organic MCT oil.<br /><br />I drink MCT oil daily in coffee, and I have tried many of the brands. Another brand I have in my kitchen is the inexpensive Horbaach MCT oil that costs $0.15 / fl oz. This Genesis MCT oil has the same ratio of oils and costs $1.48 / fl oz. Premium 100% C8 MCT oil is cheaper than Genesis MCT oil.<br /><br />Many MCT oil bottles suffer from a pouring problem and drips. This bottle pours like a wine bottle, which is fine, and it has the problem with the last oil drip running down the side, like many other bottles. I keep my bottles on a paper towel.<br /><br />This MCT oil is sold in clear glass, versus nearly every other MCT bottle being sold. I am unaware of any issue with MCT oil degrading if exposed to light, but it is something to take note of. Many places caution to keep oils out of sunlight. The NOW brand sells their MCT oil in dark brown glass.<br /><br />The bottle says High Octane on it, which is silly marketing. They are likely trying to play off the pioneer in the field of MCT oils, Bulletproof Brain Octane C8 MCT Oil, which is higher quality and less expensive than this oil. Octane, the hydrocarbon, has a C8 molecule in it, which corresponds to the 100% C8 oil in the clever marketing of that competing product. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:858eb8c518d88c4348a22cfa42af995b]] This is a high quality pure MCT oil that I take with my coffee every day. I’m on keto so I appreciate its benefits that include making me feel full for longer and for brain clarity and health. I have also used it successfully instead of butter when I made keto bread using almond flower. I like that its not flavored and pure. [SEP] I'm on a keto diet so this helps me get rid of excess fat.

[SEP] Great Proffessional packing , top notch Product...Lovered my Trigilserid but spiked UP  the the HDL LEVEL. .. SO GO FIGURE FOR YOURSELF ! [SEP] This product is the third MCT (medium-chain triglycerides) oil product I've tried out in recent months. While some debate exists as to whether cooking with extra virgin olive oil is a healthy choice, I've used it for many years because it's healthy relative to many of the other available choices, and has a pleasant taste. At least, I personally find it to have a pleasant taste for most foods I typically cook. In recent years, I've also periodically made use of coconut oil, around which debate also exists, but unlike extra virgin olive oil all of the coconut oil products I've seen come in either sprays or solid form, and one of the main reasons I became interested in MCT oil is its being available in liquid form. I've used this Strength Genesis product several times in recent days after trying a similar product from QSTA in recent months, and am fond of both because these provide a very light relative to extra virgin olive oil to the point of having zero taste. The main challenge I've found cooking with these oils is that a non-stick surface isn't created as it is with extra virgin olive oil, although this Strength Genesis product provides a slightly better cooking surface than QSTA. So when making a turkey burger, for example, I need to remind myself to flip frequently, and when making over-easy eggs it's guaranteed that I will end up scraping the pan. The main differences between this Strength Genesis and QSTA is that the former is 60% C8 and 40% C10 in contrast to 100% C10, but the latter also comes at a 50% cost discount. Some might be interested in knowing that a portion of the labeling not provided in the product description here states that this product is a ""product of Sri Lanka"". [SEP] Wow This is MCT oil with a high octane rating from the Strength Genesis store... I knew I had to give MCT oil a try after hearing so much about it. This transparent glass bottle has simple clean lines that make it suitable for sitting on the counter. This is generally flavorless, however there is a smidgeon of coconut oil taste. Using a tablespoon in my coffee worked wonderfully. There is a slight oily coating on the top, but it isn't a major issue. It also works nicely in smoothies, where it is barely noticeable. The flavor is mild and precisely what it should be. This is the most expensive MCT I've seen. [SEP] I have been using MCT oil since 2015 – and I use it every day.  Mostly I use in it my salad dressing, which started out as being avocado, MCT oil, sea salt, turmeric (powder) and pepper.  I started using it to make raspberry vinaigrette, which is delicious.  And now recently began to incorporate dulse, garlic, cilantro, fresh turmeric, fresh ginger and apple cider vinegar to make it even healthier.  Of course, I could use other oils, like a walnut or macadamia nut oil, but MCT oil is processed very differently in the body, which is why I continue to use it daily.<br /><br />This particular MCT oil from Strength Genesis comes in a clear bottle and is the most beautiful bottle of MCT oil that I have seen!  It is tall and sleek – and actually made it onto my counter top!  It even comes with a lid/cork, which serves to seal off the MCT oil once you are done pouring it.  I actually have one of those green salad dressing bottles that I pour my MCT oil into (because most bottles are quite large), but I don’t have to do that with this brand.<br /><br />I appreciate that the company informs you of the quantities of C8 and C10 in the oil (on the back of the bottle).  If you are new to MCT, I recommend that you work your way up to a tablespoon.  If you go straight to using one tablespoon, you may end up with gastric upset, so it’s best to start with 1 teaspoon and see how that goes.  Most say the taste is imperceptible, but I always feel like MCT oil has sort of a nutty taste.  I love it!<br /><br />If you want to give some weight and smoothness to your shake, you can add some MCT oil.  It’s tasty right out of the bottle (yes, I consume it straight for a kick of energy) or in any salad dressing!  The limitation with MCT oil is that you cannot cook with it because of its low smoke point, so keep that in mind.<br /><br />I went to their website and you can see that their company is focused on wellness – and I love this mission.  They sell a range of wellness items and even have some delicious-looking recipes (ahem, “Avocado Breakfast Bowl”) to try.  I do recommend this MCT oil because the quality of the oil is superb and the company’s mission for wellness is something I am completely on board with!",3,True

Blissful Being Pink Himalayan Salt Massage Stone Set - Himalayan Salt Stones for Massage- Saltabilty (Heart Shape),[],[],,4.4,17,17967,"I was pleasantly surprised by the size of these pink Himalayan salt hearts. They're large and beautiful. They would make a great gift. The health benefits that Himalayan salt provides are amazing. [SEP] I am a strong believer in the healing properties/power of salt, so I decided to try the Blissful Being Pink Himalayan Salt Massage Stone Set.  I have a lot of sinus issues so I have visited salt ""caves"" and rooms, and I I have various salt lamps around my home.  This is the first time that I have seen salt massage stones.  This set is really nice.  The stones are larger and sturdier than I thought they would be.  They are very smooth and I could see these being used as calming stones as well as massage stones.  Since these are made of salt the color varies on the stones.  One of mine is light pink and the other is slightest bit darker.  Overall, these are great and I definitely recommend. [SEP] I got these with the intention of using it for massage treatments. However, once the significant other saw them, she said they should be displayed because they look beautiful and emit strong energies.  I did have to agree with her. They seem like works of crystal art/sculpture.  So, if you plan to purchase these for massage purposes, you might consider buying two sets. One for display and one for massage.<br /><br />The pair of hearts received are very similar to the pictured product. One is pale pink, while the other has more of a rose pink hue. The shape/form are practically identical. There are generously sized, with corresponding thickness. The heart shape is well proportioned. I estimate the height and width at approximately 3 inches, with the thickest aspect about 1.5 inches.  Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br /><br />Even though they are touted for their mineral content and physiotherapy application, they can easily stand alone on their visual beauty.  These Himalayan Sea hearts are expertly crafted, resulting in wonderful heart shapes, with appropriately smooth surfaces.<br /><br />The pair of salt hearts come in a gauze drawstring bag, that increases it's worthiness as a gifting option.<br /><br />We are both impressed with these Himalayan Salt hearts. It matches the image and descriptions in the product details. It deservedly earns a 4.75 - 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.

"Cervical Traction Device for Neck Pain Relief, Neck Stretcher for TMJ Pain Relief, Neck and Shoulder Relaxer for Cervical Spine Alignment, Massager for Muscle Relaxation and Neck Stiffness",[],[],,3.5,39,751,"I tried using this for a few days and the hardness of the plastic really bothered me. The literature that came with the item did say the plastic was hard and it might take you some time to get used to it, but I got headaches and only used it a short time.<br /><br />I did keep it and may try using it again. [SEP] This is the second neck traction pillow I have tried. While they are very similar and accomplish the same goal, this one is a bit softer and has a bit more give than the other one I tried. Personally, I like this one better. At 5’-4”, I think this one fits me better. I’ve had my family members try both, and they had different preferences. My son, who is a foot taller than me at 6’-4” preferred the “harder” one. From that, I have to surmise that being taller, with a longer neck so his head falls back farther, the firmer one is better suited to taller people, but I also have to believe the decision is going to be highly personal.<br />As far as the results, I’m extremely pleased with the noticeable improvement in my neck and shoulder pain. Since I work all day at a computer, I always seem to have tension in my neck. If I take a break and use the traction pillow a couple of times during the day, the relief is immediate. It does take some getting used to, I found it quite uncomfortable at first and had to gradually build the amount of time I could lie on it, but it’s much more natural now and I look forward to my few minutes on it.<br />If you’re looking for an inexpensive, medication-free way to relieve some neck pain, I highly recommend giving this neck pillow a try. [SEP] This is a very comfortable neck traction device.  It has a little bit of give, but not too much.  This gave me relief after 10 minutes of use, after an extremely painful neck being out for over a week.  This was the ticket, and just in time.  There are some pressure nodules that fit next to the spine, but they are not painful or excessive.  They are just enough to get a misaligned neck to pop back into place.  I have a long history of back issues, and this goes into my arsenal to combat those issues when one arises.  Too many of us have necks that are straight and not curved any more, and this will help get the neck back into the natural curve it should be in.  I have a different device very similar to this, but I prefer this one 100%. [SEP] My neck is alway stiff from sitting at a desk all day. I started using this cervical traction device for 3 minutes a day and built my way up to 10 minutes after a couple of weeks. The device is made from a thick foam that is uncomfortable at the beginning and does take some getting used to. The device comes with a little instruction pamphlet that shows you how to use the device correctly. The device can be used in a gentle or strong traction mode. You can also do side to side stretches on it. From my experience of using the device for a couple of weeks, it does help reduce neck pain and stiffness, but you have to add using it to your routine. If you’re looking for a way to fix your spine alignment at home this is worth a try. [SEP] I have had neck issues for many years with no relief in sight. After trying many neck stretching and pain relieving cushions. I have finally founds something that works. It did take a couple of times before I got used to the neck strecher but now I don't know how I survived without it. This is really comfortable even if it's made out of firm foam. My neck pain is hardly noticeable and when I do find it straining, I just take 10 minutes to stretch on the stretcher. [SEP] This stretcher is good, it does help you get some relief but not too much. I think it's greatest limitation is that there is only two positions to use it. This product seems to be better suited for smaller, lighter bodies. [SEP] The material is moderately firm with slight comfort give. The bumps on the surface are too shallow to have any affect as trigger points. But the overall affect was beneficial regardless. I did find additional benefit from laying on my side with it, as I have particular lateral issues as well.<br />The outer height is 4.5”, while the center height is 3.5”. The gentle curved side has an incline of ~48 degrees, while the intense side has an incline of ~80 degrees.<br />Useful instruction booklet included. [SEP] This neck pillow really helps. I was in a car accident just before Thanksgiving and all the places were closed so I bought this and it really helps to stretch my neck. I have allowed others to try it and they said it helped too.  The manufacturer recommends you start with 5 minute intervals until you get used to it but it was still comfortable for longer periods for me. Definitely pleased with this purchase and the value for the price. [SEP] Uggg.... I was just diagnosed with Cervical Spinal Stenosis and I am awaiting a neurosurgeon referral so I am in limbo whether I should use this or not. I am debating whether it will be going back or staying put. To be continued... [SEP] I think it is a nice way stretch your neck gently.",3,True

You have to use it in very small sections of thin layers.  The swivel cord made it easy to just angle and brush where she needed it.<br />Overall, it works. [SEP] Worked fast with little to no snags. Edges kept cool and did a great job at straightening my thick hair. [SEP] Perfect for something to straighten your hair quick! I take forever to use a straightener and this one works great [SEP] This hair straightener brush is just what I needed. I have always had thin slightly wavy hair that I didn't need to straighten. When my hair started to turn white I started to use a straightening brush which worked for a while but I have more white than brown hair now so a lot of the time and my hair was just a frizzy mess. With this one, I have been able to get some of the straightness back without so much frizz. It's not perfect but for me, it's a keeper. I don't have any chemicals in my hair so that may make a difference. Also, I was looking at my old brush, and it didn't say anything about ions or hair protections, etc. I just know that this one works for me. The gray top is a pic (3rd) of me before I started using any straightening brush. The first two are with this brush. The Blue dress pic is with my former brush. I hope this helps.

It also included anti-scald gloves and an instruction manual.<br /><br />It’s super lightweight so it’s really easy to hold. It easily glided through my thick hair & straightened it after going over it a few times.<br /><br />The only issue I experienced is where the settings are located on the handle. Unbeknownst to me, I kept adjusting the setting while using it. Other than that it works well; the swivel cord allowed me to maneuver from different angles and it’s compact so it’s perfect for travel. [SEP] I would definitely use this if I didn't need my hair to be super straight, but I did need it to be manageable after swimming or showering. I have 4c textured hair. [SEP] This hair straightening brush works great. I am impressed by how fast it heats up from the moment you turn on the brush. You'll see the number on the little screen climb up steadily but quickly. The swivel cord makes it so the cords aren't going to get all tangled up no matter which direction you are brushing.

"Organic Doctor Organic Charcoal Shampoo, 9 Fluid Ounce",[],"['Organic Doctor Organic Charcoal Shampoo, 9 Fluid Ounce']",17.89,3.2,28,8198,"what a stench! Awful. Gagged it was so strong that I coun't use it. It was also shipped in a brown mailer so the cap opened and the bottle was covered in shampoo. [SEP] My dry hair has been misbehaving lately- it looks dull, feels rough and is unmanageable. I wash and condition every day using hard water and use at least three styling products daily. I’m scheduled to get my hair colored in five days and figured my hair looks lousy  because my hair needs coloring and perhaps because I’ve tried a number of different shampoos lately instead of sticking with my usual products. As it turns out, however, I simply needed a good clarifying shampoo.<br /><br />A clarifying shampoo is used to get rid of build up from hair products, minerals from hard water, chlorine, pool chemicals, oils, etc.  This Organic Doctor charcoal clarifying shampoo is black, thick and has a strong scent. This shampoo has an emphasis on organic and natural ingredients and looks better than a lot of shampoos as it doesn’t have many common chemicals (e.g., SLS, phalates and parabens), but it does appear to still contain some chemicals such as fragrance. The scent smells heavy and masculine to me and I’m not crazy about it, but surprisingly my hair smells good after it’s rinsed and dried. And the strong scent doesn’t trigger my allergies or cause any irritation.<br /><br />The first application didn’t lather much, but the second one created generous lather that I massaged through my hair and rinsed easily. My hair looks restored as it’s shiny and manageable again. It feels and looks healthy, and my color looks good. I had no idea my issues were due to the build up of things like minerals and hair care products. I’ll gladly endure the smell and use this once or twice a month to clarify (more often may affect my color) and swimmers and some others may benefit from using this more often. 4 stars. [SEP] My hair felt really clean after using this shampoo, but like others said, the scent could definitely be better. It's not awful, but it's not pleasant either. It lingered for a bit after I washed my hair too. I like that the shampoo doesn't have all the harsh chemicals of other brands, but I'll save it for occasional use when my hair needs reviving. [SEP] Cleaning-wise, it was an ok shampoo. But I really couldn't handle the smell. I even tried to use a highly scented coconut conditioner afterward to disguise the scent of the shampoo, but I could still smell it. Overall, if you're into charcoal shampoo, this might be for you. But my first try at this type of product was a pass for me. [SEP] I wasn't sure what to expect from the Organic Doctor Organic Charcoal Shampoo. I was pleasantly surprised by how nice it made my hair feel! My dry hair was very soft after just one use of this shampoo. It also made it bouncy and full. The texture of the shampoo is what you'd expect from any other and it lathers nicely. The various essential oils used for fragrance can be a bit much, but aren't bad. The fragrance is a bit masculine, but not too bad. One of our testers didn't even notice the smell. Overall, I am a fan of this Organic Charcoal shampoo and would definitely consider buying. [SEP] The product seems to work well.  But I received in an envelope with no padding and the shampoo had leaked out except for about two washings.  You will want to condition your hair after using this.  If I would re-order this, I'd probably not go through the mail and go to a physical store. [SEP] Something about charcoal and the musky scent really appeals to me, and I tried this because I adore the Bioré line of charcoal facial cleansers, which are also strong and black.<br /><br />This shampoo lathers nicely but does appear to strip out the scalp's natural oils along with product residue. It's spendy, but using it every couple of weeks should be sufficient. I would use this product for the first lather, then use a softer shampoo for a second lather, finishing with a deep conditioner.<br /><br />If you're sensitive to fragrances, however, stay away. I like the scent, but it's strong. [SEP] I have tested several other Organic Doctor products and loved them - not sure how many times I'm going to be able to use this shampoo, though. It has an incredibly strong scent that I can't identify, but it smells like being in a drum circle in a head shop on a hot day. It's not patchouli, it's just... strong. And I don't find it appealing. However, it's a high-quality clarifying shampoo. Update: I've kept using it. I almost think the scent is anise (licorice-y) - my hair does respond really well to it so I'm soldiering on. Not drying, leaves hair manageable and not frizzy. I just wish they could do something about the smell.

Is it even good for you? We buy the Costco/Kirkland Fish Oil. You could take 2 capsules and get 2,000 mg fish oil (it only suggests 1), but 2 capsules only provides 500 mg EPA+DHA and 100 mg other omega-3 fatty acids. Dr. Tobias is 800 mg EPA and 600 mg DHA. I'm waiting to see if there are any noticeable improvements. I do think the Kirkland fish oil helps my cat's coat and inflammation, but it doesn't seem to be helping my husband's inflammation. Maybe he should try 2 capsules. The bottles were sealed. [SEP] Super big bottles and ample amount for the price.  I was already familiar with this brand and have trusted it.  Easy to swallow.  No fishy aftertaste or ""burps"".  Really, no complaints or regrets. [SEP] I got these because as a lifter I try to supplement anything I can to increase my workout gains.<br /><br />These worked well and had a decent serving size per pill. I appreciate it when I don't have to take too many pills to get my daily serving. This also had much more moderate fish burps than other pills which I appreciate. They came nicely packaged and the pills never melted together.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone that takes fish oils. [SEP] I have tried so many fish oils and though I preferred krill oil I think this is the best option if I can’t find my usual krill oil in the market.<br />The price is cheaper than my krill oil and I love that this is smaller compared to my usual fish oil.<br />It is high dose and though the inflammation/pain effect is not instant, took me about 2 weeks before I noticed something but I can’t complain since this bottles will last me awhile.<br />I love that they are wild caught and uses a special procedure to give me the best fish oil there is.<br />The pills are easy to swallow, doesn’t irritate my tummy and doesn’t give me a fishy burp. [SEP] It’s actually a great product for a good deal! It’s essentially a 6 Month Supply, 360 Gel Capsules in this deal with 2 bottles of 180 in each. They are coated to avoid the fishy taste that can happen with some fish oil supplements. They’re also made very clean, are tested for Mercury, Manufactured in an FDA Registered, GMP and NSF Certified Facility  and all in the USA.<br />  I think this is a fantastic product and the health benefits are extensive so, I’d definitely recommend! [SEP] A bit pricey but they seem to work as well as others in this price range<br />I like that the qty is high but the pricing is slightly higher than well known brands that I have tried in the past so I'm not too sure if I will continue to use this after I exhaust the initial two bottles [SEP] I hate fish oil pills because the after taste is the WORST but these fish oil pills are the best! I take them in the morning and don't taste them like I would other fish pills in the afternoon. Highly recommend! [SEP] I got this omega 3 fish oil due to the high milligrams of EPA  and DHA.  It’s called “triple strength” with 2,000 mg of fish oil containing 800 mg EPA and 600 mg DHA from anchovies.  This is higher than my previous brand.  It has a slightly bad taste, but not fishy due to the enteric coating.  It’s a great deal,  too, because for 2 pills a day, it will last 90 days.  This product is made in Germany and tested to meet Proposition 65 limits for PCBs. The oil is light colored and fresh. I recommend this brand. [SEP] It's been a few months since I last reviewed an omega 3 fish oil supplement, after having experimented with a variety of brands the past couple years, and this one from Dr Tobias probably provides the most value of the ones I've recently tried. In prior years, I had been a loyal customer of Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, and this product from Dr Tobias is a reminder of the existence of many quality alternatives with better price points. A lot of different opinions exist as to how much and at what ratio EPA and DHA should be consumed daily, so fish oil supplements are typically differentiated by these attributes, as well as the types of fish used and how these are processed. The aforementioned Nordic Naturals product uses a 1.44:1 EPA to DHA ratio, and contains other Omega-3s not providing either of these, and this product from Dr Tobias a 1.33:1 EPA to DHA ratio. The product description here discloses the type of fish used as ""100% fresh, wild-caught fish"", later elaborating that this fish is ""herring, anchovy, sardine, salmon and mackerel"", but this isn't what the packaging discloses, simply stating that this product ""contains fish (anchovies)"". Interesting discrepancies, and the only reason I'm rating this product four rather than five stars. [SEP] Love that these come in a 2 pack. The pills are fairly large but not too bad to swallow. We are big fans of taking omega-3 in this household! Since we do not eat fish, it is important that we supplement it in some other way. It does not have any flavor and we have not gotten the ""fish burps"" from these.",3,True

When I first opened the bottle I was disappointed that it was only half full. Then I tasted it and I was glad that it was only half full. I have been drinking protein shakes of all different varieties for the last 10 years, either as an on the go breakfast or after a workout, and this stuff is by far the worst I have tasted. It tastes like carob flavored chalk. The flavor is so bad that even adding chocolate syrup to it doesn't save it. It still leaves a cloying gross aftertaste in your mouth. I tried it both with water and with soy milk and it was equally awful both ways. Don't torture yourself and buy something else. The taste is amazing...amazingly bad. [SEP] I'm not a vegan, and not a vegetarian either as I eat fish. So I don't need to use vegan protein powder. But it's cool and healthy to get protein from pure plant sources, to mix things up, and I like that this is made from certified organic brown rice & peas. They are the two ingredients listed first. With no ""proprietary blends"" or other mystery meat nonsense in the list. Very fine powder, super easy to mix. Taste was more subtle than many chocolate protein powders, little weak, but it was just fine for me.<br /><br />It's low fat, low sugar, low chemical additive, no-milk product, mostly organic protein powder. It does have stevia, however. No huge impossible claims on the tub. FDA registered plant, not Ripped Bob's Backyard Secret Recipe or shipped in from China. I liked it. Hope you find this review helpful. [SEP] Vegetables actually have a fair amount of protein, and I'm happy to see this vegetarian option in the marketplace.<br /><br />I do a lot of weightlifting, and the more variety of protein options there are, the better.  I can't imagine using the same protein powder for years at a time.  I'm always happy to try out a new option, and this offering from GENONE is very good.<br /><br />Flavor:  If you've never tried ""workout chocolate before"" then let me warn you it is not a candy bar.  Nearly every brand of workout supplement that claims to be chocolate is like a semisweet chocolate powder.  Have you ever tried cocoa powder?  well, thats what this GENONE is like.  Personally I am very happy that its NOT SWEET.  I tried a ""cookies and cream"" protein drink recently and was really put off by the appalling sweetness.  This GENONE chocolate on the other hand is not sweet and has a relatively decent aftertaste.  BUT!  If you are looking for the chocolate flavor usually associated with milkshakes made from real ice cream, you won't find it here! (or most anywhere else, for that matter).<br /><br />It says it has 30 servings, and since I work out 6 days a week, that will last me for about 5 weeks.<br /><br />Mixing it was fine, it says all you need to do is ""shake well"" and its nice to not NEED a blender ball to keep it mixed.  But I did have to use a fork to stir it, particularly because I had to scrape the bottom and side of the container to get it all mixed in.  Really, thats not necessary it was just me being a little OCD about ""mixing it all"".  I felt it mixed well.  I just mixed it with water which is how I mix all my shakes, particularly when I'm reviewing them.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this for a change of routine if you are looking for a new protein powder to try.  It doesn't have EVERYTHING under the sun, like some protein drinks do, but maybe thats a good thing, right? [SEP] This is good protein powder supplement at a relatively low calorie amount. It does dissolve easily with an immersion blender and tastes fine and digests easily. Most protein powders I have go into smoothies with fruit. Because this one has a chocolate taste that is a bit problematic but even on its own the taste is fine. [SEP] I tried both the chocolate and vanilla but ended up preferring the chocolate more than vanilla. I really like the ingredient list and organic use of pea and rice protein but worry about the arsenic levels contained in the rice. I wish there was a way to measure the arsenic load but otherwise, nice product.",3,True

If your child is a fan of the l.o.l franchise they’ll love this set. [SEP] My 5 year old niece niece lol dolls. She loved this set. The only negative thing I would say is one or two of the nail polishes were old. [SEP] This nail polish set is very nice for a little one. They can put the nail polish on like big people. It has 5 different colors and goes on nicely. It doesn't have a chemical smell.. Just a bubble gum smell and then it peels right off. A good little nail kit. [SEP] My daughter loved this set. This is a great gift for any child that's loves doing nails. You receive 5 different bright colored nail polish. You also get a case to carry all the nail accessories. The little gems are hard to open, I ended up spilling them. Which was a pain to clean up. [SEP] My 5-year-old niece was able to play very comfortably and was very happy. I guess it can be harder for children under five years old to play alone. The colors are great (yellow, fuchsia, purple, blue, and green). Also, all nail polishes dry quickly. In this way, there are fewer problems when playing. The small wallet is very sweet and high quality. [SEP] This Townley Girl L.O.L. Surprise! Peel- Off Nail Polish Activity Set is only okay. For young kids, this could potentially be fun like maybe 4/5 rating just for the fun of doing nails and that this set looks really cute, but all together including quality I’m only going to say 3/5 stars and I’ll tell you why.<br /><br />Pros-<br />-5 cute-looking nail polishes<br />-240 cute little nail gems organized by type<br />-Surprise nail stickers<br />-Adorable little LOL doll bag to store items in<br />-Kid friendly nail polish set<br />-Dries fairly quickly<br />-Peel off (Some may consider this a negative)<br />-Everything just appears adorable and well-presented. I’m sure any little girl would see this and get excited<br /><br />Cons-<br />-Nail polish doesn’t appear as vivid on nails as in bottle. They are pretty transparent (Blue is the worst as you can see from my pictures)<br />-May dry fairly fast but will require multiple coats to show up well- especially blue. The pink and purple probably show up the best<br />-They are peel off which can be nice, but are prone to peeling off when you don’t want them to. My daughter went to wash her hands and a few of the nail colors had fallen off. I tried them on myself and they can stay a little while, but kids aren’t so careful.<br />-Not a huge deal but the rectangular<br />decorative caps are separate from the actual caps that close the nail polish bottles. You can sit there and twist the rectangular caps forever, but they often just spin around the actual cap. I usually have to take those off first and then unscrew the real cap. They could have just made it all one? I don’t know... seems silly.<br />-The gems are adorable, but this is actually what frustrates my daughter the most (she is 5). There is no glue or anything specifically to hold the gems in place. I just painted her nails and then added some globs of extra polish to act as glue. NOPE. Fell off in less than a minute even after waiting for them to dry-all of them.... and she was so excited about them and became a little frustrated wondering why I couldn’t get them to stick.<br />-The bag is cute, but for some reason, the company thought it was a good idea to put some type of adhesive on the back of the bag to connect it to the plastic packaging. Again, not a huge deal, but it won’t come off and you can see it in my picture stuck there with an obvious fold in the bag. I’m not sure why they thought that little adhesive circle was necessary.<br /><br />In conclusion, is this a fun set for kids?  Yes, it can be, unless those kids may become easily frustrated with their freshly painted nails and gems falling off left and right just minutes after they spent time finishing them.<br /><br />It really is a cute set and my daughter and I had a bit of fun, but we were both still disappointed too which is sad because I was so excited about ordering this for her. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks! [SEP] I hate peeling polish! I misread read it and my 3 yr old is a picker. She picks non stop at her nail polish. I found this stuff all over my bed. I feel like this makes the child who picks even worse about picking! It's cute and fun set but it can be a little maddening. My 7 yr old doesn't love this set and didn't have much interest in it. [SEP] The bottles of nail polish are cheap and broke when I tried to remove them from the package. Very disappointing.

It's size and weight make it easy to slip in a coat pocket or handbag. It is a regular umbrella, not particularly sturdy. When the wind gusts in New York City, the wind tunnels can be brutal and have ruined/inverted all but the sturdiest umbrellas. I still have to put this to the test, I suspect it will be similar to drugstore umbrellas. [SEP] Although I like that this is intended for sun or rain (and I live in Georgia so use it for both at kids' soccer games), it really falls short. It folds up with extra ""elbows"" which wouldn't be a big deal, except it doesn't always want to unfold when you're ready to use it, so you'll have to manually adjust each time you're using it. The extend/release features don't work particularly well, and it seems flimsy like it will only last 5-10 uses before permanently crimping<br /><br />See attached for what it looks like when you first unfold it - you have to manually adjust all the edges down [SEP] You can definitely tell the difference in the fabric of this umbrella—both visually and texturally—compared to what’s typically used. The sun protection factor seems good because of this, while the rain protection is equitable to normal expectations of water repellant materials. I deducted a star on the rating because not only is it a little difficult to fold up properly to attach the strap and replace in the cover, but care must be taken in opening it so that the bottom half doesn’t fold upward, completely negating any beneficial effects. [SEP] I give this product full marks for how it looks: the fabric has a rich feel to it and the scalloped edges make it look refined (if not a bit frilly).  However, it is too small and feels just a bit fragile to me.  Nothing has broken or even threatened to break, and yet as I open/close it, it just doesn't really feel like it is going to hold up to a lot of abuse.  The size is a bit of an issue because, yes your face will get shaded, but a lot of your body will still be in the sun if it isn't noon-day, and that's not even mentioning staying dry in the rain.<br /><br />Form vs. function... functionally, not a great umbrella and for me that's important, but... I mean it IS very attractive... you know, if that's what you're going for. [SEP] This is a pile of garbage.  I'm sorry.  For 20 bucks you can go to your local department store and get a much nicer umbrella.  It does not smoothly open and requires some ""adjusting"" at the bones to get it to open and it does not close smoothly without similar adjustments.  It's super thin and would doubtfully withstand much of a stiff breeze.  I have no idea how they got it into its storage sleeve.  I certainly could not.  I do not think you should buy this and I think this company should improve its product significantly.  I will say the teal color is pretty, but there are no little flower designs like in the pictures. [SEP] I like umbrellas. Even parasols when it's a day I'll be in the direct sun a lot. So when I was offered this Anti-Sun umbrella for ""Rain and Wind"" as stated by the product title I was in.<br /><br />Let me say I've rarely had to give a product a 2 star review. I usually pick products that I'm confident will be of some quality or use. Sadly for the first time in a long time I was disappointed with a product. Upon first glance out of the package all was well. It was light weight and very compact, though the black material was a little to plastic/pleather looking for my tastes it was still ok. Has it's own sleeve and an attractive blue. I unraveled it and opened the umbrella, it didn't open properly at least the first 3-4 times I tried, I always had to ""correct"" it and flip the outer edges down in some way. This does NOT give me confidence that it would be any good in rough weather, or even an aggressive breeze. After I did it a few times it started to open correctly. So I started inspecting it for construction flaws, which sadly I saw right away. The post seems as if I could easily bend it with little force, along with all the ribs of the umbrella. I also saw retail type nylon tabs holding the fabric down among the skelleton of the umbrella. My particular umbrella had a hem stitching flaw along one of the scalloped edges. It was also harder than I'd like it to be to get it to fold up and the strap to engage with the velcro. There is no way I'm going to get it back into the sleeve without a lot of effort that it's just not worth expending. The umbrella is NOT a good value at over $20 at time of writing.<br /><br />The ONLY reasons I would give this a two star and not a one is:  The design is nice with the color on the outside, the dark black on the inside will help keep sun out. The scalloped edges are pretty and a nice touch. THIS UMBRELLA IS ONLY GOOD AS A PAROSOL (on a non-windy day) provided yours does not come with a stitching flaw as mine did. Otherwise it is in my opinion useless in any other weather. [SEP] This is a really nice umbrella.  We have one at the house and in my car.  My husband needed one so this was great.  It opens and closes with no issues.  We have not used it besides testing it out yet, so we will see how it holds up overtime. [SEP] Price point is to high for this umbrella.

It IS less messy than regular powder, however, it doesn't work as well.  And it is oddly... greasy?  He reports that it is lotiony in a weird way.  Since you usually use powder to keep areas and creases dry.  If it's lotiony or greasy, not so much.<br />If you're hoping for a replacement for powder - this isn't it - at least in my husband's opinion. [SEP] I have used Gold Bond products for years.  Every one of them has been a winner and this is no exception.  I get those itchy summer dry skin patches that are so annoying.  I hate using lotion when it is hot (it just makes me fell sweaty and gross).  I have this a try and let magic all those itchy spots went away within 2 days.  The spray is refreshing and cooling and leaves no gross sticky residue.  I use it daily and have not had any issues. It also helps prevent sweaty chaffing when I'm out working hard in the hot sun.  Another winning product from Gold Bond. [SEP] I HOPE YOU LIKE THE SENSATION OF ALTOIDS ON YOUR GOOCH I SURE DON'T [SEP] Great product however with serious aerosol problems.  Spray is<br />Largely non-functional.. Stick with the non-spray version [SEP] I like this product, even better that it is talc free.  Love the scent. [SEP] It is almost impossible to push the plunger. I thought it was one can so ordered a couple more. The same thing, HOW in the world can a company sell something like this? Gold Bond, I mean, not Amazon. And yes I twisted the cap and had other people try it. [SEP] After shaking the can as instructed and several minutes of trying to make it spray, it only sprays out half inch sized spot of powder.  Really worthless can. [SEP] This product is not cheap but when shipped in a proper spray bottle it does the trick. Smells fresh and smooth. I should have returned it but wasn’t worth the time when I considered all of the other things I had to accomplish, such as coming up with a minimum 100 words to leave this comment. Based on my experience, buy the travel size bottle if you’re female and under the age of 15 and over 50. Otherwise it’s a frustrating loosing battle. [SEP] Cannot use. Too hard to spray. Would have to use both hands. Cannot aim. Dissapointed [SEP] This product is great. It has a nice, clean scent that keeps me feeling fresh all day. It's well worth the money even tho it's not expensive.  It's easy to use. Just spray on and go.",3,True
Gift Bags,[],[],,4.0,43,21404,"Beautiful bags!  Love, love, LOVE these! Beautiful and High quality!  get some! Thank you! [SEP] Gift bags are arrived well packaged, sturdy and beautiful.. love it [SEP] These bags are sturdy, durable, and affordable. They arrive boxed for easy storage and are assembled as you need them. The patterns are bright and vivid, and I found them tasteful for a variety of occasions. Considering you get six of these in a package versus purchasing one bag at a time at a local store, I find this to be an incredible deal. I will be ordering again for other celebrations. [SEP] Great bag for smaller gifts [SEP] I am really surprised at the quality of these bags.  They are better then average (what you would normally find in a dollar store) and probably along the lines of what you expect to find in a party store.  Really good quality.  IF you put something super heavy in them you should still support the bottom, but you would do that with any bag.  The designs and colors are fantastic.  Perfect for pretty much any event and most holidays.  Nice average size bags.  Would recommend. [SEP] These bags are very impressive in person. They are much more striking than the product photos can convey. Good quality, and a great way to present a present. [SEP] Good quality, cute for gifting [SEP] Totally disliked that the handles were not already positioned in/ on the lovely bags. [SEP] These gift bags are super cute!

Restore 100% Whey Isolate Protein Powder – 25g Whey Protein Isolate with 10g Multi Collagen Support – Fast Absorbing Chocolate Protein Powder for Men and Women – Chocolate Caramel Cookie Flavor,[],[],,4.5,51,594,"[[VIDEOID:b000155fb557c7642d37ba6fe282f0fb]] This is like protein isolates on steroids.<br /> Extra healthy.<br /> Extra Protein for muscle fuel..<br /> Plus, joint support and soft tissue<br /><br />All in a great taste mix.<br /><br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-) [SEP] I like this Twix-flavored protein.  The collagen powder in this protein product really does help with the granularity, but it does mean that a blender rather than a fork or spoon is your mixing tool of choice.  It's very smooth when made, and it has a good enough flavor on it's own that you won't need to supplement your supplement drink with anything, but like most chocolate products, a little banana or peanut butter goes a long way towards making this more of a shake and less of a drink.<br /><br />No matter how you like it though, I think you'll find it's good. [SEP] The flavor slaps, lets be honest. But OMG it actually dissolves! No more grainy liquid with hidden powder chunks that you have to chew...freakin gross. I already have another one on the way cause I am not trying to run out. For real, put it in your cart [SEP] There are a ton of “pros” about this protein powder but, really, the bottom line is always about the taste.  This stuff tastes great!  I have been using it to make chocolate caramel protein shakes that taste like a dessert.  I have to admit, I originally balked at the $31 price BUT a serving size is one scoop while most protein powders are two scoops AND this powder packs 31 grams (according to the label on my container) or protein in that one scoop.  When you do the math, it’s actually cheaper than most protein supplements.  Another plus is that it’s made in the US and has the Good Manufacturing Practice seal.  Also, I love that it’s a veterans-owned business.  I can feel good about all of that.  This is a great product and I’ll be sure to try other flavors. [SEP] I had try many different brands of proteins and let me tell you this is the best protein shake I ever had. I don't like to feel blotted so I always use isolate whey. This product is made so fine,  that you will fall in love with the flavor, feel full and not bloated. Amazing job ! [SEP] The flavor here is absolutely delicious chocolatey-ness with some nice salty sugary from the carmel.  It makes it an absolute treat to drink, and to help prevent any chalkiness; toss in an ice cube when stirring or shaking.<br /><br />From a nutritional content, it does a great job balancing flavor and deriving the majority of its calories from protein. So it helps you boost that without dealing with excess fat/carbs.<br /><br />At about $2 per shake, it threads that line between being just between the expensive and cheaply brands so is just about in the middle for value.<br /><br />Overall, I’d likely buy again as it is one of the more flavorful wheys I’ve found! [SEP] First of all, the flavor is good and it mixes well in a shaker bottle.  Those things cannot always be said.  I also appreciate the very accurate nutrition label - the very precise 138.5 calories per scoop makes me feel like they actually recognize who their customer base is.  Many of these protein products take full advantage of the fact that the FDA allows labels to be ""wrong"" by up to 20%.  The people buying these products care about these facts, so I appreciate that the company has the courage to post an extra-precise nutrition label.  Speaking of which, the calorie-to-protein ratio is great and among the best you'll find out there. [SEP] I've tried many a protein powder, and it's nice to try a flavor that is outside the usual chocolate/vanilla duo.  This has a pretty good chocolate flavor, with a hint of caramel.  I like it, but it's a bit on the sweet side for me.  Not a big deal, I just make sure to not add anything else sweet to my smoothies and it's good.  I like this with peanut butter powder, mmmmmmmm.<br /><br />In nay case, nutrition is good, with the added collagen a welcome addition.  This blends easily, and digests without issue for me.  Price is reasonable for the quality and collaen/whey blend. [SEP] Whoever thought of combining collagen and protein powder together to create a product that tackles the numerous signs of aging is genius! Incarnate Nutrition's 25g Whey Protein Isolate with 10g Multi Collagen Support – Fast Absorbing Chocolate Protein Powder for Men and Women – Chocolate Caramel Cookie Flavor is chock full of both supplements and then some:<br /><br />- LOVE how easily this powder dissolves into whichever liquid it is combined with, easily and quickly! There is no residual clumps or leftover product on the bottom of your cup, making sure you get every last drop.<br /><br />- The flavor is yummy and tastes like a mix of a chocolate milkshake and a soft caramel chew that melts in your mouth. It's also a tasty supplement to mix with oatmeal in the morning for breakfast on-the-go!<br /><br />- Very few supplements can attain the nutritional value and amount of protein intake that this protein powder is able to deliver in one serving, not to mention that the isolate aspect helps with absorption rate.<br /><br />- The incredibly low price and powerful nutrients that Incarnate Nutrition captures in one protein powder is a steal! I wouldn't be the least bit surprised for this price escalate as the supplement grows in popularity.<br /><br />Everything one could ask for in a protein is in this powerful supplement, with additional elements that knock other protein powders out of the water! With a quick dissolving formula, a superior protein formula, and top-notch collagen, this product is your new go-to for everything you need in 1 supplement. [SEP] My only gripe with this is that it really wasn't good when mixed with water. I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk and it became VERY good.<br /><br />The macros are really solid for a whey isolate powder.",3,True

This works gently but effectively on the dry skin on my heels. If held correctly, this file is relatively easy to hold  and easy to work with. Some files are like cheese graters and this one is gentler. When I am done, I just rinse the business end under warm water and the dead skin that was removed easily rinses off. The file looked brand new afterward.<br /><br />Due to the small size, this is a few dollars cheaper than other etched glass (a.k.a. nano crystal) files on the market, which is great. In addition, this is a gorgeous file in a pretty color. To me it's  functional art. [SEP] What a fabulous foot-care product this is! The metallic turquoise coating of this handheld file device is visually attractive, and the ergonomic design gives it a shape that’s extremely easy to grip and comfortably hold. The bottom surface features a whole sea of circular nano-blades that painlessly file away rough and dry skin in an instant, and then the powdered skin particles immediately rinse away with ease! The foot scrubber arrives with a drawstring plastic pouch that’s great for storage between uses, and I would highly recommend this affordable product to all my friends and family. I’m so impressed with this one!

Some collagens are getting too fancy now with added ingredients and unrealistic prices and smaller jars, but this is a good collagen at a fair price and  454g size. There’s no information on where it’s made, only distributed. And while most collagens mix pretty well even in cold drinks, I found this to be more clumpy than normal. There’s no taste and I stir it in my pre-made smoothies in the morning and it goes down fine. Nothing really to whooop about and nothing to be critical of, just a good average collagen. [SEP] First, let me say that I have no idea why the product listing is in Spanish, but the packaging is all in English.<br /> In any case, I'm a fan of collagen powder, and this a a good way to get some.  It's pretty much flavorless, dissolves easily, and is easy to work in to almost any food.

[SEP] 50 grams is not enough to do anything, really. My son ( 4th grade) saw a Youtube video of someone making a mold with a clay, and then pour the gallium into it.  With 50 grams, you can probably make something like a penny size.  To make the gallium into liquid form, you will need to heat it or mix it with a hot water.

I haven't noticed my hair growing faster, I was hoping for NEW hair growth and I'm honestly not sure if biotin helps with that. Maybe I need to take them for a longer period.

Not that I have a particular problem. The Cider Vinegar gets me through the day without noticing digestive nuance.<br /><br />They taste good at the end of my supplement taking session. I like them. Try them for a week, and you might notice a benefit. [SEP] I've reviewed a lot apple cider vinegar gummies and these are my least favorite of all of them.  The flavor is just o.k. and the texture is not very gummy-like.  I like that these have the mother, but that's about all they have going for them except for a little B9 and B12 vitamins. [SEP] These gummies have a surprisingly good taste, must better than others that I have tried. They not only have the apple cider vinegar but also B vitamins. You only need one a day so they go a long way. It is a huge plus that they are made in the USA. [SEP] These gummies were very disappointing to us. They appeared to be broken apart, the taste was inconsistent across the board, and I just simply don't trust them to be effective. Sadly we ended up discarding the bottle because of what we saw as potentially poor quality control. Perhaps they had melted in transit? I have no idea, but I can't recommend this. [SEP] These things are shaped like a bunch of grapes.  Not sure why as they say they are cranberry flavored?  I don't know.  The bottle smells pretty fruity - like general fruit - couldn't tell you what, though.  They do smell nice regardless.  NOT like vinegar - which is GREAT!<br /><br />They are a softer chew - not too terribly gummy - more like a gel fruit candy.  The taste is pretty nice.  Again - I couldn't tell you what fruit they taste like - but nice.  The flavor is light as well - not overly sweet and not overly tart.  I actually really like them.<br /><br />I despise the taste of ACV so these are great to get a daily dose of the ""gross stuff"". : )<br /><br />If you find this review helpful - why not click the ""Helpful"" button?  Thanks! : ) [SEP] When I first tried a gummy I said to myself -- ""Needs more YUM!"" because it was not as sweet as I thought it would be. But after a few days I found the taste to be tolerably enjoyable- certainly MUCH better than the organic apple cider vinegar I usually use-- and without that yukky ""mother"" floating around in the bottle. The beet root and cranberry also adds to AC vinergar's detoxing properties. I take it first thing in the morning so there's no taste clash or interaction with what I've just eaten.<br />Personally I dont think that just one gummy is as effectve as the liquid, but I'm not worried because I still add a litlle liquid AC Vinegar to my dailiy meals/drinks.<br />The bottle size and the gummy size make it perfect for me to take when I travel. Thr price is reasonable as the supply provided is generous [SEP] It’s very difficult to find a vegan gummy that tastes good. This ACV gummy tastes good and has a distinct Apple cider vinegar flavor. I take it once a day and it helps me with bloating. [SEP] I decided to check out a different brand after finishing the first bottle of ACV gummies I had ever tried, and I am regretting that. The flavor of these is not very sweet, and tastes like a mixture of chemicals and ACV to me. The texture is somewhat soft, like a gumdrop, which is not appealing to me either. The last bottle (Doctor's Recommended brand here on Amazon, same price) I tried were deliciously sweet, with the texture of gummy bears. I could have eaten that whole bottle in one sitting it was so good! These, I have only taken 3 in the month I've had them because they are not appealing at all. If you like the flavor and texture, they might work for you. It's certainly better than drinking ACV straight or going through the hassle of mixing it in water, etc. As for health effects, I've never felt any notable difference in weight, appetite, or energy levels whether drinking ACV straight or taking gummies, but it's supposed to be good for you so I take it anyway lol. [SEP] These gummies are very tasty and help me stay regular and on track with my fitness goals. They’re squishy and gummy, taste sweet like candy. Kind of like a treat for me! Very tasty. [SEP] We believe in the benefits of ACV, but the taste of it isn't that great for some. We've been taking some other gummies that definitely had a vinegary taste, but overall, most of my kids liked them. These looked worth a try (and with some extra nutrition to boot), but they have a truly odd taste that neither my kids nor myself really want to have again. It's weird, because that taste isn't the apple cider vinegar...in fact, these have almost no vinegary taste whatsoever. It's just a weird taste that's somehow odd and off-putting (might be the beets). I'm not sure what it is, but it's not a good taste, and I don't think we'll be finishing this bottle (I haven't seen facial reactions to a vitamin like this in a long time). Honestly, the gummies just don't look that good either, with lots of kind of hanging-off pieces where they weren't molded particularly well and an odd texture as well.

Soft & Luxurious Mask, Satin Exterior, Removable Ear Cups Reduce Noise by Approx 15-20db Nrr",[],[],,3.1,25,733,"This earmuffs/eye mask combination is pretty neat. It is one piece that combines an eye mask with earmuffs to give you better sleep. The straps are adjustable to make them tighter or looser obviously and fit better for your needs. I found I don't like it super tight since that makes it a bit uncomfortable on the eyes especially if you end up opening your eyes at one point while wearing the mask.<br /><br />The mask is soft so if you do open your eyes at some point your eye lashes will touch the mask, that is a tad annoying but not a deal breaker since you should be sleeping anyways. The earmuffs are pretty noise insulating but do not block out all noise. But I found they do a pretty good job. For those who like to sleep on the side these are soft and comfortable enough to do so, although for an entire night on the same side I don't think it is optimal. I move around from the sides to back a bit so this worked well for me.<br /><br />They are pretty well made in my eyes so they should last a good amount of time. I think the thing that will probably go first are the straps that hold everything together. These should be great especially on a flight if you are trying to get a little snooze. All in all not a bad purchase. [SEP] Or ear muffs. I find them both impossible to use at night, especially with my cpap. This is an item that I will be donating to charity. I am sure they will find someone who needs the warmth of the ear muffs and likes the sleep mask. Just not for me. [SEP] This is a great eye mask.<br />I thought that the ear muffs did a good job at cutting out the noise while I was sleeping. It wasn’t loud noise - just the sound of my humidifier in my bedroom.<br />My problem with these is that I’m a side sleeper. I felt like the donut smashed my ear.<br />I don’t have the largest ears.<br />I think with some adjusting these could be more comfortable.<br />The outside of the ear muffs are a very soft silicone which I like.<br />I like how these didn’t move around or fall off while I was sleeping.<br />I think I will keep these for my travel eye mask for when I’m on an airplane or train.<br />It will be nice to be able to not have to worry about messing with the small ear plugs in those places.<br />The eye mask does a good job at keeping it black and it’s very comfortable. [SEP] One night my smoke alarm decided to chirp around 4 a.m.  Too tired to get out the ladder and change the battery, I tried this mask and earmuff set.  I am already hard of hearing and did not have my hearing aids in.  With the earplugs in and the earmuffs on, I could still hear the chirps.  I also found the whole contraption very tight and uncomfortable even when I adjusted the straps to their longest.  I am a woman with an average size head.  I am glad this set helped so many people but wonder why it did not help me at all.  It is lovely silk, very soft ,and ought to be comfortable but for me it was not. [SEP] My bedroom is on a noisy street & it often wakes me up. My intent was to remove the eye cover & only use the ear covers. Unfortunately, only the opposite (remove Ear pieces, leave eye cover) is possible.<br /><br />Seems comfortable enough once I figured the strap out. It comes with NO instructions, & when I wrote the seller/manufacturer, they simply sent me a picture of the fastener, which I had already seen. I did finally figure out how to size it (to enlarge, move each fastener as close as possible to the ear piece).<br /><br />I unfortunately had another issue which though no fault of the manufacturer, stopped me from thoroughly trying the unit: the earpieces magnified the volume of my heartbeat to where is was very nerve wracking. This may not happen for you, as I have racing heartbeat issues caused by a medication at this time.<br /><br />It also comes with optional ear plugs. I really don't like earplugs, & I don't fall asleep easily. [SEP] Love this product! Total blackout of light and sound while still comfortable. A comfortable silk mask is detachable from the ear muffs and it comes with ear plugs for no sound! I sept through a TV blaring and train coming by next to the house on a curve so it blows the horn multiple times... didn’t hear it.  Surprisingly lightweight and the eye mask has extra cushion for the eyes to ensure complete darkness. The adjustable straps allow for custom fit. The bag is great for travel and I plan to use it camping so I don’t jump at every sound and can sleep in when the sun comes up. It did take me a bit to get use to them on when laying down simply because I’m not use to a mask or ear plug/muffs. Overall, comfortable for the bulk of the ear muffs and I do Love it!",3,True

I've got no complaints but neither am I raving positively. [SEP] From a quality perspective, I believe this is a good product. It contains good ingredients which helps support with brain functions. I prefer to use it in a shake instead of water due to the taste. People will react differently to this powder. I like it because it provides an extra layer of added nutrients that you wouldn't get on a daily basis. [SEP] I wanted to give this supplement a try, to see if I could improve my focus and attention, as well as cognitive abilities over the time frame that I was using it. I used Briani for the 30 day cycle, and after that time frame, I would say that I've noticed a decent improvement in my cognitive function. I think for myself personally, the issues that I always wanted to have sort of rectified, or at least a little bit of help with, are in my ability to maintain my focus and attention, as well as my memory. Oftentimes, I find that I'm forgetting things, and being that there is a history of dementia in my family, I sometimes fear that these may be signs at a younger age, that perhaps I may be in line for this terrible disease. Any type of improvement in my memory and cognitive function, is something that I'm very interested in, and will indulge in. The powder doesn't really dissolve the best if you just take it with a spoon, and mix it with water. I also wasn't a great fan of the taste. I began mixing it in with my smoothies that I have every day, and that was a big help. Primarily because the blender would make mincemeat of it, and mix it in without issue, and secondarily because I didn't really notice the taste afterwards. I didn't find that the powder taste affected my smoothie. I often sit and require attention with the work that I do, as well as good memory. Even though, I don't have baseline tests or anything to that effect that I can point to to give you qualified results, I can tell you anecdotally, that I certainly felt more focused, and better memory towards the end of my 30 days. I have to say, I was relatively surprised by that. It is an expensive product, but if it provides good results like the ones that I feel I achieved, it's well worth it. I know that my experience was positive, and so I can recommend it for a trial if you are someone who wants to improve their cognitive function as well.",3,True

I don't think I like it quite as much as a regular lash curler (which I warm up with my blowdryer) but it does a good job. [SEP] I’ve used heated eyelash curlers over the years but they have always been battery powered. This is my first rechargeable one and it is much better not having to worry about batteries. It also has 4 different heat levels which most heated curlers do not have. I also like the LCD screen that shows you the heat level and battery life. There is only one button so it is very simple to use. It heats up pretty quickly but I usually turn it on when I get started with my makeup so that by the time I’m doing my lashes it is nice and warm. It is so lightweight and compact (shaped like a tube of mascara). It has made my lashes really pop! It says to use it after mascara but I’ve found that kind of melts the mascara and makes a little mess so I usually do it before applying anything. This heated eyelash curler really works, it’s great! [SEP] So I've actually had some issues getting this thing to work, and the cap gets stuck frequently. I was a little nervous at first with out hot it was going to get, but it didn't get to the  point where I felt like I was going to burn my face off.<br /><br />As far as an eyelash curler goes, this works ok once you get the hang of it. Its very similar to the results I get with a manual eyelash curler. To me, it just kind of seems like one of those gimmicky beauty tools that looks cool on paper, but really doesn't do anything above and beyond what I'm already able to do with my current beauty tools. [SEP] I love this curler! Fast to charge and curls my eyelashes with two or three strokes. [SEP] I have pretty long lashes so figured this would be worth a shot but honestly it doesn't seem to make an different from a regular curler and good mascara. It seems to be of decent quality, the controls are easy to use and the display easy to read, but it does lose its charge fast - you literally have to charge it after every use - which for the length of time it is used seems a bit inconvenient.  Fun as a gadget but not one that will be added to my regular set, [SEP] I was a little skeptical about this, but it actually works! This is a heated wand and is rechargeable. It has temperature settings from 60-90 degrees. The instructions were easy to understand. This is my new favorite beauty gadget! [SEP] I have very few and short eye lashes and had heard that these heated curlers were great. However, on the minimum heat setting, it fried several of the few lashes that I have right off.<br />Very unhappy with this item.<br /><br />There were no instructions for use; only for how to turn it on and heat it up. [SEP] I got this because I have long lashes but they're very straight. I think if the design was a little different that this could possibly work better as it doesn't seem to thread through your lashes like a mascara wand does. It does curl your lashes but not as much as I had hoped it would. I have only tried it while my lashes are dry but maybe if they were a little damp it would work better. It gets decently warm but not too much to burn you, you still have to be careful as to how close you get to your eye so you don't jab yourself. Maybe it'll work for people who's lashes aren't crazy straight like mine are, however it didn't seem to work that well for me. [SEP] It worked well. It melts the mascara  so that you can comb through it easily to unclump. You have to leave it on longer to curl lashes though. [SEP] I've used heated lash curlers in the past and I like this one a lot. The guard protects your lashes, its rechargeable, only takes 60 sec to heat up fully, and you can pick between 60-90F for temp. The only thing I don't like is that it does take awhile to actually curl your lashes but it is a lot healthier then using a lash ""crimper"".",3,True

I have been using their diapers for over 4 years now with two different kids.  4 years ago, they did not have the bamboo option.  It was just the Stay Dry and Hemp inserts/doublers/night time boosters.  While I liked the absorbency, thinness, and natural fibers of the Hemp, it took FOREVER to dry.  I opted for the Stay Dry because my daughter was sensitive to wet and they dried really fast, even though I don't care too much for microfiber.  However, by the time my second CD baby came along, they had the Bamboo.  But it took me a while to buy them, since I already had a stash.  Baby 2 doesn't have a sensitivity to wetness, so she doesn't need the stay dry like her sister did.  So when I saw these on sale, I thought, &#34;why not try them?&#34;  I'm really glad I did.  These Bamboo Inserts are so soft!  They absorb a tun.  They are super thin.  They dry in a normal amount of diaper drying time.  And on top of all of that, they are natural materials.  What's not to like?<br /><br />As a side, these diapers inserts look a little odd when you first see them.  The texture reminds me of the terry found on baby wash cloths.

These pads help with the 6 1/2 for the ones that are a little loose. Adds a bit more comfort for long wear. [SEP] Sometimes you get a pair of shoes that just is not comfortable.  The base of the shoe where the ball of the foot is, can be too thin and it can be hard on the feet.  These pads do seem to help, but let's take a closer look.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE PADS LIKE?<br />These pads are for the ball of the foot.  They have a place for the area under the toes so you know where to put them.  The backing is a type which will hold into place pretty well.  It can be washed and reused.  The cushion has some flock on it which keeps it soft instead of overly rubbery.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE PERFORM?<br />So far, I have a pair on one of my shoes.  The pad did make the shoe slightly tighter, but that pair had the room.  If the shoes are really fitted, they could make it too tight.  The pad did not seem to slide around that much and so far they have been good. If I am not careful, however, they will slide.<br /><br />FUTURE UPDATES?<br />I will continue to test them in other shoes, however and update my review if I have anything to add.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For reusable pads for the ball of the foot in some shoes that just are too hard, these are nice.  They will make the shoes tighter, so you need to have room for them.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />So far four stars. They stay pretty well in place, but can shift a bit if you are not careful. [SEP] I have wished I had these so many times in the past. Depending on how high the heels are, the more the ball of your foot hurts. You can't wait to get those babies off your feet. These will help your feet feel so much better. Rather than wearing sensible low heeled shoes, I will now be able to wear my pretty higher heels. They make my feet feel better about being on high heels. And my feet aren't aching like they usually would. [SEP] Not a big fan of these. The cushion isn't that thick and worse, it flattens out over time. The adhesive stuck well but I just don't like the texture of this material. Disappointed. [SEP] It has been a long time since I've worn heels on a regular basis.  I have recently been making more of an effort and have a new pair that are reasonably comfortable but take some getting used to.  I put in these soft pad inserts and it makes a huge difference.  It's important to have some space as the pads do take a little space but it is worth it.  They cover a good portion of the foot pad and move, adjust to your feet as you stand and walk. This really does make it easier to wear the heels for hours. I plan to get a set for my mother. [SEP] I have some issues with the balls of my feet; well one foot anyway.  While I don't wear a lot of high heeled shoes I do have a couple pairs of boots with pretty high heels, and these pads really help them to be more comfortable.  I like that they stick very well so not as apt to slide around as other inserts I've tried.  And I like that these are washable.  Quite a practical and good product for those of us with certain foot issues, and probably even for those without but who wear high heels and actually have to walk and stand in them. [SEP] My wife has to wear high heels a lot of the time, but living where we do also requires her to walk to and from buildings and parking lots, sometimes several blocks. And that has killed her feet. Well, these inserts are life-savers. They are easy to drop in her shoes, provides padding for her feet, and makes walking finally pleasurable. She can't say enough good things about them. [SEP] These are a perfect, simple solution to two common shoe problems.  Problem One:  A shoe that fits a tiny bit too loose but not enough for a full length insert.  These will snug up he fit just enough to prevent slipping and work in both shoes or sandals.  Problem Two:  Shoes look great but have flimsy bottoms.  I have a closet full of ""fashion"" boots & shoes that have thin soles & insoles which make them miserable to stand or walk in.  Placing these little pads under the ball of my foot gives just enough padding to make all the difference.<br /><br />It takes a little trial and effort to get these positioned just right but once placed they stay put with no problem.  They can easily be re-positioned or removed (without leaving behind a residue) and can also be washed and then used in a different shoe.  Where have these been all my life? [SEP] These pads really helped with a pair of boots I have that were on the uncomfortable side. The adhesive worked well, but getting them in the right spot took a bit of work. The pads are a little thick, so make sure you have some extra room in the toe box area of your shoes, or you'll be risking a blister on the top of your toe. I did not have trouble with them bunching up with use.  Overall, I was pleased and would recommend them. [SEP] Comfy and sturdy!",3,True

"Drain Cleaner Sticks, Drains Sinks Pipes Septic Tank Safe Drain Sticks- Prevents Clogged Drain, Non-Toxic Sink Cleaning Deodorant for The Kitchen and Bathroom (4)",[],[],,3.0,24,24304,"definitely helps keep my spare bathroom sink from smelling like mildew. Helps keep the kitchen smelling  fresh as well. [SEP] First, I don't understand how these slender, breakable sticks can last long enough to alleviate the odors of bathroom sink and shower drains, but I've resigned myself to not understanding how most things work.<br /><br />My goal is to figure out what's causing the odor and work to remediate it. Um, no, we made no progress with that. We use snakes to clear out hair and soap scum, but we have an odd odor of sulphur in one bathroom sink. That seems to have lessened, now that The Man of the House inserted one of these sticks.<br /><br />The four fragrances seem to vanish once the sticks are in the sink/drain. So they're not ""masking"" other odors, right? They're actually **working** in other ways: ""with just one stick per month"" keep your drains clear and odor-free - the stick ""stays in the pipe trap to prevent grease or other organic materials from building up"" and should ""prevent clogged sinks."" It's going on a month now, and the slow-draining sinks do seem to run faster now.<br /><br />I can't say that I ""enjoy the smell of fresh bio clean natural fragrance"" because I don't smell it at all, and I'm usually the first to detect any new odors in our environment.<br /><br />""Save time on plumbers and drain snakes as powerful enzymes break down oil and grease to keep drains free and clear."" So far, so good. Now to remember to replace these in all the sinks every month. :) [SEP] Super easy and so far my drain seems to be staying clear [SEP] These are a great Idea and I was eager to use them. Getting them out of their packaging was a little tricking in that they are very delicate and easy to break. This should have no effect on the their function. Once in the drain, it was hard to tell what they are to do. I suppose they start our having a great scent but over the course of a month I honestly couldn't tell. Not sure what I would do differently but I would like to be able to smell a fresh scent throughout the month, but that didn't happen. [SEP] This 4 pack drain cleaner comes in different scents, such as lavender, lemon, orange and ocean. Some sticks were broken in the packaging. I put one stick in each bathroom sink and bathtub in my house two weeks ago. I ordered this because I wanted my sink to release a fresh and fruity smell while I use it, but there is no fragnance coming out of these sticks at all. Now I am worried the sticks won't dissolve and clog the drain. I won't order this again. [SEP] These little sticks slide into the drain. I don't know if they work or not, but they cause no harm. The scent is negligible; nothing to notice after taking it out of the bag.  Maybe after I use the whole package I'll notice the difference when I no longer use them.  No complaints. [SEP] I have the ""As Seen on TV"" lemon version of these sticks, which I have used for years. I never even thought about looking for generics, but these seem to be pretty good. I will say, they are gooey and thicker compared to the ""As Seen on TV"" version. Because they are thicker, they didn't fall neatly into my bathroom drain, but did fall in with some encouragement. Also, they are not as perfumed, while still reducing odor. I actually think I prefer that about this product.<br /><br />I put one of these in my smelly bathroom sink drain. It did get rid of the odor after a few days and I forgot about it. These are good only if a person has the kind of sink drains where the sticks will fit through without having to take the entire contraption apart.<br /><br />Then the stand-up shower drain got a little smelly and I put a stick down the drain to take care of the smell. I doubt these could prevent a clog, but if you put one in after cleaning the drain it could help keep the drain clean. If they continue I will most definitely buy them again. I gave a box to a family member and she likes them too.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] I won't know for some time how well these work, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they help reduce clogs.  I have 2 drains that regularly seem to build up scum - the bathroom, where shaving foam, shaved hairs, creams and lotions seem to collect, and the kitchen sink due to grease, etc.<br />These are very easy to use, you just drop a full stick down your drain where it will sink into the trap and sit there slowly dissolving.  You place only 1 stick per drain each month.<br />The sticks are lightly scented, but it's very subtle.  I didn't notice any scent in the drain once I dropped down into the trap.  But the important thing is whether or not it helps reduce the smell coming from your pipes.  That's not usually a problem in my house, so I'll never really know how well that feature works.<br />Some of the sticks may arrive broken in the packaging, but it really doesn't matter other than perhaps the smaller pieces might not stay in the trap and may instead get washed down the pipes.<br />I'm pretty happy with these so far.  They're simple, they're subtle and they're inexpensive.  If my sinks continue to clog as easily as they used to, I'll come back and update my review.  If they never clog again, I'll definitely come back and raise the rating when I order some more! [SEP] Like [SEP] This is a package of scented drain-conditioning sticks that promise to provide enzymes and bacteria that will help to keep drains unclogged. The sticks are provided in several okay basic household-cleaner scents. I added an orange stick to several household drains and observed no immediate change, which is of course to be expected. If they do something, it's fairly subtle, but it probably can't hurt.",3,True

[SEP] Do not really get out had to buy another help with my neck [SEP] This hurt my neck so bad, I couldn't use it.  It was too big and too stiff.  I could not get it to fit without hurting my neck. [SEP] When I woke up on a Sunday morning with the pain of a pinched nerve in my neck along with the limited range of movement that accompanies it I knew a neck brace would be more useful than pills from my doctor. Amazon is my go to for unusual situations & this neck brace stood out from the crowd with all the benefits it provided, most especially two ways  to apply heat. Heat doesn't usually come with a normal neck brace but it is a wonderful option to have when pain keeps me from even getting out of bed &  the price was barely higher than the more traditional neck braces! Kudos to the providers of this product - who, by the way, followed up my purchase with an email thanking me for choosing their product & including pertinent safety & usage information. Thank you for a product that helped me through a difficult situation at a price that  didn't hurt! [SEP] I've had more neck surgeries than any five people usually have. I suffered for so many years ending up with numerous surgeries to fix me up. So I don't think there's a neck brace out there I haven't tried. This one is ingenious! It's made with a heating element that you can even us in your car, an added backing to be able to apply an ice pad for those times with cold is a must for pain, and even another one using magnetic to help circulation if you so choose. These are all built into one super comfy but very stabilized brace that fits it all. I've got 6 different types, 5 of which I dont really have any use for now. Even my neurosurgeon was impressed after taking a closer look at the stability of it. He then let me switch to using it until I no longer needed one after my double surgery. And now it's perfect for fatigue. Long drives its a must! You won't believe the relief you get without țhe uncomfort that others present. Oh and it doesn't dig in to your colarbones either. Finally someone gets it. Whoever designed this must have suffered neck injuries of some sort. I just really want to shout out a huge Thankyou for making the pain so much easier to bear! Anyone out there looking for a really great brace this is what your looking for! Don't waste your money looking any further for the price its the real deal. Ahhhhhh [SEP] The warming pad is great, if you have a charging device to keep it plugged in. So not very mobile. The neck collar was so big I felt like my neck is being stretched. I use the heat pad without the collar and works great. It is a great concept but needs work.  I will still use the heat pad for my neck but secure it without the collar. [SEP] I am an average size female. This brace is way too thick too thick and tall to breath comfortable. The heating pad doesnt allow room to ""mold"" brace to your comfort.<br />The fabric is rough on my skin. After a total of 6 hours wearing this product, my face had dozens of sweat bumps.<br />Unfortunately,  I purchased product before my doctors approval. So, I lost out by one day  for returning this.

However they are not soft at all and while they are three ply those plies don't really stick together. The also have a faint odor. I will use them but they are not the quality they should be for the price.<br /><br />5 stars for the packaging, but a generous 3 stars for the actual blowing your nose experience. [SEP] The tissues themselves are fine. They clean and wipe snot as well as dirt and food of the face or counter, are soft and do not irritate. The packaging while compact is a bit off putting since the tissues are so jam-packed together, it's hard to pull them out in the beginning without pulling a whole wad of them as well tearing several of them. But the tissues themselves serve well as any regular tissues. [SEP] Container : stiff, pretty, fits in car cup holder, no lid so after use you just have a tall cylinder with a hole on top.<br /><br />Tissue :rougher than kleenex, softer than hospital/hotel tissue. Works for wiping nose, but rough cold or touch up on makeup.... No. Also smaller than kleenex (comparison in picture). So softer prettier hospital tissue. Also because it's rough and stuffed so tight it's really difficult to pull only one out. I ended up pulling out a lot and tear all of them. Very frustrating.<br /><br />Overpriced. For the quality these shouldn't be more than ten in my opinion.... [SEP] While these aren't the softest tissues, the round packaging is amazing. They fit in car cupholders perfectly. The tissues come out of the canisters smoothly. Very useful. [SEP] But for what they are, these have packaging that is quite different than what I'm used to.  I mean, most tissues are short, squat rectangular boxes or more square, upright boxes.  Of course there are the little disposable ones that women like me carry in their purses, but I've not had any that are in a tube before.  I love that I can store one in the car by using a drink holder - so much easier than rooting in my purse for a tissue when I feel a sneeze coming on!  The packaging itself is pretty, me being a girly-girl kind of person, I do appreciate the colors and plants on it.  The tissues themselves are sturdy and soft enough that I feel confident that even when reaching for one to contain one of my ""big"" sneezes (that I do have more often than I would like), I don't worry that the tissue might suffer a ""crack"" in keeping my explosive sneeze contained.  The only thing I noted here is that the cost is a bit high, but for a tube of tissues that fits well in the car, it is worth the price, at least to me. [SEP] These tissues come in the cutest containers.  The containers are slim with a pretty floral and bunny print.  The container is very similar in design to Clorox wipes - you pull one tissue at a time out.  The tissues are not the softest but the containers make up for it. [SEP] I have nasal issues, and like my mother, boxes of tissue in every room and car.  I don’t have cup holders in my car, but these would work perfectly there.  They are not super soft and thick but not thin and rough either, so they’re fine.  My only recommendation is to look at the diagram on Amazon on how to open it up, I didn’t and ripped off the top, I taped it back together tougher and the canister works great, one coming out after one is pulled up and out very easily. [SEP] Best for value for money !! This is my to go for make up removal during my shoots !! It is quick in absorbing the make up and removal process s also easy !! [SEP] Great pack of tissues that are convenient for travel. The cylinder box that this is in is sturdy and strong. My old boxes of tissues usually get crushed from groceries or accidently getting stepped on. These hold their shape and fit conveniently in my cup holder. The design of the box is beautiful and adds to the decor of the room.<br /><br />The tissue itself is 3 layers and is strong and durable.

I was unable to continue to take because of this reason. [SEP] These are delicious gummies, and they deliver a reasonable dose of ashwagandha. Supposedly this supplement helps to reduce anxiety and stabilize mood. I originally got these for my wife who struggles with anxiety more than I do, but she is also a calorie counter so she decided not to eat these, instead taking ashwagandha in pill form. So, I've been taking them. I don't really suffer from anxiety or unstable mood, but I enjoy the flavor of these and I guess they have helped me somewhat during stressful times.

Too often they smell like bathroom disinfectant. So now, orange is usually my citrus of choice when it comes to essential oils.<br />Move over orange, this grapefruit is sparkling and spectacular.<br />You would swear that you are peeling a delicious grapefruit when you are defusing this organic oil.<br />Clean citrus fragrance that is 100% true to the fruit peel.<br />Cold pressed, you won't find even a hint of a solvent aroma with this high quality oil.<br />Highly recommended. [SEP] This Dr. Mercola Organic White Grapefruit Essential Oil has a nice fresh aroma. It will be great for making blends to go in my diffusers. I have a pink grapefruit essential oil already and was hoping this one would be a little different, but they smell pretty much the same. Though it smells good on its own, there are many blends using grapefruit that smell so good, and I look forward to trying lots of them.<br />It does seem to have a lighter scent than I'm used to, so I would not trust using it in any skin or lip recipes. For diffusing and candle making, I would definitely recommend it. [SEP] This smells lovely and I am not even a fan of “grapefruit”. The fruit itself I pretty much despise. This oil, though, just smells lovely and fresh.  It is not as pungent as an actual grapefruit at all – thank goodness.  It just smells very fresh and lovely.  Very fragrant and citrusy.  Maybe a sweet grapefruit – but even better.  I LOVE that it is Organic and I am already a big fan of Doctor Mercola products – as many – if not all – are Organic and Vegan as well. And that is what I buy.  This is just fresh and good. Pro tip – mix with some cedar, black pepper, and orange oils – and the scent is soooooo lovely.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks! Enjoy your day! : ) [SEP] This oil seems to be good quality.  The smell is so clean and fresh!  Nice large bottle for the price [SEP] We diffuse grapefruit all the time, this white grapefruit smells just a great as the regule color one. I would recommend it. [SEP] This is the first time I had heard of white grapefruit essential oil. A recipe called for it. I will keep it in stock from now on. [SEP] love this [SEP] I am in love with the scent of this essential oil. It smells like a freshly peeled white grapefruit and it seems to be pure therapeutic grade with nothing added.<br />I am diffusing it in a waterless diffuser and my main floor living space smells wonderfully.<br />This would be perfect for home making cleaning products as the scent is so fresh and clean.

"Cranberry Gummies | 25,000mg | 110 Count | Vegan, Non-GMO, and Gluten Free Supplement | High Potency Extract Formula | by Horbaach",[],[],,3.4,109,19590,"And aesthetically pleasing with the molded-in bumps. The chewiness factor is right up there with the best -- the flavor is great. 25 grams of cranberry is packed into each gummy, the flavor, Cherry Mango is good -- I just wonder why not Cherry Cranberry or just plain Cranberry flavor. These gummies are sweet and tasty.<br />Taking three a day is reasonable, and pleasant. The ingredients all appear to be natural -- the sweeteners, Stevia and Erythritol appear to be safe.<br />There was a generous amount of these gummies in the large bottle, and so they lasted for quite some time. I enjoyed taking them and had no ill-effects [SEP] If possible, I would take all my supplements in gummie  form, they are easier than swallowing pills and up till now, I enjoyed the flavors. When I saw cranberry gummies listed, I was excited as I have been taking cranberry tabs for a long time. The taste of these gummies was very unpleasant, almost a chemical taste. The gummies are tender and three gummies would be the daily dose.<br />  The ingredients are listed, but no country of manufacture is given, but the distributor did list an 800 number. The issue really is the unpleasant taste of this product. [SEP] These are so flavorful and intense, you really only need just a couple to be satisfied. Usually I eat sweet stuff by the handful. I don't need to do that with these. They are tasty, I recommend them. They smell great also. I highly recommend. [SEP] Like these chewy’s.  Seem to be ok [SEP] Take them for urinary health. My York pooh too [SEP] You take three gummy’s a day and this helps to support your urinary tract to keep yourself healthy. It can also help to prevent any type of UTI. [SEP] These cherry-mango flavored cranberry gummies have a lot going on. To me, it’s too many strong flavors in one; a bit overwhelming. I take cranberry to help keep my urinary tract healthy, to prevent UTI’s, and I have found gummies to be my favorite way of taking them. I think I would prefer just a cherry flavor personally, as I’m not much of a mango fan. The gummies did have a pleasant texture, and 110 in a bottle isn’t bad, but you need to take 3 gummies for one serving. Normally, I see 2 being the serving size, so I wonder if they are less potent since you need to take more. [SEP] I thought these would taste if not yummy at least good but sadly that wasn’t the case. The moment I opened the jar it smelled kind of odd and when I start chewing the gummies the flavor was even odder! Because of this I don’t think I will continue to eat them because I don’t enjoy them. I also noticed the pictures in the description shows the gummies being deep red in color but the ones I got are very dark purple 🤷🏻‍♂️ This order was just kind of disappointing to me… [SEP] it's a rubbery candy, and quite easy to take.  Personally, I'd just eat regular cranberries, but if you can't stand them, you can take this.  They have a mild black berry taste rather than cranberry. [SEP] It's a good tasting cranberry chewy.",3,True
"9-in-1 Head Shavers for Bald Men w/ 7 Floating Heads, LED Display, USB Rechargeable, Mens Grooming Kit w/ Rotary Shaver, Nose Trimmer, Hair Clipper, Brush. Cordless Electric Razor Wet and Dry, Gold",[],[],,3.6,215,6,"To be honest, my husband did not use this for a balding head. He wanted to try it for his face and for nose/ear hairs. This is his review. This was a nice man's shaver. It has several attachments which are easy to change out and install. The shave I got was super close and it was easy to maneuver it over the contours of my face. I have to admit it is one of the best shaves I have had in the past few years and for the money it is a good deal. The nose trimmer worked well with no pain or irritation. Highly recommend. [SEP] Excellent. These are lasting well over a year. The battery life is phenomenal. 7-heads is the best configuration for in-shower, bald face/pate shaving.<br /><br />7-heads are excellent. Every bit the equal of my >5x more expensive foil shaver.<br /><br />As a note, I used a shaving cream/conditioner provided by the hotel on the road some months ago and not this shaver. The hotel cream was too thick and stalled the razor. It was a bear to cleanout. It was the first time I ever had to pop the individual shaving heads ... I'd suggest you avoid this if you have big hands. Since then, I've stuck to my tried and true shaving cream that enables a close shave and easy flush cream. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:c5fa56c0667caf7dbb9094518c85e386]] I like this all in 1 shaver. I know it says for bald men but it works great on my legs, especially my knees because of the way the heads move all around and get close to the skin. It is also a trimmer, a hair clipper, a face massager, a nose and ear hair trimmer. It has a nice LED screen. It is recgargeable. It is well made and works great. [SEP] The appearance of this shaver is almost elegant.  My husband does not have a bald head so testing was only done on daily beard growth. All 7 blades revolving at once would lead one to hope shaving is quick. But the blades did not give him a close shave and took at least 8 minutes or more to finish.  He had to move the shaver slowly back and forward too many times.  He has another shaver but he was hoping that this 9-in-1 would be his favorite. The nose trimmer attachment and the beard trimmers work okay.  The battery life of this shaver having 90 minutes of shaver time is better than any other shaver he has used, but his Norelco shaver gives a super close shave in about 5 minutes.  I am giving this item 3 stars but not recommending it, although it may do a better job on shaving a bald head. [SEP] Great comfort [SEP] This electric shaver is perfect at maintaining my bald head style! It has seven gold floating heads that are diligent at cutting my hair and stubble lowly. It also comes with multiple efficient accessories that give me the power to stay neatly groomed! [SEP] I like that this is charged via USB, which is a huge winner as it makes it portable and easy to handle and manoeuvre in the hand. I rate it highly because I use the brush head at times on my face, which is not the purpose of this. But as a shaver, my husband does not rate it highly. He says it does not give a clean close shave unless he has a good few days of hair growth on his head. He says if he just wants to get rid of stubble is just not that effective. It is a good shaver but not for his hair and how he wants his head stubble free every day. [SEP] Works Great. Dry or wet. Stays charged well. Batteries last plenty long enough for 3-4 shaves. LOVE IT! [SEP] Love it for shaving my head and trimming  my beard and like the brush works good to easy charge fast [SEP] Have to go over area several times. Takes a long time to get my head bald.

"OMG! Superfoods Beauty Blend Powder - Beet, Maca, Chaga Mushorrom, Goji Berry, Maqui Berry, Acai - Source of Fiber & Iron - 6 Ounces (1 Package)",[],[],,4.3,51,1582,"Right off the bat, when tasting this, I was rejoicing that it wasn't too sweet. Many products of this nature have stevia or monk fruit, which not only have an aftertaste, but they use so much that the sweetness is cloying.<br />Not only is this product not super sweet, but it has just a little sweetness that occurs naturally from the organic berry powders.<br />And speaking of berries, what a powerhouse! In addition to beets and chaga mushrooms, you have the superfruit goji, maqui, and acai.<br />Since berries are on the hot list of being highly contaminated with pesticides, this is a product you can feel great about because all but the collagen peptides are organic.<br /><br />I love that I can just sprinkle it into my yogurt or oatmeal, as well as mixing it with a liquid. It tastes slightly sweet, slightly earthy. It gives a nice flavor to unsweetened yogurt especially if it's sprinkled with nuts. Perfect healthy breakfast.<br />And only 25 calories for a tablespoon!<br />The formulation is geared for beauty, and by now we all know the benefit of collagen when it comes to skin. But this is so much more than just skin loving, I feel that it's an all-around health tonic.<br />Definitely will be getting more when this canister is done.<br /><br />Update: So, I think I have found a breakfast nirvana. English muffin with cherry preserves, and  this powder sprinkled on top. So darn good I go to sleep happy, knowing I'm going to have this fantastic breakfast in the morning!<br />As another update, since taking this regularly, I feel that I have more energy and my mood is elevated. Now granted that could be a coincidence, but I can tell you I'm going to keep taking it. [SEP] I truly like the assortment of healthy ingredients in this Beauty Blend Powder. It contains: Beet, Maca, Chaga Mushroom, Goji Berry, Maqui Berry, Acai & Collagen Peptides.  As a disclaimer, part of my daily regimen includes beet powder, maca root powder, various mushroom powders and protein/collagen powder. So, having these, with the antioxidant/flavonoids from the berries is welcome.<br />They don't list the quantities of each ingredient, but a 6.6g serving yields 3g protein. So, I am guessing that the collagen peptides fills most of that protein. That brings up an issue. I think users want more details about the quantities of the ingredients.<br />I do appreciate that the Nutritional Facts lists certain facts/numbers. 0 sugars, 0 cholesterol and virtually 0 fat are important aspects, in my opinion.<br />The flavors of the berries basically masks the flavors of the other ingredients. Adding it to a smoothie or almond milk gives it a purplish hue. it's a tasty addition.<br />There are no badges/certifications relating to FDA or GMP, which is somewhat disappointing. However, i did enjoy and appreciate the ingredients in this superfood blend. Accordingly, it earns a solid 4 star rating, with a moderately high level recommendation. [SEP] Taste is mostly beet and maca, with a faint hint of mushroom - not my favorite. However, I blend it in with home-brewed kombucha and fruit, so the taste is fine in that combination.<br /><br />The price is good for these superfoods. I really like the little cardboard jar. I might use it for pencils and pens, once this is done.<br /><br />I skeptical about beauty claims but the mix is sure to increase your levels of iron and iodine to promote healthy cells and to help keep your metabolism on track. Potassium will help digestion and make muscles happy. Maca is also rich in calcium, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. Beets help with blood pressure. All ingredients are antioxidants. [SEP] While it would be difficult to gauge if this product actually makes you more beautiful :)  what you DO get with it is a very tasty, superfood-rich additive to smoothies or other foods!  I am no stranger to putting 'extras' like maca, turmeric, or collagen in my smoothies anyway, and have tried other products from this brand, so this is a nice bonus to have many food-based supplements in one place.<br /><br />In the picture, I made a smoothie with pineapple and coconut milk and vanilla protein powder.  The Beauty Blend turned it a lovely shade of pink!  As for the taste, I was pleasantly surprised that it only enhanced the taste - there were no weird or strong flavors (I was wary that the Beet would make it taste odd, but it didn't!)  I will say you CAN taste the presence of it - I taste the Maca powder as the primary thing as that has a kind of malty, earthy flavor, but to me the flavor is quite pleasant.  I like it and have no negatives to say about it!<br /><br />** I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review, all opinions are my own ** [SEP] I'm a big fan of powdered juices, as I don't have a lot of time to make my own. At first glance, this OMG! Superfoods Beauty Blend Powder appears to be a good product. The ingredients are organic and include: beet, maca, chaga mushroom, goji berry, maqui berry, acai and collagen peptides. It tastes pretty good and mixes well in water.<br /><br />My problem with it is the maca power. It doesn't say whether it's gelatinized or raw, and the difference between the two is a pretty big one. Raw maca can cause horrible stomach cramps for a lot of people. In its place of origin, Peru, it is eaten cooked - always. So, not having this information on the packaging is troubling. By smelling, I can tell there is plenty of maca in this. It has a lovely, distinct smell.<br /><br />So... I have emailed the company to ask about this, but they should definitely have this information on the packaging.<br /><br />Also, while I appreciate the packaging choice (it looks highly recyclable), I don't like how the lid won't stay on securely.",3,True

It helps you fight off everything from colds and flu to cancer. These gummies taste great. They have a blend of elderberry, propolis and echinacea. They're all known to boost immune function. The gummies are very easy to take and are soft and chewy. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] I'm stocking up on all immune boosters from here on out! Elderberry gummies are at the top of my list and these gummies have echinacea as well to boost immunity. Love the gummies since they taste good and are super easy to chew for the kids as well. I am convinced after using them through cold and flu season that they really do help. [SEP] These gummies are very sweet. The little kids would love them.<br />My not so little anymore kids enjoy them too, but less sugar is better for the immune support.<br />The taste is pleasant.<br />I would be very careful with the propolis part, as though it is considered very good for immune system, it is best, when it is a local product. Some people, who prone to allergies (especially seasonal) should consider a product without propolis and, if still really want to add this bee-product to their supplement pantry, find a local apiary and buy it from there. The bottom line - try these guumies in  a smaller, than recommended amount when you are healthy, to see if you'd have any allergic reaction, and only after that take it, to help your body to fight sickness. [SEP] I like the taste of these gummies, but they have 40 grams of sugar per serving. That's a ton! I wish I could use these, but these are far, far too sugary. [SEP] Good ingredients.  Good flavor. OK price. [SEP] I personally like the composition of these a lot. Great mix of immunity boosters in reasonable amounts<br /><br />Problem is taste however. I buy these for my teens to help their immune systems and they said this particular product is the less tasty of the 3-4 we tried. It’s a personal preference but that would turn us off from ordering again if alternatives are available [SEP] I really like these gummies. Taste just like raspberry. [SEP] These are exactly what I was looking for when the ones I normally purchased at the store were no longer available. The Etana elderberry gummies have a great flavor and texture, and just the right combo of ingredients to support my immune system. Best part is that they frequently offer an extra $ amount off, so I save on a good quality product. [SEP] Great taste so the whole family doesn't mind taking them. This product is great for boosting the immune system. They can be taken every day for continuous immune support. I've given my two kids elderberry products for the last 3 years. I think it works very well for kids' immune systems. Propolis & Echinacea are a nice addition to the other Elderberry gummies on the market. It’s like a gummy, but slightly more chewy (has a texture of a gummy when it dries out a little bit). But it’s sweet and pleasant to eat. I thought my kids wouldn’t like them, and they actually do. We are enjoying them and will definitely purchase it again.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] These are tasty supplements. I try to include elderberry for the immune boosting properties in my diet and this is an easy way to do it. They taste like raspberry! Easy to chew, good texture. I'd get these again!",3,True
Essential Oils Set – Organic and Pure Oils 20 Pack (10ml),[],[],,4.3,93,2152,"I use 6 diffusers, throughout, our home, daily, and I spend a small fortune on Essential Oils. I have used the same company for years and I never thought I could be swayed to like oils from any other company until I tried the oils in Salty Essential Oils. I tried the Lemon in my hall bathroom because it was a smaller space and I wanted to see if I could smell the oil  It was fantastic!! I tried this same experiment with the Frankincense and Bergamot. Fabulous!! The scents last after the diffuser has run out. As I write this, I have been enjoying Orange in my living room. I love that each oil has an explanation of what it can be used for...example, sleep, headache, etc. What an unexpected pleasure this product has brought to me. I am so glad I ordered it!! [SEP] This is an impressive collection of quality and fragrant essential oils. What is also noteworthy is these therapeutic grade essential oils are: ""PURE AND ORGANIC – our set of essential oils is carefully handpicked, ensuring there are no additives or artificial components. We understand the essence of natural essential oils, and that is why all the 20 bottles only have organic products that are non-toxic and safe for human use.""  So, besides the wonderful scents, they are human friendly. This is good scents and good sense.<br />The significant other opened each of the bottles and said she loved the aroma of each. She decided to use the Chamomile oil in the diffuser, for the living room. A few drop was more than adequate for the job. So, these 10ml (0.3floz) bottles should last a long time.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the essential oil product set. I included close ups, in groups of 5, for a closer look at the assortment.<br />The set has an attractive presentation, and would be a wonderful gift.  In my case, the significant other said she decided we're keeping it. haha. So, obviously it a winner in our home.<br />Based on these initial impressions, it earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] These are some high-quality essential oils that ROBLINK has hand-picked and produced in this wonderfully packaged set! As an avid yogi and diffuser enthusiast, I could tell right off the bat by the scent of this product that they were carefully crafted and devoid of useless additives, which a lot of companies put into their oils to ""enhance"" the product. Still on the fence about buying these? Read on for some important highlights on this set that may help you out with your decision:<br /><br />- These oils are truly versatile and work for a myriad of uses: a dash or two into a massage oil relaxes the muscles, a couple of drops into a diffuser fills any room with good vibes, a drop on your thumbs placed on your temples does wonders for migraines, or even adding to a hot bubble bath creates the ultimate experience!<br /><br />- With 20 essential oils in this set, the sky is the limit for any scent you want to permeate your senses or create your own custom scent by combining oils to suit your specific needs.<br /><br />- Numerous research studies show that certain essential oils are capable of combating certain bacteria better than antibiotics! I am no doctor but am an experienced researcher, and I can attest to the healing properties that essential oils have on your your mental and physical well-being when smelled.<br /><br />- When needing to disinfect areas in your home/work (especially during these times of COVID-19), essential oils Lavender and Tea Tree have natural disinfecting properties; a drop or two from this set into a spray bottle with hot water works great.<br /><br />- Honest moment: I sometimes forget about my leftovers in the car, which creates a wretched smell but I add a few drops of Peppermint oil (increases alertness) from this set, onto a cotton ball and clip it to a vent with a clothespin... BOOM! Goodbye smell of last night's curry and hello alert driver!<br /><br />Whether you choose to get this essential oils set as a gift for yourself or others, it includes every imaginable scent to appease all of your senses. Highly recommend this wonderful product a 100 times over! [SEP] Why are we not being offered larger bottles of oil’s<br />I purchased these all the time oils not this particular bunch but anyways I like the smell of them I want to be offered larger bottles [SEP] At less than $2 each for a rich collection of different types of concentrated essential oils, I found this product to be good value. As another reviewer mentioned, the bottles are dark amber, and allow little light through, thus assuring you can sample from each one until you find the scent you wont to disburse. In addition to their obvious use in diffusers as aromatherapy, I have dropped a few drops into the bathtub along with Epsom salts to bring a relaxing, refreshing and/or rejuvenating scent, depending on which type you select. you can also mix with a plain carrier oil to have a pleasant smelling massage oil. The selection process is easier because the set includes recommended uses for each variant (though you better have good eye sight to read them because the print is small). Given the variety of scents available and the many uses for oils, I think this is a great buy and a great product. [SEP] Love the scent, and value for the money [SEP] 5/5 Rating<br /><br />Pros<br />Multiple scents to choose from<br />Giftable<br /><br />Cons<br />None<br /><br />This is a nice affordable set of essential oil scents that you can use for your home. shower, bath, candles... I love the variety of the scents offered. My favorites are peppermint, citronella and pine tree. I use primarily for my diffuser. A few drops will last you the entire day. [SEP] Since this wasn't my area of expertise, I had my mother, who is a Doctor of Natural Medicine, give me her opinion of these oils.  Here is her opinion:<br /><br />The box had a beautiful presentation of 20 Essential Oils.  Right from opening, it was delightful because of all the amazing aromas, even before opening the first bottle. I was happy with the wonderful selection of extracts. These are able to cover a plethora of applications that can use to serve many needs in aromatherapy.<br /><br />Every one of the oils displayed an excellent extraction of the true essence, and seems to me composed of the highest quality organic herbs and flowers.  These oils have an extremely long lasting scent.<br /><br />These are the perfect base for those demanding purity as well as creativity in healthy living. These excellent extracts are perfect, and ready to be used in air-infusers, natural body health care treatments and products.<br /><br />This product is well worth it's price.  You wont be disappointed [SEP] We love the scent of these oils. So easy to use and store. I get many compliments from friends and family on how nice our house smells. Love it!!! [SEP] Current price $38.99 - Securely boxed and wrapped. Each bottle has a tamper-proof lid that you have to ""unseal"" when you open the bottle. There are 20 bottles of incredibly nice essential oils - basically $2 per bottle. Very good deal if you like the fragrances that come in the box. I think they are all great except maybe citronella though it does have its uses! ;)<br /><br />I recently started making my own reed diffusers oils. I love that I can change up how my house smells often. I just take a bottle of carrier oil and add some of the essential oils and add my reeds. Once the jar dissipates, I just create another fragrance.  Way more economical then spending $15 to $30 per refill plus my house smells lovely! 5 Stars! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful! I especially like the large selection in this box!",3,True

I took one out noticing the easy open label on the top. It actually was. The plastic covering peels off with minimal effort and I think just about anyone will be able to twist the top off. . . Unfortunately. I've drank some bad things before. I've even had spoiled beer that had unidentifiable chunks floating in it. This was that bad. It was revolting. Chalky and bitter with a horrible chemical, sour, twang. I had two mouthfuls and I was still tasting this hours later. Yes, I ate and drank other things to try and get rid of the taste but it lingered. Hands down this was the most revolting thing I have ever drank. Tossed the other five bottles in the trash. I do not recommend this product. Unless you don't like someone, a lot. [SEP] Decent flavor. Taste similar to some name brands I have tried. Filled me up for the morning. Not too grainy. Love how much nutrition is packed in each drink. The bottle is also a nice size. [SEP] except in price, They taste alike, they look alike and they have about the same nutrient information and ingredients. So why pay more for what you need. This is normally given to people who need the nutrition from the shake. For me, the carbohydrates are too high. But for others, it is what keeps them going, [SEP] Health and nutrients wise, this drink is very good. The label offers wealth of information on what benefits my body will receive were I to consume in on daily basis. It goes down easy and smooth, has light texture but it has a certain medicinal aftertaste like when you take pills and they slide down your throat and leave slight unpleasant aftertaste - that's how it feels immediately after drinking it. It goes away pretty fast, and the health benefits certainly outweigh this little inconvenience, but for some it's a big deal. So be in the know. I like it fine. [SEP] Good [SEP] I generally try stay away from these types of products these days because they have Soy Protein in them but, they are good though. I’ve drank hundreds of Ensure in the past as I was healing and I know it was a big part of my getting better and this is quite comparable to it. I think it’s a good product but, I find it to be quite pricey when I compare it to Ensure, which is what it says to do on the front of the label.<br />  If the price is right and you either need a quick pick-me-up or you’re healing like I was, I would definitely recommend this stuff.<br />  Happy Health Everyone!😁 [SEP] I thought this actually tasted pretty good. It wasn't sour and didn't have any off after taste. Looking at the ingredients though it's basically water, sugar, milk protein and flavoring with vitamins added. I personally would not consider that a health drink or a meal replacement. I suppose though if I were sick and that is all I could have it would be beneficial?  I was thinking it would be good as a recovery drink after a workout but for me though, it's way too much sugar. [SEP] Good buy and good taste. Need I say more? [SEP] Good strawberry flavor that isn't overpowering.<br /><br />I drink a lot of the Walgreen's strawberry shakes and the Nestle Boost ones, and Amazon's flavor is just as good. [SEP] First thoughts when I opened the bottle, terrible smell. After it had been opened a while it was fine. The strawberry flavor was ok, but the aftertaste was horrible! I thought it might get better the more I drank, but that did not happen. It just got worse. I put most of it down the drain. Also 32 carbs in one bottle?!? Totally not worth that!

After taking them for a couple of weeks I feel improvements in my digestion, elimination and energy level when exercising. I also sleep better and feel better overall. I highly recommend these excellent supplements. [SEP] From the female of the family: I have taken Sam-e for some years now and love the effect as a mood-booster and brain-brightener. In this bottle, you get 60 capsules, 500 mg. each, for $40. Sam-e is a pricy supplement, so you need to consider that, but I find the effects are noticeable, and worth it.<br /><br />There are benefits to your joints and liver health as well. And this product is manufactured under strict laboratory standards and inspections. [SEP] This Sam-e is made nice and clean, is GMP Certified and is made in the USA. It has helped me with the pain in my joints and the stress in dealing with the pain that comes from it. I can also speak for the stink concern of another review I saw. It simply is a naturally smelly supplement, as quite a few supplements I know of are.<br />  I actually have another very good brand of Sam-e that I’m currently not finished with and it definitely isn’t an enjoyable smell but, I could care less because of how it helps me.😁 Anyway, I would definitely recommend it. Oh, this one is also great because, it’s 500mg with 1 capsule and the other I have needs 2 caps to get 500mg. Nice! [SEP] HS Health Supplements, Sam-e 500mg (S-Adenosyl Methionine) Promotes Positive Mood and Joint Comfort,<br /><br />It is always hard for me to write supplement reviews - work as should. I know some other reviewers said there was a smell - the container I received does not smell at all. Works as SAM-e should work. I like it for body aches! Highly recommend. 5 Stars!  Hope you found this review helpful! Swedish Company. [SEP] Yikes! This supplement has a very foul, rotten egg odor. That’s a sign of degradation. Sam E should not have any odor if it’s high quality. Definitely won’t be purchasing from this brand again. Invest in high quality, well known brands. Don’t waste your money.",3,True
Quench - 30 Island Ice Hydrating Electrolytes Rip Sticks | Energy and Intensity Maximizer | Whole-Body Hydration | 5g Packets,[],[],,4.2,24,13577,"I will not be finishing the bag.  I did not enjoy the flavor at all.  Mixing required extra shaking of the water, but most of the powdered dissolved. I would not recommend these, but that does not mean another person may like the flavor. [SEP] I live in a very warm climate and do a lot of working/working out out doors.<br /><br />Electrolyte drink mixes are a constant stock item in our home.  I will often have a couple grocery store mixes in a day of working outside.  Today I had one of these and plenty of water and I feel good.  I sweated a bunch and do not have muscle cramps, headache or any of the other symptoms I get when my electrolytes/hydration are out of whack.<br /><br />Taste - mild flavor, mild sweetness  I know it's not pineapple, but that was what it reminded me of. [SEP] Cloud Nine Life is a tasty way to replace much needed electrolytes inside my body, after I’m drained from a sweaty workout. The island ice flavor has a hint of citrus to it, and when I mixed it in 8 oz of cold water it not only hydrated my tired body, but gave me a mayor shot of energy for round two! [SEP] I do a lot of physical activity, from running and cycling to weight training. So, I try to drink electrolytes as much as possible to replenish everything I've lost while sweating and working out I've tried many products over the years, so I was exciting to try this product.<br /><br />Flavor: Not really sure what I was expecting with ""Island Ice"" but I'd describe it as a mild coconut/pineapple flavor. It's palatable- not my first choice, but okay to drink.<br /><br />Packaging: I like that it comes in small single use packages that I can take on the go. They're easy to open and pour into a water bottle.<br /><br />Texture: This is really the downfall of this product. It tends to clump together when you pour it in water and doesn't really dissolve. It's okay to drink, but it tends to settle in the bottom of the glass or water bottle.<br /><br />Overall, a good product. [SEP] I'm not always a big fan of these but I do like to try them out once in awhile. Its actually not bad! The flavor is pretty mild if you ask me. With most of these type of things I suggest finding something they mix well with instead of just using water.<br /><br />The energy boost was very noticeable however equal to a cup of coffee which I liked cause I drink coffee like its a blood transfusion.<br /><br />There's a good amount in the case and not a bad value for what you are getting.<br /><br />They definitely helped to drink prior and during any kind of energy burning activities. And I didn't feel any negative side effects like a crash or burn out or opposite of being too wired. Definitely worth checking out [SEP] I drink a lot of fluids during the workday, and ""just water"" gets really boring, really fast. I could go with all coffee, but that also gets old after a while. So I figured I'd give these Quench ""Island Ice Hydrating Eletrolyte Rip Sticks"" a chance.<br /><br />I filled a glass with 8oz of cold water (and some ice) and stirred in one packet. The mix creates a cloudy yellow/white drink. It tastes fine--reasonably dissolved, not grainy.<br /><br />The taste is good--strong and sweet. The flavor comes from the prickly pair, but if you've nevr had one of those, here it's pretty similar to pineapple. There's caffeine in these, and I did notice a little bit of a caffeine jolt in the mid-afternoon, but not like a stiff cup of coffee.<br /><br />Now, at 15 calories per glass, I am not sure what they're talking about with respect to ""replenish drained energy"". But, honestly, at this stage in my life, I don't need caloric energy replenishment as much as I need a good-tasting drink that is low cal and gives me just a bit of a mid-afternoon bump. These seem to do the trick.<br /><br />Note that in the fine print, the note that these contain sucralose, along with fructose, guar gum, and silicon dioxide. I'm OK with all that, and it does taste good to me. But if you're averse to sucralose, be aware.<br /><br />I got these in 09/21, and the best-before date on the packets is 01/22. [SEP] These are low calorie and low sugar but do contain sucralose, I would personally prefer normal sugar over sucralose. Also, the description on Amazon says that they have approximately the same amount of caffeine as a premium cup of coffee, but it doesn't actually disclose how much caffeine is in it, which I wish it did. I just like details personally.<br /><br />Overall these do taste pretty good and they seem like a good deal at their current price of $10 for 30 packets. [SEP] Your everyday electrolytes nothing special taste was good . Got them for my survival bag",3,True

The lining on the lined version is exactly like the Mr. Clean gloves I've used for years. The unlined are exactly like the gloves I used to get many years ago from the same brand. Overall, given that Mr. Clean gloves have been my favorite for an exceptionally long time, these are equal to the task, equal in comfort and they get the job done equally well. With the lined version, if I am going to do something that will make me sweat a lot, it even has the same little flaw of a bit of the lining coming off on my hands, sort of like chalk, they are that similar. I love these gloves and this company has done a great job with this product. They are as good as the original brand that makes them. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] I use gloves every time I wash dishes or clean the bathroom. This comes with a pack of two so I threw out my old gloves and replaced them with these. They are a rubbery thin material kind of like latex. They are super easy to put on and take off. The rubber like material makes it easy to hold onto your dishes while hand washing. They aren’t completely up to my elbow but close and they aren’t super tight. They are comfortable to wear while washing dishes that’s for sure. Even though they don’t reach my elbows I still didn’t have a problem with water getting in them, they actually were above water just enough that it didn’t get in. You can use them more than once so don’t toss them out! I definitely recommend! [SEP] Same as other household Glove I have. It fits nicely. I do notice this seems a little more breathable. At least my hands did not sweat as much after 15 minutes of use and remains relatively dry. Not bad. [SEP] They are pretty and comfortable, but nothing approaching long-lasting. The right glove in each of the pairs - I am right-handed - wore away and tore between the fingers within a few uses. [SEP] My skin tends to dry out when exposed to dishwashing soap and I simply won’t tackle messy or dirty chores without gloves.  I’ve chipped too many nails or ruined a fresh manicure when I’ve tried to take shortcuts and avoid gloves. After going through too many thin and short lived gloves, I wanted latex-free options  that would last. These are the solution . I use one pair when doing dishes and another pair  for gardening. They’ve held up so well that I’m going to get another set to use when I clean  the bathroom. [SEP] They are working beautifully. My hands and sleeves remain dry. In other words, these gloves are perfect!  Medium fit my averaged sized women's hands perfectly.  Very easy to put on and take off. Still have very good gripping ability as these are not bulky gloves. Plus, cute colors :-)<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] I have small hands the medium is snug fit and there’s extra room on the tips of finger by .25 inch. [SEP] These medium size gloves fit really well. I have a somewhat thick arm so they slid on with room. They seem somewhat thin and may not last a long time but only time will tell. But so far they seem durable enough. [SEP] Fantastic gloves! Excellent quality. Great fit. FUN COLORS! This set contains one lined and one unlined pair of gloves for different needs.  The lining actually makes the gloves easier to get on and off while cleaning. These gloves are completely waterproof. They provide excellent protection for your hands. These are the best cleaning gloves I have used in a long time! [SEP] these gloves work good, I am lucky that my hands are small enough to use them because they came in size medium but they fit a bigger small.  I like that they feel thick and durable.  I also like that i was able to wash my dishes with the hottest temperature and the rubber glove kept my hands from getting too hot.  I don't think they will prevent a burn at extreme temperatures but they definitely kept my hands from water that would have probably burnt my bare skin!",3,True
"Air Freshener Spray Lavender Scent - Kate Naturals (8 fl oz) Sweet Floral Aroma & Odor Eliminator for Pillows, Linen & Room Spray with Essential Oils. Fabric Refresher Spray for Bedding",[],[],,3.9,19,559,"Nice natural lavender scent. Does not smell synthetic at all. I have tried a few fragrance options by Kate Naturals. They are all as natural as can be. They smell nice, dont trigger headaches. I love the whiff of fresh smelling lavender (and orange, and peppermint), but they dont linger long, and I have had bottle issues. So far so good on this one, but we'll see. I had to downrate my orange one from 4 to 1 star because the bottle stopped working after a week. I will update here if I experience that with this.<br /><br /> I think they make for a very good ""before you go"" bathroom spray. Also nice for general use, but I find them very effective for that purpose. Also works in a pinch to freshen up clothes, shoe closet, etc. [SEP] Ok the smell is good, I’ll give it that. But, it didn’t ship with a spray nozzle. The scent didn’t last long sadly. [SEP] The bottle came sealed and just as described. The spray itself smells just like essential oils do when you have a diffuser going. It’s mainly lavender with a hint of lemon, overall a very pleasant smell. I have been using it on my couch/bed and in my kitty litter pan and it works great to deodorize. The one thing I will say is that the scent does not linger past 30 minutes. For me, this is not an issue as I have plug in air fresheners in most rooms. If you are looking for something long lasting, this isn’t it.<br />This spray is perfect for after you cook and trying to get ride of lingering odors, or a quick freshen up of your house if you are having guest over. [SEP] This smells good. It only sprays little puffs so you have to be very close to whatever you are spraying. I don't think it lasts very long. [SEP] This is honestly my new favorite air freshener spray. I am so picky about scents and I don't like the smell of anything artificial or chemically, because they actually make me feel sick. This spray smells like essential oils and nothing else. The scent is strong enough without being overpowering, and it lingers in the air for a little while but dissipates within about a half hour - this is my preference, as I'm using it as a bathroom spray and hate scented sprays like febreeze that take forever to dissipate. I also actually like the style of the spray bottle more so than the other ones I've tried, and the price is super affordable so all around a great product :) [SEP] I love the lavender’s smell and this product did not disappoint me! It has a strong scent that does linger if sprayed on something. I see people complaint that the scent does not last but on open spaces, it’s hard to keep the strong smell since it spreads everywhere. But I like to spray on something if I want the scent to stay longer. I am constantly using it around the upstairs area where kids and cats leave their stinks lol<br />The spray stream is not too strong so don’t worry about overdoing it. If you want a stronger scent just spray it more times.<br /><br />Happy with this product! Lavender is so soothing and fresh [SEP] My habit is always to wait at least a few weeks before reviewing anything. That way, readers of my comments know I am not just excited about a package coming in the mail but have also tested its usefulness.<br /><br />Most air fresheners are way too strong for me to like. This has the perfect subtle scent that still covers up the bad smells. You don't have to worry about over-spraying like in a normal scent.  The scent is very calming but not overpowering. I use the product when I want to freshen up an area or if I know I am about to have company. Often times my dogs get wet from playing outside and bring in doggy odors, so great to use to freshen their sleeping areas. Love the trigger sprayer, too.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] The scent of this natural lavender air freshener is absolutely delightful. It's just the right strength and makes whatever room I spray it in smell fresh and clean.  I especially like it near the front door and in the bathroom.<br /><br />I haven't had any problem with spray getting on my fingers like some reviewers have, but I do wish the scent would last a little longer. [SEP] This room spray smells so good and has a nice mist when spraying it. It is actually strong and with just a few sprays make a house smell so fresh and clean. It's a good size bottle and will last awhile for me. It arrived fast and was packaged well. [SEP] The initial spritz of this freshener was great. I found that its extremely subtle and it isn't long lasting. In an attempt to counteract the mild scent I found myself over spraying areas or having to re-spray rooms. Not efficient for me.",3,True

I add to smoothies and it blends without clumping. Smells and looks fresh. After unpacking, I noticed the inner seal had come undone just a little causing some product to poof out. I didn’t detect any off-scent though. [SEP] PROS<br /><br />1. The taste is typical of wheatgrass—a bit grassy. Wheatgrass powder is not bitter like barley grass powder, and for that reason, I much prefer it.<br />2. The product is fresh.<br />3. It is third-party lab tested for impurities.<br />4. It contains no fillers, preservatives or artificial colors.<br />5. It is manufactured at a GMP facility.<br />6. It is not irradiated.<br />7. It is made from whole leaves of wheat grass.<br />8.

(Which, unfortunately, far too many other brands do, such as Amazing Grass, Biotech Nutritions, Triquetra Health, and Naturelo.)<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1. Other brands of similar cost are organic. If you would prefer an organic brand that does not come in a plastic container, one possibility is Pride Of India Organic Wheatgrass Powder 8 oz. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:f267ba31e12981f55ac6fdd4530df873]] Expiration date is 01/2023, a quality and inexpensive product, highly recommended brand. [SEP] I begin my day with a mixture of this wheatgrass, powdered collagen, (bovine), and 1/2 bag of Rejuvinate. I feel the difference immediately.<br />I can’t go a day without it. I also take my supplements with it. The Rejuvenate is helpful for muscles but since it’s only sweetened with stevia it makes the wheatgrass a more pleasant drink. I tried other brands of wheatgrass when this was briefly unavailable but this is the best by far! I don’t know why other brands have to taste so awful but I suspect they aren’t made like Neurogan makes it!  Hope this helps. [SEP] I'm weird, because I'm not much into veggies (unless it's chef-version fancy veggies), but I love green drinks and have no trouble at all mixing the green powder into water and chugging it down. The only thing that is unappealing is when it doesn't mix in well, and there are chunks that get stuck in my teeth (tmi, sorry), which does happen on occasion.<br /><br />This *wheatgrass powder is awesome. It's mild flavored (no bitterness at all) and smooth - mixing in perfectly!<br /><br />Wheatgrass if full of powerful antioxidants and vitamins/minerals. Overall, it's a fantastic and easy way to stay healthy.<br /><br />*This is NOT wheatgrass juice powder, which is usually a darker green and even more full of nutrients. But, because this is not the juice powder, it is a more budget friendly version.",3,True

They don't irritate my skin, they are easy to get on and off and they are sturdy. Wonderful to use and keep my hands from getting dry and cracking. [SEP] This company makes the best rubber gloves I've ever used! I clean vacated apartments for a living and they can be an absolute mess so I like to have my hands covered and these are perfect. They're comfy, durable, waterproof, and dont make my hands sweat like most rubber gloves. Absolutely love them 5 stars!!! [SEP] You can use these for anything!!  They have textured hands so you can use to scrub or hold on to items better. And they fit wonderfully. Specially since I have gained weight, these are great on fitting. Not like other brands. Heavy duty. Quality made. Worked Great!! Great Deal! I hope this has helped. Thank You [SEP] UPDATE - the smell does not go away so I changed from 4 to 2 stars as it makes me think there is something bad in these gloves. A sickening chemical smell that doesn't go away after cleaning with 409.<br />These are for general cleaning and light gardening around the house. They slipped on easy and were easy to get off. They provided modest protection against hot water (ie. not sustained but brief contact with very hot water that you wouldn't have been able to stand without gloves on). There were four sets of glove - two white with pink tips and two solid purple. Each had some slight contour on the hands and fingers for better gripping objects. I was able to hold small objects while using them and clean with them. I used 409 spray, which eats thru daisy cups by the way, and these did fine soaking in them while cleaning some faucet. The 409 did leave a stain on the gloves, but would have on any gloves. It did not eat thru them so can use them again. These gloves come in a rip tear plastic pouch and say they have a shelf life of 3 years. They have a chemically smell to them which I hope dissipates over time. [SEP] Overall, a decent set of dishwashing gloves. They are a nice length, and you can always fold them upwards if the length bothers you. The length is nice to protect your sleeves/arms from getting wet, also to prevent water from spilling into the interior of the glove. The integrated flocked lining is the nicer of the two types, with a nicer feel on the hands. This lining also seems to allow easier removal of the gloves, I found.<br />These were sized L, and they were a little loose, which was fine. I usually wear a L sized men's glove (USA sizing), and the fit is just right.<br />I cannot say the textured fingertips performed any better than other rubber gloves, partially because I am careful while handling pots or items that are handwashed. The coloring on the fingertips have not real additional functionality.<br />The gloves seem to be on the thinner side, which concerns me regarding durability. To be fair, time and usage will be the arbiter of that issue. Latex-free for those with such sensitivity.<br />Again, of the two types, the integrated flocking is the nicer feature. [SEP] These are great! I just use them to clean shoes. They're soft inside and durable outside. They rinse off nicely. They're comfortable. [SEP] These go on easily and the material feels good. [SEP] These gloves by Pacific PPE are perfect for most home cleaning chores. They're large enough to fit my rather large hands, are thick and durable enough to get a couple of uses out of each pair. Plus they keep moisture out.<br /><br />I had to mop and clean a bathroom with nothing between my hands and the chemicals I used but these gloves. They performed well in keeping my hands dry and even covered part of my wrists which meant ringing out towels and mops didn't circumvent their protection.<br /><br />I deducted a star from the overall grade of these gloves because there should have been an XL size made. While my hands did get in these gloves it was a very tight fit. I could have used more space. I also thought the price of these gloves was a bit high. Four gloves for 15 dollars doesn't feel like a bargain. [SEP] Definitly waterproof thats a plus. Definitly reusable thats awesome. All in all great gloves. Its nice having a set of 4 because I stretch one out with my big hands although they still work fine my girlfriend prefers to use her own.<br />They look nice and work well.",3,True
"Lemon Balm Drops, 30 Pre-Filled Single Servings, Ease Nervousness, and Tension, Soothe Nerves and Fortify Cellular Health, Non-GMO and Vegan, Biodegradable, Eco-Friendly",[],[],,4.4,26,947,"This lemon balm supplement liquid tastes a little like an herbal coffee. I took it at around 9 pm and by 9:30 I was feeling very emotionally calm. The easy-to-use single serving tubes are also handy. You just snap off the lid and drink the contents. So if you are looking for something to help you relax this might work for you. Of course consult with your doctor before taking any supplements.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review [SEP] Well, I was excited to try lemon balm after reading about it’s calming properties as well as other possible effects. And this tastes ok, not really lemon, as lemon balm is only slightly lemon flavored. I put it under my tongue for faster absorption. But this is a proprietary blend and no where does it list the amount of lemon balm inside the product. And most recommended doses are 300-600 mg a day . So it’s hard for me to know what I’m taking and if it’s helpful, as the information isn’t presented for comparison. The same with tea, which I was looking to try next . So, if you need a specific dose for your own experimenting, this won’t help. I’m not an overly stressed guy, so nothing has stood out so far for me as a noticeable change. I’ll finish the box, it’s a unique and easy way to take it ( reminds me of the candy bottles with flavored juice we had as a kid ) . I’m not unhappy, I just wish I had more information. [SEP] I tried this when I was entering a stressful situation and it really did help with my nerves. [SEP] I was very intrigued when I saw the Drops of Nature products. I've tried the Lemon Balm, Stinging Nettle, and Oil of Oregano drops and what you get is exactly what is shown and described on the product pages.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />Each ""dose"" comes its own little tube. Easy to open the first time, and the nifty little cap can be replaced if you don't use the whole vial at once by turning the cap upside down and placing the open end of the cap on the tube. I don't know, however, how long it will stay fresh once it's been opened & re-capped if you don't use it all at once.<br /><br />Reasonably priced for a 30+ day quantity of liquid herbal supplement. (30+ days because if you use less than one tube per day and finish off the tube the next day, it will, of course, last longer.)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The only con for me, is the taste. Of the three types, the Lemon Balm drops tasted the best. Very lemony without the sourness.<br /><br />Stinging Nettle drops tasted a lot like the way a fresh cut lawn smells. Not horrible tasting, but I didn't like it.  (This is just me, someone else may love it!)<br /><br />Oil of Oregano tasted kind of like a bland, but slightly bitter, mint. I liked this one the least of the 3 flavors.<br /><br />Sooo... these are one of the ""sitting on the fence"" type products. The things I didn't like were personal taste, and every person's is different. I can say that I had no bad effects from any of them.<br /><br />[Cross-posting to all 3 flavors pages.] [SEP] This product comes with 30 individual serving sizes ready to go, great for on the go. The liquid is brown, unlike the images on the site, and in water it leaves a brown tint which, although not visually appetizing, doesn’t affect the taste. I don’t notice a taste in water or juice. I got these as they claim to help reduce stress and stomach issues, both things I could use help with. It’s a very small serving and I haven’t noticed any difference in using this product to not. [SEP] First of all these twist caps are not easy to twist off. That was my major complaint. I ended up having to use a scissors to cut them. Also the lemon flavor was so light, almost barely there. I'm sure it wasn't meant to be very strong especially because the dose is only 1 ml. I think I usually see 1.5-4 ml is recommended for anxiety so this is on the lower end. I'm not sure I noticed a huge difference. I will maybe moving forward use 2 a day instead of 1. [SEP] These are a convenient option to have in my purse for a little de-stressing help. They taste a bit like lemon tea, and I don't love it but don't mind it. I can't tell that it does much, but I'm hopeful that it helps a little with nervousness and tension. [SEP] I have been experiencing anxiety and nervousness lately so I decided to give the lemon balm drops a try. It doesn't really taste like lemon but the taste is not unbearable. I take one dose under my tongue when I feel anxious or nervous, like before a meeting when I have to do a presentation. I feel like the drops help but the calmness only lasts for a short period. Overall I am happy with the results and very grateful for something to help me with anxiety. [SEP] I wanted to try these for myself and my autistic teen. Anything that claims to soothe nerves naturally is always worth a shot.<br /><br />We have each been taking one in the morning with our vitamins. So far, I don't feel like they do much, but maybe we haven't been taking them long enough. We haven't tried them at night before bed, maybe that's when we may notice a difference?<br /><br />We both like the taste. I drink it straight, my son either puts it under his tongue or in his orange juice. I think it tastes like lemon iced tea concentrate.<br /><br />If anything, it's healthy for us to use as a supplement! [SEP] These little plastic ampoules are genius!  They’re portable and re-closable so I don’t waste unused lemon balm if I don’t use it all at once (like when my daughter uses just a few drops).  The flavor is tolerable.  It definitely takes the edge off and helps me reduce anxious feelings.  I wish the ampoules were labeled with what is inside but I can mark them with permanent marker myself.",3,True
Spotlight Oral Care Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth,[],[],9.99,3.6,34,987,"Having sensitive teeth and gums can make good oral health a struggle.  Most of the time I just skip using toothpaste, defaulting to baking soda, but I so miss the fresh feeling that a good toothpaste leaves in my mouth.  Mouthwash is nice, but just not the same.<br /><br />I have tried many toothpaste brands that promise and fail to deliver a more comfortable brushing experience, so it was a certain of low expectation that accompanied my order of the Spotlight brand.<br /><br />I was delighted at the mild taste of this toothpaste.  No burning gums or tongue.  No sparks of pain in my teeth.  I am thrilled to have a toothpaste that properly cleans my teeth and so nicely protects my teeth and gums without discomfort. [SEP] This has a 5% concentration of potassium nitrate, which is the ingredient used in all sensitive toothpastes to cut down (or, in my case, eliminate) sensitive teeth issues. As such, it works the same as other sensitive toothpastes.<br /><br />It does differ from others with regard to taste and consistency. It has a mild minty taste that, while acceptable, is not all that fresh tasting. The consistency is a bit softer than other toothpastes and it doesn't foam up as much. While that's usually a plus, good foaming action is a benefit when it comes to sensitive toothpastes since it helps the potassium nitrate get into all the nooks and crannies. My favorite sensitive toothpaste is the Colgate foaming action one. It has the same 5% potassium nitrate as this, but the foaming action does make a difference.<br /><br />While the tube looks big, there's not a lot of product. It's only filled about 1/2 of the way and, while it looks like a standard size tube, it only provides 3.5 oz of toothpaste. It's also hard to get all of it out of the tube since the tube is plastic and does not roll up. It dispenses fine when mostly full, but is not great at dispensing when the level gets low.<br /><br />While this does work, the negatives put my score at 3 stars (average). Not a compelling purchase compared with other options. [SEP] I have sensitive areas where the dentin is not completely covered by enamel so if a toothbrush bristle hits it I go electric.  I've been using sensitive toothpastes for years so when this one came up on my list of items I could review I decided to try it.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it contains fluoride since I'm trying to eliminate fluoride from my diet as much as possible.  I've used the Spotlight sensitive toothpaste twice a day for about a week and if my teeth were going to react to it they would have by now.  I have not had any sensitivity issues with this toothpaste.  Also, it tastes fine and my teeth really feel nice and clean afterwards.  As of this review I don't know how much it costs. [SEP] I am pleased with this sensitive toothpaste. I have been using it for the past week and it has kept my sensitive teeth feeling good. It has a nice flavor. Not as minty as my previous sensitive toothpaste, but very pleasant and light. It foams nicely without being too foamy. I have not had any pain in my teeth since I began using it. I already used a sensitive toothpaste before this one, however, switching over has not caused me any problems. I like the consistency of the toothpaste. It is a normal toothpaste consistency and is not watery at all. [SEP] I have sensitive teeth and receding gums. This toothpaste helps to take away the sensitivity. I like it more than the drugstore sensodine and such. Tat too expensive, but hey, it seems worth the price. [SEP] During Covid concerns I certainly did not want to go to the dentist and have people right in my face so I had a serious issue when a dental problem arose.  It felt like my four bottom front teeth were going to fall out. They hurt a lot and I could not figure out why.  No cavities there of course and no receding gums.  They just plain hurt - especially when I brushed them.  A friend suggested I try a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  And so I tried this.  Within three days the pain had diminished and within three weeks it was gone.  I was amazed. This product saved my teeth and me a lot of money for a dental appointment.  I also like that it is cruelty free and ocean safe - not that I will be going near the ocean any time soon. [SEP] Review of:  Spotlight Oral Care Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth<br /><br />I’ve been using the Spotlight Oral Care Toothpaste for the last week or so and, so far at least, I’ve been pleased with the product.<br /><br />I found that the taste of the toothpaste is actually pretty good, especially in comparison to other ‘fresh mint’ flavored toothpastes I’ve tried before that seem to have an off-taste or bitter after-taste them.  The mint taste of the Spotlight is present but not overwhelming; which I like.<br /><br />The foaming action of the toothpaste I consider to be about average; certainly, enough in my estimation to feel as if the toothpaste was getting to every corner of my mouth but not so much as to be annoying.<br /><br />The active ingredients I also consider to be about average for a decent quality ‘sensitive’ toothpaste; Potassium Nitrate and Sodium Fluoride.  And, after using the product a few times now, I consider the effectiveness (based on the potassium nitrate level of 5.0%) to be about the same as many other ‘sensitive’ toothpastes I’ve tried in the past.<br /><br />After brushing, the Spotlight toothpaste does leave my teeth feeling clean and does leave my mouth with a nice, somewhat minty taste.<br /><br />For me, while this toothpaste is noticeably better than some bargain-basement type sensitive toothpastes, it is roughly equal to many quality, name-brand or store-brand toothpastes.<br /><br />The cost, however, for this 3.5 ounce tube of sensitive toothpaste is a concern for me as I consider it to be on the higher side; especially for what I rate as an average, middle-of-the-road toothpaste. [SEP] This toothpaste does a good job of both cleaning and reducing sensitivity.  I don't think it's cost-competitive compared to store brands, so I took off one star. [SEP] I think this toothpaste works well for sensitive teeth and also has the same amount of sodium flouride as the version for teeth whitening, so this should help with whitening too.  You do have to put a goodly amount of it on the toothbrush and brush for a while.  This costs a little more than synsodyne toothpaste that would be another similar option.  The active ingredients are almost the same. [SEP] Spotlight Oral Care Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth is made in the USA and cruelty free.  It contains two active ingredients: 5% potassium nitrate and .24% sodium fluoride.<br /><br />This vegan friendly toothpaste has a pleasant mint flavor. I prefer using toothpaste with cavity fighting fluoride and the potassium nitrate works effectively to reduce sensitivity to cold.  I use it with an extra soft brush and it works well.<br /><br />The only little quibble that I have is that the cap is a separate screw on style rather than a flip top style which is more convenient to use.<br /><br />Spotlight Oral Care Toothpaste for Sensitive Teeth is a minty toothpaste that combines two active ingredients to desensitize teeth and prevent cavities.  It is very effective.",3,True

The resealable herb bags are all pretty good sized pouches and look really nice. The little jars of gems all look amazing. One of the labels was poorly put onto the jar but we managed to pull the label off and fix it. The box the little gem jars is in barely fits them, it's quite a struggle getting them all back jammed in if you pull them out.<br /><br />Overall this is a really cool kit and everything is great quality/ looks great! [SEP] This is a great starter kit for someone new to Wicca.  I only wish it came with a book rather than a booklet with print way too small for me to read.  Now I just need to find a good book with large print about beginner Wicca. [SEP] I ordered this as a gift for my niece & she loves it. It is mostly non culinary herbs & spices. The polished crystals & stones are of good/average quality & are on the small to average size. The plastic case with the tumbled gemstone chips includes very small plastic screw cap pots with each type of gemstone identified on the top. The purple drawstring bag is very nice.<br /><br />The spoon is garbage. I'm extremely disappointed in it. The paper isn't actually parchment & is small (about 5.75"" x 4.25""), but fine for my niece to enjoy. The user guide is actually a pamphlet. It's super beginner & is fine for that but a good book or two would be more appropriate (I know what I'm getting my niece next).<br /><br />Overall, this makes a nice gift for a beginner, tween, teen, etc. If the recipient is really into it, you might want to add a book or two & maybe a antique spoon (Etsy is great for antique spoons). [SEP] This was a great buy, perfect for beginners. The herb bags were much bigger than I expected, the purple charm bag is so pretty, the spoon is nice quality and I love the design. The crystal chips and tumbled stones all seem to be authentic ( the citrine chips looked dyed but other than that, the rest were good ) The user guide was extremely helpful, it tells you about everything in the box and what everything is used for. I would definitely recommend this box!!! [SEP] As of when I type this the product is showing as ""currently unavailable"" and this makes me really sad. This is the prefect gift for a beginner just wanting to start looking into the craft (although the info sheet is super small and basic so you might want to add a book or 2), or as a kit for someone (or yourself) that is already in the craft because this is a great little kit. Great selection of herbs, mini crystals (for spells / bags - you don't see this very often) - and a set of full size chakra stones, all in a giftable box. Really hope that they make this available again soon! [SEP] I really like the Witchcraft Supplies set.  It comes with so much.  There are dried herbs, crystal chips, Chakra stones, a tiny spoon and more.  Everything is packed well and clearly labeled.  I like that the black box itself is not labeled so it keeps the materials inside personal (in case you have nosy visitors).  This is great for a beginner or to give as a gift.  I cannot comment on the price as there was no price listed when I received this. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:de54325b29c1319b25430fa1da72f542]] I am happy with the amount of herbs and gems stones and rocks love the spoon and the bag that comes with the stones I don't dislike anything I will be ordering from this company [SEP] ive been into witchcraft since i was in high school and this had pretty much all i needed. it showed up on time and everything [SEP] This is one of the nicest sets I have seen for anyone starting out, as a gift for someone who uses these items, or just as a kit to help replenish your own supply. There is a large variety of dried herbs. The bags actually were larger than I expected, so you get enough to hold you over for a while. The bottles of crystal chips are rather small but perfect for rituals and altars. There is a bag of larger crystals, and you get a very small spoon and some parchment paper. There is a brief user guide included. This is the type of kit I could see myself getting again when needed. It all comes nicely packed in a sturdy box.

HerbalDr.Net Rose Hip Oil with Vitamin E & Placenta - Small Bottle (Mei Gui Guo You),[],[],,4.8,11,36952,"Love this product.  I first bought this product at an Herbal Store in LA and when I could not find it in NYC I ordered it from Amazon.  This product is GREAT!!!!! It makes the my face feel really smooth and it removes all the small lines that you want to to get rid of.  It also makes you look younger as well.  Its a GREAT moisturize and I use it a night and a little in the am to give me a little glow. [SEP] A very easy to use and apply product.  It has a lovely rose smell that lingers and it quickly nourishes the skin around your eyes and lips to quickly minimize fine lines and wrinkles.  You need very little so it can last for a year.  Very good value and price for the amount you receive. [SEP] This is the most natural and most effective facial oil I have ever used.

My skin just drinks it up and loves it. I have noticed a reduction in wrinkles and brighter skin. It has a slight scent of rose which fades as soon as it’s absorbed by the skin.

"Neck and Shoulder Relaxer Cervical Neck Traction Device,Portable Chiropractic Pillow, Neck Stretcher,Neck Massage Pillow for Relieve TMJ Headache Muscle Tension Spine Alignment",[],[],,3.5,23,2051,"I have tried a few different versions of neck traction devices/neck stretchers and have found they all are quite similar with some slight variations in size and design.<br />This one is slightly smaller than others, something that works well for me at 5’-4”. Like the others, it is not soft despite what it may look like. The foam is very hard, as it’s intended to be, in order to support your head and neck and to provide a thorough stretch. There are also some “pressure nodes” on the device which are really just bumps in the foam but are positioned to provide a bit of acupressure and massage while you’re lying on it. Personally, I don’t notice the bumps, but it’s possible they’re doing their job.<br />If you’re new to this type of neck device, know that it takes a while to get used to it. When I first started, it was quite painful, and I managed only a couple of minutes at a time. Now, I use it once or twice a day for about ten minutes at a time. The benefits are immediately noticeable as it relieves the tension in my neck and shoulders that always develops after a day spent at my computer.<br />This particular device, unlike others I have used, comes with a zippered carrying/storage bag, as well as an eye mask and ear plugs. None of these are crucial to the neck traction device, but are nice extras. Some reviewers noted a bad smell when they received their device. I had no such issues with mine.<br />If  you’re looking for a way to relieve neck and shoulder pain without resorting to medication, this is definitely worth a try. [SEP] This one works well for me. It's compact, very easy to carry.  The stretch of neck is very relaxing. Material is good. Thanks for the bonus eyes mask and ear plugs. Fair value for price. Recommended. [SEP] This is a sturdy, well-made neck rest. I feel like it helps me stretch my sore neck and provides some relief. Not a miracle device but a useful tool! I had envisioned using it while sleeping but the instructions make it clear that you are not supposed to do that, and instead use for only 5-30 minutes per day. [SEP] The order comes with one (1) neck pillow. It comes in a nice navy blue travel bag. The pillow is shaped in a V-shape curvature, similar to a whale's tail. The pillow is made out of foam material. It is hard foam and it is really firm. It has bumpy massage nodes to provide pressure onto points on your neck for relief.<br /><br />Ordering a cervical neck pillow was recommended by my chiropractor. According to my chiropractor, my cervical spine is curving the opposite of what it is supposed to be from me being at the computer and phone all day. The pillow provides cervical neck traction for spinal health. It provides relaxing sensation on my neck and shoulder. It alleviates the pain to stretch out my neck and also the curvator of my cervical spine. [SEP] After complaining of neck pain and poor posture, a chiropractor suggested a similar device to me for about $80. When I hesitated, he recommended just using a rolled-up towel. Unfortunately, the towel didn't have the desired effect, so eventually, I gave up. Now that I found this neck traction device, I resumed my activities. As we sit hunched over our laptops all day and develop a bad posture as a result, this device is a must. Spend 10-20 minutes a day, and after a while, you should start seeing results. This neck traction pillow is made of soft-touch yet firm material, and it even comes with an eye mask and earplugs. You can position the device in different ways to increase or decrease the stretch. Overall, I am happy with this product and would definitely recommend it. [SEP] This is a very well made neck foam pad that helps stretch out your neck and relax those tense muscles and nerves. I've used this a couple of times when I feel that my neck is tense and I definitely can feel the difference right after. You rest your head on it for about 5-10 minutes and you can feel your neck relaxing. The only thing about this product that you must be careful with is resting on it for too long because you do start to feel a tingling and numbing feeling on your neck. I think that using it in moderation and monitoring your time on it definitely helps. The item itself is very durable but soft enough that it won't feel unpleasant to rest your neck/head on. The instructions say that you shouldn't use it to sleep and that makes sense since after more than 15 minutes on this, you do get a numbing sensation. I would definitely recommend people with neck pain or soreness to give this a try. I hope my review has been helpful for you today! [SEP] This pillow has a very unusual rolled shape and I'm sure it has its purposes and it looks very cool, but it doesn't work for me. the pillow is too hard and too uncomfortable to use, at least for me, I don't know if this type of pillow need to be so hard or not but I can't adapt to it, every time rest my neck on this pillow I feel more not refreshed or I feel is doing nothing, I may be using it wrong but no matter how I use it it never helps me, it may work for you, not for me sorry. [SEP] I have a very physical job and then I come home and am hunched over my computer. The older I have gotten I noticed more and more stiffness in my neck. My friend who frequents the chiropractor suggested this. I am so glad I found this. It HURT the first handful of times...actually to the point I felt I was doing more harm than good. I am glad I stuck with it because now it is the only thing that truly helps. Glad I found this...and for way less than the chiropractor's office! [SEP] After trying the cervical spine pillow as directed for a week consistently, I have begun to notice that my cervical discomfort has decreased and can even detect some realignment along the rest of my spine. The “pillow” is really more of a firm piece of foam with nodules and curves, and it is meant to use as a rehabilitative aid for those with cervical spondylosis (text neck) caused by bad posture which compresses the nerves of the cervical spine. The instructions noted that there will be some discomfort during initial use, such as tingling, aching, and numbing in the area, all of which I felt, but after continued use, I can feel the relief it is intended to bring. I especially like the complementary accessories it comes with- a carry bag for the pillow, earbuds, and nighttime eye covers. The only drawback I noticed is the poorly written instructions, that although intelligible, should not have so many grammatical errors as it can potentially lead the user to misuse the item. [SEP] We did not have any issue with smell as other reviewers have mentioned. My daughter suffers from tension headaches from tight shoulder, neck and jaw muscles. She really likes the gentle stretch and pressure on her neck and cervical spine that she gets from this device. She also really likes that it can be used in the comfort of her bed or on a firmer surface, like the floor. The different surfaces give her a different experience with the device in place. She recommends this device for people suffering from neck tension. She feels it has provided her with some relief, and it just feels nice.",3,True
"Teeth Clean Tools Kit, OUZIGRT Teeth Whitening Kit For Home & Pet Oral Use",[],[],,4.1,23,2054,"This set of dental tools comes in a metal case and includes six different tools. Four of the six are scraping or pick tools, one is a mirror, and the other a large tweezers. I’m not a dentist or hygienist and honestly I have no idea what to do with several of these tools, including the tweezers??, but the scraping tools work very well for my intended purpose which is to clean my teeth between dentist visits. I don’t like the feel of plaque and tartar building up on my lower front teeth, and with these tools, I can gently remove some of it to keep my teeth feeling clean and healthy. The tools are weighty, made of quality stainless steel, and for a non-professional like me, are perfect, especially given the low price. [SEP] I previously bought a small set of dental tools to use at home for removing plaque between my routine office cleanings. I ordered this set on a whim and I’m so glad I did. It is so much nicer than my old set! Each tool is very sturdy and is longer than any of the tools from my first set. The ones I’ve used so far work quite well. It would have been nice to have included some instructions though because this set comes with a lot more than my old one (which only had two tools plus the little mirror). I’m not sure what some of these tools are for. I’m sure they all have a specific special purpose, I just don’t have any idea what some of them are. This set comes in a nice case for storage or travel. I’m definitely glad I decided to get these. [SEP] We’ve been avoiding going to our normal dental office this year due to the health situation so I’m the one making sure everyone in the family have a clean teeth. This is just like the others I have used in the past. The quality is better than the plastic handle though so that makes me happy. Some items I really don’t have a use but the picker and scraper are the ones I use most. Easy to clean and sanitize after each use. The mirror is just ok, luckily I have a better one that have lights on so that makes it easy for me to clean our teeth.<br />Best use after flossing and brushing imho. [SEP] This set of OUZIGRT Calculus Remover Dentist Hygiene Instruments comes in a very impressive portable hard shell case which is durable and easy to open (that also stays closed when closed) .<br />Scrapers, picks, magnifying glass, tweezers -- are well-balanced and they all fit nicely and dexterously in my hand.<br />I would feel a bit clumsy if I were using this on my pet (or myself, for that matter) because I would have no idea what to do and certainly would not want to hurt the little critter - or myself. But they certainly look like they are more than able, in the right hands, to effect a thorough dental examination.<br /><br />However, I have a wonderful use for these very durable and well-made tools. I am an ardent model car builder -- and these picks make me very happy -- they are absolutely great at making little modifications, cutting extra pieces of scrap plastic from the edges or doors, cleaning up indentations, and the like. The length and the balance of each one of these tools make them predictable in tight places and very ergonomic. Once I'm done for the day, a little cleanup with a slightly damp rag, then a quick dry -- and everything goes back into the sturdy case, ready to be used over and over again. [SEP] I used this to clean my teeth daily and It’s so easy to use and cleans great. [SEP] Good sturdy metal. The mirror is attached securely. You will have to run the mirror under hot water before using in order to prevent it from fogging up. You get exactly rwhatbis pictured in the listing photos. The case is made of a tin-type metal. All items were easily sanitized by me before use. How do I use it? I have no idea. Lol it doesn’t come with instructions. I did google how to use them but I’m thinking maybe I don’t have any tartar because when I attempt to play with it, all I feel like I’m doing is scraping the actual tooth? I dunno. I don’t think that I, personally, need this as I go to the dentist regularly for cleanings BUT if you are someone who doesn’t do that..this may be perfect for you. Also, if you have a pet with disgusting tartar, like my little guy has..this would be super healpful if he lets you use it on him. FYI! Be gentle with your pets teeth. Only gently scrape off what you can get to easily. You could totally cause a major infection if you use this improperly. Maybe bring the kit with you to your vet and ask them how to properly use it on your pet. [SEP] We already had a similar set of these that we use for cleaning our dogs' teeth... we liked them so much, that we decided to get a set for the humans in the family. These are of similar quality, ie. good enough to last for years without any real damage. The case on this set is a bit sturdier and it holds the tools well.<br /><br />I am rating this four stars, as it is a value at less than 13USD. As always, your mileage and preferences may vary... [SEP] I had a friend who was a dentist and he gave me old tools when he was replacing them. These are not close to the quality of real tools. But I used them for various projects around the house and these are good enough for that. The most frequent tool I used was what I called the poky think - the sharp, curved tool that  is used for scraping off plaque and other junk. The set will continue to help me get into small areas, push release levers, etc. I would run of I saw my dentist using a set of this quality, but for home use it is fine. [SEP] I tried to order a set of nice dental instruments several years back, and ended up ordering so cheaper plastic junk to substitute.  I wouldn't let me order unless I sent proof I was a dentist, hygienist, or student of same.  I guess the pet designation or another policy change allow me to get them now.  I wanted the mirror especially, but I also like to carefully scrape the scale from my lower teeth.  I brush and floss frequently, but it still builds up on the gum line of the lower teeth.  Since I think the scale is calcium transferred by the tongue, that makes since that it would tent to build up there.  I also like the mirror to keep track of a dormant cavity that I don't want to become active again.  I had it filled once, but on the location it sits, the fill fell back out.  Nice professional set, and I suppose it works for pets too, but take care you might get bit if you don't have the trust.  Recommended. [SEP] This is a sturdy set of stainless steel tools that are designed to last.  I ordered them primarily to use for touch-ups in between dental appointments.  These are professional tools, although they seem a bit smaller to me.  I don't know that I would try to use them for my dog... there's a reason that the vets give them a tranquilizer before dental cleaning.<br /><br />This is an item that won't appeal to everyone, but if you're looking for a sound set of dental tools at a reasonable price, this is a winner.",3,True
"Mamlyn 3 Ply Breathable Cloth Face Mask, Reusable Washable Adjustable for Men and Women (Two Masks)",[],[],7.99,4.2,61,713,"This has been one crazy year. We have all had to get face masks or learn how to make our own. Thanks to COVID this has become a common day task that we wear these at work or out and about on errands and such. For some tasks I prefer wearing washable cloth masks and for others I prefer using a disposable type. At work we are only allowed to use the disposable N95 type masks but thankfully those are supplied to us.<br /><br />When I run errands or in my personal life I prefer to wear the more comfortable and reusable cloth masks. In this pack you get 2 black masks. In addition you get a storage pouch for when you are out and about to keep your mask in. You also get a pouch to wash your masks in. This is a nice set of masks that is very comfortable to wear. It fits very well above the nose and under the chin.  This one is very comfortable and fits well. The cotton is very soft and comfortable to wear. They have a metal clip on the nose to make them fit better. They also have adjustable loops to make sure the masks stay put and fit well. All int all this is a good mask that I like to wear quite a bit. At $15 this is not a bad price at all plus you can use the accessories for any of your other masks really. [SEP] This is a decent mask as far as I can tell.  Once you put a filter in it's thick and it's pretty comfortable to wear. [SEP] I prefer paper masks for breathability and fit, but these masks fit fairly well around the bridge of the nose (with a little bit of fussing), and have the added plus of being washable for repeated uses. [SEP] I can't wear this at work because I need to talk all day and it is way too muffled for me. However, it's great for going to grocery stores or other places where I don't need to talk much. It does fog up my glasses... and it does feel a bit difficult to breath, but no more or less than other thick cloth masks especially with filter in.<br /><br />I machine washed it in a bag and tumble dried low, and it's still perfectly okay to use. I would recommend this. [SEP] This mask is made of good quality material. It is sturdy and has a nose wire, perfect for me because I wear glasses! It comes with a mesh washing bag and a smaller black carrying bag. They do have a pocket for a filter. My ONLY issue is that the inside of the mask is white! That’s the only thing I don’t care for, because my makeup rubs off on it! But overall the mask is great and I recommend! [SEP] Mamlyn 3 Ply Breathable Cloth Face Mask, Reusable Washable Adjustable for Men and Women, Mask Wash Bag, and Pouch to Store The Mask<br /><br />These are actually pretty standard masks.  They have adjustable straps, a nose bridge wire and a filter pocket.  They are a bit thin though as far as I can tell, they do have three layers as described in the product information.<br /><br />For the price, there are two individually wrapped masks included.  What sets this product apart from the huge number of masks that have shown up on Amazon in the last few months is the extras.  They include a mesh bag to wash the masks in a washing machine (delicate cycle only) and a carrying bag.  And the mesh bag is actually good quality and large enough to fit more than a few masks in.<br /><br />Though the masks have a filter pocket, they do not include filters.  They take the standard PM2.5 filters that are more and more available on Amazon.  The filters slide in easily and stay put.<br /><br />The instructions on the back of the mask package are kind of silly.  They were obviously written by someone who doesn't have English as a first language.  They are hard to understand, to the point of being nonsensical, and even use the word poison.  By poison, I think that they mean any contaminants that are picked up while you're out and about.  Anyway, it's a mask.  Wash it like you normally would.<br /><br />For the price, this is a great deal.  Especially with the extras. [SEP] These mask fit well and are adjustable.  About as comfortable as any cloth mask I have worn to date.  As for the storage bag, I have never used it and probably never will.  Just one more thing to have to keep track of, and I just stuff the mask in my pocket when I am not using it.  Nice idea, and I am sure that some folks will appreciate it, but I am not one of them. [SEP] Great fit. The thin wire embedded in the top really holds the shape, easy to restore shape after a washing. Love the mesh bag supplied for machine washing. [SEP] These masks fit well and are more comfortable than any I've used thus far. [SEP] Very happy with my purchase , comfortable and we'll made. I always hand wash my masks and hang to dry .",3,True

[SEP] I love the shimmering iridescent look of these small ziploc pouches. They are great for storing earrings, Barbie shoes, little knickknacks, etc., and keeping them organized. Because they are ""smell proof"" you can even use them to store spices or tea leaves. They are definitely good for flea market sellers who need small pouches for their wares. They are pretty in their own right. Overall I'm pleased with the quality of these versatile pouches. [SEP] Nice, durable bags that work perfectly for packaging bath salts!  They are the perfect size for what I needed. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:152e3e3a0e38d09ca0dfcf2dccb2ee2c]] I love these holographic storage bags. I use them for shipping stickers to customers and friends and they are so perfect for that. The quality of the bags is great and the holo effect is absolutely stunning! The bags seal perfectly the size is great too. [SEP] These bags work great. They're nice and thick, unlike Ziplocs that can tear easily. You can put all kinds of things in these bags. They are most certainly smell-proof. Overall, good product. Would select again, if needed. Love the cute holographic colors. [SEP] I love these mylar bags so much! They are tear resistant, durable, and so pretty to look at. We've been using them to actually seal up small gifts over the holiday season, and they've worked very well for that purpose. These bags are sturdy enough to hold multiple items and the mylar is thick enough to resist puncturing as well. For gift packaging purposes, these add a unique and beautiful touch. I am very pleased with them. [SEP] I freeze dry a LOT of grab and go snacks and have tried many brands of packaging and these are awesome! I was very pleased by the thickness of these bags. They seal well and don't just melt immediately in the impulse sealer. I use a 50cc oxygen absorber with this size bag.<br /><br />I also appreciate that these do NOT have a hanging hole at the top, because  when they have the hole at the top, it prevents you from sealing the bag all the way across 100% to keep the air out. So these work well for food.

Dr Pen M8 - Microneedling Pen 0.25mm Electric Auto Microneedle Derma Pen with 5 Pcs 16 Pins Cartridges,[],[],,4.1,36,4620,"[[VIDEOID:237846475a1963f8e8b0abd9b8137146]] I debated giving this 3 stars because of its big flaw.  I have another derma-needling  device (made in Czechoslovakia) that has the pen attached to the motor via a cord that fully retracts the needles. That one I am comfortable with doing the swiping motions. I do like that this one goes to 2.5 depth. My other goes to 1.75mm depth only. I got this one because it was on vine and all of these devices are expensive. My other device that I paid full price for now has a 2.5 needle depth but that one is $200.00.<br /><br />Derma-needling is really great for collagen induction and I long ago gave up the derma rollers. Those hurt a lot more and typically take longer than a really good dermapen. This pen might take longer than my older device though because I don’t feel comfortable sliding it over my skin.<br /><br />Let’s start with the pros:<br />Rechargeable battery<br />Cordless or wires operation<br />Light<br />Easy to hold<br />I actually like the twist for depth needle depth selection<br />Multiple speeds<br />If you use it as a stamp you might be able to get away with less or no serum for the “slip”. Can just put serum on afterwards.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The big one: needles don’t fully retract so better to use this as a stamp turning it on and off again.<br />It also seemed like it wasn’t a full up and down motion each time (you know, like a jack hammer) but more of a vibrate up and down a little and then up and down a bit more. See my slowed down video with needles set at 2.5mm and speed 1. [SEP] Love this electric microneedle.  It allows even application all over your face with a sanitized needle.<br /><br />I have used a manual roller on my skin for several years, as I am pro dermaroller (I strongly believe there are the extremes on both sides.  My past experiences, both in and out of a salon (I had electric roller in salons) - I disregarded the instructions which looked bad (and other reviews have also affirmed).<br /><br />I used on dry, alcohol sanitized skin, and followed with a serum.  It did hurt a bit, but I also abide by the “no pain no gain.”  My face was a little swollen for about 24 hours, and then slightly red for a few days but other than that, no noticeable difference.  I did not use makeup the entire day and I would recommend waiting until the next day, regardless of whether you do it in the evening or morning - just let your skin sit by itself.<br /><br />Pros to this type of treatment - sanitized, one use roller, quick, depth is consistent.  It comes with it several needles if you wanted to share your machine with a family member, but I do not and I just change the needle each time I use<br /><br />Due to my consistent use of a dermaroller, I don’t expect any mind blowing results as the results take time and consistency to use - much of which I’m already getting.  However, I will definitely continue use.  My goal is once a month (allows my skin time to heal between treatments), although I don’t always make that goal.<br /><br />I have normal to dry, slightly acne prone skin.  I am a white female prone to melasma and hyperpigmentation. [SEP] Dr. Pen M8 is a beast at unleashing intense treatment that softened both my unsightly stretch marks and my cavernous furrows. It not only helped the healing of additional surgical scarring, it hydrated and brightened my complexion. I’m not sure if I’m more impressed by all of its many benefits or the fact I was able to experience its goodness while sitting on my love sofa! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:6431142495bddc01e9fc7986b0833046]] The Dr.Pen at home micro needling pen has 6 sterile tips so you can use it over time, since I used it on my face I allowed 4-6 weeks in between each time session and I use it with a topical numbing cream.<br /> The actual pen works better than most high end micro needling pens, it isn't heavy, it has a digital screen so you can clearly see what speed it is on, and dial adjustable. Overall all this is a very easy product to use and compared to the price to get it done this is more convenient and you can do it from the comfort of you home [SEP] Had to go online and search for directions. You MUST buy numbing creme or you won't be able to take the pain. I have a very high pain tolerance and I couldn't deal with it for longer than a few seconds. My face broke out really bad after using this and I never plan on using it again [SEP] I used this when I couldn’t get in to get a facial because my facial place was being remodeled and it worked great. [SEP] Esthetician Review:<br />This product is definitely not for unlicensed hands. Infact this is a definite profession product. I would not use on my face without trying on arm first. Product does sting after a while I got used to the stinging. [SEP] I got this micro needling pen for my wife. The pen arrived well packaged. My wife loves how easy it is to use, she likes the grip being comfortable. She said to make sure you buy the Lidocaine cream and not to skip the steps in the instructions. Without the Lidocaine, the process will be rather painful. Also be sure to use a hyaluronic acid and vitamin C serum for the best results. To minimize the pain, my wife also stores her serum in the fridge before use. As it was her first time using a product like this, she browsed Youtube to get an idea of how to use it. It took about three days for all her redness to go away. After the redness subsided, she loves how smooth and firm her skin feels. Well, she likes it so much that she already ordered the refill needles. The price of the pen may seem expensive, but it probably could save you a visit or two to the dermatologists. [SEP] My mother-in-law is an esthetician, and I gave it to her for her business. She was looking for a microneedling pen, and I was able to order this one, and thought that she would be the perfect person to test it out. As it turns out, her first few clients that she used the pen on, were my wife and sister-in-law. They always get treatments from their mom for these types of things, as she obviously will not charge them. My wife really liked the effect that she got from it in combination with a hyaluronic acid treatment, as she claims it vastly improved the hydration of her skin, as well as the glowiness of it. I fiddled around with it a bit too, and thought the quality was really excellent. It doesn't feel like a cheap product at all, and watching my mother-in-law use it, seemed fairly straightforward. From that perspective, I think if you're a newbie to microneedling, the learning curve for this particular device is not terribly steep. I notice the technique is to pay attention to one area at a time, while lifting the pen to another area. Never drag, always lift. I think to help gain the most benefit from skin care products, such as serums, microneedling is something that could really accelerate your results. I might even ask my mother-in-law to give it a try on my face, as I'm in my 40s now, and could use all the help I can get, to regain a youthful look. All in all, it's a really high quality microneedling pen, and one that I would certainly recommend.",3,True

The ingredients seem to be a good mix to give me the boost I need. They’re also made clean in and FDA Registered and GMP Certified Facility in the USA.<br />  I like taking a scoop of something and being done but, these are easily portable to just bring the 8 Capsules Per Serving, which is what’s called for, in your pocket, which is what I did.😁 I’d recommend! [SEP] I haven’t always been a huge fan of taking interestingly flavored - overly sweet powder prior to a workout. These capsules are a great alternative for a boost needed to get through an early morning workout.<br />I can definitely say it lacks the focus and pump that I usually get from my other preworkouts but I do like the convenience of the capsule form and the no-stim ingredients. Since I workout in the morning on an empty stomach, I noticed a bit of an upset stomach after my workout which I don’t experience with my other preworkouts.<br /><br />I know that there are a couple factors at play when it comes to supplements and specifically how preworkout might affect each person. I would recommend trying these but I’m not entirely sure I will be buying again. [SEP] This is a non-stim product, but despite the fact that you're not going to get any caffeine jitters (for those lacking the proper enzyme to metabolize caffeine the way I do!) it really does have a solid ingredient profile. I very much like the inclusion of Agmatine Sulfate, Norvaline, Nattokinase, and Stearoyl Vannillyamide. The green tea extract and Nitrosigine are nice boosts. The inclusion I could do without is the sodium -- in fact given how many of us have electrolyte imbalances and favor sodium over potassium, I'd prefer the latter if any were to be included. Very few of us need MORE sodium intake in our diets...<br /><br />That said, the capsules are GOLD in color. My hunch is this isn't super healthy for us, but it certainly feels and looks cool downing 8 golden capsules! Really makes you feel like royalty before you tuck yourself in under the barbell on the bench press!<br /><br />I generally cut the dosage in half and use alongside my main preworkout. It's a nice little booster. [SEP] works well to give you that extra boost during activities and recovery. [SEP] I've tried many pre-workout supplements previously. Most of them contain caffeine or large amounts of B12 but this one does not. The container arrived double sealed and has 240 capsules in the container which are gold in color. This provides only 30 servings per container at the recommended serving size which is 8 capsules! The directions state to use 30 minutes prior to your workout and that new users may want to start with only 4 capsules. I'm not a fan of taking pills and having to take 8 capsules prior to my workout isn't appealing by any means. The capsules are average in size but I'd prefer this to be in a powder format instead. You could open up each of the capsules and put them into a shake instead but I have no idea if that would cause any issues. There are a good mix of ingredients in the supplement which does contain some salt and black pepper. The supplement does work for its intended purpose but I had to lower the rating because of the 8 capsule serving size. [SEP] Stim free so its hard to review but my workouts where good. Good pump and have good ingredients",3,True
Dental Floss Picks - 200 Count JIVWOO Biodegradable Floss Picks Not Broken Eco Friendly Health Professional Protects Teeth 200 Count,[],[],,4.5,84,1174,"These are easy to use, strong and convenient! I like these much better than floss. They are convenient to take traveling . They fit in an empty medicine container and my husband keeps them in that for easy transport and storage. [SEP] These dental floss picks work really well. The pick is pretty sharp so it easily gets into those small crevices. The thread used for the floss is strong/sturdy and doesn't unravel or get stuck in your teeth like some other ones I've tried. These come in a nice plastic carrying case that you can easily throw in your bag/purse. Each case contains 50 dental floss picks. There is no scent/flavor. [SEP] These floss picks are really convenient and travel friendly, I have a box in my car and my purse. They hold up well when flossing, sometimes floss picks shred between my teeth but these haven’t yet. There’s no strong mint flavor which is fine with me. They have a nice plastic curve on the end which you can use in wider spaces to get out food. Having these around has definitely helped me floss more frequently! Great price too. [SEP] The carrying case is very secure and closes tightly. No spillage at all. Very good floss threaders too. [SEP] I love having picks on me at all times.  These are pretty good but I do wish they were a little thicker/solid.  They still get the job done.<br /><br />It is a great price for how many you are getting as well.  They do come in a large travel case which I wish was a little thinner.  It would work better for throwing in my purse but I can still make it work. [SEP] I dont love the taste on these flossers.  They are minty but there is  a bit of an aftertaste  that is a little unpleasant.<br /><br />They work very well.  The floss thickness is perfect and the pick works well.  It comes divided into 4 plastic storage cases which I like better than just having loose flossers in a bag that gets knocked off the counter and some fall out. [SEP] the floss string itself works great, does not shred... the handle part is what feels cheap.<br /><br />i love that it comes with traveling cases for easy packing! [SEP] They may be biodegradable, but they come in 4 thick plastic containers. Defeats the purpose. [SEP] These are too thin. I wish they were the thicker string version [SEP] The boxes are fairly large for lightweight travelers. I'm a carry-on only person, so I will just pull what I need and add them to my regular toiletry case. They are comfortable in your hand, easy to use, maneuver around your teeth - slide easily. The opposite end with the long skinny pick works well too. It's strong enough to get in corners with out breaking, twisting or getting stuck in your teeth. My dentist says floss is better to wrap your tooth, but I've always been a fan of this pick style. I tend to use them frequently and find them easier than a long strip of floss. These work fine and I will use all of them!",3,True

Suggestion, don't purchase this product [SEP] I bought this because I just needed the LED light. The one from Colgate was way too expensive and I already had crest white strips and the pen. This worked out just great. So far after one use for some reason I see my teeth look slightly lighter, not a huge difference tbh since it's one use. The LED was so simple to use, didnt cause burning or sensitivity to my gums or teeth. Would but again, but my concern was that It didn't come packaged.

"Oatmeal Protein Pie Powder, Vegan Oat Based Plant Protein Drink, 20+ Vitamins and Minerals, Promote Muscle Growth (Original Marshmallow, 2.2 pounds)",[],[],,3.1,21,772,"I mixed up some of this today with cold water and milk with some ice cubes.  It mixed very well.  I gave my wife a taste, she is pickier than I am on these things.  She liked it.  We both liked it.<br /><br />I appreciate very much that it is MADE IN THE USA.  I really appreciate the grams of fiber along with added vitamins.<br /><br />The only concern I have is the price to re-order when it runs out.  At almost two dollars a serving, it is higher than the others I drink.  But then again, this one has fiber and I don't think any of my other ones do.<br /><br />We like it and will continue to drink it. [SEP] I wasn't sure what to expect of this protein powder. I've tried many different plant based proteins but never oat. I was a little confused on what the flavor was supposed to be... It looks like an oatmeal cream pie on the packaging, but says that the flavor is ""Marshmallow."" I wonder if it's supposed to be a marshmallow filled oatmeal cream pie? The packaging should really be updated to be less confusing. This definitely tastes nothing like a marshmallow, but it does taste like an oatmeal cream pie! I was actually pretty impressed by the flavor! I blended it into a smoothie with frozen coffee cubes, coconut milk and a splash of my favorite coffee creamer and it tasted like an oatmeal cream pie frappuccino! It was so delicious that my 3 year old kept trying to steal it, so I made her a coffee free version and she loved it. I really appreciate that this is sweetened with more natural sweeteners. That's a big deal to me when I'm shopping for protein powder. Other than the confusion as to what flavor this is actually supposed to be, I'm happy with it and would order this again. [SEP] I so wanted this to be an answer for me. It is overly sweet when using a full scoop. The sweetener leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste. It does taste like an oatmeal marshmallow pie. The first sip is really good. The more I drank the sweetener aftertaste got too strong to enjoy. The flavor is basically good, just that aftertaste that turned me off. On a positive note it did help me feel full for a long time. Next time I try it perhaps I will try a half scoop, maybe won't be too sweet. [SEP] It’s like wasting oatmeal cookies but without the guilt plus protein. It’s a must have [SEP] This protein powder is innovative, something you don't see in this product space very often.<br /><br />I stopped using dairy-based protein powders many years ago. I normally use a vegan blend, because you need multiple plant sources to get a good amino profile. It so happens that oat figures fairly large in my diet. I use oat flour for baking and meal six of the day is usually based on raw oats.<br /><br />So I thought I would try this oat protein powder, with the understanding I would need another plant derivation elsewhere in the day.<br /><br />It has no junk in it. My primary concern was ""the other white powder,"" that addictive, disease-causing drug commonly known as ""sugar"". It's organic and even has some vitamins and minerals added to it. Many people have never tasted organic, unprocessed oats so they associate the flavor of oats with ""bland"". This supplement not only gives you that organic oats flavor (albeit, processed into a powder), it also contains the sweetener erythritol, which is a sugar substitute. The FDA says erythritol is good for oral health.<br /><br />One effect erythritol has in some people is it increases gas and bloating. That was the case for me. Such is my lot in life. So I will use it as a baking ingredient but I won't use it for shakes (thus reducing how much I consume at any given time). [SEP] I like using plant and whey based proteins at different times of the day or sometimes even together.  I like this protein since it has added fiber which helps the drink from being digested too fast so you get better protein absorption.  The Original Marshmallow flavor isn't bad. Different, but not bad. It does have a slight aftertaste, but that's common for sugarless protein drinks. I will usually mix in some yogurt, peanut butter or banana  and that helps quite a bit and also provides extra nutrients.  Great thing is that it has no milk products or lactose so it's nice for the lactose intolerant.",3,True
Workman’s Friend All-Natural Leather Conditioner,[],[],,4.1,29,1742,"I was making a leather folio cover for my brother and accidentally scratched it.  This stuff took off the scratches and make it look great.  Did not remove the dye or anything, just made it look good. [SEP] I'd like to know exactly what's in this leather conditioner but no where on the box or product page does it say.  I'm pretty sure it has a lot of coconut oil in it since it smells like coconut.  It's kind of soft, and doesn't take much pressure to get some on the included sponge.  It cleaned a couple of purses and an old pair of shoes pretty well, but if it's mainly coconut oil I have that here at home for a lot less money. [SEP] This leather cleaner works very well both for shoes and for leather bags.  I tried it on a small spot before using it on the full bag. It was easy to apply as I can control the amount of cleaner. It just requires even application and careful rubbing and it moistens and revitalizes leather. [SEP] This leather conditioner works so well! I have a lot of nice leather purses/bags. I like to keep my bags conditioned and this does a really nice job of that. It comes with an applications pad. It smells good too. [SEP] I bought this for my dad to use on his leather couches. He told me he has used numerous leather conditioners in the past and this was by far the best.

I had purchased some before, they weren't very good, and they weren't cheap either.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this 『Workman's Friend Leather Conditioners』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it comes in a square tin jar, with 4oz (118 ml) of all-natural leather conditioner. Once the lid is removed, you can see a lard-like color & wax texture, so you know this, when applied to any leather surface, it will stick & won't run off the shoe contours wasting valuable conditioner. But, how does it work, especially compared to the ones I had bought from shoe sales clerks?<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />==========<br />  In order to better test this new leather conditioners, I dug out one of my older, but still favorite, pair of leather dress shoes which has been neglected since I ran out of any leather protection solution or cream. I took out a cotton ball, and dipped some of this Workman's Friend Leather Conditioner onto my shoes. After only several back and forth wipes on the surface, I can already visibly see shine, as it really gets into the leather to nourish & moisturize the leather, just like I'd put on night serum to better protect my facial skins. Again,due to its lard- and wax-like texture, it really stays on the surface well, and give off that shine, especially compared to my untreated left shoes (see review  video). I even sprayed some mist on both left & right shoes, the treated right shoes protects the surface well, while water mist left shoes wet.<br /><br />Also, it doesn't just work well on shoes, I tried it on my leather messenger bags, leather jackets, belts, this leather Conditioner really help restore the shines, and give second life, and extend it's longevity.<br /><br />❣️💕💕💞👍 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍💞💕❣️ [SEP] I purchase the leather conditioner for my dressing shoes. I love how it smells so good not like others that has a strong disguising smell to it. The kit comes with a square brush so you can apply the conditioner on. I use it on couple of my shoes and makes it looking like brand new. A good products to make things look brand new again. [SEP] I love this stuff because, I think it’s about equal to my Saddle Soap that I’ve used like forever. This is a product that goes on thick and you really work it in to get a well conditioned leather. I’ve used the liquid forms for leather and they have their purposes but, I can use this type and it will Last and Last compared to the liquid needs to be redone fairly often.<br />  I think this is great quality but, it’s a bit pricey compared to the Saddle Soap I use. [SEP] Was easy to do. Definitely darkens the material which it stated. As I do like the the lighter look better that's on me, but the leather surely looks healthier and less scratched. Over all pretty happy [SEP] This leather conditioner smells like coconut butter and the texture is very similar. I was trying to find the ingredients on the container - but could not find them. I assume this is coconut butter based. It does have a warning that leather might darken with use.  I tried this conditioner on my old leather boots, and it gave a nice refreshed look to the leather. Also, it did soften it a bit. The presentation is really nice - it comes with a sponge in the box, and the metal box container for the conditioner itself. This is made with gift giving in mind. The price for this is quite expensive - but it is nice for a gift.",3,True

[SEP] I like that these contain 10 billion CFU from 4 different strains, and only one capsule per day is required.  There are 14 capsules in a bottle so it will last just for two weeks, making these probiotics kind of pricey at a little over one dollar per capsule.  That said, they didn't upset my stomach at all and I generally feel better when taking probiotics.  They don't contain, gluten, dairy or soy. [SEP] I don't know what it is about this product, but it really upset my stomach.  It caused painful bloating.  It hurt to even touch my stomach.  I've used Renew Life products before & didn't have this problem.  While I've used Renew Life products in the past, I've been using [[ASIN:B0106PG9SA Nature's Way Primadophilus Optima Adult]] because it contains more bifidobacteria bacteria that is supposed to be very helpful for those of us with IBS according to Patsy Catsos, MS, RDN, LD in her book  [[ASIN:0451497724The IBS Elimination Diet and Cookbook: The Proven Low-FODMAP Plan for Eating Well and Feeling Great]].  Optima doesn't cause me any digestive distress.  The capsules come in a blister pack vs. loose in a bottle like this product by Renew Life.<br />We are all unique, so while this made me miserable & therefore gets one star from me, it could be exactly what someone else needs... [SEP] I think they work well but , I feel for the price 14 capsule people getting played. [SEP] Good packaging size and generous dose.<br />If you order this when you are prescribed a course of antibiotics, start it as soon as you get it and take one  day until it is gone (it will last beyond the last day of your meds) to restore the  bacteria that should be there. [SEP] Oh my goodness I am so regular now it’s insane [SEP] I always cringe when I go to the doctor and they prescribe antibiotics.  Because I know I'm basically dropping a nuclear bomb on my gut bacteria.  Gut bacteria is proving to be the unsung hero of the human body.  Having healthy gut bacteria doesn't just help you to digest food easier and be more regular, it can affect all kinds of things including your energy level and mental health.<br /><br />This renew life restore probiotic is really a must after you finish your regimen of antibiotics, or, you can even start before your last day and get a jump start on it.  With 10 billion CFUs it will really help speed up your recovery.<br /><br />This was easy to swallow and didn't provide any adverse side effects.  I would definitely grab some the next time you have to wipe out the beneficial civilization thats helping you to digest and metabolize your food.<br /><br />I would recommend these, they seem as good as any other probiotic I've tried. [SEP] These seem to be of good quality but it is hard to tell for sure how potent this is, I haven't had any problems with taking them but they seem to be pretty much the same as the other probiotics I have been taking. I have not noticed a difference and don't really know if I should since I take these on a regular basis.",3,True
"BRING GREEN Carrot Toner Pad 60ea & Dark Spot Serum 45ml Set - Carrot Facial Clearing Care, Skin Soothing & Boosting Effect, Reduces Red Spots, Acne Relief",[],[],,3.7,24,1625,"I have some sun damage on my face and I was hoping this would help fade that, since that is a feature, but after a few weeks I don't see any change. The pads and serum feel really nice on my face, but there was no coloration change to my complexion. [SEP] This is one amazing complete Facial Skincare System, it conveniently combines a Carrot Toner Pad & Dark Spot Serum. The Green Carrot Vita Toner Pad provides daily treatment for skin tone and texture with moisturizing vitamin pads instead of a toner; this is perfect, as I don't really like toner which often is alcohol based solution. This is an all-in-one easy-to-use toner pad for moisturizing, purifying, and boosting effects. It's also a calming, toning pads made with mild ingredients that's very gentle on my skins. All I have to do every morning and night is, after washing my face, I simply use the pad to gently wipe on the skin!<br /><br />The second part of this facial skincare system is Carrot Vita Dark Spot Serum, it's a whitening and antiblemish treatment with active ingredients that help make my skin bright and flawless. It's so effective because it contains abundant Vitamin C as its active ingredient that helps even my skin tone and texture as well help moisturize  my skins.<br /><br />If you incorporate this into your daily skincare routine, you will find that your skins not only look younger and cleaner, you will no doubt receive many unsolicited complements on your looks! I highly recommend this! [SEP] I didn't know what to expect with a carrot toner/serum, but I'm pleasantly surprised. The toner comes in individual pads that are presoaked. You just pick one up with the tweezers and use it. They're very hydrating and feel great. There is a gentle natural smell to it. It's one of the easier toners to apply since most of the job is done for you.<br /><br />It also comes with a serum. The serum is a tad sticky at first, but also very moisturizing. After a few minutes, it will soak into the skin, and the majority of the stickiness will disappear. You may still feel a little bit of it if you press down on it with your fingers.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin and noticed no issues with this product. My favorite is probably the toner since it is presoaked for you and you can just pull a single pad out when you need to use it. I love the convenience. [SEP] First time trying BRING GREEN products. I’m glad I did! After researching on Korean websites. I’ve learned that this company use nature inspired, nature friendly ingredients.<br />This set comes with a big jar full of moisturizer and a bottle of carrot serum. I have sensitive skin but, these two seem to be working great on my skin too. Overall, I like the value set and the quality of the products. I would recommend trying this set! [SEP] Nice and easy glide on product that has a great feel. I like to use this during the day with my other facial cream. A little goes a long way with this stuff. It's good for your neck and around your ears as well. I can recommend this to anyone that wants to have darker spots look a lot lighter. This stuff works wonders. [SEP] These toner pads are great. I use them as part of a multi step skin care regime. My skin feels smooth and clear after use. Highly Recommend.",3,True

This Watermelon flavor is strong and tastes much better than the mojito flavor. Performance wise it gives me the boost I need for my workouts. I can’t say it’s any better or worse as far as the energy boost goes compared to competing products. [SEP] Flavor is the first criteria I review when reviewing energy drinks, and I have reviewed a lot of them.  It's still too much on the sweet side but almost all of them are.  I don't know why they have to be so sweet, I usually add lime/lemon juice to them to cut the sweet.  That said, I play two hard sets of singles yesterday in the hot sun and had my water bottle filled with this energy booster.  I felt o.k. for the most part. Playing in the sun really saps my energy so knowing that I was still going pretty strong towards the end of the match tells me this stuff must be helping. [SEP] My son loved taking this last year and he very much loved the fruity sweet flavors. This was his favorite. He prefers to take capsules now but this is great if you want a tolerable drink. [SEP] This is by far my favorite BCAA energy drink! I use it for pre-workout and for whenever I need a boost in energy and focus at work and school. I feel alert and at maximum brain performance when i use this stuff. Also no need to pay for the super expensive pre-workout I used to take. It helps with recovery and muscle soreness too. Buying this has actually saved me money and lots of sugar and calories, because I used to drink a lot of tea for energy. I will continue purchasing this product until it is unavailable anymore. [SEP] This review is for the Gen One Nutrition- Intramino BCAA Amino Acids Powder (Watermelon). In my house we typically use the BCAA supplements as a post-workout recovery drink. This particular powder says that it is an energy drink, or more specifically an ""intra-workout"" formulation. As such, and given the name ""Intramino BCAA"", it appears that is the core target for this drink. Per the manufacturer, this drink is intended for use DURING your workout, as ""the period in-between the start and end of your workout is the most critical time frame for results.""<br /><br />Honestly, it depends on how you use BCAA's. Some folks recommend consuming pre-workout, some during, and some after. As noted, I've always preferred to consume it immediately post-workout or even before bed to aid in healing and recovery and reduce soreness. In the case of this supplement, I thought perhaps it contained caffeine or something, given the 'energy drink' label. Oddly, I found no evidence of that on the packaging. Nor does it contain sodium chloride (table salt), sodium citrate, or monopotassium phosphate -- all key ingredients of popular hydration/electrolyte drinks. Aside from the amino acids and vitamins, it only contains sucralose (e.g., Splenda).<br /><br />So give that, I really see no added benefit for use DURING your workout vs. any other time. To me, this appears to be in the marketing. And given that this is intended for consumption DURING your workout, I would say ""no thanks"". It just doesn't mix that well, and the taste is NOT ""Amazing"".  It mixes well enough, if your goal is to mix it, shake it, and chug it down. But if Gen One thinks I'm going to sip on this throughout my workout, they need to go back to the drawing board.<br /><br />Giving this 3-stars for ""it's okay."" [SEP] This supplement will long term undoubtedly help the recovery process. [SEP] Watermelon is a really hard taste to replicate in something like this, and there's a bit of an odd taste of the finish, but overall, if you're drinking supps because you're adtually working out toward a goal, you could do worse than this, to be sure. [SEP] This is a lot more bitter than I would prefer for taste... Its bearable though... I typically mix/shake powders like this with warm or room temp water so the powder dissolves quickly... You can also drink it quicker, but with this I added a bunch of ice and drank it down with a straw...  that helped improved the taste. This is not the latest and greatest I have tried, but its not horrible either. [SEP] The supposed benefits of this powder, when to use by comparison to other powders is a lot to handle. I'm no expert, but I think the instructions to drink during a workout instead of before or after as I'm used to is solving a problem I didn't know existed or a problem I didn't need solved. The drink itself clumps pretty badly, but that is about par for the course in my experience. It is also VERY sweet. [SEP] I took this powder to hopefully enhance my workouts but much like the other powder I took from Gen-One[GenOne Nutrition- Oxy Lean Keto-FX- Ketosis, Ketones for Ketogenic Diet, Supports Energy Boosting, Endurance and Focus, Delicious Taste (15 Servings) (Fresh Berries)] I did not like this powder and reacted the same from the OxyLean Gen-One powder. Very clumpy, cloudy water that I didn't feel enhance or give me the energy I needed to improve my workouts. However, the taste was better than the Oxy-Lean mixed berry. I had the watermelon and it tasted ok, not good but not bad.<br /><br />I don't normally take any pre/post workout drinks/powders and this powder is the main reason. I feel it doesn't taste good and doesn't work. I would not buy this product nor take it any longer.",3,True
"Grenera Organic Turmeric Tablet, 240 Tablets - Uncoated, Chemical Free Tablets | Organic, Vegan, Kosher",[],[],,4.5,17,664,"First time I’ve ever taken a tablet vs capsule and I really like it! Easy to swallow and provides 700 mg turmeric/tablet. The tablets are much smaller than a penny and fit inside my pill box neatly. They do smell like what they are! Which I like and makes me think they are fresh and active. That said, even though they smell spicy, my tummy has never had an issue with them. 240 in each bottle makes this an excellent value! I love turmeric and the pain free life it allows me to live! [SEP] What I like about this product:<br />- organic /non-gmo<br />- you could break the tablets in half<br />- easy to digest<br />- no flavor burps<br /><br />Cons:<br />- tablets are large if you don't break them in half, not ideal for those who have a hard time swallowing pills<br />- unsure if these contain curcumin. The bottle says curcuma, I don't know if they are the same thing or different but I specifically take Turmeric Curcumin with black pepper. [SEP] I love turmeric because of its anti-cancer and antioxidant properties and this one does the job well because it’s pure and organic with 700 mg of high quality Turmeric per tablet. It also contains black pepper extract that increases the bioavailability of the Turmeric.<br />I only wished the shape of the tablets was different to make it easier to swallow. [SEP] I  am  a believer in the in the benefits of tumeric and so are my joints. Appreciate the savings of these tabs over the capsules offer out there while.reciving the benefits of tumeric [SEP] I find these tablets small and easy to swallow. I find large capsules make me gag and get stuck in my throat. 695 mg of tumeric plus 5 mg of pepper extract makes it very bioavailable. [SEP] I got these as replacements for the gummy’s I had. To be honest I prefer the gummy’s, but that’s Just what i prefer as I hate swallowing pills. These capsules are not too horrible. They are large but the capsule helps it go down. The taste or smell isn’t horrible. Haven’t really noticed a difference yet but I also don’t get too bad of inflammation. All in all these are easy to take. [SEP] I wish this were a bit higher dose, as I'll need to take two of them, but that's not a deal breaker. A close friend talked me into taking turmeric when I was desperate due to having been knocked down my two humongous Standard Poodle boys (76 and 89 pounds) who decided to play bowling for humans one day and added bruises and pulled muscles to my chronic pain. I was dubious, but I tried it. That was my introduction to how much turmeric can knock down aches and pains. It worked better than Tylenol and hydrocodone. And it had a lot fewer side effects.<br /><br />Since then, turmeric has been one of my go-to supplements for pain relief and it has helped me to fight inflammation for the several years. I’m expecting this brand to perform as well as the others that I’ve used, and I will come back and amend this review if it doesn’t.<br /><br />As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart.

Bought similar products about 2 years ago from Amazon but different manufacturer & sold separately- broke in a very short period of time!! This 1 is great quality & was a spectacular price for the cmbo!combo!! Quite but does a great job!!! [SEP] The toothbrush is to small it fits my mouth like a child’s toothbrush! The water pick is like a shower head! It sprays water EVERYWHERE [SEP] Pros: flosser is easy to fill; comes with charging USB wire; nice narrow stream from two separate attachments. Toothbrush feels like a professional cleaning. Cons: must use my own USB wall plug as this didn't come with one; difficult to change flosser heads if you share the unit with a family member; toothbrush is awkward to charge as the bottom has a cap forcing it to lay on side to charge. Otherwise I'm happy with purchase and will keep it. [SEP] Be careful using this if you have fillings in your front teeth as they bond the weakest. I unfortunately knocked out the fillings in my front teeth while using this, though I plan to continue to use it. [SEP] I got this Nicwell flosser and toothbrush set to use when traveling. I’ve used the set for two week long trips and my overall experience has been positive.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Both tools are not too bulky, making them great for traveling<br />The toothbrush uses a usb-c charging cable<br />Includes 4 toothbrush heads and 4 nozzle tips for the flosser<br />The toothbrush has 3 operation modes: clean, soft, and massage<br />The battery life for both tools lasts a long time. I charged both tools before leaving for my trip and did not need to charge them during the trip.<br />The toothbrush uses the same head as sonicare toothbrushes<br />Toothbrush has the expected power and speed for a brush in this price range<br />The flosser has 4 modes: normal, soft, pulse, custom (allows you to set the water pressure level)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Flosser uses a proprietary charger<br />It's hard to fully empty and dry the reservoir for the flosser.<br />The toothbrush and flosser use different charging cables, which is a hassle when traveling.<br />Neither tool comes with a case [SEP] No charger block. ""Directions"" to charge are very vague. Am currently on phone w/Amazon Customer Service to return. [SEP] I've been reviewing quite a few Chinese Water Flossers & Electric Toothbrushes lately.<br /><br />This one is the most powerful other than my old Philips Sonic Care. 3 brushing speeds.<br /><br />Toothbrush: Much more powerful than any other Asian brand I've tried. Came 3/4 chraged. Uses a standard USB cable (provided). Really only  complaint:<br />1. The bristles could be a bit softer,<br /><br />Water Flosser:<br /><br />Again, the most powerful one I own. Several speed settings. This did include all 4 different syled heads, I tried out the ""normal""/standard one. Worked well.<br /><br />3 issues:<br /><br />1. As we move into an era of USB powered devices, it is really getting frustrating that there are so many proprietary cords. I often can't find the right cord, and as they all plug into a USB charger there is no reason for this. I had an identical looking cord that didn't fit.<br /><br />2. On first use, the water had a chemical flavor.<br /><br />3.  The charging port (the unique style, kind of like a razor but barely different sized) has a rubber cover for safety. I could not get it back on the unit after charging, so I am just leaving the charging cable plugged in. At least I won't lose the cable that way!<br /><br />To sum up, if the chemical flavor goes away, this will be my go to Flosser. I would like to say similar about the tooth brush, I need to watch the impact of harder bristles carefully the first couple weeks. I also can not find replacement brush heads for sale, which if not remedied would cause a fairly short period of the toothbrush being useful.<br /><br />I will increase the review to 4 stars if I can find replacement toothbrush heads & if they are affordable [SEP] Use the toothbrush and pik in the shower!  They work great - I am very satisfied with these products! [SEP] This is a perfect duo for your oral health. I haven't heard of Nicwell before, but the set has worked well for me. The water flosser is a great size and easy to travel with if you'd like. The toothbrush comes with four brush heads and the flosser has a few different attachments for what you'd prefer. The flosser does have some good pressure to it, so be careful when you first start using it or you'll get some bloody gums. [SEP] I tend to like things matching, so Im pretty grateful my water pick and toothbrush are a matching set now. They both work like any other similar item, except the toothbrush only works with vibration, and Ive seen others that spin too.<br /><br />Its really neat that you get a few refills for your toothbrush and a few attachments for the pick. By the way, you can get another 4 replacement heads on their store for about 11 bucks (under 3 bucks per brush, which ends up being cheaper than regular brushes).<br /><br />I have one big problem with the toothbrush (and I wonder if its common on all, since this is my first electric toothbrush ever) the toothbrush vibrates quite hard and it generates the following problems:<br />1. If you remove the brush from you mouth while its on, itll sprinkle toothpaste all over the place<br />2. If you accidentally get the plastic part near a tooth, itll rattle and hurt a bit<br /><br />I know there are vibration settings, but I havent tried to figure it out yet, either way, I doubt the problems change much if I manage to lower the settings.",3,True
"JJ CARE Gauze Rolls [Pack of 30], 4” x 4.5 Yards Flexible Gauze Bandage Roll, Individually Packed Rolled Gauze, Breathable Gauze Wrap for Wounds, with Medical Tape",[],[],,4.4,313,2282,"what I like about this gauze is that is is soft, stretchy and goes on without much fuss unlike standard gauze which is not soft, not stretchy and falls off while you are trying to wrap it and you cuss a lot as your wounds weep or worse bleed and you have to start all over again and then you just sit in a pile of crappy gauze crying in frustration.<br />But not this gauze.<br />Also, very nicely priced. [SEP] Though these gauze packs are non-sterile and a bit thin, they're still a decent deal at this price point for backup use (emergencies, disasters). I wouldn't use them in my main first aid kit for my home or car, but for my backup kits and emergency bugout bags I'm okay with taking the chance on non-sterile gauze. [SEP] I like having medical supplies for my prepper kit and I found this to be an excellent value. I like that they are individually wrapped and they are a good quality gauze. [SEP] These gauze rolls are non sterile which would be fine if they were advertised as such.  Nowhere in the item description does it state this.  Only by going through all the pictures when you see a packet of gauze can you see it says non sterile on it.  Now I would never use a non sterile gauze on any wound that is the slightest bit an open wound.  This is not really the type of material you would use to heal a sprained muscle or the such either.  I just really find it deceiving which upsets me.  If they could be used comfortably on open wounds they would be great.  Make sure they will suit your needs. [SEP] This is an excellent package to add to your medicine cabinet. If you go through a lot of gauze like I do, this 30-pack is the way to go. It's absorbent, comes in small enough bundles to be easy to work with, and it's latex free. The enclosed tape is a bonus for securing bandages into place. I particularly like that the rolls come individually packed. Much more sanitary for future use that way. Don't want to handle the gauze before absolutely necessary. Recommended. [SEP] I'm currently in the middle of addressing some modest wounds on one of my legs and was excited to get the chance to try out this JJ Care Premium Gauze Roll 30-pack.<br /><br />These arrived nicely packaged. Each roll is individually wrapped and is 4"" wide by 4.5 yard long. The promised roll of free medical tape was also included, though it's a mere .5"" wide and certainly wouldn't be a factor in my decision-making regarding this product.<br /><br />These gauze rolls are noted as being longer and thicker than many rolls. They also are noted as featuring breathable gauze. They are noted as 100% polyester and free of latex. I appreciate that JJ Care mentioned the latex free feature as I do have a latex allergy.<br /><br />The first time I used a gauze roll I actually applied it myself. As a paraplegic with somewhat limited fine motor skills, this can be difficult. I found these gauze rolls to be flexible and I was pleasantly surprised with how easily I could wrap my own wound. I was a little disappointed with the overall thickness of the gauze as I could easily poke a hole through the gauze and had to be ultra-careful to not do so. This ended up also being true when a friend of mine helped me wrap the wound as she also was pretty easily able to poke a hole through the gauze simply by trying to apply it.<br /><br />Overall, however, I was pretty easily able to adapt to the thickness issue and I don't necessarily think that's wildly different from other gauze products including name brands. I actually expected much worse considering the price point here and was pleasantly surprised by the product's performance.<br /><br />The gauze adhered to my skin without sticking to my wound. It also was able to wrap around my bandage and firmly hold my bandage in place. I'm not quite willing to call this a 5-star gauze roll set, though I'm quite impressed by it and it easily performs better than I expected. There's no question I'd purchase it again.<br /><br />I really like that these are individually wrapped, latex free, and 4"" in width. It ideally meets my needs and definitely has me looking at and exploring other JJ Care products. These are much more durable than I expected and they are definitely a quality, affordable addition to my wound care needs. I've purchased these twice and I've been happy both times. [SEP] Since I am a kennel technician, I like to use gauze for ear cleaning. I purchased this for my personal pets, and it works great, even if these are not the ""proper"" gauze to use. You just simply cut as many pieces as you would like. These would also work amazingly for serious/minor injuries. It is very, very strong and does not tear, even if you pull very hard. They are also individually wrapped for your convenience. 10/10 for me. [SEP] I got scammed!! The ad name states these are sterile. ""JJ CARE Gauze Rolls, Gauze Bandage Roll, Rolled Gauze, Gauze Roll, Gauze Wrap, Gauze Rolls 4 Inch Sterile for Wound Care""<br /><br />I needed STERILE gauze for an upcoming trip. WTF?! I open the package and it states non-sterile on each individual package. I didn't read the fine print, I guess. Plus my other issue is that they do not state the size of each roll. It says 4 inches. Well again, I couldn't find the small print stating that these are not the standard size of 4 inches by 9 yards. No, they are 4 inches by 4.5 yards. Again, WTH?! They ARE NOT a great value. I have to use twice as much. I am very, very, very unhappy. Plus Amazon was 3 days late delivering, so I have no time to order McKesson or real Kerlix as I should have. Don't trust the cheaper ""value"", it's not. [SEP] I found the gauze to be 1 ply and very thin and stretchy, and it damages easily.  It was not too hard to wrap around the wounded area.  I found this product to be passable, but not really great. [SEP] I use this bandage (due to it's stretchiness) as the final wrap to hold a damp fluff bandage, covered by Saran wrap in place on my legs to aid in healing.",3,True

The Zn galvanized my taste buds. I taste Zn for hours.<br /><br />Please don't mix Zn with tasty good Elderberries. [SEP] Elderberry is a very potent anti-viral and I use it whenever I feel the symptoms of a cold or flu coming on.  I always feel good the next day.  I think these elderberry gummies with vitamin C and zinc are very tasty and are an excellent daily preventative to keep your immune system nice and strong. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:d3b8dcc1fb3c3fcbff5f70d06cd760eb]] My wife gave these a try. She said they taste like soft jolly ranchers. They even smell like jolly ranchers. If you like that flavor, you may be tempted to gobble up the whole bottle (don't do that). This is a great supplement for those who are picky about taking capsules. [SEP] I’ve been taking elderberry supplements for just over a year now. After taking another supplement on a cruise and managing to not get sick while my travel partner did made me thing there was something to elderberry, so I’ve been taking it ever since. I had the opportunity to give this one a shot, and I am definitely impressed!<br /><br />This product came well-packaged in an envelope, plastic outside seal and interior safety seal intact. The product label indicates a serving size is one gummy, which has about half your DV of vitamin C and Zinc as well as elderberry. Because single servings of previous supplements I’ve used are two gummies for a serving and have closer to 100% your DV of Vitamin C and Zinc, I opt to take two of them. This yields a 30-day supply.<br /><br />This gummy is delicious! The flavor is berry of some kind and it’s sweet with just a hint of tanginess. I really liked the texture compared to other gummies I’ve tried: it’s super soft and almost sticky on the inside (they don’t stick together in the container).<br /><br />I can’t quite speak to the efficacy of this product because I’m observing strict COVID protocols like minimizing my trips out, social distancing, and masking up, but there is some research showing elderberry does have some antiviral properties and Zinc is known to help fight colds, so I’m satisfied. The price is a little higher than other supplements I’ve tried if you do double up on the serving like I do. That said, I do recommend this product! [SEP] These are just as good as others I have tried.  I think they are a great way to boost your immune system. [SEP] This review is for Wellmo Elderberry Immunity Gummies for Men, Women, and Children - All-Natural Elderberry Extract Gummies with Vitamin C and Zinc for Immune System Support - 75mg of Elderberry Extract - 60-Day Supply. I like to take elderberry to help with immune support. I like that these also have added vitamin C and zinc in them. The texture is good and they aren't too hard or too soft and they don't get stuck in your teeth. They do have a good berry flavor and do not leave an aftertaste. Overall these are a good gummy vitamin. [SEP] These gummies have a good flavor, you will get 60 in a bottle. These only have 75 mg of elderberry in them, so that isn't very much of a benefit.  They are easy to chew and taste good, like candy that is berry flavored. I guess they are ok, but they have a lot of additives.  Not my favorite since it has junk in it, and not much of the good stuff. There are brands out there with a better chew, flavor, and ingredient list.  For those reasons, I'm only giving 3 stars. [SEP] The medium soft Elderberry gummies taste good, but has a stronger Elderberry flavor<br />that's a bit tart, perhaps because this contains less sugar than some - 1.5 g.<br />They don't stick to each other - pour out of the bottle.<br /><br />The three main ingredients of Vit C / Zinc / Elderberry are a start,<br />but not near what many would consider enough for good health.<br />To me this supplement clearly needs supplemented.<br /><br />This is a product of convenience, recommended for men / women / children.<br />Serving - 1 daily = Bottle 60 servings [SEP] I have tried many different brands of Elderberry gummies and these are good if you do not mind artificial ingredients.  The Wellmo Elderberry Immunity Gummies contain Elderberry, Vitamin C, and zinc so they really try to maximize boosting your immunity.  I like that there is less sugar included, however sucralose is one of the ingredients.  There are other artificial ingredients as well, such as ""blueberry flavor.""  If I am taking something to boost my immunity, I want it to be as healthy as possible.  Besides the ingredients, the taste is okay.  It has a sweet flavor that is pleasant.  These gummies are good if you are looking for taste and don't mind artificial ingredients. [SEP] I wanted to make sure I was keeping my immunity up this winter so I started taking these vitamins.<br /><br />They are chewable and the flavor is good. I take one a day and this lasts me two months. It’s made in the USA, which makes me feel good about using this brand.",3,True

The box comes with 3 syringes and ach syringe comes with 10 doses, 1 ml is one dose. The taste is not bad at all, a bit orangey tasting. I usually measure one dose out onto a spoon and swallow it down. The idea is that this form of probiotic leads to better absorption by the body. The more probiotics are absorbed the better it is for the gut. [SEP] Purathrive Is a great probiotic designed to recharge your digestive system, long term. This particular strain had a vague citrus flavor, and the thickness is stuffed with high levels of probiotics, benefiting my gut health.

It has only been a week. [SEP] I like this probiotic, it seems to be very effective. Good quality probiotics can be too expensive so I just use this type of probiotics sparingly and also take the less expensive ones as well.

"HEETA 12-Pack Bath Bombs Gift Set, Extra Large 4.5Oz with Essential Oils and Bath Salts, Perfect for Spa Bath. Handmade Birthday or Christmas Gifts for Gilrs and Boys",[],[],,4.4,73,213,"I love the Heeta brand as I have a detangling brush of theirs that is excellent. Therefore, when I saw these I just had to try them. There are 12 individually wrapped bath bombs in this set in the scents listed below. <br /><br />- lavender<br />- orange<br />- lemon<br />- strawberry<br />- peppermint<br />- coconut<br />- vanilla<br />- grapefruit<br />- ocean<br />- rose<br />- blueberry<br />- mango  <br /><br />Each fragrance is divine and smells fresh and exactly the way it should smell. These bombs are made with essential oils and they are large. Since I personally do not like the color rings caused by bath bombs in my bath, I use them in a foot bath. One bath bomb dissolves in about ten minutes in hot water. The fragrance is wonderful and the results are skin softening. BUT.....I used the rose bath bomb and the final color of the water was an indigo blue which turned my heels and toenails a SMURF BLUE. I also had a blue ring around my ankle. The skin color dissipated during drying but the nail color stayed for several showers. The blue coloring was easy to rinse off the foot bath.<br /><br />The current price of $32.99 comes to $2.75 per bath bomb which is just a tad pricey but then again I feel these are better than others I tried previously. This would make a wonderful gift as long as one does not mind the color changes particularly to the nails. I really love them but only for a foot bath. [SEP] Really good quality, arrived in perfect shape, loved each and every scent in this box! Highly recommend. [SEP] Hated this so so much! It stains the tub & it doesn’t smell good- also not natural ingredients like the box says. [SEP] Given as a gift and was told by my niece that she loved them. [SEP] The packaging is very well done and adorable. This really does make a wonderful gift. Each bathbomb smells wonderful too and the selection has all the favorites, from lemon to lavender. For the price this is a lot of good quality bathbombs, and while not as flashy as some other ones, they’re still very fun to use and good for your skin [SEP] These bath bombs were a wonderful buy, with some interesting quirks. To start, there are plenty of bombs in the pack with lots of variety. The interesting thing, though, is they all smell very similar. They are packaged well in tissue paper and plastic wrap, and none of my bombs were broken. As far as giftability, I would have to break my box into individual gifts. The front of the box says ""Contains Essemtial Oils"", which made us all chuckle. I wouldn't gift something with such a glaring error on the front, but that's just me. The performance of the bombs, though, is nice. It scents and softens the water well, so no complaints there. [SEP] These are wonderful.  I love bath bomb and often they are over scented or just don't do much.  This set is a perfect balance.  The various scents are wonderful and mild.  You don't feel like you are inside a perfume shop.  They are oversized, if you have a large tub one is plenty.  They dissolve very well and didn't leave a chalky film in the tub.  My skin was moisturized and very pampered.  My guy even liked them in the tub!  Presented in a nice box with each bomb wrapped in plastic and additionally wrapped in a paper with a label indicating the scent. [SEP] I love my bath bombs and am always trying new additives for my long soak baths. I absolutely love these bath bombs and I’m pretty picky.<br /><br />Size: They are large at 4.5 oz each. Bigger isn’t always better, but since my tub is large I’ve had better luck with bigger ones. These offer plenty of the good stuff for all the water my tub holds.<br /><br />Water Color: These add great color to the water depending on the bath bomb. The colors are rich and pleasing to the eye. They don’t stain the tub or washcloth.<br /><br />Fragrance: Each bath bomb is a different scent. All of the ones I’ve used so far have smelled very nice without being overpowering.<br /><br />Moisturizing: These bath bombs left my skin feeling smooth and nourished. I could definitely feel the essential oils. Oh, so very nice.<br /><br />Fizz: They had lots of fizz that lasted for a few minutes. I even got a bit of a bubble from them.<br /><br />Clean Up: There’s not a lot of clean up with these. They didn’t leave the tub slick or slippery.<br /><br />Aesthetics: This is a very beautiful set, suitable for gifting. The box is heavy with an elegant design. There is the issue of a typo on the front of the box and hopefully that will be corrected with their next box production.  Each bath bomb is double wrapped. The outer layer is tissue paper with a sticker and the inner layer is the shrink wrapped plastic. The bath bombs themselves are swirled multi-colored.<br /><br />I’m very pleased with these bath bombs as they hit the mark with all the areas I look for. They make for a very relaxing, pleasant bath experience. [SEP] Product did not arrive as scheduled but was still a good purchase [SEP] I buy these for my wife all the time.

I really like these and highly recommend them! [SEP] Review for Handmade/ Handcraft Bath Bombs with Natural Essential Oils, Shea Butter, Sea Salt, Spa-Quality Products<br /><br />My bath bombs arrived in a nice gift box. The box included 6 bath bombs, artificial rose petals and a large pink heart that I believe is another bath bomb. There was shredded paper in the box to dress it up a bit. The entire presentation was nice and ready to be gifted.<br /><br />The bath bombs had only a slight scent. They create a nice amount of fizz when they enter the water. I was surprised how long they take to dissolve. They do turn the water the color of the bomb. I found them to be enjoyable to use and a bit moisturizing. [SEP] Got these for my wife and granddaughter who really like bath bombs. They both really like these because they are handmade and have essential oils and smell really good. They come in a cardboard gift box. Overall they have been a big success. [SEP] great gift for yourself or your anyone you care about.<br /><br />These bath bombs smelled beautiful. The packaging was very nice. These are super fun, didn’t stain my tub, and smell good. they even come with essential oils. Most bath bombs dont come with oils, so it a great bonus [SEP] Very large bath bombs: ""4 spheres"", ""2 macaroons"", ""1 big heart"" and number of red roses (soap)...<br />The spheres, the macaroons and the heart are individually packaged. The red roses are not, but are beautiful decorations within the package. Because the roses are so delicate and the balls are pretty heavy, they got a little smashed during transportation, which was a pity. There is nothing in the package preventing the various items to move around and bang on each other. The heart bomb also got a little damaged because of this.<br />The box is nice, but if I had to give this away as a gift, I would transfer the content in something that is a little less cardboard-y. There are so many things in the box that you could even think of making 2 presents and still have a nice presentation.<br />I like the smell quite a bit as well, but I still have to try the bombs in a bath. [SEP] This would be such a great so gift!! The bombs smell amazing and fizz great and I love the touch of the roses that also dissolve! I’m placing another order!! [SEP] This collection of bath bombs is really nice. The bombs makes the water soft, conditioning, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized. The collection of bathe bombs is also scented nicely. They leave the water smelling great and the smell lasts for a fair time. The collection is packaged well and arranged in such a way to e perfect for gifting. Each bomb is individually shrink wrapped to preserve scent and keep things fresh. Overall, it's a beautiful set. [SEP] My wife said, ""If these things are under 30 dollars, you better give them five stars!""<br />And they are under 15 dollars. In the stores, each bomb would cost 5 dollars or more. These are fantastic.<br />It is a lovely gift set, nicer than those three times as much.<br />You shouldn't have to be rich to have a moment to be pampered and relaxed and these work perfectly.<br /><br />""Spa quality"" is exactly right!<br />Five plus, plus, plus.

The scent is not too strong, at least for my taste and my husbands.<br />however, he worked in the yard putting up decorations and his clothes were a mix of sweat, dirt and i don't even know what.  I did use double dose and not all the dirt came out.  Most of it did, but there were still a few spots where i can see dirt spots.  My husband said it's ok becasue they are his work clothes but for me, i need my clothes clean, really clean.  the sweat smell came out nicely but i don't think this is strong enough for really tough, deep dirty clothes. We started using different things around the house to be eco friendly and this is a really nice way to add to that.  I did have to wash a few things again and i did use my normal detergent and it came out fine. [SEP] These don't weigh a ton and take up a lot of space.<br />At first I thought that the fragrance would be too strong, but it was just light enough to where it didn't irritate my nose.<br />So easy, as easy as a dryer sheet.<br />Cleans well.<br />I had a conversation with a person in the waste management and recycling field once, and it was pretty shocking.<br />I was under the impression that when you correctly place plastics to be recycled, they ARE.<br />Not so. He said that cardboard is, but only a fraction of the plastics in recycle facilities go to the next step.<br /><br />No big plastic bottle for laundry is fantastic. [SEP] I think these detergent sheets would be great for kids living in dorms at school, or when you are taking lengthy trips somewhere. But for home use I'd rather have my big jug of liquid laundry detergent.  I've used several of these and they seem to clean clothes just fine and don't leave any perfume scent behind on them.  However, I have to use 3 sheets at a time since my laundry loads are big.  At that rate, I only get about 10 or 11 loads done and that just isn't all the economical since one box costs $10.59.  I can get a big jug of liquid for about that much money.  All that said, these clean fine, are easy to carry (especially good for those who can't carry much stuff) and don't leave a perfume scent behind.  These would be great for those with a very limited storage space in their laundry area. [SEP] I am not all that happy with liquid detergents and when I first found a detergent ""strip"" that I could tear off of a set of four and throw in my washing machine, I was hoping for a good result.  And they work great!  I saw this one and figured I'd try a different brand and these work great as well!  I love that they are small and non-messy, easily stored and if I was going RV-ing and needed to wash clothes, these are easier to take into a laundromat - don't even have to take the box.  Just grab one or two depending on how many clothes you need to wash (in 1 or 2 machines) - so much easier than dragging around a bottle of liquid detergent or paying an exorbitant amount of money for one of those tiny ones at the laundromat.  Maybe these aren't for everybody, but for me, they work great to clean my clothes and are much easier to store and use. [SEP] I got this thinking this product was a Laundry Detergent Sheet and thought what a great idea. When I got the product the instructions read- 1) Place the color & dirt catcher sheet and clothes into the washing machine adding laundry detergent as normal. Wait I thought this was to replace the detergent. This product is meant to remove stains and smaller particles for a deeper cleaning. I felt like the product was misleading. I have been adding this to my laundry, but do not see the benefit. This is does not replace your laundry detergent. [SEP] I love the convenience and ease of these laundry sheets. If I were someone that used a laundromat, I would be very happy to use these rather than drag along a bottle of detergent every time I went. Even at home, there is no mess with spilled detergent or trying to measure detergent. There is also no residue left in the washer from powder detergent.<br /><br />The sheets do as good a job on my laundry as the detergent that I had been using. I also have not noticed any scent on the sheets or on my clothing when it comes out of the washer or dryer. [SEP] These are great for when you are traveling (eg: going to an airbnb/hotel, etc) where you’ll need to do laundry but don’t know if the place provides free laundry detergent. You don’t want to have to buy a big thing of detergent just for washing 1-2 loads then throwing away the practically full bottle of detergent because you can’t take it home with you. These sheets are so easy to use and so convenient! I gave these a try and I was thinking these would leave white residue on some of my laundry but it did not. These dissolved into the laundry very nicely and my clothes came out clean and fresh smelling. I will be saving the rest of it for when we get to travel again. You just need to bring a few sheets, put it in a ziplock bag - it barely takes up any space in your travel bag/luggage. I hope they come out with different scented ones. [SEP] What a great idea--putting laundry detergent into dryer-sheet sized sheets. I tried these immediately upon receipt and found them to be as good or better than the typical liquid detergent I use. But of course, much lighter and more environmentally friendly.<br /><br />These would be great for travel-- in case you need to run to a laundry mat in the hotel or nearby while on vacation, but I also think they'd be great for people who regularly use laundry mats or community laundry rooms (dorms,  apartment buildings or hotels), who likely get tired of lugging big, heavy bottles around with their laundry.<br /><br />This option is much lighter, uses no plastic, travels easily and is priced well.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't want to take advantage of all of these benefits.<br /><br />The only downside is that these haven't been tested against some of the big names, so I don't know how well they actually clean my clothes. I'm someone who prefers to use laundry detergent that has been tested against a wide range of required uses to ensure it is as effective as possible at getting my laundry clean. Until this product is independently tested, I'll likely never trust it with my dirtiest laundry. [SEP] Some of the things I liked about this product are:<br /><br />-1st: The small form factor takes little space in your storage<br /><br />-2nd:The scent is a bit strong but it works fine for me because when you do bulk laundry it actually spreads out all over everything.<br /><br />-3rd:  These are eco-friendly so you can feel better with yourself as you do your laundry. (If you care about these things. [SEP] Awesome idea. It save a lot of space and water. It works pretty good. I really could buy it again",3,True

Had the countertop been granite, it might have stained it!<br />I have also noticed that my urine is more yellow after taking these than any other turmeric pills.<br />Pills are easy to swallow without any after taste. [SEP] Turmeric is an excellent natural anti-inflammatory. I've never spoken to a healthcare professional who didn't recommend it. In this case, you get 30, 1200 mg servings for under 10 bucks (at the time of this writing). You just can't go wrong with that. Turmeric is an important part of a healthy supplement regimen. [SEP] This review is for OrangeDuzt™ (Original) - Turmeric Curcumin supplement. At time of review this bottle is $8.99, contains 60 capsules and has a 2 capsule dose so each bottle is a 30 day supply for about 30 cents a dose. I love Tumeric as a spice and fresh but it has other purported benefits including as an anti-inflammatory (which is what I like about it). For those who aren't fans but like the potential benefits this is an easy way to take it. It is ONLY Tumeric nothing else like often one might see black pepper. You can take 1 capsule if you're ramping up to the full dose or a full dose is too much for you. I have found no taste (including the Tumeric itself) nor any side effects from taking this version. Recommended. [SEP] I didn't take this for any specific reason other than I heard it's good for you! So I can't say it works for painful joints or what have you. Pills are easy to swallow, not too big. Didn't notice any bad taste or aftertaste. [SEP] I have been using this product for about two years. I absolutely love it. I take it for headaches, muscle aches and menstrual cramps. My mom uses it daily for rheumatoid arthritis pain. It is an exceptional anti-inflammatory pain-reliever, with none of the stomach upset that NSAIDs cause. I substitute Orange Duzt for ibuprofen now - I get pain relief and my stomach feels so much better. I have tried other curcumin supplements before that didn’t do much. My understanding is that Orange Duzt uses a proprietary method, whey-protein binding, for getting your body to process the curcumin (not black pepper, which so many other supplements use, and which does not work well), and as a result, more curcumin actually makes it into your system, which means more pain relief. I really notice a difference when I take this, and I notice when it wears off. This product should be in every pharmacy, right next to the otc pain medicine like Advil, Aleve, and Tylenol. It works just as well and has fewer side effects than any of those. I tell everyone I know about this. [SEP] Before I go into how much I genuinely like this product, be aware that I ordered these Jan 26, 2022. They arrived Jan 31, 2022 with an expiration date on the container of Feb 2022. I began using them immediately, since this is a 30 day supply, and will still have a few that I'll be taking after they technically expire. Since I don't know with all the supply chain issues lately how much of this was actually in the company's control, am not docking any stars for it, but check your expiration date as soon as it arrives. This is a good policy for any product, anyway, but especially these days. Also be aware if you have allergies that this is a curcumin-whey product and contains milk. That being said, I really, really like this OrangeDuzi turmeric curcumin. The capsules are easy to swallow. I like the dose, I like the 100% natural ingredients, and I even like the flip top lid on the container. The addition of turmeric to my daily supplements a while back has made a huge improvement in my chronic back pain, and I definitely appreciate a high quality turmeric product like this one. [SEP] This supplement calls for taking 1 to 2 capsules twice a day. I can't tell if it's working but I haven't gotten sick recently and have been travelling frequently.<br />If you do take 4 capsules per day, the bottle will last 15 days.",3,True

In this package, you get 30 individual ""vials"" of liquid magnesium supplement. While it does have flavor, there is very little fluid so you probably won't taste it all that much (it doesn't taste bad but if you don't like the flavor, don't worry, it's  probably not even enough to make you pucker).<br /><br />This is convenient because you can always pop off a few vials and take them with you. They're  not reusable so you can dispose of them when you're done. Not a bad thing to have around. [SEP] Seems to be helping [SEP] I use magnesium for migraines. I love the packaging. They are so small, I can keep a couple in a bag or pocket for when I need it. [SEP] I have been told by my doctor to take magnisum to help me sleep.  If I don't take it before I go to bed I wake with nerves jerking in my legs.  Since I have been using this magnisium I have had good nights sleep.  I know magnisium works, this is another way to get it.  It is handy before bed or if you are traveling, it would be especially nice.  I am happy to find this product. [SEP] After being told that I needed to up my magnesium, I looked for something other than a pill and came across the drops. This is so easy and I do it as my coffee is perking. I have noticed a difference in my energy levels as well as skin. [SEP] I LOVE magnesium for sleep. It's a guaranteed relaxation aid for me. I've historically used Natural Vitality Calm, which you can get here or at Costco, but I thought this would be fun to try since it's a low effort way to get my fix.<br /><br />Aside from the difficulty of pulling the pods apart, these were everything I'd hoped for. The flavor is decent, and the relaxing effect is quick. Just a squirt under the tongue, and it's sweet dreams 30 minutes later.<br /><br />As with all magnesium supplements, I caution all buyers about the potentials of softer or more frequent bowel movements. But, hey, at least you won't be constipated. [SEP] I have a very hard time swallowing pills, so I am always looking for other options like chewables, lozenges, etc. I was excited to find these to get my magnesium for the day. I take Nexium daily, which hinders your body from absorbing magnesium, so it is essential that I have a supplement.<br />The flavor is subtle enough that you can just pop open the vial and squeeze it on your tongue. You can also sprinkle it on your food or in a drink. This is a good choice for someone who has a hard time swallowing pills. [SEP] These are easy to take and the flavor isn’t bad at all.  They are already pre-measured as well.  You can take them on the go.  Easy, easy!",3,True
"Ionic Hair Dryer, VLISBO 1875W Hair Blow Dryer Intelligent Temperature Heat & Wind Speed Settings Technology, Negative Ion Hairdryer with Powerful AC Motor for Hair Care with Diffuser for Home, Travel",[],[],,3.6,50,2066,"Pro:<br />Works well to dry my hair<br />Appears to be well built<br />I like the adjustments<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cannot think of any !! [SEP] This is a very powerful dryer but didn't make my hair all frizzy like my older dryer does. Has 4 different attachments and comes with a roller brush that is like discount store quality. The dryer itself is very good quality. I love that it comes a drawstring bag to keep everything together  and I can hang it inside bathroom closet.  Very happy with the results it gives me very quickly. [SEP] Wife says it's a great blow dryer. Comes with a diffuser and also a metal  round brush. Works great, really recommend it! [SEP] It shuts off after a few minutes of using and I have to wait a few minutes turn it back on. Not worth it. [SEP] I'm glad I read the reviews before picking this up so I knew to convert the F to C.<br /><br />I like how this product comes with a ton of tools, including a hair brush and the concept behind it is pretty cool... something def different to try. With traditional hair dryers I don't like how sometimes they leave my hair frizzy and fluffy. I was hoping this would not do that!<br /><br />My overall experience with it was that it was alright. I've used it a couple times just to test and play with the settings but honestly I don't really see myself reaching for this because of how complicated it is. [SEP] I like the style and look of this hair dryer a lot. The temperature control is great but it only has one speed. That part doesn’t personally bother me too much as it’s a high speed and my overall preference anyway but I can see it being bothersome to others or for people trying to blow try their kids’ hairs on a lower setting. The power buttons are also on the outside of the handles which I occasionally accidentally hit and turn off during use. The attachments are awesome though. It came with 3, two in which have comb like featured and great for use. Overall I really want to love this. I do plan to use and keep it for myself but if things like speed preference and button placement bother you, this is probably not the hair dryer for you. [SEP] This is the most complicated blow dryer I have ever owned, but not necessarily in a bad way! I keep all my manuals, but this one is a must in my opinion. Like if you accidentally change the temperature units and need to change it back. This is a SOLID dryer. It's not super heavy, but not light either. I really, REALLY love that you can change the temperature in increments because my toddler now lets me blow-dry her hair! My old dryer had only hot and cold settings and the hot was too hot for her. The attachments are solid and sturdy as well. I like the focused air one the best, though I can't speak about the one for curls since I have straight hair.<br /><br />EDIT: I recently discovered that in order to get hot air the setting needs to be in Celsius. The Fahrenheit setting only goes to 99 (I assume because the display only goes to 2 digits), which is only lukewarm. If you switch it to Celsius, you can get hot air. [SEP] This is a nice dryer. It came with several attachments plus a round brush and a velvet pouch. The power is strong. Not overly strong but it dried my thick long hair in about 16 minutes. The heat was also good. Not too hot it burnt my hair but warm enough to dry my hair in a good amount of time. I don’t often use the cooling power but tested it out and it worked well. One of the best features is the size. It’s a lot smaller than the normal hair dryers I’ve used before. I like the sleek appearance of it as well. It’s also a lot lighter than my past dryers.<br />Overall I’m satisfied with this hair dryer. I like how it had the temperature featured and the buttons were easy to use. It would be perfect for traveling as the size is small but it’s still powerful and the heat works great. [SEP] This is such a modern hair dryer so you will most definitely need to read the owners manual to know how the settings work. I am happy with my new dryer. Not only doesn’t it looks pretty but I also works the drying power is great. I love all the attachments for the dryer and round brush that were included as well as the carrying/storage bag it came with, no complaints whatsoever. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ [SEP] [[VIDEOID:ee380563321d6e9804db7abf6001d901]] I have a fairly utilitarian approach to hair dryers: I don't need fancy, as long as it gets the job done well and, preferably, fast. This one may be a bit more than sufficient with its degree-by-degree temperature range from 50° to 90°C (122°F to 194°F; however, temps are only given in °C on the display), hot and cool wind settings, and blower speeds from a light breeze to a light tempest.<br /><br />Note that to turn the dryer on or off you have to hold down the power button for a couple of seconds; when on, a short press of that button switches the wind between hot and cold.<br /><br />The slightly textured matte black surface feels good in the hand, although I found the uncontoured cylindrical handle wanting to rotate in my hand, with the weight of the head only somewhat balanced. It felt heavy enough that my arms would get tired holding it for as long as it takes to dry my long, thick hair.<br /><br />The diffuser has nice smooth tips and the attachments seat securely; however, they could be a little easier to swap out—arrow indicators on the pieces to show when the locking tabs are aligned would be nice. I question, too, how long the plastic locking bits will hold up if heads are interchanged frequently.<br /><br />The set comes with a storage bag and a round styling brush.<br /><br />Bottom line: Out of the gate, a good, rather large hairdryer with highly customizable settings.",3,True

I'm overly impressed with this product.  I enjoyed testing out this product. This is a product that I'd gladly purchase again. I am a satisfied happy customer. I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review. [SEP] Dull after a shorter period of time than another brand, plus there is no inner nail cleaner part. [SEP] Fantastic cut! Leaves no jagged edges! Great buy! [SEP] Sharp with a nice size opening. [SEP] UPDATE: the company contacted me and said they'd updated the clippers and wanted me to try them again. I have agreed and will write a complete review once I receive the new ones and get to try them out.<br /><br />The company owner has been very helpful and proactive with me. He shipped a new set quickly when I agreed to try them. I was very pleased with the small ones, but the large ones were missing an anchor that kept the clipper together. I emailed him and had apologized and immediately sent me yet another pair. These were both in great shape.<br /><br />My husband and I agreed that the improvements were needed and helpful. The clippers are easier to use and cut much better. The do not slip in the hand because of the surface. I am not sure if they are the best clippers, but they are worth buying. I'll keep them and see how they work over time.<br /><br />Original<br />I wish I liked these more. I do like the nonslip interior, but they aren't that sharp. They are also hard to squeeze. I'm still looking for a better pair. [SEP] Looks good on paper however, mine broke in 18 months!!  The pin that holds Two pieces snapped as the welding on retaining pice broke.  It has a life time warranty but not sure how that battle is going to go..<br /><br />Update. No information can be found on this manufacture, Moxycut.  Amazon is trying to help... [SEP] Update: broken. I was happily using the best and most expensive toenail cutter for me ever, until one day it didn't cut anymore, but tear. On close inspection, the blade didn't align anymore. On closer inspection, there was  a small crack in the steel body. I couldn't believe it. Back to the store for a cheap replacement.<br /><br />I used pretty good nail clippers before but couldn't say why they are good. Now I know. I had used hand nail clippers for the toenails, which is not good at all. I had used toenail clippers for fingernails, which is very snappy but not precise. Why I never thought of that?<br /><br />The top part is round and thick giving it strength that should be good. It doesn't wobble sideways easily. It 's sharp enough to cut.<br /><br />Yes, the nail filer is small if you ever use that. But it's a lot sharper than typical ones.<br /><br />One reviewer says the blade gap is too small for his nails. The only reason I can think of is that his nails are unusually thick, a few times thicker than mine at least. Or, unusually' curved. [SEP] These are the best clippers I have ever had. They cut cleanly and are easy to use. Product delivery was on time as promised. [SEP] after only 3 uses, the clipper broke. my nails are not extra hard. very disapointed [SEP] they are clippers, made in the usa, dont feel cheap, they are pretty nice.",3,True

Since I’ve started using Vitamin C serum, when I saw this Vitamin C toner I decided it was time to give toner another shot. It’s been a nice complement to the the Vitamin C serum. The toner feels light on my skin, it has a faint but pleasant citrus aroma, and it does not dry out my skin. I use it after washing my face and before applying the Vitamin C serum. It comes in a spray bottle which is new to me, but that I’ve found I kind of like for ease of application. It seems I’ve found a product to add to my skin care regimen! [SEP] Facial Toner for Women and Men by IQ Natural - Vitamin C Toner for Face - Hydrating, Anti Aging Skin Toner<br /><br />Nice toner. I like that it has vitamin C in it - the bottle is spray on so you don't need cotton balls or pads. The toner is non-drying. It has a very light fragrance that smells a touch citrusy. My face feels smooth and soft after using this toner! I like using vitamin c toners since it really helps with sun damage! 4 stars! Made in the USA! Big WIN! Hope you find this review and pictures helpful! [SEP] This as part of a skin care regimen to combat skin cancer which is quite prominent hear in the SouthEast Coastal area, and I find it to be light and airy yet nicely firming and youthful vigor inducing.<br /><br />It doesn't sting at all and in fact, it is quite soothing.  It is tightening yet comfortably so...  I use it twice a day after washing, before applying vitamin C serum...  It has become quite a pleasant ritual.

Best Earth Naturals Probiotics Supplement for Women and Men Nature's Support for Digestive Health and Weight Loss,"[""During the summer months products may arrive warm but Amazon stores and ships products in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations, when provided.""]",[],,4.0,57,8197,"It's always hard to measure efficacy of supplements like this, because there are so many factors in a person's diet. But, when I don't take probiotics for a few days, I notice a difference. My tummy hurts, my poop isn't regular, my eczema gets bad. Most probiotics work well to get me back in a good state. Some actually make my tummy worse, but very few. These worked quickly to keep me feeling good. [SEP] This is a decent probiotic formula, with over 5 billion organisms, and a mix of proven strains. The price is definitely reasonable for what you get. 5 billion is a pretty typical amount for this price range and should have an impact. If you have digestive tract issues or immune issues, this formula is likely to help. Pair it with some prebiotic product (such as inulin fiber or pectin, contained in apples) and you'll see even better results. [SEP] These pills are easy to take and help with the gut. When I take this, I get less gas and cramping. Probiotics are not just some trend, they really do make a difference in gut health.

"Nitropics Activated Intelligence | Nootropic Formula for Sports, Study and Work | Formulated for Memory Recall and Retention, Focus, Energy, Clarity and Cognitive Performance | 90 Count",[],[],,4.4,21,800,"I'm not totally sure this is helping. This whole pandemic thing has messed with everything but the fact that these are a capsule instead of a powder is a winner for me. I can't stand the taste of most of those things and just that alone is a turn off. I was totally skeptical but while I'm not sure how much of a benefit they are, I can say that they haven't caused any negatives so that alone makes them worth a try. [SEP] Nitropics  is a quality brand compounding interesting ingredient supplements. Nitropics supplements attract top-notch user reviews ... maybe the best in the supplement market. If Nitropics makes it, it's worth a try.<br /><br />High expectations. So far, so good. It will be better than I expected. [SEP] I like this activated intelligence supplement because it has ingredients that I believe help to improve my focus, mental energy, alertness, clarity, and total cognitive function. [SEP] This stuff definitely has some fine ingredients to help get some of my morning fog and sloth out of my way.😁 It’s as advertised too, because it definitely has quite a few of things I often take separately and they in this and mostly with respectable amounts to replace them. It’s Caffeine-Free but, these things really help me get going and my brain to process well.<br />  I’m definitely a fan of it now and would recommend it.<br />  Cons: Only one thing: It’s made in the USA and they say it’s GMP Certified in their advertising, which is important to me and a good thing but, it doesn’t say anything about it on the bottle and it should, especially so I wouldn’t have had to search all over for it. [SEP] I like to experiment with different nootropics, this has many of the ingredients I look for in nootropics. [SEP] I have been feeling just a bit spacey lately and wanted to find something to help me get back on track. I work 13 hour shift so by the end of the day I can get forgetful. I worked my way into taking 3 a day because I didn't want any crazy side effects. I felt my ""fog"" go away within the first week. I actually enjoy getting up and ready for the day now. I feel more focused and alert without feeling jittery. Right now I am taking 2/day first thing in the morning with a full glass of water on an empty stomach. I don't feel sick or anything with them like some other vitamins I have tried in the past. If your looking for something to help you get out of the ""covid brain"" and get back on track, I absolutely recommend these. [SEP] I love checking out products like this, and the best time to test them is when my mind is jumping from task to task!  I have used a wide range of nootropics (note that is product is called “Nitropics”), and each of them has a different mechanism of action.  Some ingredients in some of these supplements actually make me sleepy!  This one does not.<br /><br />What I like about this product is that it contains vitamins and herbs (among other ingredients), so I am familiar with nearly everything on the label.  I decided to try it on the days when I felt that my mind was surveying all of the tasks without concentrating on a single one.  Clearly, many mornings, I just have so many things I am trying to do before a client call, and I feel like I am going in circles between feeding the cats and dogs, preparing my morning shake, getting ready, etc.<br /><br />I did feel like this helped me streamline my focus.  I suppose that much of the time I am looking at the overview of everything that must be completed either before I can actually start my day, and then also at my task list once the day is underway. Apparently this creates overwhelm for me – and that’s in spite of my morning meditation!<br /><br />I tend to take this on the days when I need to have laser focus to get a large number of things done, or when I notice that I am jumping around from task to task and start to feel frazzled.  This product has helped me concentrate on the task at hand as opposed to doing something for 60 seconds and jumping to something else, leaving the other task incomplete.<br /><br />This product is non-GMO and caffeine-free, both of which I appreciate because another supplement I use already has caffeine.  The suggested use is from 1 to 3 capsules, but the serving size for the ingredients listed is 3 capsules.  Because I take other supplements that contain caffeine, I split up the dose, taking 2 capsules two hours after taking the caffeinated supplement and 1 capsule later in the day.  This avoids one product potentiating the other.<br /><br />Overall, I absolutely recommend this product.  It provides quite a number of ingredients, many of which I have researched, so I know the research supports the intended outcome.  If you often feel like your “task list” creates overwhelm (perhaps you are an entrepreneur?!), then find a program that helps you organize your tasks and take a product like this to help you achieve levels of focus to complete those items that you might not otherwise achieve. [SEP] With so much of life shifting to no in person things, it's nice to find something that if I could visit a doctor what I would hope they would have recommended. This product gives me the boost I lost throughout the COVID sludge. [SEP] I noticed a big difference in how I felt after about 1 week of taking these.  Not just physically, but mentally too!  I felt more focused and aware.  Very helpful during the holidays! [SEP] I've been taking Nitropics AI for over ten days now and definitely notice a difference in my concentration and focus. I started with one capsule a day for the first 5 days then upped my dose to 2 capsules with coffee and saw a noticeaable increase in energy as well as my ability to stay on task.

Keep this in your freezer and use as soon as you start to get a headache. The cold plus the blocking out of the light helps so much, it will shorten or decrease the pain of your migraine. [SEP] Fits well on my average sized female head.  I keep it in the freezer for use whenever I need.  I was almost scared to use it for fear it would be too tight but it is not too too tight and the compression feels good.<br /><br />I recently had an 18 hour migraine triggered by sleeping wrong on an old neck injury.  The type of pulsating headache that no amount of changing positions in the bed would relieve the pain.  Light and sound were unbearable.  I cannot take any meds for my migraines so I use a variety of supplements, showers, ice, heat, etc to try and bring comfort.<br /><br /> A nice tool in my migraine arsenal toolbox.  I rotate it out with other things and it helps take the edge off.  With this last ""spell"" this compression cap was just the ticket.  It allowed the pain to numb just a hair and I fell into a much needed mini nap.  That was the beginning of the end of the this particular migraine.<br /><br />No complaints or regrets. [SEP] Don't know how I lived without this cool invention! This will be my favorite item in the hot summer days! [SEP] I don’t usually do ice packs or other related things, but as I get older my headaches and tension get more frequent. This has been a great aide in getting my tension headaches under control and fits very well. I’d recommend trying this if you’ve got similar issues and are looking for some alternative relief. [SEP] After purchasing this headache reliever my whole house came down with some bug (seemed like the flu). All three of my kids plus myself had it and are still recovering. My oldest son specifically during his sickness, hogged this! He absolutely loved it while he was running a fever and had a severe headache. The gel that this is made out of feels cold for a really long time- not like Ice cold but cold enough that he got relief for hours while wearing this. He made sure every night it was good and frozen before bed so he could sleep with it on. My only complaint is that the gel is only in the front and not all the way around like other head wraps. When I have headaches a lot of the time they affect the back of my head into my neck and this doesn’t really help with that. I think the way this is designed does make it more comfortable for sleeping though- which was a huge plus for my son. Overall I would recommend this! [SEP] What can I say, I love this product! It’s refreshing and relaxing. I dont have the chance to use it yet for migraine since it was delivered but I was able to try it and was so relaxing. It provides a cooling relief and comfort, blocks out light and doesn’t have a strong smell. [SEP] I didn’t know this even existed until my sister in law had one and I had to get one for myself. It is a gel flexible, headband really. It’s perfect. I can keep it in my fridge and it not be completely frozen which is great becomes if you’re anything like me, migraines are not predictable. You’ll need this at any moments notice.<br /><br />This truly helps because you can wear it as a headband or it covering your eyes. It works great either way. More so better covering your eyes, but I’m a mom of 3. Sometimes, that’s not an option.<br /><br />Get this!!!!! You definitely need it if you get migraines. It’s the only thing you need.<br /><br />Hope you found this helpful!!! Enjoy! [SEP] Great product. Head compress is nice and has a very soft fabric. You sleeve it over your head for a secure fit and you do not have to worry about it shifting too much or coming off your head if you fall asleep while wearing it. The only thing I would change is if it had a slightly higher nose cutout. Definitely helped with my headache the other day. [SEP] I have headaches/migraines all the time, I use OTC pain relief medications several times a day, they help little or not at all, so I wanted to give this a try. The first day, I used it right out of the box, felt cold and the material is very soft and comfortable, easy to put on and take off, the compression felt good on my head, made me feel relaxed. The second day I used it after leaving it in the fridge for 2 hours, made me feel even more relaxed and sleepy. The headaches and migraines aren't gone unfortunately, but just that compression and relaxation feeling is worth having it on for me and I think I am going to use it every night in bed.<br />Things that I didn't like though is that it is Hard to keep in place if you wear glasses and you are using it during the day. It also doesn't have a removable cover, so I am not sure if it can be washed as it is.<br />Overall, it is a very good product, it is well made and is worth giving a try. [SEP] The mask does offer 360 coverage, in that it wraps around the whole head, but unfortunately the cooling/heated portions are NOT all the way around this! It's the same old, same old and centered at the front...bummer. Also, as others had stated, no instructions included with this. Of course right now the info can be found here, but what about down the line??? It's annoying when product info & care instructions are omitted.

I have 2 labs and 3 cats, so it is important that I use products that are not going to harm them. I like freshening up my carpet, so I figured I would give this a try.<br /><br />For pet owners:  Sprinkle on carpets, wait 15 minutes, vacuum. THEN keep pets off of carpet for an additional 30 minutes after that. I didnt realize that second part is needed until I read the directions. I failed to see that when I was looking at the product description. It is there. So just know to add in the additional time.<br /><br />It smells really good. Very fine particulates. Be sure to follow directions with pets. For added precaution, I am using this in  areas that are well ventilated and not in direct sleeping spots. [SEP] The carpet in my town home is 13+ years old, so it has seen better days. It wasn’t even new when I moved in. And, the management doesn’t offer carpet cleaning anymore (the old one did). They also don’t replace the carpets either, unless you move out.<br /><br />So, naturally I want something to refresh.<br /><br />And, with all the bad things out there, trying to find a nice “good” refreshener is a chore.<br /><br />Seeing this, I thought – “why not” …<br /><br />And, I found out why not.<br /><br />The package is atrocious. The product, despite having a seal, sprinkled out. The seal wasn’t easy to remove, and more product flies out.<br /><br />Let’s talk about scent – if you have a problem with strong scents … STAY AWAY!!<br /><br />Since it is just my mother and I in the household, we have no small kids or pets – we sprinkled this on the carpet.<br /><br />It says to wait 15 minutes. Now, we only sprinkled a small area. But, after 5 minutes, we had to get rid of it. So, we vacuumed it up.<br /><br />THAT MADE IT WORSE! O-M-G!! It smelled like old tuna cans and peppermint! Gross.<br /><br />Effective? I cannot believe any germ would stay around with this. It did lighten the carpet, but I had to toss the rest of this due to the scent.<br /><br />It is definitely not worth the $9.99 it is currently listed as. It isn’t something I would get again or recommend.<br /><br />Now, I need to find out how to get the stench out! [SEP] Not bad for a natural carpet powder. The scent is good, a citrus potpourri scent...Not amazing but clean. Doesn't seem to linger too much or refresh the whole room but does a good enough job with a light dusting. It says kid and pet friendly but requires them to not be around it for a half hour after use.<br /><br />I would give this 3.5 stars, but had to round one way and felt it was closer to 4 than 3. [SEP] We have a fur baby and she sheds like crazy. Even with regular brushing and maintenance. So with that being said, her fur leaves odor and dander all over our rugs. It’s not an awful smell but I prefer not have an as strong dog smell in our home. This carpet powder works okay. The scent isn’t my favorite and a little too strong although will dissipate throughout the day. It’s obviously easy to use and clean up. But the scent is just so fake and perfume like to me and not one I care for so I wouldn’t purchase this a second time.",3,True

I will just pay the higher price for a product that actually works and does what it says it will do. [SEP] BE CAREFUL these look like bits of candy, and would easily be confused as such by a child.  There is nothing printed on them stating not to eat them and they are individually wrapped as candy. So if you carried these around in your purse you may easily mistake them and eat one. I do not think this is safe at all.<br /><br />I am not sure they will be very effective in a smelly situation as the scent it gives out is very mild.  I would never order these again unless they were in packaging that labels it appropriately so it isnt mistaken for an edible treat. [SEP] The idea behind this product is great, but for me there were some issues. First, I read the directions and it was confusing as to whether or not to use just one tablet or more. Following directions, you will pop a tablet into the commode before use, in my experience there was not a positive fragrance, nor cleaning factor. The company does issue a clear warning to keep these tablets out of the reach of children, but is it enough of a safe guard?  Children might view these as mints. The product is individually wrapped and would be easy to carry in a purse or pocket. [SEP] I couldn’t smell anything different other than toilet water. It wasn’t fragrant at all.

We always bring along a small bottle of spray specifically made for toilet use.  You simply spray three squirts into the bowl before using the toilet and it does a remarkable job of covering up embarrassing odors.<br /><br />I was really excited about these tablets.  They look to be a more convenient solution when traveling due to the fact that they are tiny and easy to throw into luggage.  I was eager not to have to deal with a spray solution anymore and simply throw a tablet into the bowl before using it.<br /><br />Here's the huge problem with this product...<br /><br />It's a total failure.<br /><br />So, imagine this:  Nature is calling and you have to use the toilet immediately.  You throw one of these tablets into the bowl and then....you wait...and wait...and wait...and wait.  It took a single tablet more than 15 minutes to completely dissolve.  Is anyone going to hold back their movement to wait that long for the product to ready itself?<br /><br />What's worse is that when the tablet finally dissolved, it left an ugly discolored stain on the bottom of the bowl and absolutely no discernable scent to cover up what comes next.<br /><br />I couldn't believe how poorly this performed and I was really disappointed as I had such high hopes.<br /><br />I would love to give you some sound advice:  If you are looking for something to cover up toilet odors I highly recommend the small sprays made by Air Jungles and Clean-And-Fresh.  You spray three times before toilet use and they are highly effective in masking odors.<br /><br />This product should not be considered. [SEP] I thought these were toilet cleaners but they are more for a toilet fresher. they did dissolve and provide a nice smell to freshen up the bathroom. [SEP] Does turn my toilet water to a soft purple but that's about it. [SEP] Do I use 1?  2?  There is 1 in each package yet it says tablets (plural).  Do I wait for it to dissolve before I go? When you gotta go, you gotta go!  Some of the packages are easier to open than others.  I ain’t got time for that!  Lol. This is a great idea but I have too many questions.  Did it help?  Maybe a little.  Perhaps I’ll let it dissolve a bit more next time…if I can. I suggest putting 2 in a package.  Also, definitely keep these out of reach of children.  They can easily look like wrapped candy. [SEP] No one noticed a difference while using these. Would not recommend.",3,True

I need to have some good sources of pain relief topically so I can sleep at night.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a tube.  You take off th seal and then you use the flip top to dispense the cream.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />This cream is very thin and it can easily be squeezed out too quickly if you are not careful.  Once applied, it is not sticky or tacky and absorbs in pretty quickly.<br /><br />SMELL<br />There is a minty menthol smell, but it is not too bad compared to some creams.<br /><br />DOES IT HELP?<br />I get about an hour or two of relief after using this.  I primarily use this at night and it does help me sleep a bit.  It does not seem to work longer than two hours tops, but I am thankful for anything.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This cream helps me get an hour or two of relief at night from pretty intense pain.  It does not burn or give me problems but is a bit thin so you have to be cautious.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  If this was just a little bit thicker, it would be easier to use.  Other than that, it is pretty good stuff.  It is too expensive to waste by spilling out by accident. [SEP] This pain relief cream from the appropriately named ""Dr. Paine"" didn't work that well for me. There is a slight menthol scent and the lotion is absorbed quickly without leaving much residue, which is a good thing. However, it seems ineffective for strong back pain. For some reason I associate strong smelling creams with higher potency - since this one is mild, it doesn't seem to have much impact. The positive thing is that you can apply the cream and go out without someone noticing a strong scent. However, I prefer Ben Gay for providing stronger pain relief. This one is just Meh. [SEP] This product works pretty good for upper shoulder muscle issues, and it has a nice menthol smell that reminds me of Vicks.  This is a cream that absorbs well into the skin, but I do have to use quite a bit so do not expect it to last very long.  Having said this, it is priced more reasonably than some of the other pain creams out there and in addition to the topical analgesic also has ingredients such as aloe, arnica, boswelia, bromelain, and MSM.  All of these other ingredients have anti-inflammatory properties, so overall this product has a good combination of ingredients to combat muscle pain. [SEP] Two of us here have tried this product several times over the last 2 weeks plus 2 days. Can’t say it is the most potent pain reliever but it might have it’s use if you need something on your ache & need to be out in public — since the smell is more like a spearmint chewing gum.<br /><br />Box itself was not shrink wrapped by the manufacturer and did get crushed some (1st picture).<br /><br />The outside of the box has a clear expiration date that would give most folks plenty of time to use this before its last use date. The inside has a protective barrier to seal it before you open up the tip (3rd picture).<br /><br />It has aloe in it, not prominently disclosed on the front, but in the ingredient list. Some folks are allergic to aloe & I do tend to try to avoid it.<br /><br />I like it enough to have it on hand, but I don’t think it’s going to be my first reach during a major pain event. For minor aches it might be all anyone would need. [SEP] I get really sore neck and shoulders when I get a migraine. It hurts even after migraine meds help with the headache pain. I used this cream before bed so I could fall asleep without pain. The cream felt very cold but soothing. It really took the pain level down. I fell asleep easily. Worked well and I will have to get more when this tube runs out [SEP] Update: my wife used it on her sore muscles and pain went away.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised. I’ve used icy hot before and it is more hot than icy. This has a similar smell and is more icy and less hot. After 10-15 minutes, I noticed that may pain was gone. I have chronic pain and usually have to pop pills for relief. This worked really well and will continue to use it. [SEP] This cream has a nice combination of menthol and other herbal and mineral ingredients. I used this cream on my back and it works. The smell of menthol is not overwhelming and this ointment is not greasy. I like it. [SEP] I found this product to be similar to other pain creams. It basically does the same thing. It absorbs into the skin quickly and did relieve some soreness I had in my upper back and shoulder. It comes out of the tube a little thinner than expected, so I learned to be careful with how much I squeezed the tube.  It has a light, medicinal scent, but it wasn't so overpowering that I felt odd wearing it in public. Nothing particularly special, but it did the job. [SEP] It has the same effect as ben-gay and icy-hot and it smells just as terrible.  However, it does help with pain relief.  I have some pretty serious pain in my airm all the time and it did help to alleviate it for a while. [SEP] I got this after I ran out of Bengay and it works well, happy to have something to put on for when my muscles are sore after going to the gym.",3,True
Rising Health - Floranex One - Saccharomyces Boulardii (5 Billion CFUs per Serving)- Daily Probiotic and Prebiotic Supplement for Men and Women - 30 Capsules for a 30 Day Serving,[],[],,4.5,17,1592,"This is my second purchase of the tropical Saccharomyces boulardii yeast probiotic. This is not gut flora you are likely to acquire naturally in the western diet regimen. The yeast has delivered a noticeable reduction in night vurps. I seem to get these wicked revisits in spells for a couple of days. However, I can't recall an event since I've been taking it.<br /><br />Seems to have solved my night vurp situation. [SEP] Well-renowned probiotic for IBD other gastrointestinal issues.  Great because they are usually considered stable at room temperature, although sometimes they send them to you cold and then you think you have to keep them refrigerated.  Considering the relative low price, it seems like a good starting point on the road to recovery. [SEP] This is a great quality probiotic strain that really can help with so many issues. For me, it helps with autoimmune inflammatory issues so much! I'm really happy with how well these work. [SEP] This is my first experience with a probiotic product.  Have been taking this product for only several days now.  I realize that we are all different and the results would probably be more effective on others.  I have had  problems with gas and a very soft stool.  TMI (too much information) I know but, that is why I have this stuff.  The one difference that is noticeable is the soft stool, a definite improvement within a short period of time.  The suggestion is one tab a day......have read that some other products want you to take three a day.  Rather pleased with the results. [SEP] This is a very good daily probiotic. It has everything you are likely looking for and more. This is great for gastrointestinal health, vaginal health, urinary tract help. I have been using these and have nothing but good reactions to it.<br />As of this time there is no price listed so I can't tell you if I feel it's worth the price. Otherwise, it's very good and likely a good option for anyone looking for such a thing. [SEP] Those are the two words that come to mind when I think of probiotics. And that is just what I have been getting since taking the Floranex One probiotics. This is a daily pill and is a bit pricey but if it gets me to my  two favorite probiotic words then its worth it! Also, after opening the packaging recommends storing in the fridge, which I have been doing. The pills are moderate sized powder filled gel caps. [SEP] So I'm stating up front that it's hard to get a true sense of the efficacy of this without running an expensive clinical study (double blind, statistically valid), so my comments are due to me only. So, the first two days I took this I did not notice much of an effect, beyond I was regular. Then the 3rd night I was woken suddenly with the runs. Really bad- which lasted two days. It wasn't food poisoning with the horrible fever and cramps- but this was different. Considering my family ate the same things as I did over the last few days it was most likely not the food and more likely due to this. I stopped taking it and have no further curiosity to resume. [SEP] This is a probiotic that works well in helping to stay regular and also helping with occasional gastrointestinal upset. It's effective and helps me avoid too many tummy troubles. Probiotics are pretty essential like daily vitamins, especially for me and these are a good quality product. [SEP] Floranex is a trusted brand name for probiotics in the healthcare field. As a nurse, I see a lot of patients taking this brand of probiotics.<br /><br />I started taking probiotics a few years back due to GI issues, and I continue to take them because of that and increasing research showing ties between gut health and mental health. These Floranex One capsules are as easy to take as any others I've tried before. I'd never tried Saccharomyces boulardii supplements before, but they seemed to work just as well as my Lactobacillus and Bacillus coagulans (my personal favorite) supplements. If you have really bad GI problems, these may do the trick if the other probiotic strains haven't worked. Saccharomyces boulardii is a yeast (fungus), not a bacterium like the others, so it has very different cellular properties. [SEP] Recommend by my GI doctor",3,True

The only toy are the 3 egg toys. It's not actually toys inside of the bath bombs though. Our nephew was extremely let down to find this out. [SEP] These were our purchased as a gift.  They were a huge hit.  Well worth the price. [SEP] The bath bombs are fine as kids bath bombs go, but I thought that each one would have a dinosaur inside and that is not that case. There were ZERO dinosaurs inside the bath bombs, but 3 wobbly, dinosaurs in 3 of the bath bomb spots. [SEP] These are cute little bath bombs in the shape of dinosaur eggs. The description is slightly confusing since it talks about there being toys but in these are not surprise bath bombs. There are no little toys inside the actual bath bombs but rather there are plastic eggs mixed in with the bath bombs that turn into dinosaurs. The bath bombs are very fuzzy and colorful. [SEP] Super fun bath bombs for kids leaving their skin smelling great, soft to the touch, and gives them a super cool dinosaur toy to play with! Highly recommended!! [SEP] This is a great set for kids who love bath bombs, especially bombs that had toys inside them. Dino addicts will love these also.

Some do leave a ring around my bathtub and have quite a bit of dye in them. They do not irritate my daughter's skin.<br />She does love the dinosaurs! The pack includes 9 bath bombs and 3 bonus toys.<br />The downfalls are: Stains skin if touching them while they are dissolving and some colors leave a ring around my bathtub plus no toys inside the bombs. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:cfdacabdb35e04a5e3ad0f2459ed6ad]] This is a nice set of bath bombs. Just to be clear there is nothing inside the actual bath bombs. You receive three random toy dinosaurs plus an assortment of 9 bath bombs. These bath bombs dissolve faster than other brands I’ve tried, they dissolve in less than five minutes. They give off a lot of fizz, and do a great job coloring the bath water, but will also color your skin. Took me a while to scrub the dye off so if you have kids that like to play with the bombs, they may come out of the bath a different color. Didn’t do much for my skin, but it didn’t irritate my kids skin. Overall a decent set of bath bombs for kids!<br /><br />Thanks for reading, hope this was helpful! [SEP] Lovely set of bath bombs with fun little toys. They all are so fragrant and smell sweet. The colors are bright and make bath time fun! [SEP] fun for kids.  comes with 3 toys in the box, nothing inside the eggs.  My kids enjoyed them.<br /><br />see pictures posted.

Not one time has body odor peeked through. Even after 24 hour.

I will NEVER again purchase anything else. This deodorant held up during the hottest days of the year, my wedding day, and if you need it to, it will last multiple days on! Everybody needs to try this pleeeeease!! Thank you Ethique! [SEP] Love this deodorant,  none of the bad ingredients.  Great for sensitive skin. [SEP] It is what a expected. Scent isn’t very strong but it coats well and does the job. Keep it in plastic bag so it doesn’t  dry out. Glad to not be buying plastic throw always. Will buy again but waiting to see how long this will last so far good over a few weeks. [SEP] I love the smells and how its feel. No stain in the clothes, just perfect! Will buy it again. [SEP] I tried this deodorant as part of the body sample pack and was so impressed. While most natural brands use baking soda to absorb moisture and odors, this product uses bamboo. It is so much easier on my skin and doesn't seem to leave a buildup on my clothes. I think the scent would work for a man or a woman. It is not overpowering.  Keep the waxy paper that it comes with to hold onto the bar to apply and to wrap it when bot in use. [SEP] Smells nice and I love the no plastic concept for the packaging but the bar does not go on well.  It is to hard on my armpits.  It smells nice.  Not sure why the price is very high.  I could make it for much cheaper [SEP] I'm impressed at how well this works.  I've tried several natural deodorants and I had a hard time finding one that worked for me.  Plus, I need baking soda free because the baking soda was causing me to breakout.  I found another brand that worked, but it was way too much plastic waste.  Everything I've tried from Ethique works well and the zero waste is incredible.  My only downside is I wish they offered a holder that would allow me to add the bar and then push up from the bottom to apply.  Holding the bar on it's own can be difficult.  For now, I haven't found anything that works as well and is as eco-friendly as Ethique. [SEP] This is one of my favorite eco-friendly, plastic-free deodorants, and I've used many different kinds. I love that there is no plastic, and this deodorant bar lasts a long time. It's nice and soft, but not too soft, and it smells great!",3,True

I did have to order another dispenser and it's even too big for the cups, but it will work. [SEP] I bought a different print design of “3 oz” bathroom cups from UNVES only a handful of weeks ago.  Despite being advertised as 3 ounces, look at the picture… you can see that they are about 2/3 the size of a standard Bathroom Dixie Cup.  Does that matter?  It does if you have a dispenser for 3 oz. cups.  In fact, a normal stream of water from our bathroom faucet causes the water to splash out of this tiny cup and onto the wall.  Once you have to dry off your painted wall enough times, you might understand that the size DOES matter!<br />When I went to review the Unves 3 oz. cups that I bought, guess what??  They’re discontinued!  I’ve experienced the same with other “Brand X” cups from Amazon as well.<br />* At this point, I’m reviewing the company that advertises their product with an incorrect size, not the printed design that could be discontinued tomorrow.  I would advise you not to buy from UNVES unless you check reviews, and look out for complaints about the size.<br />These little cups look very nice and they hold enough water to take a couple of aspirin.

[SEP] I've already used a few of these towels to clean my Air fry oven and dual microwave convection oven that were in need of cleaning, and it did a wonderful job. My air fry oven and microwave look brand new again. But, this is not the main reason that I wanted them.<br />A while back, I took on the endeavour of repainting my kitchen and bathroom cabinets. I thought it was going to be a simple job, but it turns out that there's a lot more to it than just a little sanding and painting. It's taking me a while, I'm only halfway through, and I'm on a little break right now, but will be back at it within the next week or so. These towels are going to be great for all the chemicals I'm going to have to use, and all the scrubbing and cleaning I'm going to have to do. Especially, in the bathrooms, as I haven't done any of the prep work in those two rooms, yet.<br />I'm trying to go off memory of the proper steps, so I may miss something. You have to clean your cabinets with a strong special cleaner, then lightly sand them, and then reclean with a 50/50 mixture of water and denatured alcohol. You also have to keep ammonia on hand for some reason, but I can't remember exactly why. This might not be everyone's way, but this is just how I was taught to do it, and it's working well. The job was taxing on me because I didn't have good towels to use. I was using a sponge and paper towels for a good part of it, and they just weren't cutting it. I think there's something in the makeup of these towels that make them clean better and will make my job of prepping my cabinets a lot easier. I'll also need them to wipe away any sanding dust in between coats, and these will leave them lint-free, unlike paper towels.<br />Just from using a few of these to clean my Air fry oven and microwave, I know there's some super special cleaning power in these towels. I know that they will serve me well while doing my cabinet painting jobs. Because of how durable they are and well they last, I'm sure I'll have some left over to do other cleaning jobs around the house. I definitely recommend these towels! [SEP] These work so much better in our workshop than I thought they would! I've attached a before and after photo of wiping down a greasy, metal shard covered piece of machinery. It not only did a great job of collecting all the grease but it also did an amazing job of catching all the aluminum shards - and not a SINGLE shard came through the fabric! That is pretty remarkable since those shards are very sharp, rough, and love to become metal splinters in your skin. I decided to be dangerous and didn't wear gloves when cleaning and didn't get a single metal splinter. I was able to wipe down a very large, dirty area with a single cloth and it didn't get a single tear even though I was working around a lot of sharp metal. I'm super impressed with the durability and absorbency of these - especially how well it handles grease and oil - and would definitely recommend them. [SEP] These 12"" cleanroom wipes serve nicely for spill control and general cleanup tasks. The polyester/cellulose composition provides excellent absorbency for cleaning solutions or solvents, and the wipes maintain good strength whether wet or dry. As with most cleanroom wipes, these are double-bagged at the factory to reduce contamination, but the bags are not as sturdy as those found on other brands I've used.<br /><br />The wipes' non-woven construction allows for moderate stretch on one axis and almost none in the perpendicular direction. The wipes generally produce very minimal lint in use, but their fibers can be loosened on rough surfaces, so you'll want to stick with woven products for the most demanding situations.<br /><br />Where these wipes come up a little short is their performance on optical surfaces. The wipes seem to contain a moderate level of water-soluble residue, which can result in slight haze or streaks being deposited on some surfaces (anti-reflective glass, for example). I have worked with other brands of non-woven poly/cell wipers that exhibited much better purity in this regard.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give these wipes a four-star rating. Their strength and absorbency are ideal for containing spills and for general cleaning, but they're not sufficiently residue-free for wiping optical surfaces. [SEP] I almost said these are just a very durable disposable towels when the table I am supposed to review arrived. The metal legs were covered with something that looked like dried up boogers ( or a glue?) but I wasn’t able to remove it by scratching off with my finger nails. I tried dipping paper towel in water just to see the reaction to water, was it gonna soften or something but no, 0 result.  Then I saw these and decided to give them a try. I dipped in water and pressed hard... it was COMING OFF! It wasn’t the water, it was the wipe a d I could tell by the way it wS coming off. It wasn’t melting, it was sort off coming off in tiny chunks. Regular paper towel didn’t do anything, nada! I don’t know much about fibers and exactly were these made but they are thin yet VERY DENSE. You can literally wash it, rinse it and reuse it. I really think the density of the fibers is what gives them scrubbing power. I then sprayed my bathroom sink with a bathroom cleaner and used this to wipe off..OMG! I didn’t use anything to scrub like usual (scotch scrub sponge), I just wiped with this wipe which scrubbed the sink and absorbed cleaner at the same time leaving my sink looking clean and shiny after just a few wiping moves, seriously? I then went onto my kitchen cabinets that were ahem kinda due for a scrub... did great.<br /><br />The only downside is the packaging. It’s a plastic bag with a stack of large square towels. That’s it. It takes large space to lay flat and you need to keep it flat so it’s easier to remove one wipe at the time. That’s another part of the same problem, it’s not easy separating and pulling one out. Some sort of dispenser would be 100x better. [SEP] The ""FG Clean Wipes"" arrive in a white plastic bag. There are 150 wipes in that bag.<br /><br />The wipes are just dry sheets with nothing on them. They are white in color, have no scent and are a large size (12"" x 12"").<br /><br />They are also extremely durable. I've used various products (water, cleaner, rubbing alcohol) with these wipes and none of those product caused these wipes to weaken or even tear. They are very durable.<br /><br />I've even used the same wipe over and over again just rinsing it out between uses. It held up great with no signs at all of wear and tear.<br /><br />These wipes are marketed toward being used for cleaning but I really don't see why they can't be used for other things as well.

I tried dipping paper towel in water just to see the reaction to water, was it gonna soften or something but no, 0 result.  Then I saw these and decided to give them a try. I dipped in water and pressed hard... it was COMING OFF! It wasn’t the water, it was the wipe a d I could tell by the way it wS coming off. It wasn’t melting, it was sort off coming off in tiny chunks. Regular paper towel didn’t do anything, nada! I don’t know much about fibers and exactly were these made but they are thin yet VERY DENSE. You can literally wash it, rinse it and reuse it. I really think the density of the fibers is what gives them scrubbing power. I then sprayed my bathroom sink with a bathroom cleaner and used this to wipe off..OMG! I didn’t use anything to scrub like usual (scotch scrub sponge), I just wiped with this wipe which scrubbed the sink and absorbed cleaner at the same time leaving my sink looking clean and shiny after just a few wiping moves, seriously? I then went onto my kitchen cabinets that were ahem kinda due for a scrub... did great.<br /><br />The only downside is the packaging. It’s a plastic bag with a stack of large square towels. That’s it. It takes large space to lay flat and you need to keep it flat so it’s easier to remove one wipe at the time. That’s another part of the same problem, it’s not easy separating and pulling one out. Some sort of dispenser would be 100x better.",3,True

It’s a simple couple of ingredients to bring such a strong Immune System boost that makes it so great. I think it’s a wonderful supplement to have around, essential these days and I’d recommend it to everyone.<br />  Cons: It seems that this is a good product and the company seems to have an extensive amount of happy customers to go by so, I’m happy too. My only issue is something I hold Every Supplement Company up to and that’s them sharing their information on their testing practices for Purity, Quality and Quantity; they show nothing. I know it’s made in the USA, which is a “general” plus for the safety of supplements but, I like to see information I can actually confirm if I decided to.<br />  Hopefully they do in the future because, they do seem to be pretty decent.<br />  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁 [SEP] > Supports healthy cholesterol levels / and heart health.<br /><br />Started researching Beta Gulcan, then realized this is a vast<br />and complicated subject to attempt explaining in a review.<br />So here's the skinny<br /><br />1,000 mg B-Glucan - from =<br />1. aureobasidum pullalans = couldn't find any info.<br />2.

I have no real issues , I’m a believer in preventive medicine . As I always say, do your own research, as the benefits of any supplement or vitamin changes weekly as new research is performed . There is a wide range of pricing for Beta Glucan also, so pay attention to what you are wanting . If you eat a lot of mushrooms , especially shiitake, maybe you don’t need so much . Also you can buy a powder and sprinkle it in your food . These work for me and I feel like I got a good deal. I like to re-evaluate my supplements every 6 months, I think it gives every product a fair chance to perform or not perform in your body. I’m happy ! [SEP] This bottle contains concentrated beta glucans from a couple different sources to support immune health. The capsules are vegetable based and have a couple flow agents but no other additives. This is a one month supply at the recommended dosage, a little expensive but worth trying if you are looking for isolated beta glucans.",3,True
