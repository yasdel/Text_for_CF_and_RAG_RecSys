They cover whatever comes up in your account next. I was given a $75 card as a gift to by Kindle books.  I also have an auto mmontly shipment of coffee (auto paid by credit card). The gift card was applied to the coffee and when I ordered abot $30 worth of books the gift card was gone and I ended up buying books at cost by cc.  I would not have bought all those books if I thought the gift card was used.  I realize the net cash was the same but I found it annoying. [SEP] I was lucky to receive a gift card for Christmas.

It's just a gift card. [SEP] Bought these recently for my friend's birthday. She LOVES the movies and was thrilled to receive these. Great for not only admission, but snack bar too!!!!!!  Works for me!!!! [SEP] Perfect gift for the movie lover in your friends or family circle. These always come activated, unlike the ones in the store, which some employees forget to activate and then the cards are deemed useless.

[SEP] Longhorn Steakhouse has always been a favorite of ours and I love that you can buy gift cards from Amazon!  They ship quickly and have a great selection of different ones to choose from. [SEP] First off I don't remember the last time I wrot a review since I only belive about 10% of what I read but I got so sick I felt I needed to do something so here you go. Stayed next door at a hotel so it was convenient to walk next door for four of us to eat dinner. The hotel and the restaurant were very new so it looked like a good fit. The restaurant was not very busy at all which made me wonder why. Maybe it was a little out of the way or too new for locals to find.I ordered a steak and I believe my steak was contaminated by someone or it was just to old to eat. Anyway this is what I sent back to the restaurant chain hoping they will react to what I experienced that night after eating my dinner in Landcaster, Pa.<br />To the restaurant chain:<br />I Ordered a sirloin steak medium rare and believe I received a filet cooked rare. Ate it anyway after the server assured me it was a sirloin even though it was about 3"" in diameter and 2"" thick, rare meat is usually ok with me rather than medium. A few hours later I got the chills and shakes that I could not fight off and went to bed about 8:00PM, at 4:30 AM thi next morning I woke up violently ill with nausea, diahria, body aches and a fever that I believe was attributed to the piece of meat I ate at your restaurant. This was a new restaurant that was sparsely occupied so I believe I was served a piece of meat that was old and contaminated. I was sick for 60 hours as a result of eating that steak dinner.","The LongHorn Steakhouse Gift Card offers the opportunity to enjoy a relaxing and inviting dining experience at LongHorn Steakhouse locations, along with other Darden Restaurants such as Olive Garden, Bahama Breeze, and more.

Good Product [SEP] This was a good birthday surprise! [SEP] I love the tin! The gift cards can be ordered on different amounts. [SEP] My kids and grandkids always love Amazon gift cards. This one was for my daughter for her birthday. [SEP] Really charming way to present the not so exciting gift card.  The tin is just darling, great for res-use. [SEP] I recently sent two of these as birthday gifts and the Mom got the loaded gift cards with instructions to let the kids have the tins since I could not bring them edible cupcakes.  From purchases in the past, I was aware that they are pretty thin in depth as well as the metal gauge and I knew that there is a clear plastic rectangle on the rear which provides Amazon to identify the code on the card inside of the tin.  The kids didn't mind that and the Mom didn't mind sharing her gift.  I suspect that the funds embedded in the cards eventually went to buying items for the kids anyway because she's a sharing person.  This is one of my favorite physical gift cards from Amazon which I enjoy sending. [SEP] Cant go wrong with Amazon gift cards [SEP] Love the gift cards [SEP] Bought as a gift.

It's a $25 gift card. I bought it to take advantage of an Alexa/Echo offer. The box and bow are attractive but they were in the garbage in five minutes and a few minutes after that the credit balance was in my account. Sending the pretty box and bow was nice and only other option was a white gift box with bow. Why I couldn't have been emailed the $25 code I don't know but I actually feel a little guilty for Amazon wrapping this up nicely and shipping it overnight. I'd have been happy with a code to copy, paste and redeem. Now all Amazon had to do, as promised, is email my $5 voucher for buying this $25 card. [SEP] Another gift card.  This one also received the expected cheerful response from the recipient, but what more can you expect.  It worked. [SEP] It's a gift card in a small box with an orange ribbon and bow on the box top. You can send an Amazon gift card by email or hand deliver one like this. They all work the same, money which is applied to a person's Amazon account.  Only problem I have with gift cards is that purchases don't register as &#34;verified purchase&#34; when the gift card balance is used for payment and you leave a review. [SEP] Amazon gift cards have really nice selection of boxes. Perfect for any occasion [SEP] What a clever way to package a graduation gift card.  Thanks. [SEP] Christmas gift for one of my nephews.

Plus, it looks much nicer than simply a gift card that you can get at the store since it comes in it's own little box making it look good.  I will definitely be buying more of these in the future!

Great design of gift card for friends to eat some chipotle food in holiday season. Easy to use.

fast delivery and card worked [SEP] I love to eat a couple types of food at Panda Express. This gift card is easier to use and saves money for more cash back with Discover card during the holiday season on Amazon. It's giftable as well! [SEP] Good card [SEP] Was as expected [SEP] ITS FOOOOOOD!!!!!!! [SEP] If you are planning on gifting this, then the cosmetic imperfections matter. The card came with scratches on it and the backing was crumpled. The card was stuck crooked on the backing. The card is difficult to check the balance - the # is absurdly long (unlike all the other GCs I've bought recently). If you enter it wrong, the system hangs up on you! Once I managed to enter it right, after having to call it back twice, I was able to check the balance and see that the card was loaded. [SEP] Saves us drive to store! [SEP] If you like Panda Express then can't go wrong with a gift card. Got this for Mom for Christmas and she loved it.

Item as described. [SEP] good steaks [SEP] Thank you gift for our snowblowing neighbors who love to cook out...!!! [SEP] Can’t go wrong with anything they sell. All the products are of the highest quality. I send these gift cards to my son as a Christmas present and sometimes for his anniversary. Usually I buy them direct from the company but at Christmas time realized I could get them from Amazon prime faster. Yay Amazon Prime! [SEP] Who wouldn’t want a gift of delicious Omaha?? [SEP] What's not to like about Omaha Steaks! [SEP] I had been giving Omaha Steak gift cards for years at Christmas. I could include them with the Christmas cards for people I wouldn't see during the holidays. It has since been brought to my attention that the company now has such a high threshold for free shipping and a high shipping rate that it is now cost prohibitive to purchase from them online. Even when given a gift card! I'm now forcing friends and family to spend more just to get a gift! If you can find an actual store, maybe you're alright but mail order is out of the question. It used to be fun. People would buy special packages of steaks or burgers. Or try something out of the ordinary. Now it seems its more of a hassle to find something you'll like and not spend more then the gift cards! The weight of the meats is small, the postage is high and adding heavy potatoes to a combo isn't really ""special"". I will NOT continue buying these in the future. [SEP] Great meat. [SEP] Quickly received just as described!

as expected [SEP] No wrapping and the receiver really loved the freedom to choose whatever they wanted rather than &#34;just getting&#34; something because it was a holiday. [SEP] it's a gift card... what more is there to say? The box and ribbon looked great, and the code was easily redeemable. Sometimes Amazon runs promotions for Prime members where you can get some extra credit (roughly $5) to your account if you purchase a certain amount in gift cards, which is a no-brainer. If I was actually gifting this to someone else, I personally think the direct e-mail is a better option, but the availability of a box is a nice touch. [SEP] I like that they are shipped so quickly so they make a perfect last minute gift. Everyone can find something they want on Amazon so its a pretty universal gift. [SEP] I needed a last minute Christmas present  for a family member with whom I thought we had agreed that we were not exchanging gifts this year. She called me three days before Christmas and discussed, to my horror, that she could not wait for me to see what she had gotten for me. I knew that she has a Kindle fire, so I looked locally in a mad dash at local retailers and could not find any Amazon related gift cards. They were sold out. I came home and ordered through my Amazon Prime membership and received the card the next day in a nice little gift box already wrapped. Fast and hassle free. I had already made up a card explaining that I had not received her gift yet, but I did not need to use the card. She immediately bought a book that evening. Really a life saver, thanks Amazon for the quick delivery. [SEP] This was a wonderful gift for a new Kindle Fire owner!

these are always a hit! [SEP] Got for 40$ [SEP] It’s a gift card so what’s not to like? [SEP] Great Tunes [SEP] A great gift card especially when trying to monitor my app spending. It was sorta difficult setting up on iPhone now iTunes has change for the worse [SEP] I’d give zero stars if possible. After purchasing this gift card on Lightning Deal during Prime Days I will never purchase another gift card from amazon again. A $50 gift card for $40 wasn’t worth all the time I spent trying to get the card to work or<br />my $ back. What the problem was is still unknown. Amazon customer service didn’t help me as I was referred to Apple. After a lengthy conversation with Apple the result was the card wasn’t identified or activated. I was referred back to Amazon. It was a battle with Amazon Customer service (which I usually receive 100% satisfaction) to resolve this issue. A battle. It was an Apple problem. No it wasn’t. Finally since there was nothing amazon could do to make the card valid I requested my $40 back. Another battle after being referred to more people to discuss the problem. Finally after demanding resolution & speaking to the “right” person at Amazon, I was refunded the $40. Since no activation papers are sent with the card trusting the system applies. The system didn’t work with this card. After my experience I wouldn’t suggest purchasing gift cards. Amazon needs to state they will include activation paperwork with the gift card, Until I read such words I’ll  never purchase a gift card again even if it’s a deal is too good to pass up. [SEP] Easy to use [SEP] The card worked great, without any problems.

Then, go online to use the free pizza coupon, select more pizzas, and immediately use your $25 PJ gift card.  Also, if you look, there are all kinds of specials on the PJ ordering website, such as this one that is going on at the time of this review... it's called &#34;Pepsi. Pizza. Rock.&#34;  For $12 you get a large 2 topping pizza and a 2 liter drink.  Then, you receive another coupon code for a free product, such as a large pizza or a 2 liter drink.  All of mine thus far, and I do this every weekend for the past month...have been a free large pizza.

I only used the $50 card one time at Burger King. It was difficult to use. Must be run as credit, not as gift card. No remaining balance is given at the end of the transaction. And although it's on me, I misplaced or lost this card after only spending about $6 of it. I was hoping that the seller could provide me with the full card number so that I could at least use it online for other purchases. They failed to respond. I have the receipt from BK, but it only shows the last 4 numbers. There isn't a way of contacting happy cards customer service online that I could figure out. I wish I'd just stuck with credit cards. A lot safer. [SEP] Good for gifting [SEP] Used gift card with no issues. [SEP] It's a gift card and works at the places listed. No complaints. [SEP] Good [SEP] Use it at my local Panera. Yum! [SEP] Shipping was quick and I love cute pink packaging🥰 Gifted to my mom for her birthday. I love that it gives you options where you can shop. Was initially glooming for just an ultra one but this gives her a bigger variety without me having to buy separate ones. [SEP] I love restaurant gift cards. I especially loves getting them at a discount like this. [SEP] Good gift card [SEP] So I got 2 of these on a lightening deal. Sometimes (especially on lightening deal) I buy quickly and then go back and read reviews later. After I read the reviews I was terrified that I would get one that looked used (I was purchasing as a gift,) there would be nothing/only a portion on it, or the place that the person I gifted it to wanted to use it wouldn’t take it. This is all I read when first reading reviews. However, I had already purchased so there was nothing I could do at that point. Since I read such horrible reviews, I decided to keep it for myself. I didn’t want there to be a problem with the card after I gave it as a gift. I’m pleased to say that both cards looked crisp and new and I had no problem at all in using either one. I actually used one of them at multiple stores and stores that other reviewers had said the store wouldn’t take. The main thing to note is you have to use these as credit. Everywhere I used these the cashier knew just what they were and how to use them. At the end, if you have a balance left you can split the transaction so that you can use the full amount. You’ll need to know the balance but checking the amount is extremely easy. Overall, these are great to gifts because the person you are giving it to has the option to use at multiple places. Not to mention if you keep an eye out Amazon is often offering these on sale so they can be a great deal on places that you usually can’t get a deal at. I highly recommend. They really are very simple to use and are the perfect gift idea.","The Happy Gift Card offers a versatile gifting option with the freedom to choose from a variety of brands.

Olive Garden overcharged their customers for worst food they made. Upon arrival at a local Olive Garden branch in October 2014, my friends and I saw only a few customers sit there so we should be assigned a seat quickly. There were several welcoming representatives just talking to each other and one told us that we had to wait at least 20 minutes to get seated.<br /><br />After the dirty and sour meal, we were overcharged and were forced to pay 20% service fee as tips. If it's a good meal and service, we might pay more than 30% of dinner price as tip but we had a horrible dining experience in Olive Garden. After all, we would never visit Olive Garden again because such a bad restaurant kept ripping people off. I have seen bad reviews on this restaurant from other people on other sites too. [SEP] If you know someone who like Olive Garden, this is a fun gift to give them.  It makes them treat themselves and splurge a little bit.  And maybe they will take you with them when they go to Olive Garden. [SEP] Great [SEP] Perfect !! [SEP] Purchased 2 gift cards and they both worked with no problems. I did call the number on the back of the cards just to double check the balance. [SEP] My mom got me a gift card. Who can say no to free food? :) [SEP] With this card you can purchase the most amazing soup, salad and bread sticks available at any Olive Garden.

User Reviews:
Great item for the movie lovers in your life. The only complaint is the surcharge you pay in addition to your movie tickets; however, it is quite convenient for booking a movie in a theatre that has reclining seats. [SEP] This is a great gift for any family member. It is convenient and easy to use. [SEP] I repeat do not buy.  I don't know how it works for movie tickets. My issue is with renting. I tried everything possible to figure out how to rent a movie. I sent an email for help. No reply. I waited twice on website chat. No representative. Don't risk buying it. It may be great for some. I wouldn't take a chance if this is for a gift. [SEP] The movie ticket worked on both FandangoNow and Fandango website. If you use it to buy digital movies on FandangoNow, sometimes they ran promotion with other onsite movie sponsors for a free promotional movie ticket.<br /><br />Update on 6/30/2017, as this gift card only can be used without any other promo code available from Fandango, FandangoNow, or any other parties. [SEP] These gift cards are so difficult to use. Seriously, just give people money. [SEP] great! [SEP] I am re-reviewing this product since Amazon pulled the option (which is the same item: Fandango Gift Card) that had all the negative reviews.<br /><br />Buyer beware! Fandango created a business to make it easier to purchase movie tickets online. The idea is good, but there are so many opportunities for things to go wrong and Fandango Customer Service is beyond terrible. The chances of getting burned by buying this product is very high. Since Fandango is a separate company than the theaters they deal with, you have to deal directly with Fandango if there are any issues with your tickets- the theaters cannot (and will not) help you. Fandango redeemed a $50 gift card we had and never issued tickets; when we called customer service, we were on hold for almost an hour (during which time the movie we were trying to see started). After having no luck on the phone, I filed an online complaint. It took several days for them to get back to me (in the meantime, I called again the next day and was able to get through after about a 20 minute wait). Fandango refused to issue a refund because their policy is that refunds need to be requested before the start of the show. I'd like to know how that is even possible if customer service reps don't answer the phone and don't respond to emails for days. They figure people redeeming gift certificates won't push the issue since it was a gift (not their money). There are hundreds of negative reviews about this company. Do some research before purchasing. Movie gift cards are nice, but I'd suggest going through the actual theater so that someone can assist if something goes wrong. Fandango just wants to steal your money. [SEP] They charge a fee for each ticket you buy. Just go directly to theatre websites and use a gift card to avoid all fees (not a fandango one, the specific companies). [SEP] Why on earth would anyone want this crap - charging an extra $2.00 for each ticket as a ""Convenience"" fee!!!!!!!  I wan not aware of this - shame on misleading people into thinking they are giving a gift of ree movies - you're lucky if that $25 buys 2 tickets.  I will NEVER - and i do mean never - purchase fandango again - this is a rip off [SEP] Great x-mas gift for all","The Fandango Gift Card is a convenient option for movie enthusiasts, perfect for gifting on holidays, birthdays, or as a token of appreciation.

Seller must know this but still advertising in headline $50 card with free appetizer. False advertising. [SEP] what's not to love? [SEP] my mom loved this birthday gift [SEP] Good value [SEP] I bought this as a gift. It comes in a sealed package which is really nice. However, here is a word of advice: on the package itself, it states that the card is not valid until activated by a cashier. This had me a bit worried that I had just paid $50 for an unloaded gift card. I opened the package so that I could get the code off the back of the card and check the balance on the website provided. Thankfully, the card IS loaded with the $50. I wish I would have left it in the package it came in because it would've looked better as a gift, but I felt I had to make sure it was actually loaded first. So learn from my mistake- yes, the card is loaded. And if you really want to be sure it is loaded, it provides a website you can go to to check the card balance. However, if you're buying this as a gift and want to keep it in the packaging (looks nicer that way) then you can be rest assured that it is actually loaded and you don't have to open it to check.

What can you say about a gift card? Well, it was valid. It's a good gift for someone who doesn't like to cook. Arrived promptly. [SEP] Bought for a family with a Special Needs Child.

[SEP] Very giftable [SEP] I know nothing about Door Dash except my niece told me it would make my older brother’s life easier. Win-Win! [SEP] We received a Door Dash card from a friend during my surgical recuperation. 6 months later we were still trying to use the card for food at Baja Fresh.  In addition to terrible redemption processes through Door Dash we discovered that Door Dash adds $3 to the actual menu cost per item.

Christmas gift so cute. They loved it [SEP] Great Christmas gift [SEP] I specially ordered a gift card with a reindeer ornament inside and did not receive the ornament. [SEP] Disappointing.

Another nice gift box from Amazon. With the world the way it is now I had to send a gift rather than going to a party.

Good gift [SEP] I like the idea of getting socks with a gift card purchase. Maybe if they gave options for socks sizes I'd be a bit happier. They're huge socks that won't fit anyone in our household.

My son and daughter-in-law work full time in a small midwestern town.  There aren't many restaurants in town, but there's a Domino Pizza.  So, when they don't want to cook, or have students over - my son is a professor - they can serve up some classic Domino Pizza.  Figured this would give them an excuse to not cook and have a break.  I called the Domino's in their town as recommended to ensure they take gift cards and they do!  My daughter-in-law likes this pizza, so figured these gift cards would make her happy! [SEP] I have recently come to love dominos and these gift cards make it easy with the cash back tied to my Amazon credit card. Saves money getting 5% back then the 2% from actually using it at the store. Only complaint is that I wish it was an e-gift card rather than plastic for environmental purposes. [SEP] Great gift, great food, reasonable gift for any occasion.  Who doesn't like pizza, ok maybe a few, but not many. [SEP] Worked perfect. [SEP] Easy to use [SEP] Great for pizza night on a Friday.

Bought this for a gift and was very happy it shipped quickly and they received it just in time! Amazon is awesome! 🤩 [SEP] I love giving Amazon gift cards to my kid's teacher's at Xmas and the end of the school year. I really appreciate that Amazon sends along this adorably manly box. I like being able to hand them something wrapped rather than just a card. It somehow feels more personal. And then they get the joy of opening a wrapped gift, which everyone loves that feeling.  I can't recommend Amazon's gift card boxes enough!!!! [SEP] The gift card works.  You apply it to your account and have the funds to cover a purchase up to the dollar amount of the value applied to the card.  You cannot add to the card, once it's applied to the account, the card is useless as a form of tender.  I personally have a tool to make guitar picks from cards like these, so I'll make a couple of guitar picks from this one and give them to the kids.  One of the kids loves to play his guitar.  The tin in which it arrives has a cutout with a plastic insert so that the warehouse workers know which card to select to fulfill the order, and that does not hinder my using the tin for other things.  I actually like to see what's inside the box, just like the Amazon staff I guess. [SEP] I ordered 4 of these to give as teacher gifts.  I didn't realize they don't show the amount of the card which i dislike. Also one of the tins was dented. [SEP] Worked as advertised. [SEP] Exactly as pictured. Great gift.

Great holiday gift! The bear sits under our Christmas tree and it looks nice. Enjoyed the gift card as well. [SEP] The bear is VERY soft and cuddly.

got some sex from my wife. [SEP] Christmas stocking gift. Loved it [SEP] For gifts, these are great as the recipient is not limted to just one store. [SEP] My niece is a trend setting tween.  At 12 years old, she loves anything she can buy at Old Navy (her go to store) and the Gap.  She doesn't always have the funds for it, so this was a perfect way to give her options and help the fashionista in her keep on point.<br /><br />Being that she's a hip (yes i'm old) tweenster and her Aunt is old, I figured what better way to hook a girl up with an amazing Christmas present than to give her something she can use to pick out herself.  Worked like a charm!  I ended up buying two of these cards for a total of $50, she was thrilled that she can use them at more than just Old Navy.  Options work wonders I have found with 12 year olds.<br /><br />The cards came activated, complete with the receipt that shows they are live.  They, like any other card, fit perfectly into her new wallet.<br /><br />Anyhow, this girl went out shopping and has spent a portion of the money and i'm sure will spend more as the year progresses! [SEP] works like advertised although gift card came in beat up packaging, got all wrinkly! [SEP] my granddaughter is just old enough (7) to enjoy shopping for herself.
