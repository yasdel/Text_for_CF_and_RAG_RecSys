Did the job. [SEP] lightweight and feels cool to the touch. nice form fitting. [SEP] This is a nice light weight breathable shirt. I really like the color combination and the pattern they chose for incorporating the gray. The sleeves have a band on the end of more thick elastic type material. I went up one size when I ordered this and thank goodness I did or it would fit too tight to wear. Overall I do like it, fits nicely going up a size, perfect for warmer weather, and nice classy appearance. Will recommend to others as long as repeated washings does not cause seam failure or any other fabric flaw. [SEP] Love the shirt. It is comfortable and fits well. [SEP] First positives: material is lightweight, appears sort of perforated, best use for active wear.<br /><br />Negatives: sizing is far off base.  I ordered XL per their sizing recommendations.  XL fit closer to 2XL or 3XL.  I can't even fathom what size would correlate with XL.  There is no indication the shirt was made slim, after trying it on.  You might as well wear a dress. [SEP] I ordered this shirt because it is moisture wicking and looked nicer than most of the other ones I've seen, or own.<br /><br />The materials are decent.  They are on par with just about every other shirt like this.  There is nothing that sets it apart there.<br /><br />It does run a little tighter than I'd like and it's a little shorter than I'd like.  You'll want to buy a size that is a solid one size larger than what you normally would buy.<br /><br />It seems well put together.  I have no concerns about it holding up over the long run.<br /><br />Overall it's a decent value.  I'd consider buying another in a size larger. [SEP] I like the fit even though it's smaller than how XL normally fits [SEP] This polo is very nice. The material is easy to take care of. Dries quickly. While it is synthetic, it feels good on the skin. The navy color is a nice dark blue and the white accents makes the body look slimmer!<br /><br />The sizing is fitted -- true to size but slim fitting.<br /><br />Good shirt for all around casual use. Recommended. [SEP] Love the material and how it fits. [SEP] My husband is 6‚Äô2‚Äù and 200 lbs. We ordered a large and it fits him just right. The proportions are just right- not too long or baggy in the torso, sleeves not overly long or large. The material is soft, lightweight and breathable. We especially like the blue accents which add interest, and help add to the visual ‚Äúshape‚Äù of the shirt. It looks great and he really likes it.",3,True

That said the fit is odd. Very large in hips and waist and disproportionately slim in the legs. Not cute lol. Unfortunately not even ok for lounging at home due to fit. Had to return. [SEP] Lower in the waist than I prefer and fit more like Capri's (5'11"", size L).  Shame because the style was very cute. [SEP] These joggers are thick and warm. They are made with sweatshirt like fabric. I like these for lounging around but they are too thick and hot to do use while running. However, I can wear them over my gym shorts for running to the gym on cold days.<br /><br />As far as fit, I got these in a size medium which is what I usually wear. They fit me as I would expect without being too loos or tight. I like that they have a drawstring so I can cinch the waist tighter as needed. There is a knit band around the ankles which keeps these from sliding up. I like these for camping and sitting around the campfire at night when it's a little chilly. Overall, I like these. I'm not totally in love with them. They don't look great, just something to wear around the house. [SEP] I'm 5'8 135 and these are waaayyy too short [SEP] Nice quality but too warm in Ca...thought it would be lighter material. [SEP] I am 5'2"" so the short inseam was okay for me. I took the advice of Amazon and ordered a size up. They are eay to big.  I did try to wash and shrink them, I should have purchased the medium. üôÑ [SEP] I have been all about comfort lately, I mean, these days we are staying home more, so why not be comfortable.  These pants do the trick.  they are warm, and comfy.  they fit OK, they are a little on the big side, but I love my comfy pants being a tad baggy.  I know joggers aren't the most flattering, but there are times when comfort and warmth wins over.  Made well.  will last a long time. [SEP] Very flattering, warm and comfortable. Since working from home I needed something cute that I could also run errands if needed during the day. I love the colors on these. [SEP] Friendly Warning: The blue, yellow and pink pants are a far more better quality cotton material than the grey and lighter white one which are more synthetic fabric.<br /><br />I got them yesterday, the fabric is awesome, soft and not too light, but light enough for the summer. The color is a beautiful yellow as shown. I am 5.5 110 lbs, I ordered the small, they fit perfectly, not snug, roomy comfy and the length is perfect. A great buy, great quality for your money!

I purchased the indigo color in a medium. These are super soft and extremely flattering! They hold you in but do not give the compressed feel. Husband immediately told me I should buy more :) I am such a fan and will be ordering more colors soon! [SEP] So, I bought these leggings in both a M and a L. I pulled the M out and they looked TINY. I tried both on and they are both tight but the L seems to give off more camel toe than the M. Which is strange. I like the M but there are a couple downsides. The leggings are not full length. More like 7/8. Also I wanted to give them the go round at the gym before I reviewed. They aren‚Äôt really sweat proof. I mean it wasn‚Äôt awful, but I stopped at less than 2 miles and I usually go 3.5 because I didn‚Äôt want it to get worse. More like a darker tinge on the crotch sweat regions. I also bought the shorts. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm going to keep them yet because the M is way to tight around the legs and I‚Äôm scared the L will have the weird crotch fit. So, I‚Äôm in between on these leggings. [SEP] These are great, I use them for working out, weight lifting specifically and they absorb sweat pretty well while making you feel cool, it keeps you compressed without digging into you're skin, and the price is great, the waist band sits pretty high but im also 5'1 and that's kinda always the case. [SEP] First of all i thought the fabric was going to be more thick, its not like super lightweight as the ae ones, but lighter of what i thought. Anyway, great surprise, they are SUPER soft and confortables. Squat proof, and no cellulite showing! For me is win win. Im going to use them tomorrow for leg day, so i will update on performance. But as today, i will purchase more colors for sure. :) [SEP] Very fitted. They don‚Äôt get loose when working out. Durable material but not too thick. [SEP] You get camel toe with this!! It‚Äôs upsetting to not have noticed that before I removed the tags. It‚Äôs not pure black leggings either. It‚Äôs more heather black. I don‚Äôt think this is as cute as in the picture. It is high wasted though so that‚Äôs a positive side of this. [SEP] These leggings are *chefs kiss*, super flattering, stretchy, and comfortable. These leggings do not fall down and you cannot see through them. 10/10!! [SEP] I am 5' 10"" (fit 155lb to 165lb) and they fit well. I bought these to compare to Gym Shark brand and they are almost as nice, slightly less soft, but comfy. [SEP] Love these leggings! They make your legs/butt look so nice and are super comfortable. No camel toe, doesn't get too hot, and they stay nice and tight.<br /><br />Would definitely repurchase these in more colors! [SEP] Great",3,True

[SEP] The design on this komono is lovely. The material isn't my favorite, though. It's a bit on the rough side. I like having things like this around to throw on in case a visitor comes over and I don't feel modest enough. For that purpose it works fine. It's not a flattering length at all, though, at least on me. I think it would look a great deal better if it were longer. Kimonos have great potential to be elegant and pretty, but this one just looks awkward to me. [SEP] My daughter loves this bright colored Kimono.  This top is a one size fits all.  Made of 100% polyester.  She likes to wear this Kimono over another top.  It has an open front.  It is a bright yellow color with wonderful print of ferns.  There is a tie on the front should you want to tie this top instead of leaving open to flow.  This is a very nice Kimono by Orchid Row.  She loves it. [SEP] This is such a comfortable top for spring and summer.  It is light weight and airy.  It gives you some coverage from the sun or to keep some modesty, but still leaves you feeling comfortable and cool.  It is very flattering.

Love these!:)<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful.:) [SEP] Awesome pants, good quality material, breathable, suitable for all year wear.<br />I wore them in a very cold, windy environment and was feeling great, warm but not hot, very comfortable.<br />Material is off medium thickness, not see through or clingy, doesn‚Äôt accentuate any skin flows, stretchy, feels pleasant against bare skin.<br />Great design-definitely not leggings style more like yoga or lounge pants, slightly baggy through the thighs and thinning out down the ankle with a cuff at the bottom.<br />Looks exactly as presented in pictures posted in this listing even the color was captured better by their photographers than by my phone‚Äôs camera.<br />In regards to the fit-for some reason Amazon recommended me to get XL, but its 12/14 and my regular size is 8-10 so I choose to go with Large and it fits me perfectly.<br />Waist has a wide stretchy band than can be easily adjusted according to your personal preference whether you like it high waisted or wear a bit lower.<br />Length is perfect for me as well-not too short or to long, just right and I‚Äôm an average height woman-5‚Äô5/5‚Äô6.<br />All in all like these pants, would probably get another pair in different pattern and recommend it to anyone looking for casual, comfortable pair of leisure wear üëçüèª [SEP] The material is incredibly comfortable. They can be dressed up or dressed down. I love that I can lose weight or gain weight and they will fit because I'm a yoyo with my weight unfortunately due to primary lymphedema. Highly recommend. I'm 5'4"" and 223 lbs and got the XXL. 4 [SEP] I'm 5'6"" 135 lbs.  I read the reviews and decided to get the M and the L to see which fit best.  Many of the reviewers stated that the pants run a little small.  But, I found out, for me, that the Medium fits best.  The Large was a little baggy.  These pants don't fit skin tight like regular yoga pants.  That's exactly what I wanted.  I don't wear them for working out.  I wear them as casual and/or dress pants.  They are really cute with a wedge heel for dressier outings.  I can also wear them with my athletic shoes and they look good. I got the burgandy color and they are spot on in color.  Also, the inseam is 29"" which is good for tall girls with long legs.  They might be a tad too long for someone 5'4"" or under. [SEP] These Paola women's jogger and/or yoga pants are fabulous!!! They fit me perfectly and I'll be wearing them frequently! And I love the color of a burgundy wine. Who says workout clothes have to be boring?! I'm thankful these fit so I can try even harder with my workouts when I'm able to wear clothing that I like that fit correctly. The pants are high-waisted which I need, there's a side pocket on each side along with a hidden pocket on the inside back waistband. This hidden pocket is not closed with a zipper so I have some concerns about that not being secured and hidden item would need to be waterproof because of sweat during workouts. Perhaps you could put money and keys in a zip lock bag to keep moisture away. ? Anyway, I like the large waistband and the cuffed ankles to keep pant legs away when excercising or biking. These pants fit snug but would still be snug if you lost 10 or 20 pounds because the fabric is a 4-way stretch. I'm pretty excited to have these yoga pants. I have an elliptical machine and a stationary bike at home and sometimes I go to our community center to walk when the outside weather is awful and they also have a treadmill which I like. I'll be wearing these pants sometimes. Really nice! [SEP] These joggers are soft and comfortable. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and weigh 130.  I wanted them to fit loose and longer, so I purchased a large. [SEP] I absolutely love these pants!! I will be buying more in other colors! [SEP] I love these joggers. They are perfect for working out. Not too lose but comfortable.<br />I wear a 10-12 and bought a large. I want another pair! [SEP] I love the high waistline and the pockets.",3,True
LICKLIP Women Panda Pajamas Set Cute Cartoon Animal Print Top Bamboo Drawstring Pants Two Piece Sleepwear with Pockets,['Drawstring closure'],[],,3.5,4,2130,"I was expecting a lightweight pajama set so was pleasantly surprised when I discovered these are heavier than I expected and even cuter in person.  Loving on bamboo fabric [SEP] These pajamas are very comfortable. They are very soft to wear. They are very nice.<br /><br />They are flattering and look attractive. They seem durable and well made. The fit it fine. They are a good thickness, not too hot but nice coverage.<br /><br />These are good for anyone, from a teen to an older woman. They really look nice and work well. They are great to sleep in.<br /><br />They would make a nice gift.  I would recommend them. [SEP] The fabric is just wrong for pj's. The shirt is a no go completely, I will hold onto the pants though for lounging. Really odd fabric choice, who wants to lounge around in what feels like a loose rash guard set... [SEP] This PJ is okay. It fits true to size, at least the shirt. The material is lightweight and cool to touch but there is not even a tag to see what kind it is. It's well stitched but the pants waist is too tight for my comfort. It's squeezing me to the point of discomfort. I do not know how others like their PJs and lounge pants, but I like them loose and comfortable and these pants are not comfortable. I am a bit disappointed that I didn't like them more.",3,True

The straps are lightly padded and that definitely makes it more comfortable to wear for a long day. I'm pleased to see the cups are sized correctly and don't gape. I've worn this bra three times now while working on a travel trailer remodel and it has been completely comfortable. It doesn't ride up or pinch and the back hooks are covered so they aren't pressing into my skin. There is plenty of support as well for those of us on the larger end of things. [SEP] As someone who doesnt often wear a bra, this isn't too uncomfortable. I can tell its on, but I am not itching to take it off. It fits surprisingly well. I am plus sized but dont have the boobs to go with it, which can make it hard to find a bra. I need the side support in the form of wide rib bands, the wider shoulder bands are nice as the bra doesnt dig in. The cups are soft but foamy- definitely lends added structure and smoothness. The ""push up"" part is more in the overall cup and how it lays rather than there being a padded shelf to hoist them on--they should take that out from title description-- misleading. If you want that, you wont get that here. I failed to see the term push up in the description, so I am glad i doesnt do this. I just wanted a more structured and comfortable underwire bra for days I actually wear a bra (or wear something more than super basic soft cup with no structure).<br /><br />5 stars because I will actually wear this. Have blown too much money on bras I immediately hated (and cant return because of nature of garment). [SEP] I have washed this bra four times and no matter what I do, I cannot get rid of the terrible smell. I wish it was just a chemical smell, but it's much worse than that. I am sad about this because it is actually very well made and fits very nicely. I'm not sure if it is just this bra, or if they all come with the smell. But, it is enough that I cannot recommend it. [SEP] It looks nice. The straps are comfortable. It fits a little larger to me. Only thing I hate is the wire. It hurts the on sides. [SEP] First off I was pleasantly pleased that this fit as expected as so many bras don‚Äôt when you order online. Second this was so comfortable. It fit in all the right places, did not dig in, the straps did not slip off my shoulders. I actually cannot wait to purchase more of these bras in different colors! [SEP] This fit as expected for my size. I love the wide straps. They didn‚Äôt cut into my shoulders. They also stay on shoulders good. I was afraid they would slide down. There‚Äôs one spot on both sides that rubs a little but not bad. I think it will be fine after washing and wear a few times to break in. It‚Äôs very comfortable. [SEP] A good supporting bra that is also comfortable and easy to wear. I like the wider straps at the top of the shoulder. I I I usually have a problem with slippage of the straps and they stayed in place all day. The material is comfortable and breathable. A nice touch of femininity in a full support bra. [SEP] Comfortable. All day wear without issues. [SEP] Usually bras are either pretty or functional. This one is both cute AND ultra comfortable. I wore it for 14 hours the first day. I barely noticed it was on even with the underwire. It fit so perfectly. I love that it lifts in all the right places without padding in the cups. The straps are wide and cushioned offering extra support. The lace around the bottom and the bead ornament in the middle give this bra a beautiful look. I cannot recommend this bra enough.<br /><br />***Update - did I tell you how much I love this bra?! I really do. I've gotten a couple of compliments on my shirts since wearing it. Shirts that I have worn for years. My mom said she couldn't place her finger on it but the shirts seem to fit better. I changed and put on a different bra and sure enough it made a difference. I can't wait until they come out with more colors, maybe lighter colors. [SEP] Loved the fit around and the straps but the cup size is WAY too big. Definitely not a C cup",3,True

[SEP] I don't know about any special healing properties, but this is definitely a nice piece. The copper is very trendy, and it would pair well with any outfit or style. Definitely a keeper. [SEP] I can‚Äôt speak to the healing properties of copper, but I will say that my brother has worn a small copper bracelet for years & swears by it!<br />Regardless, these are very pretty & each one has a different design - 3 are wider bands & 1 is a rope style.<br />I have big wrists & these come already large, but they‚Äôre easily squeezed for a custom fit. The weight & thickness of the metal is decent as they don‚Äôt feel flimsy or easily breakable.<br />They come in a small burlap drawstring bag with a card from the company saying they‚Äôre ‚ÄúLovingly Handerafted‚Äù (somebody there needs spellcheck!)<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this & hope it‚Äôs Helpful!) [SEP] It's copper so yes, expect this to turn once the initial finishes wears off; it's not something you will want to wear all the time. I've long heard about the healing power of copper and was curious. Admittedly, I'm skeptical but figure if there was any benefit, it should be able to come through the cynicism. I found no benefit. It's a cute bracelet, looks cute, provides no real benefit to me at least. [SEP] I have little confidence that magnetic copper bracelets heal, but I will try anything once.  My positive review of this item should not be taken as evidence that this works, but only that the bracelet is well made and is made from good quality copper.  The design on the outside is nice and interesting, although of the various versions available, I prefer the hammered design.  My only complaint is that the end pieces which hold the magnets is poorly designed and looks like an afterthought. [SEP] Beautiful bangles! I can't vouch for whether or not the magnets do anything but I can say that I'm very happy with these bracelets. They are very pretty and can be worn alone or together. They are easy to put on and take off. [SEP] This magnetic bracelet is beautiful and adjustable for any wrist size. I appreciate that it doesn't turn my skin green or brown, which usually happens whenever I wear jewelry that is not solid silver or gold.<br /><br />As far it hasn't done anything for my carpel tunnel pain, but even without any healing properties it is still a nice accessory. [SEP] I wanted to try this Copper Bracelet because I‚Äôve suffered from de Quervain's tenosynovitis (or tendonitis) for a few years now.. I had surgery last summer but after my daughter was born this year it came back and started to bother me again. I know it didn‚Äôt state it would be able to help with that kind of ‚Äútendon‚Äù pain, but I thought it was worth a try. Well long story short, it did not help with the pain but looked very pretty. It was lightweight and very easy to bend. I wore it for three days, taking it off during the night. On the third day I noticed discoloration on my wrist.<br />Other than that, I was pretty happy with it.",3,True

It reminds me of dress pants from the '90s. They have a little bit of shine, and they are loud. Like polyester. They just weren't quite the right look for me. The fit is great. I'm just not digging the fabric- which is purely personal preference. [SEP] These are very slimming.<br /><br />These pants are great. They are are extremely versatile and many people just live in them.<br /><br />These pants are very comfortable. I like them a lot. They fit nicely and feel very good.

They have a nice look to them. They are flattering.<br /><br />They feel durable. I am pleased with the quality. They are reasonably priced. I would recommend these. [SEP] These pants are made of just the right weight of fabric [SEP] These pants were way too large, even though I ordered the same size I usually am, 6P. The material was weird too, it felt like that cheap polyester stretchy material that I feel like looked too cheap for work. [SEP] These are flattering and the crop is quite flattering to most legs-even thick ones like mine. However, this appears to be a line that does vanity sizing, so I would order at least 1 size down. Usually I am a solid 4 in most pants but a 4 is a bit too big for me. [SEP] These are fantastic pants. They're super flattering in the way they are cut, the fabric is high quality and really easy to move in, and the overall look is incredibly Lux. [SEP] Somehow these pants were made wrong. Petite is below heel and calve is wrinkled because too tight. [SEP] These pants have a long rise.  My wife is petite - 5'2"" and size 6 - and these were too long from the top through the crotch, causing them to be ill fitting.  Her friend, who is taller, 5'7"" and size 6 tried these on and they fit great.  Both of these women have birthed 4+ children and the pants have enough room. [SEP] For the most part, these pants fit fine, but the waist is much too big. I ordered a Size 8, and there is a good 4"" overhang. There are no belt loops, so I won't be able to wear anything that tucks into the pants because the waist will droop. I wouldn't want to go down another size, though, because everything else fits perfectly.  Any top I wear with these will have to be long enough to cover the waist. I might try some safety pins to pull it in some. Hopefully with a nice, loose sweater, I can hide the droopy waist and get some good wear out of these. [SEP] These pants are very comfortable and they look really good. I'm usually a size 10 in pants but in the description it says to order a size down so I got a size 8. They fit good but I feel like they are still a bit loose and I could've gotten away with a size 6. They are ankle length as described so no surprises there. The reason why I got them was because I know nydj makes flattering clothing but I am not sure if these pants are. They fit and look good but I dont feel like they do anything slimming like they advertise. They are just like leggings but more expensive. I don't think that they are worth the price.",3,True

The Y-back feels a little odd but that's because this is the first tank of that design I've worn so I think it comes down to personal preference.  Overall I like this shirt a lot, although I think I prefer the hooded tank top a little bit more but that's just my personal preference and that I like the option of having a hood in case of drafts in the gym, etc.  If you want a Y back tank to show off your shoulders, back, and arms then this is for you and at this price it beats most anything you'd get at a a department store or sporting goods store that charges more for a name brand.  I think it also looks better than most stuff you'd find at department stores at this or even higher price points. [SEP] I liked how they fit but the material is a real nipple rubber. [SEP] These are great shirts at a great price. [SEP] i bought these in hopes of avoiding having my nipples rubbed raw during a long run.

Men's Biking Pants Mountain Bike Shorts Loose-Fit with 3D Padded MTB Cycling Underpants,[],[],,4.0,26,11140,"Not a huge fan of these shorts.  There is no front pockets, and the rear pocket is a zipper close and is just odd to use.  The underwear is uncomfortable and made me feel like I had a loaded diaper on.  I don't ride bikes so maybe these work well for that activity.  The shorts did fit well as did the underwear.  THey washed fine and no issues with shrinkage.  Maybe these would work better for bikers but they just didn't work for me. [SEP] Just what I had been looking for. I ride a motorcycle and after a few hours certain areas of my backside starts to get sore. These will help me go a little further in a day compared to without. As for the outer shorts, I personally really like them. Only down fall for them is Id like more pockets. I wont be wearing the paid together cause I dont wear shorts on a motorcycle but they are soft, quick drying shorts. [SEP] I've had three piece suits, but never three piece shorts. This was a first. These are in three parts - a pair of shorts, a pair of undershorts, and an insert to pad your rear.<br /><br />The shorts manage to be baggy but still slightly small in places. The underwear fits fine, although for the sake of sanitation I' would recommend regular underwear under it. The printed bum-padding does help alleviate the discomfort of the bicycle seat, but it takes a bit of getting used to. The feeling is odd and not entirely pleasant, it needs to be adjusted when you sit, and it moves around when you aren't riding the bike. A bit Rube Goldberg, but it does feel more comfortable [SEP] These are great cycling shorts! The padding is just as thick/soft as the ones in my training bib. The waist is snug and the leg holes feel loose giving your groin plenty of fresh air to breathe. I used these on a 20 mile ride and my bum felt pretty good afterwards. Of course, this is subjective for many factors e.g. physical acclimation to hard road bike seats, but regardless the extra cushion these shorts provide will make a huge difference if you plan on cycling for more than 30 minutes. [SEP] This Outfit of Shorts feels nice and Cool, Soft and definitely gives you Padded Protection where you need it when riding your Bike. They‚Äôre made of 98% Polyester and 2% Spandex, which means they will dry within Minutes of getting Wet, especially when you‚Äôre out and riding around. They Air dry within Minutes of leaving your Washing Machine, if you put them in an area with Fresh Air flowing.<br />  Personally, I‚Äôm torn because they would‚Äôve been a great thing when I was a Kid and my tiny Seat on my Bike was Solid Plastic but, it feels like I‚Äôm wearing a Full Diaper when I have them on. I don‚Äôt mean to be Gross but, it‚Äôs what I feel. I figure that, as with much in this life, you will get used to it and the Benefits will outweigh the Odd feeling.<br />  I think they‚Äôre made well though and Rating this Set by that, I would say they earn 5 Stars but I need to pull 1 or 2 simply because, it should have a personal feel too and like I said, they feel a bit weird to me. [SEP] I can‚Äôt really comment on the fit because a xxl was what was sent to me, which was too large, so my review is based off features rather than the fit of the shorts.<br /><br />This item comes in 2 pieces - the bike shorts and athletic shorts to go over the bike shorts. The bike shorts are made of a nice breathable material and can stretch to fit. The padding is very thick, so if you‚Äôre looking for cushion, there‚Äôs no lack of it in these shorts.<br /><br />For me, I didn‚Äôt really like the athletic shorts that came in the pack. While they are very light, they are almost like swim shorts rather than actual athletic shorts. It is nice that a reflector is built into the back pocket and they are quick-drying, but they aren‚Äôt really my style.<br /><br />Pros :)<br />- bike shorts are nice and breathable<br />- thick padding<br />- lightweight material<br /><br />Cons:(<br />- didn‚Äôt like the athletic quick-drying shorts [SEP] Never own a padded bike shorts so I don‚Äôt have anything to compare it to.  However the fabric is soft and of a light weight material. I‚Äôm a medium (unfortunately they sent me an XXL). So the padded tights fits on me loosely, and not snug like it should. Might be the reason why it feels a bit weird because it was sagging in the baddest area.<br /><br />There is a good amount of cushioning, so for bike riding I think it should do the job. The outer short does have a back zipper  pocket (about 2‚Äù deep) and a draw string. By using the drawstring It does fit me loosely. I‚Äôm a size medium 32‚Äù waist. And even though this is XXL, it definitely feels more like a large than an XXL.<br /><br />Over all i‚Äôll Probably end up just wearing the outer shorts for basketball etc, because the inner part is just too lose to feel comfortable. [SEP] These have allowed my husband who rides his bike a lot to have that extra support and cushion on his rear end. The padding is very comfortable. They have been washed many of times without any wear or fade. They fit him perfectly. Highly recommend these for someone who is experiencing pain in the rear from riding a lot. [SEP] My husband really likes these.  He says they fit as expected and feel comfortable, not to mention they have a handy pocket for keys.<br /><br />Now, if the bike would just be delivered. [SEP] We've just started riding our bikes again after a bit of a hiatus, and man did I forget about how sore your gluteus maxiimus can be after a short 5 mile ride! Trying these padding bike shorts I thought was worth a shot, after all, I had seen the ""real bike riders"" with them so I figured this amateur could benefit. I was right! They were snug fitting, yet still comfortable, breathable and made a huge difference in my ""seat"" comfort. They laundered very well, not twisting of the seems or shrinking - I only dried them for about 3-5 minutes as with most of my athletic wear I was concerned about the nylon being compromised from too much heat. I will most definitely purchase another pair.",3,True

She has already lost a couple of pairs of sunglasses at work. She's been in need of some inexpensive yet functional sunglasses. These have been nicer than expected. I would consider these to be better than dollar store quality. They're not high end quality either, but they're definitely decent enough to wear out and about. And they're perfect for her to wear to work! They come in a variety of bright colors. They do a good job of protecting her eyes from the sun. They would be great party favors! [SEP] I've got kids. During the summer, sunglasses are pretty much disposable with them. This pack is great because you get a LOT of them, and they are pretty cheap. So when they inevitably break or get lost, no worries- we have more! This pack would probably also make a great goodie bag prize for a birthday part or something similar.<br />So far, my kids are very much enjoying these. I put one on for a bit, and they aren't really my style as an adult, but I'm pretty sure they aren't meant to be. I think they are perfect for what they are.

Super cute! [SEP] These are so much better in quality than I anticipated! They are comfortable to wear, decently made. The only major thing is that some of the arms are loose on the hinge, but an eyeglass repair screwdriver fixes that easily.<br />The 10 pairs in assorted colors are brightly colored and look good. I actually have put pairs in my cars, stroller, bags, desk, so I am ready to walk out the door without any cares and any time.<br />The size is great for my normal sized head, they also look good on my teenagers. The lenses are dark without being either too dark or too light.<br />Really, for the price, look and quality these are a no brainer, and not just as party favors!

I bought these for my family as we head on vacation to a water park, for the price I won't be as mad when they leave them or break them. Fun colors! [SEP] I hate leaving g reviews for a product that doesn't meet my expectations. The words,""party favor"" is a big tip off. You can get nicer glasses at the dollar store [SEP] So, I recently got put into contacts. For the first time in years, I was out of glasses and could wear my big, bug-eye sunglasses. I was so happy. I went out and immediately bought a pair of sunglasses that I wore for two months straight. I never left the house without my sunglasses.<br /><br />When I saw these, I thought about my kids. I thought ""I can get these for the boys and they can pick out sunglasses to match their outfits."" The day these were delivered, just before the mail ran, my 8-year-old picked up MY sunglasses, and broke them.<br /><br />So, we split these. They aren't dark enough for my liking, but I love that I can match my sunglasses with my outfit. They fit well on my small face and are comfortable when I push them up on my head. I do miss my old sunglasses, but these work well and the boys love them! [SEP] Kids loved them and they were big enough for my big adult sized head! [SEP] These glasses are fun colors and just great for having fun with different outfits or little giveaways. Maybe a good party favor for older kids.

Fabric feels soft to the skin.<br /><br />Wash before wearing advises the company in cold water.<br /><br />Stretchy!<br /><br />My husband would be very happy with these briefs if the fly wasn't sewn shut.

There is no current price listing for these, but as a lesser known  brand, I would expect them to be a better value.<br /><br />The fabric of these is lighter than his other ones, and that is a good thing here.  The elastic is more comfortable for him, too.  Overall, he really likes these.  There is no fly opening, but he never uses that anyway, even on his that have the opening.<br /><br />Once these are available again, you'll have to comparison shop, but if they are reasonably priced, I'd certainly get them for him again. [SEP] When it comes to underwear, most dudes tend to fall in one or two categories: either you are a brief (triangular cut) person, or you are a boxer (square cut) person. I belong to the latter category, as I absolutely cannot stand briefs. One would figure how hard can it be to find a good pair of boxers, Oh No, I'm fully convinced the easier it appears, the more difficult it is. In a simple pair of boxer underwear, I look for these qualities:<br /><br />  1. Style (good looking)<br /><br />  2. Comfort (the lower half making the Crowned Jewel happyüòãüòÖüòùüòõüòÇ)<br /><br />  3. Plain & Simple (no polka dots, no bananas, etc)<br /><br />  4. Affordable (I don't need designer boxers costing me $20/pair)<br /><br />The VERDICT:<br /><br />  Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I ordered these because they fit all of my selection criteria above. Frankly, I didn't expect much, as most boxers I've come across just didn't live up to one or more of the aforementioned criteria, either not comfortable, doesn't fit as expected, weird (sometimes embarrassing designs)or just too pricy for a simple pair of boxers - it's nearly impossible to find a brand of boxers that live up to all of my expectations.<br /><br />  Note: There's no fly on these boxers, so if you prefer your boxers with fly, these may not be for you. For me, and I'm sure many men out there, this is really not an issue. C'mon, we men are lazy, we try to do as little as possible whenever possible - WHEN was the last time you actually took out your 'baby"" and shove it through the ""fly zone""? That's A LOT of work!!! üòÇü§£üòÇüòÇIf you're like me (& most men), you just whip it out over the elastic waist band and do your things, right? üòÅüòÜüòÅüòÜüòâüòâüòâ<br /><br />Look no further, pardon my pun, these Awesome 360 Boxers, which come in a pack of 5 pairs in plain gray & black elastic waist band, are simply AWESOME! I will order more, these will be my go-to boxers, they're so comfortable! Absolutely LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è it! [SEP] These are nice boxer briefs: soft, stretchy, but they fit somewhat strangely. The leg portion hangs almost like regular boxers as opposed to stretching around my thighs. I have never had this problem with other underwear, so it may just be a fit issue with this particular brand.<br />Also, there is no fly in the front. I really prefer having that, but I guess that's just a personal thing. [SEP] Bought these for my hubby as backups...and he said to donate them.  They don‚Äôt have an actual slit in the front.  It‚Äôs like a faux pocket in jeans...makes no sense for men‚Äôs underwear. [SEP] First off I wear boxer briefs.  When I grew up you either wore boxers (usually made out of cotton with no elastic) or you wore briefs (spun cotton that gave you support).  When they combined the two, I was in hog heaven.  The comfort of a boxer but the support of a brief  This is how I base my review and taking into consideration cost.<br />First off, as many have noted, this does not have a fly front (Y front for the Brits).  This is nice for obvious reasons.<br />The fabric is very thin so it does not give much support.<br />As the fabric is mostly polyester, it should last but the  briefs will probably loose even more shape.<br />The one good thing is the price at $5 which is about what they are worth.  I will probably stick to better known brands and wait for the Black Friday sales where I  can get a much better product at about double the cost.",3,True

Really like the strip at the top as it helps control eyeglasses fogging. Not too thick so easy to breathe through. Very cute too. [SEP] Good quality‚Ä¶.does its job.

Anti Blue Light Blocking Glasses Women Men Eyewear Frame Transparent LensÔºàTwo pointsÔºâ,[],[],,2.8,23,7354,"Good glasses with solid frame. They help reduce stress on the eyes when working on the computer for long periods of time or simply while watching TV. [SEP] Reasonably well constructed non-corrective glasses. Comes with a little blue light flashlight to confirm that shorter wavelength light is blocked by the glasses, which it does. Looks cute in a librarian way on my wife. [SEP] I purposely chose these because the eye-portion is very large and I don't care what I am wearing when I am working from home, but I do care about what I ""read"" about blue light and eye strain and affecting sleep patterns.<br /><br />I usually wear contacts, so grabbing these light weight blue light blocker glasses is very easy (I have bad eye sight, so regular glasses can be heavy, and of course these are very light and comfortable to wear)<br /><br />I wear them in front of my computer monitor all day and I think the blue light blocker portion does work and I really have been getting a good night's rest! 5 stars for that! [SEP] It comes in a simple packaging with a blue light test. The glasses look nice - yet simple. I am a petite female Asian, so I don‚Äôt have a Caucasian nose like my husband. I have a recessed nose bridge near my eyes and unless there are adjustable pads to support the glasses up high on my nose, they always fall down to the middle of my nose leaving me to be looking at the upper frames in the middle of my eyes.  These glasses have no nose pads at all., so that‚Äôs a problem for me since I‚Äôm Asian. People with straight or larger noses won‚Äôt have this problem.<br /><br />I use a lot of 6 inch cellphones, 12 inch tablets and 40 inch large screened computers displays, so it get exposed to a lot of the blue light, actually near or actual UV light. The don‚Äôt give a spectrum chart to know the cutoff point of the so-called blue light.  And I don‚Äôt know how much UV light is being emitted from the displays. And holding cell phones and tablet close to you face can be worse than looking at a large screen PC display. With a large monitor, you move further back from the display. It‚Äôs all about how much light is hitting your eyes, setting you up for cataract surgery earlier than usual. My husband just had cataract surgery and it didn‚Äôt go well - $3500 mostly wasted (variable Fresnel lenses).<br /><br />Anyway, I got two pairs of eye glasses; one of the frames is clear and the other frame is black. It comes in simple packaging along with a blue light test. The glasses look nice - yet simple. Again, I am a petite female Asian, so I don‚Äôt have a Caucasian nose like my husband. I have a recessed nose bridge and unless there are adjustable pads to support the glasses up high on my nose, they always fall down to the middle of my nose. These glasses have no nose pads at all.  So before I know it, I have the upper frame right across the center of my eyes.  So I usually just put them away somewhere and give them away. I‚Äôve finally had to decide that unless the glasses have nose pads on them, I can‚Äôt use them.<br /><br />The glasses are not heavy but not too light either. I tried the clear framed one first.  I could see a yellowish discoloration in the lens, which was too distracting to continue to wear them.. While the black frame fits the same, it is far too prominent on me and makes the glasses look nerdy.<br /><br /> I don‚Äôt think it blocks blue light. It didn‚Äôt take but a few minutes to give me a bad headache. The longer I wore them, the worse my headache became very bad.  It‚Äôs much better not to wear any glasses in my case.<br /><br />It might work for other people but not for me. People have different opinions and experience. The price is not bad, but it would be nice if it actually blocked blue light ‚Äì not impressed. [SEP] such an awesome product [SEP] These fit my husband great and he‚Äôs got a large(ish) head/face.  He‚Äôs in front of a computer, or phone screen, all day and these seem to help him sleep better.  Not sure of all the effects, but with the handy little blue light testing kit, you can see they work.  He wears them daily now.  They are lightweight and comfortable, As well as durable. We would definitely recommend. [SEP] Overall, I do recommend these anti-blue light blocking glasses for women and men! As you may know by now, staring into a computer or phone screen kind of what I am doing right now LOL is not good for the eyes! These glasses take out the blue light so it basically makes it easier on your eyes and helps you sleep better at night if you were looking at a screen later at night! The style looks good the color is good and to my experience the lights work so I do recommend them! Please let me know if you found this review helpful! :) [SEP] I did not notice a difference between using these glasses or not.  I also did the different tests to see if it was blocking blue light and they did not appear to work.  I get regular migraines and struggle wearing glasses for long periods of time, and these were no different.  I could not wear them for long without them causing a migraine.  I'm bummed.  I was really hoping they would work. [SEP] I've owned a couple different types of these ULTRA CHEAP blue blocking glasses.  They are always made by some company that you've never heard of before and cost next to nothing.  I don't think they are really blocking blue light, and I recommend that if you value your eyes you would buy a pair from a reputable company.  I'm not sure they are really doing anything.  My very nice pair of prescription glasses has a blue blocking feature and you can see the difference in tint when you move from one to the other.<br /><br />On these the lenses are clearly very low quality, with occlusions (blurry spots), sometimes like looking through a plastic bottle.<br /><br />I just think my eyes are worth more than that. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:9158bc23168397102b9b5cb44e746140]] There is a lot of talk about how the upper end of the blue spectrum blocks melatonin and affects our sleeping patterns.  So you can do your own research but if you are curious about how to block the blue, the new technology makes it easy. You simply use blue blocking glasses that don't appear to do anything to your vision --- but you make notice the ability to sleep increases at night.  The video here shows how powerful they are at blocking the light but they don't change anything else. I had this added to my prescription glasses and sleep was actually faster and deeper. Could be in my head but it was definitely in my bed!",3,True

These are a great alternative to leather and fabric bibs.<br /><br />What I like about this product:<br />- Made of Food grade silicone<br />- Made without  BPA free, lead-free, BPS free, Phthalate Free<br />- Easy to wash/wipe off, and dishwasher safe<br />- no drying time!<br />- Durable material<br />- Large/wide Food catcher<br />- love the colors<br /><br />the only downside so far is that sometimes it could be difficult to button without getting my daughters hair caught in it [SEP] We tried all the bibs with our grandson. Smocks, fabric with plastic coating, all fabric. These are the BEST hands down. They wash up in a less than two minutes. They catch all the food and milk to save the high chair liner and floor. Hands down our favorite bibs! [SEP] These are really cute but my 1 year old has long hair and his hair seems to get stuck on these and pulls. They are really soft but durable feeling, clean off well after using and hook nicely at the neck. Love the colors! [SEP] This bibs were just what I expected, good quality silicone, strong and easy to clean. The colors were perfect for the theme baby color my friends was going for and she loved them for her soon baby born. They are adjustable and big enough to hold on fallen food once the baby starts eating solids. Overall I was very satisfy with the quality, price range and use of it. [SEP] Nice bibs. Easy to put on and take off. The material is fantastic and super easy to clean. Just wipe down and done! The little pocket at the bottom helps catch falling food, crumbs, and liquid spills. Awesome! [SEP] It's silicone, durable, easy to clean and catches all of the food. The bibs are soft and made well. It's not too heavy either. This is the first time I've ever used silicone bibs and I like it. [SEP] After using Tommee Tippee for years I expected something very similar from this product.<br />Positives:  good coverage on shoulders and wide coverage on chest.<br />Nice subtle color.<br />Negatives: very heavy silicone. Hard to lock bib in place.<br />Unfortunately I will be returning the item and going back to Tommee Tippee. [SEP] We love these bibs! They are soft and easily pliable. These particular colors are very pretty which is a bonus. The bibs are amazing for just about any meal, especially soups! They are so much easier to deal with than cotton bibs that get stained and have to get washed and dried. Just clean them with soap and water and they are as good as new. They also have four adjustments at the neck so they will fit a child for a very long time. [SEP] As far as silicone bibs go, these are really nice ones. I've tried out the Tommee Tippee (which warp over time) ones for years and the Target brand ones recently. I would honestly say I like these the most compared to the competition. They are very easy to clean and I love the muted simple colors. The spill pocket is very wide, giving full coverage for any missed food. There are 4 neck fasteners that fit well. I used this for my daughter who is now 1 year old and the tightest button fits great, so these will fit her well for years to come. I tried it on my almost 4 year old and they fastened at the third button. Great quality bibs. I highly recommend trying these out. Very affordable too!

It was very soft.<br /><br />It was comfortable to wear. I also thought it was very flattering. It looked nice on. This would also make a nice gift. I would recommend it. [SEP] Totally beautiful. Exceeds my expectations for size, softness, quality of fabric and intensity of color. This drapes nicely from the weight of fabric and there is no static.  I can't wait to wear this all winter! Also, I got a chuckle out of the label on package. [SEP] This 'pashima' scarf is what I tend to notice anymore a generic label for a very soft scarf/shawl - yes, it has some wool (25%) and cashmere (25%) in it, with the rest being polyester, but I wouldn't consider it to be a true 'pashmina' scarf. That said, it is very soft and is thick enough that you don't see through it at all, unlike with most cashmere scarves (unless they are VERY expensive). It's almost 80"" long without the fringe, and almost 30"" wide, so it covers the shoulders and hangs down one's back, and can be wrapped around to provide warmth as a shawl or knotted in cute ways for a scarf.<br />It's very soft, definitely a nice touch around one's neck or against the face, and with the polyester in this I'm fine with washing it (delicate cycle, in a bag for protection, cold wash, hang to dry. The non-fringe ends look as if they were just cut, no stitched seems, but the material is such that as its worn, it should 'mat' together. All and all, this is a lovely, large wrap that's so soft and will provide some warmth during the cooler months at a great price point (especially considering the fact that I've lost a couple over time - I'll be sad but not as sad as if this was the real thing). Also, lots of color options. [SEP] It's so soft and luxurious that I love wearing it. And it's warm and attractive as well. Perfect as a light wrap for cool days or evenings, as a scarf, or over your coat for extra warmth. [SEP] I love scarves! I am also very picky about my scarves because of that though.  This is a soft wool blend that makes me want to wrap up inside like it's a blanket! Beautiful and soft, kept the wind off my neck and face while also looking stylish [SEP] This shawl is a big piece of semi-thick, soft black material with no knitting at all.  The ends are fringed.  It's nice and looks good, and it wraps around my shoulders nicely and feels good.  I will be wearing it this fall to football games.  If I machine wash it I will place it in a mesh bag and use something like Wool-Lite in cold water.  Then it gets laid out to dry. [SEP] This Crndzsis Womens Wool Pashmina Shawl Wrap has fleece-like texture and feels more like synthetic, than wool. I would really like it to be thinner and more cashmere-like, but it is what it is. Because of the thickness I won't be able to use it as a scarf (it'll be too bulky), or hide it in my purse when go out (just in case if it'd be colder, than I expected). It does keep me warm and does not attract hair and other particles in the air or around me.<br />Out of the package the  Shawl has a terrible smell and had to be washed prior wearing. [SEP] My wife likes this as this is a very basic wool shawl in black that will essentially go with anything.<br /><br />She has no complaints other than it is just very basic and simple and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. [SEP] Very nice, soft, and quite large shawl/scarf with fringe. This measures 27 inches by 64 inches excluding the fringe. I love the versatility of this. It works very well as a scarf in winter and also indoors in summer when the air conditioning is too cool. I find it very convenient to take on a cruises. It‚Äôs cold when I leave home and then when I travel to warmer weather, it does double duty as a shawl on the ship in the evenings when the A/C is too cold for me. You can tie it a zillion different ways or just wrap it around your shoulders. [SEP] This is a nice scarf - it's not bulky & thick, but it's long, wide, and warm. In addition to being a nice accessory, it will fit neatly under your coat. I did an Internet search of how to wear a Pashmina scarf and there are so many ways to wear it! Look for the cascading way - it's simple to do and shows off the nice fringe on this scarf. Yes, I'd recommend this scarf.",3,True
Orchid Row Women's Fashion Spring Summer Straw Hat with Bow Detail and Decorative Trim Tan O/S,[],[],,4.2,18,486,"Cute floppy summer straw hat , or for all year,(  I live in Ca,). with a black trim around the brim.<br />The hat  has a big bow on the back or side of the hat. Looks better if its in the back.<br />The bow is straw with the same trim as the hat has..<br />That said, I‚Äôm not a fan of bows, and I notice its tightly glued on, but can be taken off gently.<br /><br />This fits a bit big, but I think its supose too cause its floppy.<br />We have a beach place, and this is a perfect hat to keep the sun off my face, eyes, and hair. [SEP] This hat is very cute. We love hats. It looks so nice on. It really is snazzy. It is also cute to have for special occasions or in pictures.<br /><br />Of course it is also functional. It can help block the sun. We have a strong sun here in Florida, so for us that is very nice.<br /><br />It is very comfortable to wear. It fits well on the head. It doesn‚Äôt feel hot or tight at all. It feels pretty light.<br /><br />The quality is pretty good. It seemed durable, too. It is flattering. I would recommend it. [SEP] This is a great hat - very floppy and easy to travel with - scrunch it up in the suitcase, and it just pops back in shape.  I prefer it without the bow - the black rim is enough trim.  It‚Äôs best when the sun is high and you‚Äôre getting it from all sides, as this hat protects the face really well.  We‚Äôll be working out in our lavender fields in a couple months, and this will be the hat of choice.  Important to have a wardrobe of hats for all occasions. [SEP] The title calls this a floppy hat so I can't fault it for truly being one.  There's not a lot of structure in the brim and it does flop down.  I know a lot of younger adults like to wear their hats like that so I think they will like this if that's the style they want.  It looked a little funny on my older round face.  The hat itself is pretty.  It fit my head perfectly and I think I'm pretty average.  It's not super comfortable but it looks cute with the bow. [SEP] It fits.  I have a small head and I usually get caps from the kids section.  This floppy hat not only has a ruffle and a bow but it has an elastic type material inside the straw to keep the hat on. I hope this hat lasts forever.  It is by far the best hat of this type that I've owned. [SEP] This is a really attractive hat and I like it a lot on my smaller-headed friends.  It will not do for women with a large or XL head.<br />It is well made and will not fall apart with a couple of wearings.<br />It looks pretty enough for wearing with a casual dress.  I really like everything about it except the size. [SEP] I think this floppy hat is so adorable with its large bow in the back, the hat is made of the same straw material as the hat and it has a black decorative trim made of cloth. I live on the Southeast coast where the sun is pretty strong in the summer and this hat will be great to wear when I relax on the beach with a good book. Since the rim is pretty large, It will protect not just my head but also my face from the strong sun rays. The hat is a little bit loose on my head and it's not adjustable, but it stays on pretty well and I don't plan to do any strenuous activities while wearing it. But overall, my favorite feature of this hat is the large bow, it gives it a vintage look while looking fashionable. [SEP] I am not a hat person but I wanted a wide brim hat to keep sun off my face, especially when I am at the beach or walking around my neighborhood. But this hat could turn me into a hat person. It fits perfectly and looks great on. I am not sure what it is made of.. straw, jute,? but it is made well and the weave is tight but it is not a stiff material, kind of on the soft side but sturdy enough to have the brim hold up nicely. There is a matching bow that is delightful and sets this hat apart from other straw hats out there. I love the matching black trim on the rim of the hat and the bow as well. I am so pleased with this hat.<br /><br />However, I was not pleased with the shipping method. This hat was shipped in a big gray plastic shipping bag with no protection except for the bag itself. I live in an apartment complex where the mail ‚Äòboxes‚Äô are grouped together. My mail ‚Äòbox‚Äô measures approx. 12‚Äù x 4‚Äù and is a bit deep but this poor hat was actually stuffed into that small ‚Äòbox‚Äô. When I opened the bag and pulled out the hat, I thought it would not be able to be saved as it was so schmushed. I flattened the brim on my dining room table and stuffed the hat part with a towel to try to take out the indentations. I left it that way for a couple of days and thankfully, most of the misshapen areas are gone or at least minimalized where I don‚Äôt think they will be noticed. Luckily the bow and the trim on the brim were not damaged.<br />I do love this hat and the brim is a bit floppy which adds to the look but it is sturdy enough to keep it from falling in my face, even after the shipping fiasco .. I guess that actually proves that it is a high quality hat.<br />I love it!!",3,True

She is big for her age so I went a size up and I think that it will be big on her this year, but will fit just right next year. I already have plenty of clothes for her for this summer, so I am happy that she can wear this a few times this year and still have it for next year too. She has been asking to wear dresses a lot this summer while it has been so hot. The material is 100% polyester, so I am not sure just how breathable it will be. But since it is a dress, the cut allows for plenty of ventilation on a hot day, so that should help offset the polyester. The fabric is super stretchy so I think this will be very comfortable to wear. The colors are bright and vibrant with some neutrals mixed in so it isn't too over-the-top. These colors really appeal to young kids. The attention to detail with the stitching is very nice. This is the second item I have purchased from this company and I have been pleased with the quality of both of them. Based on my experience, I would be happy to purchase from this company again. [SEP] A wonderful cat themed dress",3,True

I like the fact that there's no tail and they are adjustable. Exactly what I was looking for but I found two downsides for me. First, even at it's tightest setting, they are still too big for me. It does prevent my glasses from falling off my face, but because it's still loose they still go halfway down the bridge of my nose. When I would rest my head on the back of my couch, they would push forward so I wasn't able to rest my head while watching tv. Also once you put these on your glasses, trying to get them off was quite a challenge. Kudos to the company for making them so secure, but I thought I was going to break the arms of my glasses trying to get them off, but I eventually did. So...overall I would recommend this product, maybe I just have a small head. LOL. [SEP] My husband suggested getting these to keep his glasses on while riding roller coasters. It was nice there were 3 in the pack as my son and I used them for our sunglasses as well. [SEP] Hard to adjust while on your head. Good it was a three pack, threw first one away because it stuck and wouldn't slide [SEP] They are very comfortable and super easy to adjust. They fit a variety of size frames I've used then on. [SEP] I normally use cablz brand, but couldn't pass these up, almost 3 for the price 1 cablz. Thought the square receivers would be bulky, but actually narrow and fit is just perfect. Quality is there and no concerns on my 3 new pairs of glasses ü§ì [SEP] I used the strap while in Hawaii and the strap worked well and stayed out of the way when wearing a hat. [SEP] I was concerned that my hair would get caught when I adjusted the strap. It does not pull your hair and is very easy to attach to your glasses and adjust. It is not ""tight"" on my head but will definitely keep my glasses on when I ride rollercoasters. Highly recommend. Shipped quickly in quality, reusable packaging. [SEP] Fits and holds tight. [SEP] Can quickly tighten and loosen to prevent glasses from sliding down your nose and for removal. Love the way they grip the ends of the arms & no obstruction on either side of the ears. [SEP] These eyeglasses straps are very good. Instead of going to the eye doctor to adjust my eyeglasses arms, instead I bought these eyeglass straps and it works very well and very durable. It latches on to the arms of the glasses doesn‚Äôt lose its strength and it keeps the eyeglasses in place while I‚Äôm wearing them.",3,True
10 Pairs Womens Wool Socks Winter Thermal Warm Socks for Women,[],[],,4.0,39,884,"These socks are perfect for Winter. They're thick, soft and warm. They come in fun colors and there's also a few neutral pairs. You get enough to keep a few and share with others. They also make a good gift for sock lovers.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] Being part wool these socks are a little itchy, no matter how many times they're washed/fabric softened they won't soften up to where I'd like.  I also noticed up on receipt they had a slight, strange chemical smell, but that went away after the initial washing.<br />They do seem to keep my feet warm though, so that's a plus. [SEP] This box contained a nice variety of colors of socks- in fact, I shared a few pairs with my teen daughter.  My favorites are the black ones- they almost look striped.  They are soft, warm but not too thick, and stay up nicely.  (It's a pet peeve of mine to have socks that slip down!)  They wash up just fine, no changes noted.  I wear a size 8-8.5 shoe and these fit me perfectly.  I'm picky with socks-- can't have seams that I can feel or be too thin-- and these meet my personal criteria perfectly.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this item for free in exchange for posting my honest review here. [SEP] If you need a big ol' batch of wool blend socks that aren't too bulky, these are perfect! They come in a big plastic bag (with stilted English instructions reminding you not to throw the bag into the ocean) but they're nicely individually wrapped with little brown paper labels -- I wrapped a couple up for a friend as a gift, and they felt nice even individually.<br /><br />The socks are of solid quality -- I like the scalloped edges at the tops. They're only crew socks though, and they're only about half wool, so these aren't for SUPER cold days. But for most of us, these will do just fine, and they don't feel too bulky or scratchy on your feet.<br /><br />Mostly, that value is great!!! [SEP] These seem like decent socks, but they don‚Äôt seem like your typical wool sock. They‚Äôre looser for starters, where other wool socks I‚Äôve owned have had a tighter fit. They‚Äôre also not terribly thick. They keep my feet warm while I‚Äôm around my house, but I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôd be something I‚Äôd wear for prolonged outdoor exposure in winter temperatures. The colors are cute, without being loud, and they are cozy. [SEP] Panvbo Merino womens wool socks are very nice socks, It keeps the feet pretty warm without being real bulky and it stay up and fit well. It comes with five different and styles and it is made of 53 % wool, 24% cotton , 16% polyester and 7% spandex. [SEP] When I see ""wool"" and ""thick,"" I think about hiking and keeping my feet warm while playing in the snow. Like the rest of my wool socks. My other socks are thick-thick, though. You walk on clouds in those things. They're two times thicker than these socks. These are more akin to standard sock thickness, except for the thicker ankle (more like what I think about when I see ""thick wool socks"").<br /><br />They're comfortable and fit me as a size 7 in most shoe sizes. They don't feel any warmer than regular socks, though. So we're 0-2 on what I consider to be staples of thick wool socks. I'm giving 4 stars because they're otherwise fine. They're cute, colorful, and functional. They have enough stretch to go over my heel and snap back into place. They're not living-in-a-dream soft and cushy (like those fuzzy socks you find all over the place before the holidays, or hiking socks with padded heels and toes) but, you know, it feels like you're wearing a regular sock. They keep my feet warm as much as regular socks do. The seam at the toe doesn't rub awkwardly and there's no extra give at the toe, either.<br /><br />I wouldn't try hiking in these and I wouldn't trust them to keep my toes warm in my waterproof boots in the snow, but I'll wear them otherwise! [SEP] Socks, feel comfortable . I like the colors, feel light, not tight around the toes.  Heel stays in place. give them 5 stars! [SEP] cute but don't seem to be wool. [SEP] I really like these socks. I look forward to putting them on in the morning and lounging around my house in them. I also pull them up over my skinny jeans or leggings when I'm wearing boots. They're warm, but not make-your-feet-sweat warm. They're actually pretty breathable. I love the different colors that came. They wash perfectly fine and keep their shape and quality in my regular wash and dry cycles. Would definitely order again.",3,True

The cut is good for movement and  doesnt limit my range of motion.<br /><br />The pockets are nice and large and the hood is nice and heavy so it will stay on in the wind. I needed to fluff up the fur but with the fur off of the coat it looks very fitted and trim. [SEP] It‚Äôs extra warm and has the extra large hood, like artic issue. [SEP] I was hesitant about buying a coat with such few reviews, but I'm glad I did. I am 5'9"" and 150 lbs with relatively long arms. The medium fits me very well. I could wear a hoodie under it if I wanted. I would say it fits as expected, perhaps a little on the larger size. The sleeves are long enough and I love the hand pockets on the outside. I love how long it is as well, it's like wearing a cozy blanket with the soft fleece material on the inside. The hood is nice a big and the faux fur has a zipper that you can detach. I prefer without but I'm more of a casual dresser. I still need to test it in the cold Michigan winters, but doing great so far during my cold morning walks right now.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/31/21: Unfortunately the zipper on the coat broke a few months after purchasing it. The coat, however, is still holding up well and keeps me very warm in the winter. I love how soft the inside material is. I'm going to try to fix the zipper because I really like the rest of the coat.",3,True

AULIV Genuine Leather Airpod Case,[],[],,3.2,25,9127,"I‚Äôd be afraid this would either damage my AirPods taking them out of the case or break the case. Very unimpressed with quality. [SEP] This leather case slipped right over my airpod case. It's designed for Airpod 2 but my original airpod case fits as well - a little more loosely, but still secure. Gives a nice, distinctive look, easily identified as mine if, say, I dropped it and some bozo picked it up and tried to say it's his in front of my friends. Worked extremely well in that instance! [SEP] The case is sturdy and attractive. The manufacturer needs to point out that it is NOT meant to hold air pods independently, but to hold the air pod case. There is a small loop on the side whose purpose is unclear, especially since it is so small. The manufacturer could have made it more useful by putting a metal ring in it. As sent, it seems incomplete. There are no instructions. The top flaps open and cannot be secured without the air pod case inside. I‚Äôm not sure I could recommend this without more development by the maker. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:e3990b6a6649ed3141243187525d72bd]] This case looks classy.  It is a hard plastic case with a paper thin layer of leather glued on the outside.  It looks durable but I would think the leather stickers might come off after some time.  The one thing I don‚Äôt like about this case is the double hinges (original case plus this case) make it harder to open the thing. It has the effect of pulling the AirPod Case up whenever I open the lid.  It does look nice.  ** NOTE:  I received this item in exchange for an honest review based on my own experience with it. [SEP] I'm really impressed by this case!  I was a little hesitant at first but I have to admit that I love it.<br /><br />The case looks wonderful!  The craftsmanship is really good and the leather looks very nice.  It has a very solid feel but isn't too bulky.  It is a little stiff when opening/closing but I suspect that will loosen as I use it more.<br /><br />I highly recommend this case! [SEP] When you would 1st open it the interior top part would get stuck on the ear buds & separate from the leather piece.  After time of breaking it in it no longer does that & works great. Easy to charge as well. Very happy with it!!!! [SEP] If you don't want the white egg looking case for your Airpod then this is a great pouch/skin/cover to use.  You open the case fully, slide your Airpod case in completely then fully close lid over top.  When you open next the lid on this will open your case for you revealing your buds.  There is a opening in the bottom for your charging port to be obstruction fee.  The exterior is nice soft leather, the interior is a hard durable plastic.  On the side is a small loop you can add a hook, key-ring, or cord to. [SEP] Nice product to hold your AirPods in. Genuine leather on the outside and a plastic insert of some sort in on the inside. Has a loop on the outside to hang out maybe to a book bag or keychain. There‚Äôs a cut out hole on the bottom for your charging port. Overall it‚Äôs nice but the one problem I had was getting the AirPods out of the case, its a little hard because you think you‚Äôre gonna break your AirPod lid.<br />NOTE : To get AirPods out open lid fully and it makes the AirPods case lift up inside of the leather and you can pull it out easier. [SEP] If you're going to purchase Airpods, you're going to want a good quality case. Not only does one want to protect the valuable and easily mislaid Airpods, but one would also like the case ideally to have a bit of quality if not elegance to match the underlying product.<br /><br />This is a good offering. Attractive quality. Set up for easy charging. Makes it more likely that one won't misplace these valuable ear buds. [SEP] Case does not stay closed unless you put AirPod case in there. With that said i‚Äôm Not overly excited about this it seems like it‚Äôs made on the cheaper side and not that great of a case once you get the AirPod case in there it does stay closed however it seems like it may want to rip on the backside",3,True

There is also good compression in the calf area.¬†<br /><br />I ordered the large/extra-large because I take a 9 to 9.5 shoe.

However, since they are on the large side, I'm passing them off to my boyfriend.¬†I have several pairs of these socks and have worn their¬†socks all day. It feels great wearing them. I also love the styles they come in.<br /><br />These are not only ""fun"" but they are medically helpful for my plantar fasciitis. I wash socks like these in a lingerie bag and lay them flat to dry.¬†Currently, there is no price listed on Amazon for these socks but I would expect them to be priced in the $12.99 to $16.99 range. The only reason I lowered my rating one star is because they are larger than the size specified; otherwise, these are 5-star socks in my opinion. [SEP] I use compression socks for my venous insufficiency and varicose veins. I use 20-30 mmHg nearly all the time, for a couple of decades now so I know what to expect and how they should feel. I replenish the socks often as they are not meant to last forever (the sock may hold up but the compression decreases over time). SO I am always on the look out for a decent compression sock. These are NOT IT. I will tell you why:<br /><br />The compression on these is about right. No real complaint there. Very important to select a size based not only on your foot size, but also on your calf size. If deciding between the two, I would aim for calf size or go to a different brand.<br /><br />They are thin in calf area. I sense these will lose compression sooner over later.<br /><br />One sock has a hole it in it that I noticed as I put it on. A hole with a run! No good! Also, if that weren't bad enough..<br /><br />One sock is way too long. It goes up over my knee nearly to my thigh. The other sock just goes to my knee (as it should). The socks SHOULD fit in such a manner that it goes to the knee, or just below. Not so far above that it is like a thigh sock. Makes them uncomfortable as the band will bite the skin.<br /><br />Maybe I just got a bad pair or maybe there is a bad batch. Regardless, I am disappointed. I CAN wear them, but again they have a hole and one is uncomfortably long. '<br /><br />To end on a positive, the foot is accurate for sizing. I have size 10/11 womens (8/9 mens) and the L/XL is suitable for womens size 8/12.5 and mens 8-14. I have room left over. Just also need to have a calf size within 14-19 range. My measurement is around 17""<br /><br />The foot has a slightly padded feel.<br />Toe seam sits on top of toes and not at toe nail (which is good thing)<br />Since there are so many design and color change, then know that there are corresponding threads on the inside. This is a not a positive but it isnt necessarily negative either.. it is just a detail I find worth mentioning as it may mean that some people may catch a toenail on the interior threads.<br /><br />If my sock didnt have a hole in it (and a run) and if the socks were the same length ending at or just below knee, I would have rated these a 4. But with the host of problems I can't recommend these nor will I ever purchase more from this brand. [SEP] Very nice looking compression socks. Got these for my brother in law who is a nurse and works 12 hour shifts. The colors and pattern are cool and make the socks fun. The material is also nice. It‚Äôs a soft and smooth cotton feel. They are super tight and stretchy at the same time. Hopefully these will help as compression socks for long hours. Easy to wear under scrub pants. [SEP] True compression sox that don't slip down or press too hard leaving large unsightly visible indentations. I really like the design they went with its very Battle Star Galactica 1978. I do love the color but blue sox that come up that high pick up everything off the floor. These are NOT thin nor are they Asian School girls uniform knee sox. These are thick and more durable I am hoping these will last me a long time but i wear boots a lot and most sox don't last more than six month before thinning out and getting holes. [SEP] These are pretty nice compression socks with a medium level of compression.  You can feel the compression but it isn't overly firm.  Like a nice comfort hug form your great aunt not a tight strangle hug from your uncle frank the kind where you get lifted off your feet.<br /><br />I wear a women's size 9W or 91/2 in shoes where my guy is a shoe size 12.  We have a pair of these socks in the L/XL which is listed as being able to fit either one of us.<br /><br />I have no complaints on this pair of socks.  The heel is in the correct location, the socks pull up and end just below my knee and, again, have a good medium compression.<br /><br />For my guy, the foot area and heel are perfect.  His difficulty is in the calf.  His legs are like GIANT turkey legs so needless to say this is a bit uncomfortable to not able to stretch out for his extra large sticks.  Not a nock on the sock but wanted to point it out.  Super large calves are gonna be uncomfortable in these.<br /><br />I washed/dried standard care.  No broken seems, no fading in color and no shrinking.  Material is comfortable to wear for long hours or for a rigorous workout. [SEP] I saw the design of these socks and just thought they were very cool looking, sort of reminds me of like Tron!<br />These aren't as tight as a pair I've gotten from another company but I kind of like the milder preasure, tighter then a regular sock for sure.<br /><br />If there's anything that I can think of that could be unsatisfactory to someone else, the listing makes these socks look like they go right above your calf, but they actually go above your knee (I'm 5'7)<br />I think it might've been nice to either have then at right above calf or further up the thigh then where they end up. [SEP] These socks offer a nice compression, however they are very long. They fit above my knees which can be uncomfortable.<br />Fabric is nice, no issues after washing them. Combination of colors and design looks amazing.",3,True

Orchid Row Womens's Fancy Multi Color Casual Cozy Knit Infinity Scarf and Beanie Set Green/White O/S,[],[],,3.6,15,6434,"Fairly ordinary scarf and hat.  Soft. Not the color listed, but that might just be an ordering glitch. It'll keep your neck and ears warm, but it's not particularly stylish. Strikes me as a nice gift for a youngster. [SEP] This Orchid Row Women's Fancy Multi-Colored Infinity Scarf and Beanie Set is well made, and pretty cute. The infinity scarf is convenient because it's just knit in a big circle, and can comfortably go around your neck twice, or even three times if you want a giant turtleneck-like look. The colors are off white and mixed black/blue, and the pom pom, made of faux fur is black. The fabric is 100% polyester and feels softly puffy. The only minor criticism I have, that may not apply to all, is that the rim of the hat can't be folded over due to it being fairly narrow, so this is a bit puffy w extra space at the top of my head. [SEP] I'm often not a fan of knit products because they often don't strike me as particularly warm, but I'm pleased to say this was an exception. The infinity scarf draped easily and looked cute, and within a minute or two felt like a soft hug. The hat was OK but not my favofite--the black puff on the top was a shiny black that didn't exactly match the yarn so I wouldn't wear it if I wanted to impress anyone, but for outdoor winter wear it's fine.<br /><br />Also, the ""green"" color is mostly black and white. There's a tiny bit of dark aqua blended in, but it's really only noticeable in the base of the hat. [SEP] For the price, I wasn't expecting much. The hat is meant for someone with a smaller head, so it was a bit of a tight fit to the point where you'd rather go with earmuffs. The infinity scarf was ok - it felt good and did good work protecting from harsh winter winds, but the quality isn't that great. I guess that you get what you pay for. Overall, it's fine and a rather basic set, deserving of a 2.5 star rating. [SEP] Fits great and is a gorgeous color! Very happy with this product. [SEP] One of those items that the picture looked better than real product. Ended up being a lot thicker and rougher than expected. The scarf is an infinity scarf but being so think found it got on the way. The hoodie is much better size but again the knitting could have been done with thinner yarn. Will have a hard time using this product. [SEP] A cute infinity scarf and hat set that will keep you cozy and stylish in cold weather! The set is made from acrylic yarn colors in cream, teal, and black. The beanie hat has a cute pom pom on top in a faux black fur which looks really cute--like you are going to a ski resort or out for a walk in the snow. The material is acrylic and it is a loose knit which was nice because the hat could fit a range of head sizes but could be prone to pilling.  I recommend hand washing the set in cold water before first use to add a detergent smell to them.  Nice product! [SEP] I absolutely adore this set! I'm really picky about material and these are amazing. Fluffy, soft and warm. I love the pom pom on the hat, it's very now, trend wise. The green color is subtle which I really like. The hat is tighter around the forehead so it will flatten curls or a specific hair style but otherwise it's perfect! [SEP] I love the colors!  Black and white with a little blue/green mixed into it.  Its a lovely matching set.  The hat is topped with a puffy pom pom which is cute as can be.  The scarf is longer than I expected and warm as well.  This look great with a little coat or with a more formal one.  The only minor complain is that the hat fits a little more snugly than I anticipated. [SEP] This is a great scarf and beanie set that looks great and is so comfortable and warm! The monochromatic colors work with just about any outfit. Downside is that it's a looser weave, so, and the threads can snag easily. But other than that, it's a great set for a great price.",3,True

The color is also a little brighter in person then I expected but it is still really nice. Seems to be made of good quality material. Thin enough to wear on warmish days.

You'll want to consider ordering a size smaller for your child, it's long but, that would make it cute worn as a dress with a pair of leggings or tights.  It's really well made and a very pretty shade of pink.  I love the style and would make a great addition to any child's wardrobe. [SEP] Very cute little short-sleeved sweater.

It's soft, comfy, made out of nice material, and true-to-size. 5 stars [SEP] Runs a little big, but very well made. The cotton knit is quite thick and a little stiff.

Good socks are the difference between blisters and not. I've worn these twice with my hiking boots just doing normal stuff and the socks are really comfortable. They fit properly and don't slide around when you're climbing a small muddy hill or over rocks.<br /><br />These are soft and feel good on the skin. The tops stay up, but they don't bind or leave marks on my legs. I've run these through the laundry twice and they haven't lost shape or elasticity. I'll definitely pack these on my next trip out to Big Bend in October. [SEP] These socks are crazy comfortable and warm. I'm the type of gal who can wear socks all day every day and these are the perfect addition to my sock collection! They are very soft, too. Not too thick so you can wear them with your shoes. Now I wish I had more pairs! [SEP] I wear a women's size 6 shoe and the medium fit me well. There is a little bit of room in the toe for a size or two bigger, but that's about it. The calves are pretty tight (compression for hiking) so these may or may not be comfortable for you. They come up much higher on me than the product picture, I'm only 5'2"" but these come up mid-calf and they look like they should just be above your ankle in the pic. I'm not that short...<br /><br />They are super well made, you can see all the different compression areas. They are also specific L and R socks, that always cracks me up. I recommend following the size chart. I was tempted to get a small, since typically a size 6 shoe is considered small, but glad I stuck with the medium. I really wouldn't want anymore compression, and I think the small would have been too snug around the toes. [SEP] Really bright and cute! They are really well made, thick and soft, structured with arch support knitted in that really is nice for walking and being on your feet. I love to wear them treadmill walking, as hiking is too much for me with all the ailments I have, but these are just as good for overweight, past middle-aged, non-athletic gals like me, for the treadmill. I recommend them, they look great and offer a lot of cushion and support. [SEP] These are very nice, soft, mid weight hiking socks. The pattern and colors are vibrant and fun. The soles are lightly cushioned. They come to my mid calf. Size medium fits a women‚Äôs 7.5 perfectly. May be snug on a larger calf. Material photograph is taken from the packaging. [SEP] These are thick,comfortable,and well made.  Perfect for hiking and winter weather.  Did I mention that they‚Äôre cute?  I really like these. [SEP] My wife loves these socks, she loves the pattern, the feel, and the added warmth. We may be in the middle of Summer right now, but she's already talking about packing these for our Fall camping trips. Just that extra bit of warmth can fend off the Autumn chill, and I'm sure she'll pack them for the beach trip later this summer too. Nights can get kind of chilly, so a warm pair of socks is always welcome.

It fits well, but I recommend buying a bigger size than you need, as kids grow fast, and this material is strong enough to last multiple seasons. [SEP] Love this top. So hard to find gender neutral cat clothes. My boy can't wait for it to be cold enough to wear. My kid is a 4T and this fit true to size. [SEP] My daughter is pretty much a perfect Medium (7/8) and the sleeves are definitely too short for her on this one.

My husband said ""It looks like you're wearing a blanket!"" as there is a LOT of fabric. Still, I love it and wear it around the house all the time.

There's adequate traction on the soles. They fit as expected. I wish they made these in adult sizes! [SEP] My son was growing out of his old sneakers so it was time for a change. We decided to have him try this pair of Under Armour Boy‚Äôs Grade School Ripple Sneakers rather than going with the usual selection of name brand sneakers. He sure was glad we did. My son raved about how cushioned and comfortable these feel. The Big Kid Size 7 fits him just as it should, too. The sneakers seem robust and sturdily made, but are also lightweight. My son wears these 5 days a week for PE and they‚Äôve held up great. He mentioned that his feet don‚Äôt seem to sweat as much in these as with his older sneakers. Overall, in terms of comfort and wearability, he‚Äôs been much happier with these Under Armour Boy‚Äôs Ripple Sneakers than with his previous shoes made by big name sneaker companies. [SEP] Like the way this shoe fits. Very comfortable. Really cool style as well. Very well made. [SEP] These shoes are very well made and very comfortable.  The color is a very versatile light gray with a white sole.  There is good tread on the bottom which provides excellent traction and stability [SEP] My son loves these shoes! Too bad the tops of them started falling apart after wearing them for only 3 weeks. When I noticed it, it was a couple days outside Amazon‚Äôs return window so I had to make a claim with Under Armour. Since my son is Autistic and will only wear these shoes, I have to order them again from Amazon (UA doesn‚Äôt have them now) then send the only ones back to UA and they are *supposed* to give me a credit for the purchase. Not great quality, friends, and I‚Äôm surprised at how quickly they fell apart on one of the least used areas of the shoe. [SEP] My daughter loves these shoes and they fit her perfectly. I got a good deal using my  prime and am very happy with the purchase [SEP] My picky 9 year old likes them.  He loves his nikes but wanted to try under armour shoes.  He thinks the nikes are just as comfortable as the under armour.  They do not slide on gym floors like cheap Fila shoes.  The sizing in under armour shoes is the same as nikes too. [SEP] These are very durable and great wearing shoes! [SEP] Color was off [SEP] Really smart looking sneaker, perfect for everyday wear even for adults.  Turned out my kid that I wanted to try this out for had grown a size and a half in a month, so I ended up trying it out, and it was wide enough for my extra wide feet.  The style looks neat and not out of place on a grown woman with jeans or capris, and it's really comfortable with adequate arch support for walking.  Would absolutely actually buy this for my kids, or myself though now, they belong in the adult size range at age 10.",3,True

They are larger so the chunky in the name is definitely appropriate, they are wider quite a bit wider at the bottom. They come very nicely packaged in little individual bags inside of a little drawstring pouch with a brand on them, they even come with a little cleaning cloth. They look exactly as pictured with as much detail as noted in the pictures. They were very easy to put on, and I actually didn‚Äôt have any issues taking them off either. I just did the same thing I did to open them before putting them on which was push up and then pull them to open. So I had no issues in that regard. I have use them a number of times, and even with my sensitive-ish years I have not had any allergic reactions to them or anything. They are a little bit heavier, but that is to be expected since they are bigger, wider earrings, but nothing too bad. Overall I think they look really nice, I have received a number of compliments on them, and I do really like them. [SEP] Very uncomfortable.  Posts are twice the diameter of normal posts.  Returned.  Quality was nice, a little heavy. [SEP] These earrings are absolutely elegant! They are small and simple, yet add the right amount of class and sophistication to any outfit and any occasion! I love the silver color and the filigree design, it is very feminine, but understated as well. I like to wear them during the day and transition them into the evening. They add the perfect touch without being too much! [SEP] These earrings are substantial for their small size. They are hinged, huggie style and come in both sterling and gold plated sterling.  The quality and looks of these are 5 stars, but they were very difficult to open.  I knocked them down to 3.5 stars because I broke my nail trying to open the gold plated pair.  They do get easier to open after a few times opening and closing but I worry that I will hurt my earlobe trying to take these off.  The silver pair did not give me this trouble so it might be hit or miss on these.  I really like the look and the feel of these so I am torn on how to rate them overall. They are very pretty. [SEP] I liked the filigree design, not overly big either. They are not solid however, they are hollowed out but would make a good gift for any age person. They come in a nice little bag with a wiping cloth to keep them shiny. Thumbs up! [SEP] These are pretty earrings that are perfect for a night out or to add a little glam to any outfit.

[SEP] These are nice and stretchy tights and are perfect for ballet or just to wear with a skirt.  They seem to be very durable and  are easy to wash by placing them in a mesh bag and then into the washing machine.  I hang them up to dry. [SEP] These tights are nicely made and my daughter had no trouble with the opening on the foot.  The only down sides are that they seem to run a little small (more towards the size 7 and not the size 10), and that they do snag more easily than I would like.  They aren't Bloch's but for the price they are good and make sense for regular classroom use. [SEP] Nice set of tights for girls, not really women. Unless you‚Äôre a short woman. The ‚Äúconvertible‚Äù nature is also a little unclear, as there‚Äôs just a hole near the foot that you can push your foot through, but then you have a bunched up part around your ankle? If you‚Äôre planning to wear them with shoes that are open on the top, this hole might be hard to hide. The tights are thick, and seem like they‚Äôll hold up fairy well. I‚Äôm just not sure the convertible aspect is worth it. Either buy tights with feet, or ones that end at the ankle. [SEP] These convertible tights are nice quality.  The material is soft and they seem like they will be durable.  They were a good fit for my daughter and she says they are comfortable. [SEP] I got these for my daughter to wear under her leotard to dance class and they are perfect. Just what we needed. They are not completely invisible, but they aren't solid, opaque white either. They are sheer and have a nice, shiny look to them that looks cute with dance-wear. They fit true to size for my daughter. They also wash well and we haven't had any issues with runs or holes yet. Will definitely order more of these when these wear out or when she outgrows them. [SEP] These tights were thicker than I expected while still being smooth - very nice quality.  My daughter takes gymnastics and dance classes back to back, so these convertible tights prevent her from having to make changes between classes.  She wears the feet up for gymnastics and down (under ballet and tap shoes) for dance.  I found they ran truer to size than the similar style the dance studio carries and are thicker and should last longer.  We will use these throughout the year and just wear the studio tights for recital.  Excellent!",3,True

I use them often for driving (especially in the direction of the sun) and as well as an accessory to my outfit. They stay firmly on my face and I don't deal with having to frequently push them up my nose. Of course, if this happens to you, they can easily be adjusted for free at any eye care store. I recommend these slick shades - especially for driving! [SEP] Good for men OR women. I really like the hue of these sunglasses - it's a warm glow. I think aviatior style suits a lot of people. This is my 1st time getting sunglasses online without trying them on first, and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. Not too big, they weren't loose, and they have an attractive colored frame; brownish gold metal with rounded arms.

These fit the bill quite nicely. [SEP] The frame is well built. with spring hinges, and a tortoise- like ear piece. What concerns me most is the durability of the lens. It is plastic and very thin. To be honest, it feels very cheap. It is polarized and works well with the intense afternoon sun in Arizona. It cuts glare very well. It does seem to darken the field of vision somewhat. These glasses are priced around $12, and for the money they are a good buy. I don't know if they will hold up very well . They came with a very cheap case and a cleaning cloth. These glasses wont compete with high end models, but at $12, the work pretty well. [SEP] These were much better quality than I was expecting.  The metal frame is very heavy (heavy for glasses not heavy in general; in a good way).  They have a good weight to them.<br /><br />The frames are nice.  They are not as large as some other glasses and I actually like that.  I think they look pretty good.  They do seem to face down a little when I have them on. [SEP] These are nice sunglasses with amber lenses.  The problem with most sunglasses is the amount of light they block out.  Many block out too much light and so it can be hard to see details.  These are very good, you can see fairly clearly when they are on.<br />They also come with a nice holder. [SEP] These don't fit me properly so I don't really love them.

The hinges are decent and the wood temples are well sanded so there's no chance of splinters for now. Of course as you sweat and the wood absorbs the moisture and swells there will be changes. Only time will tell but these feel like they'll last a good while. [SEP] Sturdy.  Fit well.  Attractive.  I love the wood case they come in.  Makes it easy to throw them in a purse for travel.  Seem to work well shielding my eyes from the sun.  No squinting.  No complaints or regrets. [SEP] Cool wood ear pieces.  Sturdy frames.  Good quality lenses.  Look great.  Comes with a unique wooden case as well.  I love them.  Got a pair for each of my cars [SEP] The case that comes with these is awesome. It's a wooden tube with a pop-off lid. The polarization on them is clean and the lenses are nice and clear, not foggy or scratched up. They're strong, sturdy, and fashionable. I'd highly recommend this brand because it seems like they put a little more effort into their product than similar competitors. [SEP] I'm digging these glasses. These fit my grown male face well.  The glasses are listed as unisex and while the style would be killer on my wife, the arms are much too long for her.<br /><br />I only wear polarized lenses and these do not disappoint.  The lenses have a pleasant level of tint, not too dark.<br /><br />The hinges are high quality.  The bamboo arms are smooth and well shaped. The glasses as a whole are excellent quality.<br /><br />The case these glasses arrived in is my favorite!  It looks amazing and will protect my glasses during travel. The glasses also come with a tiny screwdriver keychain.  It's not something I will likely use but it's nice to have.<br /><br />Overall, I would absolutely recommend these to any of my guy friends. [SEP] These came in the cutest wood packaging! The glasses are made from quality materials and are incredibly comfortable. They fit nicely on my smaller, round face and have some stretch to them. They also keep out the brightness while still being able to see perfectly. The wood itself doesn't feel like those cheapo ones you find at Target, it feels legit. 10/10 would highly recommend for any gender [SEP] I love the look of the bamboo ear pieces. They're a little thick so if you're wearing them for a long time they may bother. They're a little heavier, but I'm used to thinner aviator glasses. The lens doesn't change the color of things which is nice, most lenses make things have a brown/reddish/yellowy tone.

I really like the lens color with the bamboo frame - it's a great combination. The thing I noticed when I first put them on was how good the fit was and how comfortable they were. I do have a larger face but these just fit really well, not too snug but not too loose. Polarized sunglasses are the way to go and these are indeed polarized, protecting you from UVA/UVB rays. These are great for doing anything outside especially driving in the daytime.<br /><br />They also include some extras when you receive your sunglasses. There's a nice wooden/bamboo case to store your sunglasses (or anything for that matter), a nice quality soft case, a small microfiber cloth for wiping down your sunglasses and getting all those fingerprints off. They also included a cool little screwdriver with a Phillips-head on one end and a Flat Head on the other end. It has a loop on the end so you could attach it to your keys or anything you'd like.<br /><br />I do recommend these sunglasses as they are a nice everyday pair of sunglasses that are stylish, comfortable, and won't break the bank. I will have to see how they hold up over time but there's nothing to me that indicates they won't last for a very long time. [SEP] I got these for my husband and he loves them. He was somewhat concerned that they would be to feminine or too large on his face. The fit him perfectly. They are very well made and durable. They are also polarized. They came with a bag to keep them in while not wearing them to prevent scratches. He likes them so much we are going to get him another pair to keep in the other car. I highly recommend.",3,True

Jeff & Aimy Womens Summer Straw Beach Sun Hat UPF 50 Packable Wide Brim with Chin Strap Panama Stylish Fashion Cloche Travel Hat Beige,[],[],,3.8,15,421316,"I am so glad that ladies hats have made a comeback.  There is nothing more fun than adding a hat to complete your outfit.  It ups the look in both a sporty and fashionable way.  This  is kind of a hat that you often see Blake Lively wearing when out and about. It‚Äôs made of paper straw, it‚Äôs well designed, hold up well but are just a teeny bit floppy for fun and gives UPF 50+ UV PROTECTION.  It has contrasting colors with a dark band.  Here is a hat that can be worn by adventurous ladies of all ages. [SEP] This is a flattering hat that provides great sun protection. It is foldable but still looks good without being too floppy. The hat is well constructed and features black grosgrain ribbon accents. There is an inner adjustable tab that allows the fit to be customized. But despite the product description saying this has a chin strap, mine did not. But overall this is a quality hat that is flattering and offers good sun protection. Perfect for summer for individuals of all ages... [SEP] The hat itself is fairly cute. The velvet bow on the back adds a bit of style and visual interest. The interior of the hat has a velcro strap that can help adjust the hat's circumference to allow for a better fit. However, the chinstrap was not actually attached to the hat. It was a separate cord with an adjustment toggle, so I'm assuming you loop it over the top of the hat and then secure it under your chin...only downside is that it looks a bit ridiculous and it's not particularly effective. We live in a very windy area, so the extra benefit of a chin strap to keep it secure is essential.<br /><br />The hat itself is flexible and packable. It is a bit floppy which makes it easy to fold when needed. The brim offers a bit of additional sun protection for both the face and neck without having an overly large, wide brim. [SEP] Not my favorite.  It arrived crushed and remains wrinkled looking, not as chic as pictured.  It is super floppy with no shape at all.  I do like the adjustable band inside.  The hat itself seems nicely made and perfectly functional.  It just constantly looks like someone sat upon it.  Not all the crisp structured hat shown in the pics.  Overall disappointed.  Even with the adjustable size it is not that comfortable to wear.  I think it is because the hat without adjusting is too large and when I tighten it there is no give. [SEP] This looks great with an over-sized pair of sunglasses!  The brim width is great- not too wide, but wide enough to provide good sun protection.  Its flexible and comfy on.  I will be wearing this all summer! [SEP] Very cute style, and high quality - feels like I could put this in my purse or a big bag and it will bounce back into shape. I thought I wouldn‚Äôt like the bow but it‚Äôs actually kind of cute. I have a larger head and this fits nicely. [SEP] This is a cute summer hat.  It fits great.  It has a slight give or stretch.  In the picture I pulled it down so it‚Äôs snug on my head.  The four parts of the black bow has a stich in the middle of it keep the bow in place.  It's sturdy and seems well made.<br /><br />What attracted me to this sun hat is that it‚Äôs easy to pack and can be rolled up easily and not harmed. [SEP] This hat from Jeff and Aimy arrived slightly crushed from the box and I haven't been able to get it to fall nicely. It is not a firm hat and it has soft fabric and brim. I'm sure it is because it is meant to be packed and crushed when traveling. It certainly can be packed, but the result afterward was not acceptable for my wife. It has a wide brim with a black bow in the back. Also, at the bottom of the bag it came in was an adjustable string. However, I have no idea how it attaches to the hat. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with this hat I would have loved a hat that was packable and retained its shape better.",3,True

Definitely a great new accessory!<br /><br />Definitely recommend! [SEP] this is a very lovely set of bangles. Mine were all silver and they look and feel nice. they should accommodate most wrists. Nicely made they catch the light. They come packaged in a rustic looking drawstring bag. thin and lightweight, they add a fun touch of light to your outfit. [SEP] I really like these thin silver bangle bracelets!  The only thing I wish is that the separate bangles had some different designs so that they didn't all look alike.  Other than that, they are thin, delicate and enough of them to make them eye-catching.  Really pretty! [SEP] They make a very satisfying low pitch jingle noise when they touch. The fall back to a perfect angle when your arm is flat on a surface so they don‚Äôt interfere when you are typing. The colors compliment each other and look good with my skin tone. They are not soldered together that well but you don‚Äôt really notice that when they are all next to each other. [SEP] These are nice looking bracelets. Very pretty and can be worn for any occasion. Unfortunately, these are too big for me. They slide on my hands and wrist easily and in turn, slide off easily too. I have very small wrists and have trouble finding bracelets that fit me, so I'm not surprised. But these should fit standard size wrists. If they were more fitted I would happily wear them. [SEP] These are a set of fun bracelets. They are definitely costume jewelry, a combination of silver and gold, and they are great to add a little glamour to an outfit. You can wear them all together or you can split them 6 and 6. They will add a little jingle to your walk. [SEP] Very shiny and jangly! I love these, and I loved getting a whole bunch of them for one good price. A full arm's worth! They have a nice, wavy design with some black rubbed into it to make it show up good. The mix of silvertone vs goldtone is about 1 to 4. They are nice and sturdy, too- no warping or bending. They come in a cute little hemp or burlap drawstring bag, nice for gifting. [SEP] As I write this review, it's hard to give it a rating because I always factor in the price point for an item like this and they're currently unavailable.  What I'm reviewing is 18 of the Silver Bangles, as opposed to the gold or the mixed set.<br /><br />I personally love this type of bangle because they're lightweight and they dress up your outfit a bit.  You can wear quite a few without adding a lot of weight to your arm.  I may sound like I'm 5 years old when I say this, but I like the little tinkling noise they make.  The bangles are quite pretty with some engraving that catches the light a little and gives a bit of shimmer.<br /><br />I have fairly small wrists and hands - I wear a Small glove, for example - and they're a good size for me.  I measured the circumference, which is approximately 8.5 inches - and the opening of the circle that forms the bracelet, which is approximately 2.75 inches.  They do not fall off my hands, as can be the case with some bracelets.<br /><br />Being somewhat short and needing petite sleeve length clothes and coats, I wouldn't wear all 18 at one time, but a taller or larger person might.  I think 6 at a time is about my limit, so if you buy these bracelets and find 18 to be more than you need, you can always share.  I haven't worn them enough to know if they hold their shape, but they seem to be as sturdy as any I've seen - and I think they'd be durable for normal use.<br /><br />The bracelets came in a little fabric bag that I'm guessing is burlap that has a drawstring.  I think these bracelets are the type of jewelry that is classic and timeless, but also ageless and women of all ages would wear them (they would be too large for children).  Depending on the cost when they're available, they'd be an excellent stocking stuffer for an older teen, young adult or even Grandma.",3,True

[SEP] Addidas made a stripped jogging pant/soccer pant over ~2000 to 2013 that I LOVED.  I have tried finding replacements for my very well aged favorites, and so far, the newer stripped jogging/soccer pants from Addidas have a strange fit and are not available in as many colors.  The fit of Addidas jogging pants since 2013 is rather hard to describe.  It feels they are narrower in the hip, and not even/balanced, as if the left side is sewn a bit tighter than the right.  I have not measured seam to seam.  If I do that, I will update my review.  Also, the ""crouch"" seems considerably higher.  (Since through-out life I have had a few folks tell me crouch seam isn't the corrrect term, as odd as that seems to me, for those types of people I will appease them and say, the rise is too high.  Increasing rise on pants whether jogging or eans or even dress rose drastically in men's pants around the turn of the new millenium.  In order to where modern pants so that they contact at or near your perianum so as to allow as large of range of motion of your legs as desired, a man has to pull pants up over his belly button and nearly half way to his nipples (yes.  men have nipples just as wild bores, dogs and any male mamml even though they serve no function in male mammals.  Some people have given me a hard time for referring to nipples as nipples on male mammals in the past couple of decades despite men and male mammals whether a wild bore or a pet dog, all have nipples though the males of mammals do not lactate (normally) and do not nurse or acrry babies -- what strange times that I have to explain these crouches and male nipples.  The world has definitely gotten strange whether the extreme leftism and extreme conservatism to the extreme stuapidity and extremely dogmatic nature of folks for everything to be said in some way they prefer, as if somehow refferring to a man having nipples or a male pet having nipples is somehow offensive.  What do millinials call them, and what do millinials call the perianum region of woman, and why is it no longer right to call it a crouch.  Crouch was crouch all my life until the new millenium whther male or female.  Perhaps for professional tailoirs or clothing designers they may have a special venacular for theit trade but for lay people, a crouch has always been a crouch whether male or female all my life until th enew millenium.  Why do we have to waste so much time in modern times describing these things and learning unnnecesssary new veranacular instead of being a productive society as we once were?

It would be good for Mother's Day, her birthday, the winter holidays or any other occasion.<br /><br />It seemed well made. It went on just fine. It looked nice. I would recommend it.

It fits pretty much everyone and is ready to be gifted. Pick the message specifically for your relative or friend and it is a perfect gift. [SEP] Easy enough to adjust and you can always tuck the string into a figure 8 if it dangling bothers you. I just like the minimalist look of these bracelets and it gives you something to fiddle with it. [SEP] I have worn this bracelet about 10 times and it has held up well. I really like this style.

Perfect to give as a gift or as a gift to yourself to remind yourself how great you truly are....

It‚Äôs especially apropos for teens who often have their good works ignored. [SEP] Fun little bracelet that‚Äôs a good conversation piece. [SEP] I really like these bracelets. The black string bracelet is very thin. There is a bead that secures pushes up securing the bracelet. It is not a good mechanism as it comes loose pretty often. I have found the bracelet on the floor after taking off my jacket. It gets caught in my jacket easily and the clasp is not strong enough to secure it. So, be careful and mindful.<br /><br />I love the fact that the message is in Morse code and therefore not a whole lot of people will know what it says. It makes for a great gift.

The chain is the usual thin one you get for this price point, but the clasp is easy to open/close and you can extend the necklace two inches past the 16"" (I like mine short). It comes in a lovely gift box and bag, with a cleaning cloth and a cute card, which makes it perfect for gift giving. [SEP] Very nice looking pendant necklace. The cubic zirconia makes it sparkle and come alive. The double chain is very popular and this look is much preferred to the traditional necklaces. [SEP] This is a beautiful necklace that I want desperately to love, but I don‚Äôt. I like that the layered chains are all connected on one necklace, but they easily get tangled and wrapped around each other. I spent more time untangling them then just wearing the necklace! [SEP] This is a very pretty necklace but you will have to take some time to make sure the inner and outer chains are not twisted together and that the necklace hangs evenly on your neck.  The little wheels with the lovely cubic zirconia diamonds might have a tendency to lay flat instead of being upright but I haven't worn it long enough to know when they tend to lay flat.  I like this necklace a lot and it can be worn casually as well as with more formal clothing.  It doesn't look cheap at all. [SEP] (Reviewed by my wife): This layered necklace is so pretty.  It is sparkly, delicate and dainty.  I got the ""ferris wheel"" design with the little gold circles with tiny faux diamonds.  The ""ferris wheels"" are beautiful.  The necklace is very versatile - it can be worn with a casual outfit or a dressy outfit.  The necklace comes very nicely packaged, making it nice to give as a gift.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when I wear this necklace I find myself having to constantly adjusting it because the two layers tend to twist and tangle the wrong way.  This is a bit distracting. [SEP] This is a lovely two-chained choker necklace. Each chain has a circle bead studded with cubic zirconia. It is attractive. The only drawback--and the reason I rated this four stars instead of 5 is that it is supposed to be 14K gold plated, but there are absolutely no markings on this to indicate or certify this. This necklace comes packaged in a nice gift box with card. [SEP] I am in love with it. The packaging and card and everything is elegant. It is such a worth gift for anyone [SEP] Another great piece to add to my collection. Nice shine, sturdy, and gorgeous! [SEP] Nice way to add some subtle bling.

Jeff & Aimy Winter Wool Ivy Flat Cap with Ear Flaps Newsboy Driver Hat 60 Brown,[],[],,3.0,19,9494,"I received the brown tweed cap with flaps for review.  The tweed material is very good quality and the cap looks like something grandpa would have worn - very well made back in the day.  Hubs has a big head and this cap fits it perfectly.  The only thing he's not real fond of is how the flaps are attached to the cap.  He doesn't like the zipper because he says if you decided to fold the flaps under instead of taking them off you can see the zipper pull.  He has another cap with flaps that you just fold under when you don't want the flaps.  I think it looks fine with the zipper pull still on it but he's a little picky about his caps.  When the flaps are taken off 1/2 the zipper is still there but it is so thin that it's really hard to see and I seriously doubt anyone would notice it.  I like this cap a lot and it looks great on his head and it looks exactly as pictured on the product page. [SEP] The hat is OK but it's not the one with the ear flaps as expected. Also, it's polyester (not wool) and is a different color. Top is roomy but the band around head is tight - you'd have to have a small head to wear this. It's not my style, although in the pictures it doesn't look bad. [SEP] This hat is very, very small. I've never had a problem with hats fitting me before, but I could barely fit this onto my head, and it pinched unpleasantly once I did. It seems more like a child's large than an actual adult size.<br /><br />Beyond the size issue, the hat seems to be well-constructed and sturdy. I like the shade of brown and the overall shape of the hat, but I wish they hadn't attached a shiny metal ""S"" to it, like a pin. It's a strange accent that doesn't work with the overall style of the hat. [SEP] This hat would have been GREAT if the ear flaps covered the ears like muffs.  But it's still quite fine for brisk fall or light winter.  It looks good and its brim works to protect against snow or sun.  All in all a winner. [SEP] hubby likes it, but one thing we don't like about it is that we don't have a way to adjust the head size. it is loose around my husband's head but it is nice looking and he likes it. he is bald so this will help him a lot in the winter. [SEP] If you're reading this review what you honestly want to know is ""should I buy this?"". The short answer is YES and here's why.<br /><br />Ok I'll just going to admit it. I've always wanted a drivers cap with ear flaps. Don't ask me why, I just have and this hat does not disappoint. It says it's ""wool"" but the actual breakdown is Crown = 48% Polyester, 44% Wool, 3% Viscose Fiber 3%Nylon 2% Acrylic.<br />Visor = 56% Wool 44% Viscose Fiber.<br />Yarn = 50% Wool 50% Acrylic.<br />Lining = 100% Cotton.<br />So it's safe to say that it's mostly wool. One thing people may or may not like is that the ear flaps zip off and on. Not a problem if you have hair, but if you're bald the nylon zipper can start to rub and become a little irritating. But honestly, you have to wear it for a while before the irritation starts. The other thing to mention is that unlike ""traditional"" ear flap drives caps, because the ear piece zips on, simply folding it out of the way just looks weird. This is mainly because the zipper really isn't strong enough or even made to hold the ear flaps up. It works, it just doesn't work well. You can definitely tell that it was the intent to remove the ear flaps altogether (which is a great way to lose it).<br /><br />Now one of the most important things about a hat is how it looks and fits. This hat actually fits better than expected. I have an in between sized head so finding the right sized hat is always a challenge. But this hat fits really well. As for the look? I've worn it 5-6 times and gotten compliments each and every time.<br /><br />Bottom line, it looks great, fits well and has removable ear flaps, what more could you really ask for.<br /><br />If you're still on the fence about getting this, hop on down and buy it now. Your head and ears will thank you especially when it get really cold.<br /><br />Do I recommend this? Absolutely<br />Emoji rating: üôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇ<br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read this review, I really hope it helped. Cheers!<br /><br />Make life fun! [SEP] The hat I received looks nothing like what is pictured.  What I got seemed to be made of a huntsman check tweed, rather than the herringbone tweed pictured.  It is not the flat cap with ear flaps I was hoping to receive.  It seems more like an eight panel casket cap, but does not pull down flat and does not have ear flaps.  The cut and the shape are just all wrong for me. [SEP] Real wool, adds a sense of warmth and comfort to this hat. Ear flaps are functional, can be folded down to cover your ears and neck for warmth, or, folded up if you prefer not to cover the ears/neck region. Color is a brown tweed, it‚Äôs really classic, sophisticated, yet traditional, something anyone can easily wear. Could be an everyday hat or for a special occasion ‚Äì it is versatile! [SEP] Received different cap than what's advertised.<br /><br />Have no ear flaps, and more rounded design<br /><br />Better fit/look for those with compact faces (not too long or wide) in my opinion<br /><br />Overall good cap if you're into the detective look; just know what you're not getting what's advertised the product page [SEP] Winter Wool Ivy Flat Cap with Ear Flaps Newsboy Driver Hat 60 Brown<br /><br />Hat is just as shown in the photo.<br /><br />It has removeable ear cap.<br /><br />It's comfortable but fits a bit big for me.<br /><br />I wear a 7 1/4 fitted cap is way to big for me.",3,True
GLADDON MODA Women's Crossbody Bag black,[],[],,3.5,14,82023,"I was looking forward to receiving this purse and really wanted to like it. But no. Just no. The front and back of the purse are made mostly of see-through plastic‚Äîa material very similar to the large zippered bag that a bed comforter comes in. The see-through plastic is surrounded by a 5/8‚Äù border of alligator-patterned black PU leather that looks and feels like plastic or vinyl. The purse has a strap closure with a buckle. When the strap is buckled, the top of the purse is still open and the contents will spill if you dropped the purse. The see-through plastic collects fingerprints easily and quickly took on the look of a smudged mirror.<br /><br />As a grown woman, I just can‚Äôt imagine using a purse made this material. The word ‚Äúcheesy‚Äù comes to mind. For those who prefer not to use leather, there are a lot of nice man-made materials generally available that don‚Äôt look so plastic like this purse. Perhaps if it was a bright color, a little girl might use it ‚Äî but it‚Äôs probably too large for a little girl. And the style is too mature for a little girl.<br /><br />The purse is 9.5‚Äù long, 6.5‚Äù high, and 3.75‚Äù deep (thick). The sides, bottom and strap are also made of the black PU leather (plastic). The strap is attached with 5 1/4 inches of gold tone metal chain at both ends. The crossbody strap is adjustable in length with a clasp type buckle.<br /><br />It came with a small black toiletry bag that is made of a material like straw, has a black-zippered top closure with a gold zipper pull, and the inside is lined in black fabric. It measures 6.75‚Äù wide, 5.5‚Äù high, and 1.75‚Äù deep (thick). [SEP] This is cute, functional and stylish.  I transferred all the stuff from my other purse easily to this one, It is a smokey see thru plastic with imitation alligator skin accents.  The strap can be either a cross body or as an off shoulder purse, both work easily with the strap being adjusted to your preference.  It has a twist closure that matches the golden chains on the strap.  I can clip my keys to the D ring on the purse where the strap attaches, I feel confident this purse will last quite a while.  Some employers require purses that are see thru, this fits the bill.  This purse stands up without me being too concerned that it will fall over as other purses do.  The base is built for it to sit up.<br />My only concern would be losing items if it accidentally got knocked over.  I would not use this for travelling on an airline, with the metal accents and potentially losing important items in a airline checkpoint.  There is a soft inner purse, for ladies essentials or monthly cycle needs, keeping them nicely discreet.  Overall I think this is cute and functional, will use on date nights.  I think this can be used with confidence by a vast age range as well. [SEP] I ordered this bag because you never know when you might need a clear bag on the spur of the moment. I live near a big city where there are multiple sporting and cultural events every single day! For many of these, a clear bag is the only acceptable type to carry in. I jumped at the chance to try this elegant-looking, well-designed bag. It is bigger than expected and its chain and strap allows it to be worn as a cross body. There is no way to adjust the strap, and it is awkward as a shoulder bag. There is no zipper at the top, which could be a drawback, especially in crowded venues. The bag comes with a zipper pouch in a charcoal shade which not only carries necessities neatly, but also makes the purse look less clear and more attractive. It is nicely made and the alligator trim definitely gives it the touch of class that many clear bags are missing. This bag comes with a nice knit protective case, which is a really thoughtful added touch. If it had an adjustable strap and a top zipper, I would gladly give it five stars. [SEP] Gladdon Moda crossbody bag is an quite unique and a fun style bag, however there‚Äôs a significant design flaw. The bag has a buckle that goes across the middle with no zipper, so things can fall out easily from the sides. It comes with an all black woven change purse for a little privacy, but if the bag falls at just the right angle this change purse can also fall out as it doesn‚Äôt take much force to pull it out. Which brings me to another point, this is a pick pocketer‚Äôs dream as there is nothing stopping anyone from walking behind you and just pulling out your wallet. I think if the designers wanted an open design as possible, they might should of just added one more buckle on the side so that the change purse cannot fall out plus giving the bag a little bit more of a barrier from sticky fingers. Besides the design flaw, the idea is neat, gives the bag a fun vibe yet still nice enough for evening outings. I like the tinted view on both sides. It appears well made and quite durable. The bag is still functional, one would just need to be a bit careful with it. [SEP] Cute see-through crossbody! Hoes great with casual looks or office looks. It‚Äôs a great size for my necessities! The strap is sturdy yet not too thick to make it uncomfortable. Such a fab little bag [SEP] I love the size and the style of this bag.  It's easy to toss items in and find them again since the front and back are are through.  The only down side.is.It only has a small enclosure on it.

Having ordered a lot of delicate jewelry from Amazon over the years, I expected a thin chain and mild sparkle. I was surprised and pleased at how bright and sparkly this necklace actually is. The design is cute (a cut out heart suspended over a round pendant with the missing heart) and it catches people's eyes even though it is quite small (the pendant is smaller than a dime).  It isn't very long, however, so this is best worn as a choker-like necklace. The necklace appears to have holes that allow you to extend the length but they are so small they are hard to see. So I went for the largest circle which makes the fit tight.<br /><br />Overall I like it very much but I wish the extension holes were bigger. [SEP] This is a really sweet rose gold necklace that I wanted to love. I had plans to wear it with jeans and a t-shirt and with a more dressy outfit on those rare date nights. I tried it on and was delighted by the real look of the metal and small but glittery stones. Alas, this love affair was not  meant to last. Within a matter of minutes of wearing this necklace the two strands twisted into a tangled mess. I've tried several other times to get this little beauty to stay put but without success. On the positive side, the presentation, complete with a pink jewelry bag, iis lovely, the romance card is a nice touch (although it's printed so it opens the opposite direction of traditional cards, and  the price is ok. Too bad it's annoying to wear. [SEP] I ordered this to give as a gift to my Mom. She always signs her name aka Mom to me with two hearts. For more than a decade, I now search out double hearted gifts to send her.<br /><br />The necklace came in two plastic bags & was not tangled. The bagged necklace was inside a gift box, the gift box was inside a pink velour pouch with a floral ""Best Wishes"" card that is blank inside & a cleaning cloth. Both the bag & the jewelers box have ""Hugitout"" stamped on them. I'm not too crazy about that. I haven't decided how I'm going to send this. All the packaging seems a bit excessive, but at the moment I'm leaning to sending all of it. After all, my Mom might find a use for the pouch.<br /><br />Overall it is very pretty and dainty. I'm very happy with it. [SEP] Good for an everyday necklace.  It's very pretty. [SEP] Good design and very pretty. It is not as big as I think, but still a pretty decent size. [SEP] First, let me start off by letting you know that I am part of the Amazon Vine Program so Amazon did send this product out to me for review. The Hugitout Pendent Necklace has a very nice presentation that comes in a nice little jewelry box that's in a cute pink pouch. But the necklace itself, I was a little disappointed because, it wasn't what I was expecting. The necklace is super thin, I feel too thin, which in the picture it looks a little more thicker than it really is. The pendents are very cute but if they were bigger you could appreciate it more. You may find this necklace a good size for a child/teen but it's so thin with a teen wearing this, I can see it getting accidentally snatched of their necks super easy. I can't really recommend this necklace for the price, cause of it's thinnest and it's so easy to break which is too bad cause this necklace could have good potential. [SEP] This chain set is sparkly and lovely.  It arrives well in a beautiful little suede bag with a nice box and cleaning cloth - all which make it a great gift.<br /><br />The chain is very thin and will tangle easily.  The chain is also very short.  This set is definitely for thinner people.  My teenager is wears a women's S/M and it fits her fine.  Me, not so much.  Sad as I got this for myself as a birthday present. [SEP] This is a very pretty layered necklace. Layer one has a small heart and layer two has a bigger heart with a heart shaped hole.  The necklace is gold plated and cubic zirconia. This is a great gift and comes in a very nice box and pouch.<br /><br />It is a very delicate chain.

Cute print, comfortable fit, true to size, comfortable material, good padding. I‚Äôm a 34c and the medium fit perfectly. [SEP] I was actually sent the wrong bra, I was sent a strappy cross back bra so I'll just review what I know about that one and hopefully it's similar info.<br /><br />I'm a 30F and I ordered a medium. It does fit comfortably and cool, but unfortunately gives me armpit spillage. I could kind of tell by the product images, but these bra seem to cut in a bit at the armpit which probably isn't an issue if you have a smaller chest but will cause spillage and give the appearance of armpit cleavage if you're larger chested like I am.<br /><br />I'll probably still wear it under work out tops, but I wouldn't wear it on its own. [SEP] HIGH SUPPORT! Make sure you pay close attention to that. this bra is a great quality... but it was like spanx trying to get them on. [SEP] I‚Äôve never had luck with sports bras. I‚Äôve tried so many times but it always ends the same way: I feel like my ribs are going to break and then it‚Äôs war to get the thing back off. I‚Äôve never tried one from Ocean Blues and with all the extra working out I‚Äôve been doing due to quarantine I decided to try one more time. I‚Äôm so so glad I did. This is nothing like those torture devices I‚Äôve worn in the past. This bra is comfortable and supportive and doesn‚Äôt flatten me out. It‚Äôs well made and the fabric is soft. I can‚Äôt believe how easy it is to get on and off. It‚Äôs really helped me with my workouts and evening runs. Who knew a sports bra could be so great! Highly recommended! [SEP] This is a very comfortable bra. It has great support and I like the extra coverage so it feels like your wearing a tank top instead of a bra. [SEP] Okay, the quality is actually amazing. I was expecting a cheaper material, but NO! I am wearing a large and there is a little bit of extra room, but it is still so flattering! [SEP] I typically wear a size small or 34A.  This size small is perfect for me.  It is not too tight like other sports bras and is easy to get on and off.  It feels great to wear!  The material is breathable and soft.  It provides great coverage and can be worn alone or under a top.  I am a runner and it has provided perfect support for me.  I feel very comfortable and do not feel restricted in my movements with this sports bra.  I have tried a few other products by Ocean Blues and I have found all of their products to be of great quality and comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this sports bra! [SEP] I am a 32B bra size and the small fits me great. This has padding, but it‚Äôs not as thick as other sports bras I‚Äôve had in the past. This also comes down a little lower on my torso than I‚Äôm used to. Overall, this bra is great for working out in. [SEP] Cute and comfortable sports bra. Excellent support--keeps the girls in place during jogging without being overly restrictive. Light padding (which is removable) prevents the appearance of headlights. Fits true to size--i typically wear a 36C bra and the medium fit like a glove. [SEP] Does not fit a 36dd",3,True

The material isn't as flattering as I originally thought and the buttons are tacky and cheap. Overall, I am dissatisfied by both the look and quality of the shirt. It appears to be a cheap knock-off of some higher-end button downs. I do not recommend this product.

I ordered the salmon pink and it came out to be more apricot (more orange/tan than pink)<br />3. cheap-looking tassels on ALL of the button holes<br />4. meant for fine-boned, thin Asian. I am a muscularly-toned Asian with slight curves. (fits loose and nice everywhere except the bicep/tricep area)<br /><br />It is the perfect shirt to tuck in or wear under a blazer. The size chart fit accordingly.<br /><br />Overall, I will keep the shirt (even though I'm very upset about the missing cuff button) but will probably not order any clothes from this company again. Although the shirt is cheap, I still expected quality as depicted. The shirt looks run-down because of the tassels and missing buttons.

Coolife Luggage Expandable 3 Piece Set Suitcase with TSA lock pinner softshell (black),[],[],,3.1,21,84566,"Bought this luggage prior to a cruise. It looks great and I really love this set. The only issue was that the side handle on the largest piece broke. Other than that, each piece rolls smoothly and is roomy. The four wheels make it easier to maneuver compared to two wheel pieces.

I received the medium size for review and it fits me just right with a little room to spare.  I'm 5'9"". 142 lbs, 34B, and have birthing hips.  This blouse draped nicely over my hips fit well on my shoulders and everything about it was just right.  The material is soft, sheeny with lovely furrows and the sewing is very well done.  There is absolutely nothing negative I can find to say about it.  I placed it in a mesh bag when put in the laundry and placed it on a rack to dry.  It dried beautifully with no wrinkles and looks brand new.  This is a lovely top to wear to even the fancy occasions as well as a casual office top. [SEP] (Reviewed by my wife): This is a lovely blouse.  There is a metallic shine to the fabric so it is definitely something you could wear to a holiday party.  The fabric is crinkly/crepe-like.  The blouse is loose-fitting and the sizing is generous.  The blouse is very comfortable. [SEP] I like cotton shirts. I had thought this was a cotton shirt because the description says it's cotton. It's not. This is a 100% polyester shirt. It does not look like cotton nor does it feel like cotton. The tag on the shirt shows that it's not cotton.<br /><br />That aside, like other reviewers have said, this shirt sits somewhere between formal and casual. I think it's perfectly work appropriate if you're an office worker. It will look great with a pair of slacks.<br /><br />Even though the tag says machine wash gentle and no tumble dry, I dried it on low heat anyway, and it handled it just fine, except a SLIGHT  wrinkling of the collar seams (see photo). This is a big plus for me, it is also the main reason why I prefer cotton when I buy shirts - I can machine wash and tumble dry it. Line drying is a pain in the butt for me. So, even though this is not made of cotton, I am glad it dried well.<br /><br />It fits very loosely but I think it's super comfortable. I like the flow of the fabric. It doesn't cling to my body. When it came out of the dryer, there wasn't static. It's very nice.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice shirt. Not what I had expected when I ordered it, but I would recommend it. Just know that the style may be a little quirky... I call it a very Chinese FOB style. It's something I'd found very commonly seen in a Chinese speaking country. [SEP] This blouse is loose fitting and very light, stretchy and shimmery, it can be dressed up or down, however I have  only it worn it once because I find he material to be somewhat abrasive on my skin, even after washing with plenty of fabric softener. [SEP] This blouse is not so much cotton, but rayon. I would not wear this casually around my house, but maybe at work. Thin material, and not super flattering unless you are trim. [SEP] This top is somewhere between dressy and casual. It's a simple t-shirt style, but in a great metallic color. It's hard to figure out where to wear it to because it's neither completely casual nor dressy enough for evening ware. I really like the color and fit though, so I hope I find the perfect event to wear it to.<br /><br />The color is exactly as shown in the product image - a very very light gray.<br /><br />Fits well. Looks good on. Material feels good - light for summer wear, but not a thin cheap material. [SEP] This blouse is not so much cotton, but rayon.

[SEP] A snappy set that looks very cute on my cutie.  It keeps her nice and warm, it is thick and soft and she likes the subtle color. [SEP] After having owned a few different hats with a proof on top of this nature, let me just say right from the get-go that you are not supposed to put them in the wash. I'm not entirely sure what you're supposed to do when they do go funky, but don't wash them. It totally ruins the pom-pom.<br /><br />Aside from that dire warning, this is a great little hat and infinity scarf set. The stitching is cute and I really like the fun details of all of the different colors mixed in, the yarn is very soft and not at all itchy in any way, and I really like the cut of both the hat, which is a little tighter around the rim and then flares out a little bit for a baggy look, and the infinity scarf, which can be wrapped around the neck twice and looked generally full and stylish to wear. [SEP] This scarf and beanaie are a winning combo when weather gets cold and blustery. The infinity scarf is long and large providing versatility in wearing. It is soft, warm and fun. The beanie is warm and cozy with a fun  pom pom on the top. The burgundy and white pattern matches my burgundy down jacket perfectly. a fun set that is attractive, warm and well made. [SEP] Cute matching hat and scarf duo that is perfect for cold days.  The yarn is thick and tightly woven, helping to keep the cold hair out.  The colors are vibrant and fun and will work with virtually any color coat, sweater, or whatever outer ware you choose to wear with it. [SEP] I'm not a big fan of hats and scarves because they itch. Not so, this matching set. It's incredibly soft and nonirritating against the skin. It can be washed cold, line dried. (I wouldn't put it in the dryer for fear of ruining the cute pompom). I love the color combination, the stitching patterns they used, the softness of the material, the size of both pieces. The scarf is wonderfully wide, meaning you can put over your face one time, and don't have to wrap it multiple times around your neck. Very nice gift set. I'd recommend it for any woman in your life.

He typically doesn't like skeletonized fashion quartz watches that display faux watch parts as design features. He also doesn't like non-sport watches that are too thick to fit under his shirt sleeves. But after trying this watch, my husband was pleasantly surprised by this quartz Mini Focus watch with a skeleton-look dial that measures around a staggering 16mm in case height. Somehow, it all works. This watch with the chunky tonneau case just looks amazing on his wrist.<br /><br />We received the Black color option (also comes in Red, Gold Black, Gold Blue, and Silver Blue) which has a matte black barrel-shaped case and sturdy silicone watch band with an ""MF"" signed buckle. The black buckle is glossy rather than matching the matte case finish, but my husband didn't really mind. He said that with this watch, the buckle would be the last thing he's looking at. The case and dial are the stars of this show.<br /><br />The watch is a basic three hand design (hour, minute, second), but includes a date calendar window at about the 4:30 position. Part of the date wheel is also exposed at the 9 o'clock position, yet the whole dial still looks balanced, helped in no small measure by the two curved lines running the length of the dial that look like the inverse of the Tonneau shaped case. They really draw the eye and hold the entire design together. Additionally, the curved lines, hour markers, and hands are all lumed with glow-in-the-dark luminescent coatings that give the watch a striking appearance in low light. The watch is also easy to set and keeps time well. All in all, this watch was not what my husband had originally anticipated, but far exceeded his expectations.

I have worn it in the shower multiple times and I wash my hands with it on with zero issues. This watch looks nice and is a fantastic value! [SEP] [[VIDEOID:40f0a2e673bd7738c3f722bb8e320100]] I liked the fact that the mini focus is very well designed and it‚Äôs easy to use the watch it‚Äôs very stylish with a sports look that‚Äôs great and it‚Äôs comfortable to wear [SEP] This is fairly, nicely thick at 16 mm on the side of the case.  It‚Äôs one of the thicker watches I‚Äôve ever seen and heavy for a watch.  First impression was like wearing an alarm clock.  However, it will do for informal wear.<br /><br />The first thing I asked myself when I got it is why is it called a ‚Äútonneau‚Äù watch.  Come to find out, that‚Äôs a French word and means the watch face is shaped like a barrel.  Looking at the face of it, I can see it resembling the profile of a barrel.<br /><br />The watch band is a rubberized-looking silicon and very  rigid.  It‚Äôs  unwieldy to strap on because it‚Äôs so stiff.  It is a skeleton, kind of, sort of.  You see elements of the movement but I wouldn‚Äôt totally classify it as a skeleton watch.  I certainly wouldn‚Äôt call it a mechanical skeleton watch since it‚Äôs quartz.<br /><br />It does have a luminous dial that if you expose to light, will light up in the dark.  Under normal household lighting, I found it did not light up.  Only after I held it directly above a table lamp for a minute did I see the glowing effect in the dark.<br /><br />It does have some interesting features like a date movement.  Why they chose to attach it in such a way that the numbers are upside down to the hands telling the time is a mystery. They could have just had just as  easily created a small dial with the numbers oriented in the proper direction that would have worked.  It ‚Äòs almost like this was an afterthought.  I actually thought I was wearing the watch upside down until I looked at it closer.<br /><br />I did get it to set the date once but then I had trouble trying to make further adjustments.  It has a date function and another number wheel that I never have figured out. The instructions weren‚Äôt of any help on that. Time, date and week? [SEP] Watch is very heavy and sticks up very high if you are going to wear it with a dress shirt also hard to see at night all the different colors end so can‚Äôt see hands [SEP] My brother is into trendy watches and his favorite color happens to be red. I ordered this one for him and he really liked it. The skeleton shaping is what gets the most compliments. It runs well and is a conversation starter. I would definitely order it again.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful! [SEP] The watch is a perfect for it's arthentacy, there's nothing wrong with this watch, I have plenty of watches and this particular watch fits well in my collection, there's not a lot to explain about the watch other than it's solid, don't ever get caught up on the watch has to be higher price to be good, this particular watch is good and I would recommend it for any one who appreciates good stylish watches. [SEP] üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç [SEP] Love the watch but the band is way too small but purchased 22 mm crome extenders and the watches are fine . Not for big men .

It‚Äôs gorgeous! It‚Äôs a bluey gray that really does bring to mind slate blue.<br /><br />The hoodie has a pocket on the front. Like a pocket tee. Not a kangaroo pocket. The description says ‚ÄúFront pouch pocket for no fuss extra storage‚Äù but that is not accurate. I actually didn‚Äôt realize there was a pocket on the upper chest -- the pictures don‚Äôt show that detail very well.<br /><br />The hood drawstrings are raw, just tied in a knot. No aglets. For a sweatshirt this expensive, I‚Äôd prefer a nicer finish on the drawstrings.<br /><br />The cropped bottom hits right at my hipbone, so it‚Äôs not a super short sweatshirt. It does look very cute with a pair of high-waisted leggings or pants.<br /><br />The sizing is true to size, Woolly Clothing has a better size chart on their website.<br /><br />The hoodie itself is medium weight, so it‚Äôs warm but not overly bulky. It will be great for fall temperatures. The wool is soft not scratchy, and is machine washable. The care instructions are printed on the inside back of the hoodie, machine wash cold with like colors, inside out. The hoodie has no tags at all. [SEP] I'm a huge fan of Woolly clothing, I would take one of everything!  This is a super comfortable, lightweight top that you can wear all year round.  I've been wearing it around this summer, only in the AC!  Love to lounge in it at home.  High quality material and make, it fits beautifully.  It is cropped so keep that in mind.  Not super short though and it's attractive.  I have noticed that Woolly tops run small so I always recommend sizing up one at least.  You'll love it! [SEP] The Wooly Clothing Company's women's merino pro-knit wool cropped pullover hoodie looks adorable on my wife.  She ordered the size XS, which is her regular size, and the waist is perfect, as are the shoulders and her bust region.  The problem occurs when she dons the hood.  It's several inches too short, and pulls up the area over the shoulders.  My wife commented that while we love Wooly Clothing Company's products, they need to hire someone to properly design and size the products.  For my wife's slim and light-weight profile, each item is a gamble as to whether it will fit her properly.  If you look at the model in the product photo, she's only partially donned the hood, and the waist is being pulled up in the front.  Even in Size Small, the proportions aren't right. [SEP] This sweatshirt is amazing (almost) in every way! The color, the weight of it, and ESPECIALLY the fabric. It doesn‚Äôt feel like any kind of wool I‚Äôve ever seen‚Ä¶wool can be scratchy and itchy, but this is neither.<br /><br />It‚Äôs insanely soft and smooth, feels great while you‚Äôre wearing it, and is very well made. The wool is obviously very high quality.<br /><br />The only thing I don‚Äôt love about this is how baggy/big it is. I know that‚Äôs a thing right now, but I don‚Äôt like wearing any top that makes me look like a little kid playing dress/up with my mom‚Äôs clothes. Very highly recommended, just size down if you don‚Äôt like the oversized-ness (yeah, I know that's not a word). [SEP] This is the perfect weight merino pullover. The color is gorgeous; it's the perfect neutral. The pullover has not gotten out of shape at all after repeated wearings. I got a Medium in order to wear over shirts/jumpers and it fits well. I would purchase again in another color. [SEP] I wear a medium.  Size chart said to order a large, so I did.  It is loose.  The fit is cute for general wear or to be layered on top of other articles.<br />Love the quality of this shirt.<br />I am more petite.  The sleeves are long on me (not uncommon).  The waist band hits me below my belly button.<br />The wool is soft and lux.<br />The color is as advertised.<br /><br />I am a big fan of this shirt.  I will wear this a lot.  It suits me well. [SEP] I‚Äôm going to the Arctic regions of Norway for three weeks on an all womens exploration expedition in November ‚Ä¶ Guess what I‚Äôll be wearing?!<br /><br />I now have this top in every color, as well as the short sleeved cropped tops, bikini brief, and a mix of joggers and sweats because I love them that much!<br /><br />Woollys needs to sponsor me! [SEP] Woolly's Women's Merino Pro-Knit Wool Cropped Pullover Hoodie is my third Woolly purchase. I was a little apprehensive about ordering it because of its length. It looks short on the model in the listing's photographs.<br /><br />When my hoodie arrived and I had tried it on, I was pleasantly surprised. It's not as short on me as I had thought it was going to be.<br /><br />There are no pockets in this hoodie which is a slight downer. I find myself reaching for them a lot which is something I do often when I wear hoodies. The sleeves are a bit long for me as well. Lack of pockets and long sleeves aside, this is a super cute top!<br /><br />When contemplating this purchase, I was unable to locate the manufacturer‚Äôs measurement chart in the listing so I chose a size XXL. I‚Äôm glad I did. I like the fit a lot.<br /><br />I should note that I do have sensitive skin and typically cannot wear wool without it bothering me. This top is slightly itchy but so far, I‚Äôm able to wear it without feeling uncomfortable. I should note, I have yet to put it through the wash and dryer.<br /><br />For sizing reference:<br />My Bust measures 42"", My Waist Measures 38"", and my Hips Measure 48"". I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù tall. I ordered the XXL. [SEP] Love this quality-made Merino wool hoodie.  The length is great for me since I‚Äôm short; it‚Äôs not quite crop length but hits about waist level.  I got it in black, along with the matching pants.  They feel soft and smooth to the skin and not scratchy at all, very fine weave.  I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and weigh about 123 pounds and went with the Medium because I don‚Äôt like my clothes tight; however, probably a Small would work too, so it‚Äôs according to how you like your clothes to fit.  I was unfamiliar with this brand so this was my first apparel by this label, and I am impressed.  It‚Äôs difficult to find garments of this quality; worth the price. [SEP] I love that this pullover hoodie is 100% Merino wool.  I'd much rather wear Merino wool than any other fabric when hiking because Merino wool works well at both warming and cooling which is an issue when walking 4 miles or so at a time.  This pullover feels lightweight.  The sleeves are a bit long on me for they come down to about the middle of my hands but it's easy to simply push them up.  There is a front pocket that's rather like a shirt pocket that's over one side of the bust area.  My rating is 5 stars for a quality pullover that can be layered or worn alone.  Although it's not thick enough for the chilliest weather, I think it's perfect for those days that start chilly and end up warm.",3,True

I think it would be good for anyone from a child to an adult.<br /><br />I thought it was unique. It came packaged nicely. It would make a good gift. The quality seemed good.<br /><br />It was very comfortable to wear. It was flattering on. I felt it was reasonable. I would recommend it. [SEP] Pretty cheap. I have bought higher quality jewelry at Claire‚Äôs. The gold finish looks really fake. [SEP] This necklace is definitely cheap looking.  It looks like one you would see hanging on the rack next to the cash register in one of those discount Asian stores.  It would make a nice stocking stuffer for a kid, but I don't think too many adults will want to wear it.  The chain is really cheap and not as good as cheap gold plating.  I don't know how much it costs but I wouldn't want to spend more than 5 or 6 dollars for it.  The stone is unpolished pink quartz and for the most part is nice looking.  I don't know if it will permanently stay attached to the chain or not.  Don't give this to your girlfriend as a serious gift or she will see how cheap you are. [SEP] The necklace is pretty but there were some surprises for me when I received it.  The chain looks shorter than the picture.  I thought the pendant would fall mid chest, but it falls near the level of collarbone.  Nobody can really see it.  The chain that came with it is 17 inches long and doesn‚Äôt look very sturdy.  I will need to buy my own longer chain.  Also, the little elephant is indeed adorable, but it‚Äôs not a solid piece.  I had to keep flipping it over, so that the hollow side of the elephant doesn‚Äôt show.<br /><br />The quartz piece is a good substantial size and very pretty.  The quartz piece is slightly pink and about one inch X 3/4 inches.  It looks real to me, because I can see tiny dark grains in the quartz. The necklace does look great with a blouse or sweater. [SEP] I love handcrafted items, and this is so cute, however it looks like it‚Äôs more for a child because the chain is really short. [SEP] I seen the picture of this necklace, but didn‚Äôt expect that it would be very small once on. It‚Äôs not like the picture because the model has the necklace a little longer, but mines don‚Äôt get to that level. Looks very cheap made and not very stylish as the picture. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it! [SEP] This is an okay necklace for little girls.  The chain is only 8 inches long, in the photos you can see it looks like choker on my neck, not the length shown in the advertisement  photos.  The chain also has this weird feel to is, somewhat like touching a chalk board, doesn‚Äôt feel like plastic and it does somewhat feel like metal, it reminds me of the necklaces you could get out of a gum ball machine from stores when I was a kid.  There is no clasp for the chain connections to hook to you have to hook it to a link, not really a problem just pointing that out.  The elephant is a charm, and it isn‚Äôt solid it is just a 1/2 mold, like a charm that was cut into half.  The quarts is rather pretty and good size,  Overall, this isn‚Äôt that great I would say its more for little girls and probably won‚Äôt last long. [SEP] I was really excited for this as I love Rose Quartz.  The stone itself is really nice and pretty.  It was everything else I was not a huge fan of.  This looks really cheap.  It is more of something I would give my child than for myself.  The chain and design were cheap feeling and looking and not something that blew me away. [SEP] Honestly, the whole thing felt 'cheap'. The necklace seems to be made of an inexpensive metal - it feels and sounds cheap.  The color is a bit strange as well.  I like the quarts stone - it is well cut and semi-polished.  The elephant is not well centered.<br /><br />I cant picture any adult woman I know wearing this.  3 stars because I do think my tween daughters would like it.  One loves elephants and they both love pink. [SEP] And don't get me wrong this is a gorgeous necklace. Good artisan and craftsmanship went into this. I love the elephant and I look specially with chunk of quartz on it rose quartz it looks like. The gold chain is nice my spouse thinks it's real gold looks like. Elephant could have been 3D instead of flats only turns around there's something on on all sides. The elephant is beautiful nonetheless as is the wonderful chunk of Crystal that was included. Made by Indian artisans is gorgeous sadly the chain is too small and I wasn't able to get it on it made it too tight almost like a choker as opposed to a necklace. However get a crafty witch I'm using it as a pendulum instead which could be use this one if you know what pendulums are. Too beautiful not to. Keep it anyway cuz I'm almost going to give it to my mom but I can't bring myself to do it because it is too pretty. I happen to love elephants and stuff made from India and that comes from India. I really appreciate it I'm glad I found it on Vine I just wish the chain would have been longer and I would feel too guilty modding it even though I know how to fix jewelry I make my own jewelry I would not want to mod it in anyway cuz it's too beautiful  I'm going to keep it as it isn't as a keepsake and something from look at cuz it's that gorgeous",3,True

"Abillon Travel Toiletry Bag Leather Shaving Dopp Kit, Unisex",['Zipper closure'],[],,4.0,27,7380,"A simple, logoless, durable and sturdy toiletry bag is almost impossible to find but, I finally found one and this is it!<br /><br />I was so excited when I opened this and found that it didn't have a big flashy logo on it and how simple it really is.  The design is great and feels like thought was actually put into how the user would use this bag in many different ways.  There is plenty of room within the main section and has a separate front compartment for other uses.  The large handle on the bag is great and has plenty of room for your hand and wrist.<br /><br />Would absolutely recommend this travel bag for anyone looking for a durable toiletry bag. [SEP] This toiletry bag is made of smooth, pliable leather with brass hardware. It's not the highest quality but it's not bad, either, and I've seen similarly styled bags going for much more - the only difference with those is that they had a designer name, or was packaged in a fancy gift box. This one would benefit from such treatment (in comes in rather dull, pedestrian packaging) but in terms of actual use, it's not bad at all, as it has more than enough room to pack an electric or standard razor, comb, shaving cream, and cologne. Very nicely made too, and it's well-sewn. Overall it has everything you'd want in a toiletry bag, especially for men. [SEP] This is a nice bag. It does look like a better quality than the other ones we have, but our other ones are very basic. This one is nice for my children to put their toiletries in when traveling, but I could see it being great for many kinds of uses. It looks like it'll be pretty durable. It has a zipper across the top, which has worked well so far. There's a snap on the zipper tab that will allow it to be ""locked"" closed. It has a removable handle for toting it or hooking it to something else. The front has a zippered pocket. On the inside, there's a zippered pocket on one side and two open pockets on the other side. It's done its job well so far. [SEP] This bag would be ideal for either men or women. The zipper is full length on the top and very easy to pull and close It also snaps closed. . The front of the bag has a large pull tab zipper for a deep pocket. The inside is very roomy and has two inside pockets. The leather is very soft and pliable. It is not stiff. I have been using this for a make up bag and it works very well. It has also been used for a shaving bag for a trip and has worked well for that too. If you need something for traveling or just around the house for personal use you cannot go wrong with this bag. [SEP] This is an awesome toiletry bag that actually has many purposes, depending on your creativity. I took a train trip recently and didn't have a convenient bag for my watercolor painting gear. This is the perfect size to contain my sketchpad, small paintbox, and brushes. The only thing that wouldn't fit was the water bottle that I was able to attach to the strap with a small carabiner. This is such a cool bag I am going to get another one for toiletries. The design is such that it is equally perfect for either men or women's aesthetic sensibilities.<br /><br />The bag is made of a dark, super soft, slightly textured leather. It has two inside cloth pockets and an outside zippered pocket with a magnetic snap to keep the zipper closed, which I thought was a nice addition. The carrying strap is great for both keeping track of it in a packed suitcase and attaching items (such as my water bottle). [SEP] It's difficult to find a travel bag that's big enough to hold an electric razor, toothbrush, deodorant, hair gel, toothpaste, etc that's not too big or unwieldy to fit in a backpack with headphones and other frequent flyer items.  This bag definitely fits the bill.  It's also soft enough to squeeze it in to the backpack when necessary, but firm enough that I don't worry about the items inside.<br />Functionality is nice too--there is a removable carrying strap, a zipper that has a small strap to button it close (magnetic, too), and a front pouch for storing additional items.  The leather doesn't appear to be high end, but it's durable and soft enough, plus, this is a travel toiletry bag, not a purse or wallet.  The key is the size and functionality and this bag manages to get it exactly right. [SEP] I didn't think I'd use the handy wrist strap for this shaving kit bag, but when I finished packing my suitcase and saw I forgot to pack the shaving kit, and there was no room left in the suitcase, I just slipped the wrist strap over the suitcase handle and problem solved (road trip, not air travel....).  There is a zippered pocket on the outside to store thin items without having to open the main bag and rummage through it.  There is another zippered pocket on the inside, as well as some open pockets. [SEP] The first thing I do when I receive a leather product is to smell it-- I LOVE the aroma of newly tanned leather -- but this bag -- had nothing. No smell, although it did have a leather texture -- so I'm wondering if this is really leather after all. But this is a minor point, as this bag is big, opens wide, holds alot of travel toiletries inside, has a pocket on the inside and a generous carrying strap.<br />HOWEVER-- if something spills in it, then what? I had expected at least one interior compartment  to hold the toiletries in some semblance of order, but there was none. I had also expected a plastic liner to control spills, but there was none. So.... I can fit everything in this but although my little travel bottles of shampoo, mouthwash, conditioner, shampoo, etc -- are all inside  as well -- they are inside a plastic zip bag.<br />This bag fits nicely in either a carry-on or my luggage. Hopefully for the price, it will exhibit acceptable longevity.<br />PS- I used it on a 5 day vacation and it performed perfectly -- stored all my stuff, kept its shape, did not get soaked from the sink water splatter. Good job!!! [SEP] And allows me to safely pack my toiletries and shaving kit when I am on the road. I use both dowuble edge and straight razors (depending on my mood) and this allows me to pack both, along with my shaving mug, brush, shaving soap(s) and my old school Bay Rum aftershave.<br /><br />Fits perfectly in my weekender bag with room to spare. I also keep my hair care products in it as well when I am on the road.<br /><br />Price point is actually a little better than some of my other Dopp kits, so that's always a plus. Made from pebble grain leather, it looks good, and feels good as well.<br /><br />5 star buy.<br /><br />End of Review<br />===<br />Thank you for taking a minute out of your busy life to read my review.

It pretty much looks like the photo, except the synthetic leather feels a bit more rubbery than it looks.<br /><br />The size seems pretty good, would be great for few days trip. It has a zippered compartment in the front, another zippered compartment on the inside, along with two slim slots on the other side.<br />The wrist strap is also detachable.<br /><br />They have a magnetic closure to secure the zipper pull, which was a thoughtful design choice.<br /><br />I would have loved this in a waterproof nylon fabric, too.

Women's Dress Cool Colorful Fancy Novelty Funny Casual Combed Cotton Crew Socks Pack,[],[],,4.0,27,4623,"Can't say I am all that crazy over the red, white and blue pair, but the prism type is great. I love that print. The socks are your standard issue 85% Cotton,15% Polyester blend and they do require hand washing. That will keep them looking bright and new. When you wear them, wear them with pride. [SEP] I received two pair of socks‚ÄîI like the design of the purple ones with pineapples the best, but the primary-colored diamond shapes are also nice.  The quality of the socks is very good.  The strings on the inside of the design are trimmed nicely.  I took pictures for you to see the inside and out.  The designs are very fun and festive! [SEP] I wear a size 9 in women's shoes and these fit me comfortably. I didn't feel like they we too large or had too much fabric. Love that the designs are woven in and are fun and whimsical. The don't offer the comfort and moisture wicking that I am used to wearing, but they are a fun alternative for me to wear at work. [SEP] My wife said these are fun socks and fit as expected. The materials are quality and comfortable. [SEP] These are very cute and comfortable socks.  The pattern is so fun and I particularly love how the model in the listing has styled them.  I‚Äôm not sure if I would ever wear them with shorts but the color and pattern are one of the things that drew me to these.<br /><br />The material is well made and these socks fit well.  The colors are bright and vibrant and they have stood up to being washed a few times.  They would be a great gift for the funky sock lover in your life [SEP] I received 2 pair of socks to review.  The first pair has a rainbow diamond pattern, and the other pair have mouths with the tongues sticking out.  I wear a women's size 10W shoe, and both pairs fit me well, though I did think the mouths fit a little tighter (there's a lot more strings inside those to make the design).  The socks are crew length, or maybe even a little longer.  My only complaint about the fit is that the cuff of the sock fits tighter than the rest, so it cuts into my legs a bit... not so much that I can't wear them, but still a little uncomfortable.  The colors are bright and do not appear to have faded after several washings.  The material is lightweight but not super thin, so they hopefully will last a while.<br /><br />I'm rating this item 4 stars: I like it. [SEP] These are comfortable and soft. Fit well. [SEP] These see a perfect gift for my brother. He loves crazy socks! So nice that the bottom is more neutral and as you go up they get more fun! Very comfortable and light weight. Vibrant colors to add a little fun to any outfit. [SEP] MIGI Colorful Novelty Socks are a nice blend of 80% cotton, 15% polyester and 5% spandex.  They are comfortable and stretchy and stay up well.<br /><br />I machine washed them in cold water and let them air dry.  There was no shrinkage.  There are loose strings on the inside but they are trimmed which helps avoid those annoying toe catching loops of thread.<br /><br />These MIGI socks are delightful, bright and cheery, and designed to add a bit of whimsy to an outfit. [SEP] Fun socks that are practical.  They stay up and don't bunch up around your ankle!  Nice wide band at the top.  Good construction with fun prints.",3,True

It looks ok enough, and I guess if you wanted this to look distressed or vintage, there it is? It definitely looks like the photo, though. I just prefer things to not look beaten up from the get-go. [SEP] This cute little pin will bring a smile. It comes nicely packaged in a blue and yellow box. It is a lapel pin. the colors are vivid and it seems to be nicely made. I don't know too many men who would wear it but it is a fun piece for kids and those who work with them. adorable. [SEP] Good pin. Looks pretty cool. Seems to be well made. Not a bad price. [SEP] I really like this pin.  I think the pixel design is done well and it has a very interesting texture to its look.  It‚Äôs small and subtle touch but this was a perfect addition to my backpack.

"Cushion Low Cut Socks,WXXM Mens Low Cut Ankle Athletic Socks Cotton Mesh Cushioned Stretchy Running Ventilation Sport Tab Socks Large 3 Pairs White",[],[],,3.4,13,19552,"As far as athletic socks go, these are on the thin side. I usually prefer my work out socks to be on the thicker side to absorb the sweat and also provide a layer of cushion to my sneakers. These socks are thin so you can definitely feel the your sneakers. Only recommended if you like thinner socks otherwise I would stay away. [SEP] These are cushioned bottom socks, with an airy type mesh top. They are really nice for wearing with tennis shoes. [SEP] Wore these to a college football game where there was limited seating and stood most of the game. They did run a little small; not an excess of sock left on a ladies 8 1/2 foot. The reinforced arch support did keep my foot from getting tired and the weave of the sock prevents your feet from getting overheated. I did like the little extra material at the top of the heel so my shoe didn‚Äôt rub and create any blisters. Overall I liked these socks and would definitely buy again. [SEP] These socks have almost NO stretch to them.  It was a struggle to get them on and then they bit into the front of my ankle so much, it was painful.  I couldn‚Äôt keep them on for more than a few moments as it felt like they were cutting into my skin.  I can‚Äôt imagine trying to walk, let alone run, in these socks.  Too painful.  They definitely need more stretch. [SEP] I was surprised at how tightly these socks fit. They almost felt like compression socks. Since they‚Äôre tight, they don‚Äôt slip off of the heel while walking, and they offer a lot of support. I was, however, happy to take them off at the end of the day. There‚Äôs not a lot of give in the elastic. [SEP] WXXM Athletic Ankle Socks are a very nice sock for those seeking to join the ankle sock craze. The socks are comfortable, the toe area is a bit thicker than the rest which adds comfort and durability to the socks. I also like that there are breathable elements of the sock and it has attractive styling albeit aggressive branding.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Fit and feel. These socks feel good against the foot and they didn't contribute to a ton of sweat while working out even in hot outdoor conditions<br />- Styling. Ankle socks are all the craze now and these socks won't show even when walking or running. When you remove your shoes the socks have a signature styling to them that fits with athletic apparel.<br />- Comfort. There are breathable elements to this sock as well as a bit of padding around the toe area. This meant activities like basketball, boxing and jogging were not hindered at all by these socks.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Wouldn't always stay put. Until I had broken these socks in a bit they wouldn't stay put within my shoe. During my first couple of weeks with this sock, I had to remove my shoes and reposition the socks at least 2 or 3 times each day. That improved as the socks got broken in but there were still times when I had to reposition the socks even after weeks of usage.<br />- The WXXM branding is literally front and center with this sock. They're no show socks so I really don't understand why this bold choice was made. The lettering could have been several font sizes smaller.<br /><br />Overall, these socks are comfortable, functional and stylish. However, it is very important to pick the right size with these socks. Order them too big and they'll lose the no show effect everyone seems to covet these days. Order them too small and you'll have to break them in, that is, stretch them out a bit just for them to stay put and not ride up your feet during vigorous activities. Comparatively speaking, these socks are OK. They didn't exceed my expectations at all but I wasn't disappointed by this product either. Translation, if these socks were gifted to someone I think they'd wear them but it's doubtful they be the first socks out of the drawer.",3,True

It is on the thinner side too but will be warm enough in the winter as long as you have a nice warm jacket. With that in mind I would think this is best for Spring and Fall really. I do like that it has a hoodie with it and also like the two little pockets in the front, perfect to warm up your hands or keep your phone in it.<br /><br />The sweatshirt is true to size. I am 5'7"" at about 200lbs and this fits just right with a nice loose fit. It like that this top is not short in the torso which is great. This shirt is pretty well made and hopefully will hold up during washing. [SEP] This is a nice casual pull over hoodie sweatshirt. It's pretty in a nice laid back way and looks great with a good pair of jeans.<br />The two tone coloring is great. It comes in a variety of colors for the upper section of the shirt but the lower section is a grey color. It has draw strings at the top which are a good length and work well if you want to tighten the hood up on yourself and also look good hanging down. There is a zip at the top to make it easier to get over your head and it also has a nice big pocket/pouch in the front for your hands.<br />I found that it ran just a bit small, not by much but it seemed a tad short in the arms. Other than that it's a very nice hoodie sweatshirt. [SEP] Runs Small<br />My normal shirt size is a xs/s. When I want to layer for winter, I usually go with a size large which is plenty big on me; creating a nice pocket of warmth. I ordered this sweatshirt in a large. I wish I went with an XL. It is roomy & very very warm which is great, but itw not as long as I'd hoped. I can just pull it down to right under my butt. When I sit, I cannot pull it down over my hips & thighs. My upper body is snug as a bug in a rug, but my hips & thighs are chilled.<br /><br />I am a petite 5'2"" Irish lass who lives in a tiny historic log cabin (think Abe Lincoln) with only a wood stove for heat. Warm winter clothing is a necessity for my lifestyle. While my husband doesn't like my bum covered in winter, I do. If this was just a little looser & longer, it would have been a perfect addition to my large winter sweaters. This doesn't mean I wont use it. I happen to be wearing it right now & yep, my legs are cold, but the rest of me is snuggley.<br /><br />Cancer Chemicals<br />After wearing it, I looked for the washing tag & under that tag is a tag that says, ""Warning this product can expose you to chemicals including lead and cadmium which are known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm."" (I've included a photo of the tag).<br /><br />I googled this wondering what on earth could be in a cotton/polyester sweatshirt that could be dangerous. It appears that the most common culprit for this warning in clothing is thanks to the dyes used. Seriously WTF? Manufactures can't choose non toxic dyes!?! So what about when this is washed? What does that do to the environment? Or how about, making it clear on the product page that this article of clothing has this warning label so folks can decide if they want to buy it or not? Ordering it & not knowing, wearing it, then seeing that tag is just wrong. I know some people thing the P65 warning is nonsense. I've learned enough over the years, that it concerns me. If it doesn't bother you, that's your right. Me, I'd rather know up front, so I can avoid such clothing. [SEP] The sizing is just right on this sweatshirt.  It feels very good on.  Launders nicely and comes out with little or no shrinkage.<br />I like this kind of item to just hand around in on the weekends.  in fact I keep one of these in the back seat of my car so if I am out and about and it gets cold I can just slip it on.<br />Love the kangaroo pockets on the front of this item.  Great to slip your car keys in and maybe a little bit of money so that you aren't caught broke.<br />Recommended. [SEP] This is a nice, comfortable to wear, zip up hoodie. I ordered it in my usual size large and it does fit pretty well although it is slightly baggy or at least compared to another hoodie I have by this brand in the same size.  To compare, I laid the other hoodie on top of this one, and this hoodie is 3 or 4 inches bigger, width wise.  The sizing measurements provided by the seller do seem to be pretty accurate though so I would go by their chart to determine what will work best for you. For me, I can easily wear a t-shirt underneath without the hoodie being too tight.<br /><br />The hoodie sweatshirt is pretty soft even after washing and drying.  I washed and dried according to directions (cold and tumble dry low) and it looks and feels just fine.  The item does come with a Proposition 65 label.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty happy with this sweatshirt as it's great for lounging around the house or when you are going for a casual look. [SEP] Has a weird cut, flares out at the bottom in an unflattering way. Large was too big, sized up based on reviews and it was too big. Didn't like the fabric. It's fuzzy but also kind of stiff? Not worth it. [SEP] This is a pretty heavy hoody, not winter wear by itself but perfect for cold days.  I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù 180lbs 36/38B and have this in the Large.  this fits me very comfortably, large enough to wear another shirt under neath it if I want to.  The kangaroo pouch is large enough to hold a phone in a case without issue. Zip at the neck goes up easily.  Overall, comfortable shirt. [SEP] Super warm, cozy, comfortable, flattering.  I am 5'5"" about 140# and ordered large because I like it a little big.  They don""t shrink or pill or fade,  Not a lightweight fleece.",3,True

Orchid Row's Lace Trim Lightweight Travel Scarf Saffron,[],[],,4.5,21,780,"The color is as vibrant as you see in the picture. Hand Wash, I hung it from a hanger to dry and then put it in the dryer with some stockings/pantyhose to get any wrinkles out. Although for the price, I think I will stick to my favorite [[ASIN:B07CZ3NFM5 Women's 100% Chiffon Scarf Neck Fashionable Printing Country Style Lightweight scarves for Ladies and Girls (Purple)]] and [[ASIN:B015MY2YMA MissShorthair Womens Long Scarf in Solid Color Large Sheer Shawl Wraps for Evening]] [SEP] This is a pretty scarf. It's VERY light, and the edges look like they might fray, but so far so good.  The color is bright, and it's soft to the touch. However I don't think it's worth $24!  Maybe half that would be reasonable for this quality. [SEP] First thing I loved about this scarf was the deep, bright Saffron color. The color is rich-looking, not gaudy. Though it seems to be an ideal Autumn  color, it is easily adaptable to Spring or Summer wear.<br /><br />Next, I loved the weight of the fabric. Light as air, the scarf is 100 polyester and the lace is 100% nylon. The lace is soft, not scratchy, and has little &#34;eyelash fringe&#34; around it, which is a pretty touch.<br /><br />As I said, it looks like it will be perfect in Autumn --around the neck of a sweater, tucked/wrapped near the collar of a jacket-- any number of ways! But it is perfect to wear right now (Summer) as a over-the-shoulders wrap at the beach or in a restaurant, when the AC is too much. In the Spring, I can picture it with a lightweight raincoat around Easter time or St. Pat's Day. (I don't see this as a winter accessory, no matter where you live, because the design/lace/fabric is just too light and airy to mix well with heavy winter clothing. Also, the color(s) don't really say &#34;winter&#34;.)<br /><br />The label says it can be hand-washed. (I'd be VERY careful with washing however, since it IS so lightweight and the lace is delicate.)<br /><br />The price is reasonable for an accessory that is pretty and will give you three season wear. [SEP] My spouse loves this Orchid Row Lace Trim Lightweight Travel Scarf.<br /><br />We recently took a trip to Paris and found a little store near our hotel that sold Tibetan textiles. She found a blue scarf there that she then wore the rest of the trip. It was beautiful.<br /><br />This scarf is very similar. Lightweight, big enough to wrap around, good for everyday wear.<br /><br />It's also very attractive and could go with a lot of other coats and outerwear. [SEP] The Orchid Row Lace Trim Lightweight Travel Scarf is attractive, warm, and well-constructed. Made in Shanghai, China the body is 100% polyester fine thread that you can see through when it is draped in a single layer. When the 74 inches long and 32 inches wide scarf is wrapped in multiple layers, the saffron color is bright. The 3 inches wide lace border is 100% nylon and has a floral vine pattern. The scarf is very soft against my wife‚Äôs neck and she wears it in air conditioned stores now.  It will be nice to wear it in the Fall when we travel more. The scarf is hand wash only and line dry. [SEP] Yellow isn't normally my color but this pretty scarf is almost a butterscotch color that looks very nice. The fabric is fairly thin, so it's easy to wrap or knot without a lot of bulk. I wore it with a chambray dress and got lots of compliments but I think the color would go well into the fall season too. I especially love that the edges of the scarf have a tiny line of eyelash lace; it gives it an extra feminine flair without being too over the top. [SEP] Absolutely beautiful, rich color! The scarf has a delicate weave that makes the material light with a nice drape. If you are looking for a scarf to keep you warm in winter, this might be too light, but it will give some warmth to your neck. It would look great with a casual outfit, but could be used with something dressier. It is, at $24, priced too high, in my opinion. If you don't mind paying that much, however, you won't be disappointed. [SEP] Soft, gorgeous color, and very pretty trim! It's also a nice length and width, and easy to care for! [SEP] Perfect color for my prints and the fabric is soft. [SEP] Love it",3,True
"Charis Allure Women's Casual Blazer Button Lapel Collar Suits Long Sleeves Coat, Black, Medium","['Button closure', 'Machine Wash']",[],,3.3,10,4669,"If you have an interview, a nice blazer over a skirt or pants with a nice blouse always works. This is a nicely made blazer and can also be worn with jeans. You can do so much with a nice blazer and it should be a wardrobe staple. The material is a more casual fabric but it still looks good. [SEP] This is a classic blazer. They've added rolled up sleeves for a more casual look, which is nice.  Well designed with nice material. [SEP] At the point at which I ordered this item, the smallest size offered was medium, which I selected because I was fairly certain I was not L or XL. Looking at the measurements for a medium I am on the line between medium and small, so a medium should have been at least close to fitting, but if I‚Äôd known a small was going to be added to the offerings I would have waited to get a small even if it potentially meant the price would go up. The sleeve length and width is great, and the overall length is perfect, but the overall width could fit me and a couple friends, and cannot be mitigated by buttoning up as the buttons are solely for show. I was also disappointed because I expected more of a sweater-like feel to the fabric, but it definitely feels like a casual suit jacket. As this is a 100% polyester item, I suspect that despite the directions saying to wash in cold water that warm water washing will not shrink it much if at all. If I find this assumption is wrong and washing does modify the garment I will update this review, but I do not have high expectations at this point. [SEP] The quality of the fabric is kind of cheap.<br />The structure of it is okay but I don‚Äôt know if I could truly call it a blazer.<br />Overall, it‚Äôs just ok.

I have bifocal glasses, but there isn't the jarring change from regular to bifocal like these sunglasses have.  I tried using them at the pool the other day to read in the sunlight, and they helped with that, but it wasn't as easy as reading with my regular glasses.  I have reading sunglasses that I like a lot better than these.  They seem to be sturdy enough built, and some people really like them.  I just find the bifocal part a little too intense. [SEP] These are great glasses for those of you who are like me and go through glasses like Kleenex, from either loosing them or accidentally messing them up.  The overall construction of the glasses is nicely done and the lenses came in without a scratch.  The glasses themselves seem like they might bend out of shape somewhat easily due to their style.  I would say these would be better on people who have larger heads.  I have an issue with them being a bit loose on me and I don't have a small head.  The price is nice for what you get. [SEP] UV protection for your eyes, bifocal lenses, 2.5x. plastic arms. Came with a cloth to clean glasses. A case to keep your glasses in. I use these while driving the bifocal works well. Very nice made for man or woman. [SEP] These glasses by SKYWAY are a first for me. I've never seen sunglasses with a bifocal for reading, except from an eye doctor. I've needed to go get my eyes checked for 2 or 3 years now and I keep putting it off. My current prescription is .5 these sunglasses are 2.5. These glasses are amazing!! I can see perfectly to read wearing them. The icing on the cake is they are sunglasses also. A very nice shade of purple that gradually fades as they go down lower on the lens. I'm not sure why they are called ""grey"" in the sellers description because they aren't. These are currently my favorite glasses, hands down. They are lightweight, durable and a great style. Included with these reading glasses/sunglasses is a hardshell glasses case and a glasses cleaning cloth. Another awesome point about these glasses is the price, I've seen other reading glasses, sans the sunglasses, and they have ran at least 2 or 3 times the price of these glassesby SKYWAY. They are a great value and are very fashionable. 5+++ stars for these great glasses. Thank you, SKYWAY!! [SEP] My dad was complaining about not seeing well in one eye even with his contact in so I had him try these. They‚Äôre a nice pair of sunglasses but if you look down they have a good bifocal area at the bottom only,  to help with reading. He loves them! Great for those who are driving but need to read maps or gps details or work outside and may need to read something. [SEP] Though I would probably not give up my expensive name-brand sunglasses for this product, when close work or reading is required while outside in bright sunlight, these sunglasses are just the ticket. The 2.5x magnification is great for very close work, or reading extra-fine print. [SEP] The idea of having reading glasses integrated to otherwise normal sunglasses seemed a good one.<br /><br />The glasses arrived in a padded envelope and the included case is not rigid either. As a result, the nose bridge separated from one side (see picture). It turned out repairable but it‚Äôs hard to say if the subsequent fragility is a result of that or inherent to the design. (Judging by the looks, I‚Äôd tend to think the latter.)<br /><br />Once ‚Äúrepaired‚Äù, the glasses turned out to be a bit tight for my admittedly large head. The lenses have reading insets (2.5+) and that is a good idea. I‚Äôm not used to that and at least initially it feels like the reading portion is a bit too high, or at least a bit close to normal vision (without a prescription). The lenses have a bit of a graduated tint and do not appear to have polarization or coatings (scratch or fog resistance).<br /><br />The frame does not ooze strength and although I don‚Äôt have extensive experience with it, I‚Äôm not sure it would endure much more than careful treatment. The soft case is actually fairly stylish but also doesn‚Äôt keep the glasses from adverse forces under rough treatment. [SEP] To read at the beach or anywhere outside these are ideal.  Since they're bi-focal they work in a wide variety of uses.  I even can drive with these on quite comfortably.  Speaking of comfort these are that due especially to the light-weight nature and the ergonomic fitting design.  Far better than what I expected at only $12 at the time I received these.  They even have a decent zipper semi-hard case.  I think these look fantastic and seem to fit my face as well as my wife's leading me to further believe the design is pretty spot-on right.  I truly enjoy these reading shades. [SEP] These glasses sounded interesting... tinted reading glasses aren't something I see everyday. However, the magnification part is only at the very bottom of the glasses, where there is no tint. So if you're, say, on the beach reading, and you want to protect your eyes from the bright white page, then these glasses don't deliver. You're going to be looking through the untinted part.<br /><br />So I can't quite understand how these are going to be useful. Perhaps in the car, when you want sunglasses for the outside, and the untinted part for reading while you drive. Or something.<br /><br />The glasses themselves seem fine. They are light and a little delicate and look nice on the face. They come with a soft carrying case. Overall, the quality and the price seem to match.<br /><br />Ultimately, these do not solve the problem of needing reading glasses in bright light. Instead, they just allow your pupils to dilate a bit from the dark, top part, while too-bright light still floods in from where you are actually looking when you read. [SEP] Saves you from carrying along a set of both sunglasses and reading glasses, without a prescription. These are very light, have a unique nose bridge (actually pretty cool idea) with rubber tips, and no wrap around the ear braces, to reduce that irritation. The shade is just enough above the 'bi-focal' reader lens that you can read outdoors.  As for the reader lens, it is thicker than the sunglasses, so there is a visible line, but really, who cares, these are useful. They also come with a decent zippered case and a microfiber cleaning cloth. I won't be forgetting these on a restaurant dining table, these are keepers.",3,True

My main issue is the wasteful packaging. It comes in a Tiffany blue box with a foam insert that was clearly meant for earrings! Worse, each bracelet is encased inside a tight, saran wrap-like seal that is more appropriate to freeze dried food than jewelry. In my struggle to remove the plastic, I used a scissor which had the unfortunate impact of scratching the edge of the woman's bracelet. When I finally removed both ID bracelet, the quality did not impress me. [SEP] These bracelets arrived in a Tiffany blue box.

[SEP] The ladies bracelet makes for a great addition to a main bracelet, but I wouldnt wear it by itself. I was expecting a more solid piece of jewelry, but it seems light and plasticy. It's dainty enough that you can't tell, especially when it's paired with another piece. I've been wearing it 24/7 and it's held up well, through a couple of weeks of showers, too. The men's bracelet, since it's bigger, you can tell it's not a solid metal bracelet. It looks like a plastic bracelet. [SEP] Beautiful shiny gold tone pieces. The woman's very petite, the man's more masculine. As per the pictures, however, there were some problems. There is not much difference in length between the two.

Also, the man's version had 2 very deep scratches on the plate.<br /> These would probably be fine for engraving if the sizes worked.<br />One really odd note: the packaging was weird. Both came in a single box, which is ok as it's meant to be a gift for  a couple. However, each piece was wrapped individually in some kind of clear plastic that was a pain to get off, especially the female version. I am sure this was done to protect the pieces, but there must be a better way. It was unbecoming and a nuisance. [SEP] Very good and reach looking jewelry! Suitable for almost any occasion",3,True

There are some clear rounds thrown in for extra sparkle, and a few metallic findings that enrich the overall look. This is a true collar-style necklace, and it fits me like an 18&#34; necklace, and that's using the extender.  Because of the construction, you won't be able to add more than about another inch because it won't lay correctly if you do.  If you like longer necklaces then this piece probably isn't for you.

I wear a size 7.5-8 in shoes and have never had a pair of women's socks fit this oddly tight.  I tried on multiple pairs in the pack and they are all too tight, so it wasn't just a fluke on the first pair.  I'm sure they would get even tighter after washing.<br /><br />The socks are somewhere between thin and medium thickness; definitely not a thick sock as you would expect of a winter sock.  I do like the colorful patterns on the socks. [SEP] I love these socks - they're warm and comfy, and with the variety of patterns, there's one to match any outfit. They fit closely, no bulk or excess fabric. The colors are pretty and the patterns are unique. They'd make a great gift because they look so festive. [SEP] Socks are socks, that is a given, but sometimes they are scratchy and sometimes they are too thin or too small. These are comfortable, a nice thickness, not overly thick but thicker than many I own, accurately sized and wash up nicely. Overall, I give these five stars for style and comfort and recommend them to anyone who likes the design. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] Good for a hiking sock. Breathable enough to not cause sweat pools. They are warm enough for indoor use. They clean really easily too. [SEP] Very happy in receiving this winter soft warm socks as winter is around the corner here in NYC. I usually like walking around my home with socks so this socks come in handy for that. They are very soft and have a nice grip to it so it won‚Äôt get loosen while walking on them as other warm socks do. This also are very stylish with different patterns and colors, you can por other with some leggings and even some low boots. Definitely recommend!! [SEP] My first impression upon receiving this pack of socks is that the colors are delightful. They're bright and cheerful. Then, I put them on. Wow! Not only are they soft and comfortable, they also have non-binding ankle tops ... which is nice if you are a person who is a little larger or who has foot issues.<br /><br />The length of the foot was perfect for me (size 7 shoe ... hose are often a little long in the foot, and the heel turning ends up around my ankle). They are warm without being too heavy, and I anticipate would wick moisture well simply because the majority of the fibers are cotton and wool.<br /><br />I will look forward to wearing these on a January trip to coastal Italy, where much time will be spent outdoors. HIghly recommended. [SEP] Beautiful socks, but they dont even pass over a heel.. wasted [SEP] These socks are small. I wear 10EE in women's shoes, and the heel in the sock doesn't quite cover my heel. This is before the socks have been washed. I'm assuming they will shrink during washing.<br /><br />The patterns are very attractive. At first look, these socks look well made. However, there were several loose threads. As I was removing these threads, I came across some that were attached to the sock. I don't know how this affect the durability of the sock.<br /><br />The yarns used for the pattern are loose on the inside of the side. This may cause snagging.",3,True
Stocking Fox Women's Plus Size Opaque Stretch Black Tights XX-Large 2-Pack,[],[],,3.3,22,7163,"These are your standard, high waisted, opaque tights, which on the one hand nip in your belly just a little bit, but on the other hand, tend to roll down to the smallest part of your waist and feel kind of annoying. There is a small color difference where it transitions from your upper thigh to where you might find the leg opening of ‚Äúgranny style‚Äù briefs, which means you‚Äôre not going to see that transition for most garments, but at the same time, you can‚Äôt wear them with short shorts or a leotard, for example. They look and feel as you would expect for this type of pantyhose. The mostly opaque fabric has a matte quality, as opposed to some shinier ones, which means that some garments might cling to it a little bit. [SEP] If they got the sizing right these would easily be four or five-star hose. However, they run two sizes small. the tights themselves are quite well made. they are truly and opague black. They are comfortable and seem to be run and snag resistant. the waistband doesn't roll and they fell good on. But the caveat is the sizing is way off. The XX-Large is a comfortable large. If you can figure out the sizing they are fine. [SEP] Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from these black tights when I selected them for review, but i am so surprised and pleased at how easy they are to put on, how soft they are and how well they fit.  I received the XXL size for review and they are perfect.  I'm 5'9"", 142 pounds and they aren't tight feeling at all, but still are form fitting.  They have lots of stretch so if you are bigger than me they should still fit.  Unless you are overly Rubenesque, or more petite, I recommend this size despite them being XXL. [SEP] Stocking Fox Women's Plus Size Opaque Stretch Black Tights XX-Large 2-Pack are comfortable, high quality tights. These opaque tights are true opaque, covering your legs completely in a non-sheer black. The fit is smooth, but not tight, leaving room for your skin to breathe. They are so comfortable in their fit, you feel like you aren‚Äôt wearing heavier opaque tights at all. A wonderful feature on these tights is the waist band. It is made very wide- so wide that it never rolls over. Every pair of pantyhose and tights I have worn always roll over, even just a little- but not these- the band stays smooth and in place.<br /><br />As for comfort, these are so soft and breathable, your legs feel great in these. They are not control top, but do keep your waist in place, but if you need control on your middle, you may want to use a pair of control top panties over these. Washing these is a snap, just put them in a net bag in your wash and line dry. I can see these getting a lot of wear, due to the thick opaque material being 85% nylon, 15% spandex and 70 denier. I am almost 5 feet 9 inches tall and weigh between 180 and 190 pounds and the XX-Large size fit lovely- not tight, just right. I could see a woman smaller or larger than me being comfortable in these as well. Beautiful, high quality tights with a non-rolling waistband that are so comfortable and soft to wear gets a big 5 STARS. [SEP] I gave bad memories of uncomfortable, ill fitting tights from my childhood. The crotch always seems to find a point between its optimal location and my knees.<br /><br />Well, scratch that, baby, because it‚Äôs a new age. What struck me first about these was the softness and stretchability of the fabric. I was amazed! They went on easily, didn‚Äôt pull in odd places, and stayed put. Hallelujah, no saggy crotch! The fabric isn‚Äôt think and opaque, but isn‚Äôt even close to a pair of black nylons. I think it gives just the right amount of coverage and warmth.<br /><br />They are super comfortable and I could wear them all day. I‚Äôm absolutely delighted I decided to overlook my bad past experiences, because these are going to look adorable with my favorite boots! Recommended!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I have done my best to give you a detailed and honest opinion. If you found my review helpful, please click the Helpful button below. [SEP] I saw a lot of reviews for these saying they were far too small, and I wonder if body shape plays into the fit, as the XXL fit me well, though I do think the leg part might be on the short side, at least according to the chart, which lists 5‚Äô8‚Äù to 6‚Äô (5‚Äô12‚Äù *eye roll) for the 2XL. I wear mostly US 18‚Äôs, am 5‚Äô8‚Äù, and carry the majority of my weight in legs, hips, and thighs, so I‚Äôm pear-shaped rather than apple shaped. These tights went on easily with room to spare‚Äîno, I couldn‚Äôt get my arm in up to the elbow like the model in the picture , but I‚Äôm easily able to pull the top several inches away from my hips and stomach, and I can move around in them without any problems. The material seems quite durable and is sufficiently opaque though I very rarely wear skirts or dresses‚ÄîI like to be able to wear tights like these under slacks or jeans in cooler weather for warmth. I was able to comfortably wear these all day, and didn‚Äôt have to fight to get them down or back up when it came time for bathroom breaks. For the fit and durability, these seem like a good deal for the money. 5 stars [SEP] I wear a 2x in ""normal"" American sizes, but this 2x runs more like a 14-16. The size chart in the description is no help at all. The quality and density of fabric seems good [SEP] I was not too hopeful when I saw all the reviews saying that these run small but they actually fit me pretty well.  Yes, It was a bit of a stretch at the top rendering them less opaque than at the feet but somehow, I think this is as designed.  They looked similar on me to the pic of the woman in the description.  I havent worn hosiery in a long time but that is how I remember stockings fitting.<br /><br />The material is SUPER soft.  Perhaps a bit thinner than I expected for tights (vs stockings) but they were so soft I really dont care.  They seem sturdy - did not snag on my rough heels or broken nail.<br /><br />I would get these again!",3,True

[SEP] If you have a short neck, be aware that this is closer to a true turtleneck than a mock. I was hoping for the 2-3 inch collar of a true mock. This has a long collar, that ended up having to be folded significantly for me. That makes it tighter around my throat, and accentuates the fact that I have a thick and short neck. Also, it is a bit short for tucking, if you have any kind of a tummy. Ah well... It will work for layering, but I'll keep looking for the perfect item! [SEP] They're really shiny polyester.

[SEP] Pros:<br />Good quality<br />Good stitching<br />Exactly like the pictures<br />Very comfortable<br /><br />Cons:<br />Runs  too small for me [SEP] The first thing we have to note is that these aren't sized accurately to US sizes. As when you order clothing from over seas, you really need to go a size up to get the correct fit. Beyond that, the color is vibrant and the material seems to be a good quality. If you manage to get the right size, the fit is pretty good, but the strings that go around to tie in the back are a little shorter than would be ideal.

The top is not see through even after getting wet. Careful on sizing, I feel the cups run just a tad bit small. I normally wear medium tops, and this medium definitely fits a tid smaller.

Orchid Row Women's Classic and Chic Wide Brim Floppy Straw Sunhat Black,[],[],,4.0,25,3596,"This is a great straw sun hat to wear to prevent sun damage to your face/neck while still having a bit of style - the weave is tight enough to provide shade and the brim is large enough to cover your face and neck while having a slight 'flop'/bend to it, but still has a little rigidity/shape to it. It doesn't feel too heavy while wearing it, and while it's 'one size', it fits well (if you have a rather large head, you might have problems). [SEP] This is exactly what I wanted! Stylish, black, soft enough not to irritate my skin, and with just the right amount of &#34;flop&#34; to it.<br /><br />It sits softly and conforms to the shape of my head, contouring itself nicely, but still holding the brim far enough out on all sides that my nose and other parts of my face stay shaded.<br /><br />I was worried it might be scratchy, but it's not, it's great!<br /><br />I sit outside watching my kids play often enough that I wanted something to throw on quickly as I run out that wouldn't make me look silly.

It is a nice solid black color and looks well made. It is comfortable and fits my head perfectly. I like to wear mine to the beach or when I‚Äôm out doing yard work. You do have to be careful on windy days, due to the wide brim catching the wind. Love this hat though! [SEP] I am a fan of this hat and have worn it at the beach and the pool and it looks very elegant. It keeps the sun off my face and stays snug and in place. I also wore it just walking around in Cabo with a sundress and it looked great [SEP] Nice style and covers the head very well [SEP] A cute floppy sun hat to go with a swim suit or to wear in the summer with a sun dress. I did kind of feel like it was on the ever so slightly too small side on my head, but not enough to bother me too much. The brim was nice and wide and had a good amount of floppiness. My daughters love to try on my hat! [SEP] Hat runs small. [SEP] Fit as expected [SEP] Great floppy for vaca.  This is a very large hat so you can actually keep the direct rays of the sun off your neck and shoulders.  It's great for vaca but to be honest it's so big that it really can't be packed so be prepared to carry it along on the plane or train.  It looks great by itself but you can easily dress it up with a scarf and you can match any outfit. [SEP] Fun and stylish floppy straw hat with wide brim. Versatile enough to wear with your best dress, or your bathing suit at the pool or on the beach.  The hat is made of flexible straw so if you if you wear &#34;big hair&#34; it will stretch just fine over any hair style. The band is strong enough to hold on with slight wind, and the brim is large enough to protect face and neck from sun. The top can be worn rounded, or creased in the middle like a fedora. The brim can also be bent up into place. Find your best style and have fun with different looks. This is definitely a five star product, but the price killed it for me.

They look nice and dress up an outfit. [SEP] I used these earrings for Halloween this year.  They are a bit heavy for earrings and any earring you wear should not actually pull your lobe down by the weight of the earring.  So I would wear these very sparingly.  They are quite bit so they will get noticed. [SEP] I can honestly say 99% of the costume jewelry I have purchased off of Amazon I have been super happy with!  These earrings were not the case.  They came in a nice case, and opening them, I instantly thought there is no way this is what I ordered.  The pearls, are half white beads with a pearl coating, every thing about them screams cheap.

If you want to wear them as mood pieces, all well and good. But ordinary wear? Daily wear? Formal wear? Never.<br /><br />We give four stars because of relatively good quality.

Comfort is great. Looks good. Shiny. Looks great on my grand diver. [SEP] Wowzer! These folks have made the ultimate NATO. Just oozes quality.<br />Now, when will more be in stock? [SEP] I'm a bit of a watch strap addict.  I'm constantly buying new ones and swapping out and trying new looks.  So I've tried dozens of NATO straps over the years.  But I have never found one as comfortable and beautiful as this one!  I tried the blue one first, and it impressed me so much that I immediately ordered the green one and the striped one as well.  The material is a much tighter weave than most standard NATO straps, and it's softer and more comfortable.  It seems more durable too, but time will tell.  All-in-all, if you're looking for a watch strap that looks good and feels as good as it looks, look no further.  This is the one. [SEP] I could tell immediately that this strap was higher quality than the ones I am used to [SEP] Having purchased over a dozen different NATO straps, this is by far my favorite.  Very comfortable and solved the biggest issue I have with NATO straps, since I have a larger wrist.  That is there‚Äôs never enough strap, to fold and tuck under the holder.  The added strap length and floating holder is brilliant...strange that other manufacturers don‚Äôt do the same. More colors would be great, since this will be the only NATO strap, I‚Äôll be buying, going forward.  This is by far the best strap, if you have a larger wrist and like re-tucking the excess strap, under the holder. [SEP] These are some of the best NATO straps available.  They compare very well with my Omega strap, and for a fraction of the price.  They are soft and strong. [SEP] Very comfortable watch band [SEP] very nice product,  high quality and the colour is exactly the same what is on the photo, absolutely loved it,<br />only thing it's a little bit too long but it's not a big deal.

I love that it's environmentally friendly I like the latex.

The gloves also have some stretch/elasticity to them so I am able to tuck my sleeves in the gloves. The glove sleeves stay up without slipping, unlike other gloves.

Outside is opening back up, spring has begun! Now that it's time to let fresh air in and start going out again, I found a solution for sprucing up my house and keeping my nails looking presentable. These gloves are durable and can handle the very hot water I like for dishwashing. There is a scrubby texture on the palms and finger tips, so I use them to clean each other while still on the hands after I get them dirty. The grip also helps with hand washing clothes. There are 4 in a pack so you can have for different chores if you like. My sleeves stay dry, my nail polish lasts, and you can't believe the pleasure of not worrying about jewelry when you just want to jump in and scrub something! But the best part are the embossed heart shapes on the sleeves. They add sweetness to an otherwise utilitarian object. The color itself reminds me that these are natural and doesn't dissuade my partner from enjoying them too (which is the real way I achieved my original objectives hee hee.)  ...If I may read your fortune in the soap suds: the new order of things may have you online shopping more often, so keep your tape measure and conversion charts handy to avoid unecessary anguish over the size and origins of a product.

Byairls Funny Meme Socks Crazy Socks Casual Cotton Socks Novelty Dress Socks (J1),"['80% Cotton, 17% Polyester, 3% Spandex', 'Machine Wash']",[],,3.1,28,4629,"they had spelled hang correctly. You just can't ""hany"" with your dog - which is what the socks say. I am sure the girl won't mind and will wear them anyway. It is unbelievable that they have a spelling error like this on a product that is meant to be worn. [SEP] Either it was error or it was done on purpose, but they say, ""I just wanna hany with my dog"".  I don't think anyone would really be able to easily read anything from just looking at them from a reasonable distance except for the word, ""dog"".  ""Hany"" - really.  The socks though, are soft, stretchy very colorful and light weight.  The colors and designs are really pretty and my teens love them.  I think they're well made and should last for a while. [SEP] These are decent socks.  Well made and comfortable.  Not sure what size they were supposed to be as there was no size listed and no size given on the package.  FYI they are a woman's size 9 (at least that is what my daughter wears and these fit her very well).  My issue is with the odd saying. ""hany with my dogs""  either I don't understand or know slang (a very real possibility) or the meant to say ""hang with my dogs""  either way it is kinda odd.  Being socks I guess it really isn't important what they say but more that they are comfortable and these socks are indeed very comfy. [SEP] I really wish I could go out in public in this pair of socks.  The colors are rich and bright.  The design is cute and very trendy.  HOWEVER, the manufacturer actually sent out this product without spellchecking it!!!  Who does that?!  Instead of ""I just want to hang with my dog"", they sent it out saying ""I just want to HANY with my dog!""  Too bad because they washed well and fit nicely. [SEP] Got these for my kids to wear, they love silly socks. They are well made actually, and pretty comfy. [SEP] I wear a size 8 in womens and these fit me perfectly! I really like the stripes on the socks and the fact they're for dog people! The saying was clearly typoed but makes me laugh every time I put them on. [SEP] Super colorful sock, very nice and delightfully comfortable. Nicely made and warm feel. Amazing on the feet, the colors are vibrant as well and the socks stay up throughout the day. Very great socks I would totally recommend. [SEP] These socks are not exactly as advertised on the website.  These are funny meme crazy socks but I thought it was because of the colors.<br /><br />There are several differences in the socks I received and what they look like on amazon.<br />1.  The pink color is a very bold pink.  The picture looks like a dull pink.<br />2.  The picture shows a blue area below the top of the sock.  There is a blank blue area on one side of each sock.  BUT  on the other side of the sock, there is a saying and a car in my blue area.  The saying...""I just wanna hany with DOG"" .  A person and a dog are hanging out of the car windows.  And no, I did not misspell the word hang....HANY is spelled out in black on my socks.  Is this correct???<br /><br />These socks are imported from China.  This may be the reason for the misspelling or maybe I am missing some point here.<br />The socks are  80% Cotton, 17% Polyester, 3% Spandex.<br />Apparently these are one size fits most.  These will fit fine on my wife but I could wear these as they are to small.<br />The socks are soft and I think they would be comfortable.<br />There is no current price so I do not know if these are a good buy or not.  I would like to know it they intended the sock to say "" HANY"" or if it was a misspelling. [SEP] It took me a minute to notice the spelling error on these socks. When I did finally see it I thought maybe it was some new slang word that I just wasn't familiar with. It's not. Now I see why the company didn't put accurate photos online.<br />Obviously the socks are supposed to say ""I just wanna hang with my dog"" but someone messed up big time and printed ""hany"" instead of hang.<br />It would be kind of funny if it wasn't so obvious that the company is trying to deceive buyers. These are referred to as ""funny meme socks"" but if you flip through the photos on Amazon you'll notice that they conveniently leave out the graphics and words. Most likely because if they were to show the actual product no one would buy it.<br />Other than that huge issue, the socks are decent. I wear a women's size 9 shoe and these fit me fine. The colors are bright and vibrant and I like the color scheme.<br />Unfortunately, I can only rate these 2 stars because of the spelling error and the way this company purposely deceives people. [SEP] I was confused when purchasing these socks. They said ‚Äúmeme‚Äù socks, but the picture of the socks didn‚Äôt have any print. I thought the pattern/color of the socks looked nice. They are definitely nice-quality socks.<br /><br />They came and they have a typo... ‚Äúhany‚Äù instead of I just want to ‚Äúhang‚Äù with my dog. I wish I could‚Äôve known what these socks would‚Äôve have said or else I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten them for 2 reasons. The typo, and I don‚Äôt have a dog!

For the money these are good deal, as long as you know they are not 100% cotton and they are thin and not padded. [SEP] My daughter really likes these. Very on trend, and they seem to work in any kind of shoes, even sneakers. You can't see them at all when you wear them with most shoes. They don't slip around either. [SEP] I love these socks.  They are comfortable.  The fabric is soft and not too thick or too thin.  Unlike other low cut socks I have worn, these do not slide down into my shoes/sneakers.  I highly recommend them. [SEP] To be honest, these are a little big on me (shoe size five, women). The heel goes up a little more on me than the model. However, these socks still fit fine. They're not invisible under my shoes, but honestly, I don't care so much about not seeing a bit of my sock. They are comfortable and don't fall done, at least. They could use a little more padding, but are light, like they say. They're also a bit slippery, so be careful when walking on non-carpeted floors with them. [SEP] I like these socks a lot for daily wear.  They're comfortable, and they don't slide down in your shoes or twist around on your feet.  They're also lightweight and seem cooler than some of the other socks I have.  I knocked one star off because I don't think they're good for athletic activities as the description advertises.  They need more padding/thickness in strategic places in order to be good for sports or fitness activities.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy them for regular use, though. [SEP] These have the texture and thickness of a dress/trouser sock but are ankle length like a sport sock.  The seams are smooth and lay flat and the elastic at the top keeps them from sagging into my shoes without being overly tight.  They are not cushioned or bulky and would be ideal for a warm day and/or snug shoes.",3,True

Beautiful  Watch! [SEP] Granted, not the same watch, I've replaced it multiple times over the last 15 years. But with a watch this cheap I don't feel bad doing it. This look is CLASSIC, straight 80's classic and a timeless design still feels of this moment whenever that happens to be.<br /><br />I work as a carpenter so I chew through watches quickly since my hands and wrists are always getting battered around. That being said, they stand up to direct hammer blows and smashing into sheets of plywood or scratching along lengths of steel without any issue. I treat these watches terribly and they keep on telling time perfectly, the backlight never fails nor the alarm.<br /><br />What always fails before the watch does is the band, usually after 1-2 years of daily abuse and taking it on/off to shower the watch band with tear. That or the crystal will become so scratched from accidents that it's time to buy a new one. But who cares! These watches are so affordable I don't mind trading an old, tired one for a brand new one.<br /><br />I love these watches. They look great, they do their job and they're wicked tough. I'm sure I'll continue wearing these for another 15 years to come. [SEP] If you wanted a very basic digital unisex wristwatch then this watch is for you! It's so cheap taht you can get another one if this one dies on you. Th light at night is barely visible and it's numbers are small but visible under the sun while being very light that you hardly feel it on your wrist. This wrist watch is also what President Barack Obama was wearing while he was in the White House for 8 years. It's timeless design and the simplicity you just can't beat. A Highly recommended wrist watch. [SEP] It is smallish, but works well.  Good value for the price [SEP] This was very similar or the same watch as the one I wore in the early 1980's as a child. It still works great actually. [SEP] This watch is a classic, the battery seems to run on for ever and the cost is cheap enough that I don't have to worry about scratching or damaging the watch. One down side is the strap seems to break after a year or two and replacement straps are about the same price as the watch. [SEP] Unfortunately, I lost this watch pretty soon after I bought it... BUT, while it was in my possession, I really liked it. It looked nice on my tiny lady wrists and told time accurately. [SEP] Exactly what was ordered, good condition and great price. Inexpensive watch that can handle abuse. [SEP] I love this watch and have been wearing them for years. I am very active and the band will wear out/ or crack eventually. But for the money it is great.Love the features. [SEP] Band is too small",3,True

Length and fit wise, both were perfect.<br /><br />I don't know if it is because of the color I got but I feel like it gives me a little bit of a camel toe. I wonder if I had gotten the black one it would have been better. It just doesn't hug my body as tightly as I would have liked.

Also, they are made from good quality material that wash well. Nice product. [SEP] For an XL it's it's nice fit. It's not skin tight; it's comfortable as it should be. I'm 5'8 and wear size 14. I like the calf length as it's often too short on me - these really are mid length. It's a soft material and it has pockets! The print is fun. I'll wear this with a long black tee or loose tank top.

I was able to make these work for me, but I would like to see them add some additional sizes in the future.<br />I like the blue color and the addition of pockets with these.  They have a nice band at the top, but not as high waisted as I would like.  Otherwise, great leggings [SEP] Love these! I ordered the blue size S which is a soft blue in color. They are the most comfortable carpi pants and have worn. Washing instructions are to hand wash and line dry. Received many compliments!<br />Going to order a couple more.

The only issue is that the top is very short, like crop top length. I ordered a small and it all fit as expected except the length in the top. Otherwise a cute set of pajamas. [SEP] This pajama set is so cute! Love the mix of velour and lace. The velour is very soft and the lace is thick so it won‚Äôt rip easily. The straps are adjustable. The pajamas fit fairly snug on your body without being too tight. The only downfalls for me were that the shirt is not quite average length. It is more of a crop top so I wish it was a little longer. The top also shifts easily while sleeping so you might accidentally show more than your intended to. [SEP] Fits well and is super comfy! The lace is a little problematic and tangles in the straps but that's my only complaint. For the price it's awesome! 4ft 10, 120lbs and bought a small [SEP] Usually I'm a t-shirt and short shorts kind of gal, but I actually prefer sleeping in this! Soft and comfy plus it looks cute!

I've washed it twice (on delicate cycle, in a delicates bag) and it has held up well, no tearing, nothing fell off. The top and the shorts fit well, the shorts are comfortable and longer than most PJ shorts but still short enough to be cute. For reference, I ordered a size S, and I'm 5'7 and 100lbs, 26 inch waist and the Small fit perfectly [SEP] Trim is pretty sloppy, but you get what you pay for!

Orchid Row Women's Printed Maxi Chiffon Kimono Ruana Wraps,[],[],,3.8,19,34539,"I'm short (5 ft) so this kimono almost reaches my ankles, making a very dramatic look. It seems to be well made and it's one-size-fits-all without being tight on the arms. Sometimes one-size-fits-all things will make the arms too tight or it won't be flowy enough. There's not that problem here. The base is black with lots of brightly colored florals but this is still the type of thing you can wear on an everyday basis out to the shops or to work. It feels nice and cool like any summer shawl or arm cover up, but it's made of polyester so I don't have to worry about washing it separately or with my delicates. I've had lots of compliments on it already and look forward to packing it away in my suitcase this summer for a quick, easy dash of style. [SEP] Cut very generously - almost like a big rectangle. Didn't find it useful for 4'11"" frame but may look lovely on someone taller. [SEP] Very pretty kimono to wear over a bathing suit or even a black dress. Regrettably, it doesn‚Äôt include a self belt which would‚Äôve enhanced its versatility. I will find a long solid color polyester scarf to repurpose as a belt because I want to wear it over my black bathing suit. The print is a lovely floral. See my close up photo. [SEP] This Orchid Row ‚Äúchiffon‚Äù kimono has a nice floral print on fabric that‚Äôs 100% polyester.  I don‚Äôt care for the feel of the fabric as it‚Äôs so synthetic feeling and not breathable or airy. While chiffon can be made from polyester (or silk), I think of chiffon as sheer and floaty but this polyester feels thick and heavy.  It just hangs on me and lacks any movement. It doesn‚Äôt fit like in the photo or have the same sheer, flowy quality that‚Äôs pictured IMO.<br /><br />This is a one size fits all garment, and I am tall at 5‚Äô11‚Äù so this kimono may fit me different than others.  The sleeves barely cover my elbows, and the length just covers my knees. The top looks boxy on me and isn‚Äôt particularly flattering, though it doesn‚Äôt look bad. This has slits on the sides that go to the top of my thighs. They should give the fabric more movement but they don‚Äôt.<br /><br />I‚Äôve tried this kimono on many times over various outfits, such as a tank dress and over a tank with jeans or pants. But I‚Äôve still never worn it. That‚Äôs a bad sign for me as I wear things right away if I like how they look and/or feel (unless I get them off season). At most, I could see wearing this at home as I think this looks like pajamas or a robe on me, yet the polyester fabric lacks the softness or comfort I want for hanging out at home. This is just okay. 3 stars. [SEP] Nice soft material, good roomy fit. This always elicits compliments when worn. [SEP] I use this as a coverup for my bathing suit!  i love it because it's a thin material of chiffon where there's breeze on a hot summer day plus you can still see the bathing suit.  i love that flowyness through the breeze too!  goes great with a panama straw hat!<br /><br />on other days, you can wear this with your outfit to give it some character!  i am 5' tall and the length is a little long on me, but i don't mind.  i love it! [SEP] Very pretty floral print ""robe"". I hesitate to use the word kimono because except for the billowing sleeves, there's nothing kimono like about it. It's open. I do wish it came with some kind of belt for if you would like to tie it closed, but you can use some wide ribbon just as well. I like to wear this in the morning, when it's just a little chilly but not too bad. The sleeves will give you some grief when you're doing chores though so I'd regulate this to lounging. It's pretty, flowy, somewhat modest, but impractical. [SEP] This is a lovely kimono. The fabric is a silky polyester chiffon that drapes beautifully, floating over the body. It can be worn to dress up basic jeans, leggings, or a dress. It would also work as a nice bathing suit cover-up or a robe, although there is no belt, so if you want a more traditional closure you will have to supply it yourself. My daughter has been enjoying just wearing it around the house while she relaxes. She wears a 10 or 12 and is 5'5"", and the kimono hits mid-calf. [SEP] This kimono is longer than most I have.  It comes down to about 3-4 inches above my ankles.  My husband thought I was wearing a coat!  It's very sheer.  So, there's not way it gives the warmth of a coat.  It's a black background with assorted colorful flowers.  The sleeves are 3/4 length.  It's made to be worn open in the front.  There are no closures.  I wear it over jeans with a tank top.  I do not like to wear sleeveless tops because of the way my arms look.  This is a nice look without extra warmth.",3,True

This is a nice, big hat and will keep your face adequately covered. You may want to invest in a strap to keep the hat on your head in case it is breezy. [SEP] This is an ok sun hat, but the brim is smaller than similar hats, and the construction feels cheap -- since the hat is unlined, the stitching of the floral pattern on the brim shows through on the underside, and looks pretty chintzy. At this price, I think you can do better. This might be cute for little girl who doesn't care about exposed stitching and for whom the small brim feels more generous, but for me... it's not a win. [SEP] My mother loves this Orchid Row Women's Floppy Hat with Hibiscus Embroidery!  It has a nice wide brim and is rather stylish with its embroidery! She finds it comfortable to wear and when she sits out on the deck to enjoy the few days in New England that there hasn't been any rain, it works well to keep the sun out of her eyes. It is really a nice, well made hat that is suitable for many occasions. [SEP] I love dramatic, striking beach hats, and this one definitely doesn't disappoint. It looks very classy yet attention-grabbing. It holds the shape very well. The material is good-quality. I can't wait to wear it on my upcoming beach vacation. [SEP] This sun hat fits snuggly on my large head. It could be a tiny bit larger for me, but it should fit most people with medium to large heads just fine.<br /><br />This sun hat is well-made with high quality materials. There is enough weight to the hat so that it doesn't blow right off of your head with the lightest breeze. The brim is not very wide, but it is large enough to block enough sun without impairing your vision too much. The fringe trim and bright floral embroidery add a feminine touch.<br /><br />While it's true that the flower embroidery shows up under the brim, I think lining the hat to hide the underside of the stitching will just make the hat retain more heat and be heavier.

Since it is metal, I bent it back as much as I could but I don't know how well it will work because from my experience, the hinge area can only take so much bending before it breaks.

The frame is gold metal and just feel cheap when I wore them. A big no for me I am not going to the disco anytime soon. [SEP] These are the perfect sunglasses for me. I refuse to spend more than $20 on sunglasses anymore, but I still want stylish pairs, this is my answer! I love these, they are oversized, and made very nicely for the price! I love them! [SEP] I'm a big fan of these sunglasses. The shape and style is very hip and in right now, and I'm surprisingly a fan of the brown fade on the lenses. Others CAN see your eyes when you're wearing these, so definitely be mindful (to be honest, sometimes I like dark shades, so I can people watch and stare without being rude haha). But I've had no issues with the make or quality of these. Overall, very pleased! [SEP] Beautiful pair of fashion sunglasses. I like the oversized square frames. The lenses are a pretty brown shade that go well with a lot of my outfits. These flatter my square shaped face. These come with a nice soft case to store them in. [SEP] These are not the best sunglasses. They are oversized, but so much that they keep falling off my face. The nose pads don't help at all and constantly slide off my nose. The color is nice, but wouldn't wear these as actual sunglasses, more so for fashion than eye protection. The color is nice and the shape is ok, just wish they weren't as oversized as they are and actually protected your eyes from the sun, since they are not polarized. [SEP] These sunglasses from Skyway made a statement.  Granted, I am not quite sure what the statement might be, but they certainly said something about the wearer.<br /><br />My lady had hoped the glasses would have a 1970s vibe while giving a more updated, current look.  Unfortunately, they appeared to be a rather cheap knockoff from the 1970s: the glasses seemed more suitable for a costume party than everyday wear.<br /><br />The lightweight frames felt fragile, such they would never survive a drop or accidentally sitting on them.  The soft case did not help, as it offered no protection beyond the prevention of surface scratches.  I wouldn't try adjusting the nose pads or legs for a better fit, as they would probably snap off!<br /><br />Despite a reasonably low price, I don't think the quality and overall appearance justify even that price.  I would look elsewhere if seeking a pair of retro, oversized sunglasses. [SEP] Great looking glasses. Nice oversized frames. Be gentle though. The frames don‚Äôt feel real sturdy and I don‚Äôt think these will hold up to much abuse so treat them gently and you‚Äôll look good in them for a long time to come. They have a nice case to keep them from getting scratched up. My daughter refused to model these for my review so I wore them. Although I look great in them these are for women. [SEP] Not really a brown tone, more of a light pink undertone in color. Square is an unique shape to the sunglasses, but, fits well with my rounder face. These are UVA protected which is nice. These are of an average quality, but, are nice for a sunglass rotation to your wardrobe. Overall a very fun pair! [SEP] What a cute design and color! I am in love with the pink style of these glasses. Good uv protection, with a cute pastel aesthetic. These sunglasses have a very flattering shape for more rounded faces. They are extremely comfortable, and very wearable.<br /><br />These sunglasses go with almost any outfit, pastel or not. They are so versatile and overall adorable!

I‚Äôm not sure if the fault is with the buckle or the notches in the belt, neither look damaged, but it‚Äôs defective nevertheless.<br /><br />Update: I was contacted by customer service, and they sent out a new belt at no cost, which does work correctly. + 3 stars for great CS Reps<br /><br />Update 2: as grateful as I was to get a free replacement, the second belt they sent me started doing the same thing after 2-3 wears. I don‚Äôt know if the issues is with the buckle or the strap, but one or the other seems to be faulty on both belts I tried from them. [SEP] Marino has the perfect belt buckle for guys like me with a little bit of a belly hangover. I love everything about Marino and finally they were able to solve my problem with belt buckles cutting into me because I'm overweight. This design with rounded edges work's perfectly. Love the design and the belt leather. Easy to cut to make the perfect size belt. Superior design with a slide through belt buckle that securely ratchets the belt to the right tension.<br /><br />Their customer service believes in customer satisfaction. You will not be disappointed. [SEP] I own 2 other Marino Ratchet Click Belts and I love them. But this one has a different style of buckle with a latch on the bottom. It continually comes unlatched unexpectedly! This is incredibly disturbing especially when I am with clients in mixed company, like today. I can't recommend this model. It looks great but functionality is defective. I really wish I could order just the buckle of another style to replace the one that came on my belt. [SEP] A great product at a great price! [SEP] Great product. Really loved the ease of use. No issues so far after few months of use. [SEP] Super belts for all guys, not just those who are small motor challenged. [SEP] Nice belt [SEP] Great idea, but the execution leaves something to be desired.  The ratchet functions seems to work great, however the release catch is very stiff.  Not sure if it's just on the one I received or the same across all.  Also, there are no clear instruction for how to cut the belt to size.  We figured you should be able to use a utility knife or something that an average household would have available, however we were not able to achieve a clean or straight cut with a utility knife.  We ended up using a power saw to get a good straight cut.  Then, still had to use a utility knife to trim the frayed edge to look nice and flat, and so it would fit into the buckle well.  Because of this, the belt ended up being a little shorter than we would have liked. [SEP] Wonderful belt! Package was perfect for gift giving. Completely satisfied.",3,True

Milacolato 2Pairs S925 Sterling Silver Threader Earrings for Women Tassel Dangle Drop Chain Earrings Set Lightweight,[],[],,3.8,19,103451,"LOVE these.  The chain is very thin so you can pull that portion through your ear, and have it at whatever lengths you want for either pair.  Elegant.  Dress up or down with these [SEP] Several years ago I purchased a pair of very expensive gold threader earrings.  I have carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands and needed earrings that were easy to put on.  Unfortunately those threaders slipped out easily - especially when I was changing clothes.  Consequently one became lost - money down the tubes.  Once I managed to get my tiny gold hoops back in my earlobes I had not taken them out for the past five years.  Then I saw the product description of the Milacolato Threaders.  It claims you can sleep with them on - even take a shower and they would stay in.  I was willing to give them a shot.  And it turns out the product description was correct.  I have slept in these;  I have showered wearing these;  and I have changed clothes without knocking one or both of them out of my ear lobes.  They are delicate and light weight - I don't even know they are in my ears.  Even better, three neighbors who have seen them on me commented on what beautiful earrings they are.  I have owned these earrings for 24 hours.  I hope they last for 24 years! Love them. [SEP] I'm so happy I came across these beauties! They are not just beautiful, but really good quality as well. Not cheap or flimsy, they seem pretty durable and were packaged beautifully. I'm pictured with the shorter length ones but am looking forward to wearing the longer ones this week as well. They are comfortable to wear and although my lobes are sensitive to certain jewelry, I had no problems wearing these earrings. Their classy enough to be worn out on a night on the town yet subtle and versatile enough to wear to work in a corporate setting. I received a lot of compliments. Don't hesitate to buy! [SEP] I was very skeptical of pulling these all the way through my ears but it turns out they are great. They take a little getting used to but the style and look is totally worth it. I haven't seen earrings like this before and I like how cool they look. I especially like the second pair with the wavy part, they were a little easier to put in and out and look great. My ears are pretty sensitive and I didn't have any issue wearing them all day.  I would definitely recommend these. [SEP] I ordered this for my wife. She didn‚Äôt like these at all. They seem a bit ridiculous trying to slide these earrings into pierced ears. My wife tried to put them in her ears but her holes were too small. [SEP] These are cute and fashion forward. Comfortable and easy to wear. I think the price point is a little high, but they are functional and cute. [SEP] The pack comes with 2 gold plated tassel dangle drop earrings set. They are made of sterling silver and won‚Äôt rust. They are very light to wear. They are designed for casual every day use and would suit any attire. [SEP] These threader earrings are really cute, simple, and delicate. I did expect them to be a little bit bigger, the picture can be deceiving since there is nothing for scale, but I like how delicate their small size makes them. The chain is very thin as well so unlike other threaders it doesn't hurt your ear to put them in. Definitely recommend! [SEP] These earrings turned out to be more dainty and beautiful than I thought! The pictures don't do these justice. I ordered these in gold, although a rose gold jewelry fiend, to wear in an upcoming wedding. They are easy to put in the ears and are almost weightless. These will be the perfect added touch to my dress and accessories!",3,True

If you have big calves, do not get these socks. [SEP] Cute bold colors [SEP] Good support but at the end of the day each of the dots makes an impression in calf.

They fit great in the foot (I wear a Women's 8); however, the sock was so tight in the calf that I felt like my circulation was being cut off!! The polka dot indents were left on my legs for almost an hour after taking the socks off!  Additionally, they were SO hard to get on!! I don't recommend. [SEP] They are good compression socks. They worked well to keep the swelling down when I went back to work after an injury. They're even quite attractive. The reason they're not 5-stars for me is that the material they're made out of causes my feet to sweat more and holds the moisture and sweat in making for pretty stinky feet and shoes at the end of the day.

They fit, but are so trashy short, I would never leave the house wearing them. If I bend over, an inappropriate view results.... definitely not something you want while grocery shopping.<br /><br />The fabric, what little of it there is, is stretchy and easy to wear. The pockets are shallow and essentially useless for carrying a phone. These will end up being laundry day shorts and nothing else. [SEP] I received 2 pairs of these shorts - a size 12 and a size 14 so I am combining the two into one review.  I'm 5'9"", 142 lbs and have an average sized butt.  The 12's were a tad too tight so I gave them to my daughter.  The 14's fit nicely and I'm definitely keeping those.  I washed both pairs in the regular laundry cycle and both pairs came out of the dryer rolled up at the legs which I find a bit frustrating.  They are already short enough (just barely long enough to keep the cellulite hidden) and even when I tried unrolling them they still wanted to roll right back up.  I docked a star for this.  Otherwise, they seem to be well made jeans, are soft and not overly distressed. [SEP] I usually wear a size 12 or 14. I took a chance on the size 12 and they fit well. They are comfortable.<br /><br />These are a little short, but provide adequate coverage. I normally wouldn't buy ""distressed"" denim, but these are cute. The pockets make sure nothing important is exposed by the small tears. ;o)<br /><br />They came through the wash fine. Didn't shrink and the hem did not ravel more.<br /><br />Can't wait for warmer weather so I can wear them! [SEP] These are adorable shorts. I usually go for much longer shorts, but I thought I'd give it a try. I wish I could have gone up to a 16 since these are a little snug, but they're pretty true to size because they have some give to them.<br /><br />After washing, the little bit of leg material that's there rolled right up into the shorts, so it looks like they'll need to be folded and put away promptly to prevent them from permanently going on a roll, like while wearing them.<br /><br />Overall, these are a good deal, especially if you feel comfortable in short shorts. [SEP] I like these jean shorts overall. They aren't too short but they are a nice length. They are well made with quality material. They have some stretch to them for comfort, though I find them to be a little tight (not sure if that due to pandemic weight gain or that these run small.)  Overall, they are nice simple cut offs. I like them. [SEP] These are cute and fit as expected but the material is thin! It makes them comfortable but the bottoms also roll, especially after washing.<br />They are a good buy, but I hate ironing so I probably won't wear them much. [SEP] admittedly - these are a bit short for my taste - but i tend to wear shorts at the house that are too short because i keep my house kind of warm in the summer, so they will be good to have around.  and who knows, by this summer maybe i'll have gotten my act together and clean up my thighs and i'll be willing to wear these in public.  they are really cute shorts - i was stoked to find a pair of denim in this color that were cut-off rather than hemmed.  when you first put them on after washing them - they will feel snug, similar to jeans but in just a bit they will stretch to a perfect it, so you can order your normal size and know they will fit within just a bit after putting them on.  when i first took a look i thought for sure they would be too small, but i put them on and walked around for a bit and was quite comfortable.  they have just a decent amount of stretch - just enough to make them fit but not so much that they get completely streched out and unwearable.  they are a solid jean material.  aside from the length - they are a really great pair of shorts - if you like them short, you will not be disappointed. [SEP] These ""cut offs"" have a nice bit of stretch in the fabric, are sized right so fit well and are flattering for my figure. The shorts are distressed and the frays on the legs appear to be stitch stopped so they won't fall apart. They come packaged in a plastic bag. So good fit, good quality, good rating....5 stars.

However, if the screen is tilted a little, then this aligns the filters and the dark screen and/or prism effect should dissipate.<br /><br />--of the color choices available it appears that black, red, and purple all have a dark lens, while the brown pair has an amber looking lens.

These definitely look nice.  My problem is that I live in Southern California.  We‚Äôre already having 90+ degree days in April.  So I wear them on a late afternoon/ evening walks.  Every time we were out of the shade, the sun was blinding me.  I feel like this are just not dark enough or don‚Äôt block enough for where I live.

[SEP] They are weird when you are looking at your phone though, has a weird effect that hurts my eyes. They are fine to look at everything else and feel okay on the eyes on sunny days. We've had lots of sun and these sun glasses do shade nicely without making things depressing or overly dark like some grey lenses. I like the amber, bright driver style color, and appreciate the polarized effect for seeing into the water and being able to see through the glare and see the fish below the shiny surface. That's really fun. But, looking at the phone is crazy.  Good value for standard, dime store glasses. They come with a really nice case and they fit well.

The currently advertised price of $25.99 for two pair seems about right to me. [SEP] These are well made, thick and soft. The waist and leg elasticity is strong but not tight. They are just baggy enough to be comfortable. They wash and dry well without shrinking or fading. The length goes from stomach to about an inch below the knee on a child that is 4' 8"". [SEP] I received the black and red pants the black is a true black and very nice but the red pants definitely seem like a color between orange and red MOST DEFINATELY NOT A TRUE RED which is very annoying so when my son had to wear it I couldnt not pair it with anything red like his sneakers or a red t shirt cause it didn't match it made the pants seem even more orange so be aware of that , but quality wise very good quality pants my son is 5 and tall for his ae and the length was good hit just below his ankle not tight very loose crop which I prefer. so im still satisfied with the pants despite the poor color of the red one.. still a good purchase [SEP] Got these in size large and they fit TTS for my daughter who wears 10/12 (closer to 10). The pants have good stretch in the waist, which is good for active kids. They are slightly tighter than a typical joggers, but not yoga tight. There are side seam pockets, no fly (real or fake), and no back pockets. The capri length is unique and looks good with stylish sneakers and slides. Fabric is lightweight (but have not tested the moisture wicking) good for fall/spring--there is no blushed fleece on the inside like other joggers. My child liked them a lot, and they matched well with a lot of our current wardrobe. May be more liked by an active girl than the usual tight leggings. Washed and dried great with no special care, color did not fade. Recommend! [SEP] My daughter is on a big anti-dress, pro-comfy pants kick and she digs these pants. They‚Äôre a nice thick material, soft and sturdy, with nice side pockets (a step up from sweats and leggings) and a relaxed athletic fit, great for active kids.<br /><br />To me, the poly content is too high‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt wear them, because it‚Äôs a little too close to the old doubleknits of my childhood. But there‚Äôs enough cotton for a good appearance and feel, and poly is durable. Plus, I‚Äôm not the one wearing them; and she‚Äôs pleased with them.<br /><br />Not crazy long for my shortish kid, but they bunch enough to know they‚Äôll be long enough unless your kiddo is a real string bean. Roomy enough if your kid is on the sturdy side, with a really nice, wide waistband. [SEP] Unacoo size L kids capri sweats. Good fit and comfortable thicker crop pants. These have pockets which is great. They do have a tighter waist band and no drawstring bhb it other than that they fit good. The material is different like sweatpants material mixed with a synthetic knit maybe not quit sure how to accurately describe it. These do remind me of toddler sweatpants as another reviewer has mentioned. Good quality nice fit  and a heavier material kids like them. [SEP] These pants run a little small.<br />I got size 10 for my 7 year old who wears size 10 in everything, and they were too short.<br />The material feels almost like a nylon to me.<br />I ended up donating these.",3,True
"esstive Women's Soft Velour Midweight Casual Zip-Up Hoodie & Pant Full Set, Black, Large",[],[],,4.4,19,838,"This brand makes great athleisure wear. This set is super soft and ultra comfy. The fabric feels high quality. I have found that this brand runs small. The large fits more like a medium. Overall, I highly recommend this set.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] This velour zip-up hoodie and pant set is great. The zip-up hoodie has 2 pockets so you can either use it for your hands or use it to keep your phone or other things in it. The jogger pants also have two pockets which basically can serve the same purpose if you want. They have a draw string so you can tighten them to fit perfectly and that they don't slip down.<br /><br />This is perfect to lounge around at home or for quick casual errands to run around town, personally to me that is acceptable like getting groceries. These are true to size and fit really well. This outfit is nice and comfortable and I really like to lounge around in it, nice in the winter especially so you can keep the heating bill down. [SEP] She liked it.  I washed it.  It came out smaller than it went in.  Unless you want it form-fitting I might suggest ordering a size larger than you normally get.  I actually think it looks very nice on her.  Maybe even better than it did before when it was a bit baggy.<br /><br />We do both like it.  It is very comfy she tells me.  Give it a try for yourself, you might just like it also. [SEP] This seems to run a tad on the small side but aside from that it's nice enough. It's a very soft crushed velour zip up hoodie and pant suit. The hoodie has a zip up front and the hood has pull strings. There are two pockets in the front that are a decent size. I found that the sleeves were a little short on me so I'd consider a size up for that. The pants have a drawstring and two pockets, one on each side. The pants, like the jacket, seem to be a little too short so I would consider a size up in those as well (so for the whole set).<br />These are ultra soft when you feel them on the outside. They aren't as soft on the inside, but still feel very comfortable. The set is machine washable and it holds up perfectly after numerous washes. It looks goods as new and I'm up to three or four washes.<br />This is a very nice set, but depending on your size, I'd consider sizing up due to length issues. I'm 5'8"" and 160 lbs and a large was too short in the arms and legs, for reference. [SEP] I normally wear a medium. I got this in a large as I didn‚Äôt want it to be too tight.<br />I think I could have been good with a medium.<br />The pants are baggy on me - I would say correctly sized.<br />The top feels a little like a medium around the stomach but is correctly sized in the shoulder/arms area.<br />This outfit is very comfortable. My only complaint is that it‚Äôs softer in the outside then it is on the inside.<br />The inside isn‚Äôt scratchy or anything- it‚Äôs comfortable just not cozy.<br />This outfit is great for lounging around or a quick run out to do errands.<br />I wouldn‚Äôt actually without in this outfit.<br /><br />**If you found this review helpful, please click the ‚ÄòHelpful‚Äô button below. [SEP] These are well made.  I love the zipper hoodie, fits perfectly.  the pants fit very large, yet comfortable, but I am typically much smaller on the bottom than the top.  It not made to be snug.  So all in all I really like it.  I wouldn‚Äôt say ultra soft either, I have some very soft fleece wear, this isn‚Äôt all that soft.  Not too thin and not too thick, so just right in medium/fair weather [SEP] This is a comfy velour set but it is more form fitting rather than loose fitting.  I got it in my usual size large and while it fits, it is snug.  I have other clothing items by this brand, all in size large, and this velour set has the tightest fit out of all of them. It looks nice on me and is flattering but if you prefer something not quite as form fitting, I would go a size up. I have an average to maybe even below average size rear end for a woman and if mine was bigger or my upper thighs were bigger, I would definitely need a larger size.<br /><br />I'm 5'6"" with a long torso, and short legs. The only thing I don't really care for is the cuffs on the pants.  It just looks weird because the velour kinda poofs out a bit before the cuff starts.  But that's being pretty nit picky as this is just something I am going to wear to lounge around the house.  The bottom part of the pants might be an issue for shorter women.<br /><br />Overall a good set if you want something comfy to wear. I washed according to instructions (inside out, on cold, and tumble dry low) and it came out just fine. The set also comes with Proposition 65 warning labels. [SEP] I usually wear a large but this fits so big.<br />Think because of my height the pants are long and big. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù<br />The top fits great.<br />The material is so soft and comfortable<br />I love it just would need a smaller size in pants, [SEP] Great for lounging or even working out.

Deep rich color and easily removable jacket. Need some more of these!",3,True
GLADDON MODA Women's Crossbody Bag Gray,[],[],,4.0,9,3342,"This item is made well and the design looks nice. The design is just as pictured, colors as well. There are two longer/ larger pockets with the exact same compartments. They have They have 4 card slots on one side then a divider and a id holder on that side. There is a smaller pocket in front, about 3/4 the size of the other pockets, which opens wide enough for small items, like chapstick, receipts, etc. It has gold zippers, most run smoothly, one of mine kept getting caught, but came through eventually. It comes with a 4 foot shoulder strap (that can be adjusted) and a 1 foot wrist strap. [SEP] Got this for my teenager just starts her 1st college year. Besides the big backpack used between dorm and classrooms, she has a much smaller backpack to carry small items for non-school related outgoings. But, from time to time, she needs a purse or handbag to match her dressing style for events. This GLADDON MODA crossbody bag fits that need well. The design look nice, which is important to match formal dressings. This big is small (which is good for teenager, they don't want to carry a big bag...like the one from mommy), yet it has quite some pockets to accommodate plenty items...like the 6.2 inches cell phone she has. The bag comes with two straps. With the short strap, this is a hand bag. With the long strap, this becomes a crossbody bag.<br /><br />The only thing I have reservation about this bag is the thin strap. A little thicker would be more secure. [SEP] Pretty and stylish purse. Got it for 15 y/o‚Äôs bday and she thinks it looks cool. Fits her phone and essentials handily with space for odds and ends [SEP] Nice and convenient crossbody bag to carry cards, money and your phone. I like that it has 3 compartments to carry all your essential small needs and the sizing of it. The quality and color of this print bag is very good rough straps are very thin and not thicker as I would prefer them.

If you found my review helpful, please click the ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù button. Thank you! [SEP] Cute purse, I absolutely love it.<br />I don‚Äôt use the shorter strap because I wear this as a crossbody bag. The longer strap is easy to adjust to your own specific length.<br />The zippers are somewhat smooth, but I did notice that if I loaded up a compartment then the zippers stuck a bit causing me to press the purse together to make it thinner in order for it to zip.<br />I put my IPhone 8+ (with a Lifeproof case) in the back compartment. If I really shove my phone down then I can zip it up, but most of the time it‚Äôs too bulky to zip all of the way so I only close it halfway. It‚Äôs still secure since the sides come up on the inside so nothing drops out.<br />Plenty of space for cards.<br />Material is soft and squishy.<br />Overall, I love this and I carry it a lot. [SEP] I'm not wild about the fake skin appearance but it doesn't look terribly cheap and the functionality is terrific. Thin strap, lots of well sized pockets able to handle a phone, cash and other basic necessities without taking up a lot of extra space. Easy open zippers and neutral enough to go with most outfits.",3,True

I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] The dress was cute, but on me not too flattering. It was just okay. There was nothing wrong with it... it seemed well made and was good quality, just the style didn't work on me. Still, I think it would be nice based on someone's body size, so I would consider it. The fit was fine. [SEP] This is a very cute dress. The material is on the thinner side and a little see through. It does have a liner in the legs area though. It is made out of 100% polyester, some may not like it. It is a loose fit which I personally prefer. It is perfect for summer since it is so nice and airy. It is drawn around the waist which gives the dress a nice little definition. It is also not revealing which is great.<br /><br />The dress has a leopard print that looks great. It is very well made and should hold up nicely for some time to come. This is a nice addition to my wardrobe. It runs true to size.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and it‚Äôs down to my calves, very unflattering. I added a belt which helps a lot, but the neckline could be more shaped and open; looks a bit matronly for me. It is double lined but they‚Äôre both sheer, and because of the large blousey tent then I‚Äôd definitely wear a slip or bike shorts. The fabric is thin and synthetic, which is fine but it‚Äôs just not flattering on a small figure. [SEP] Runs small, but is really cute. The tie across the neckline is cute and the cinched waist help give definition to your body while the fabric is flowy and fun. Nice animal print is in style (when isn't it?). I don't know if I would dry clean, but a lingerie bag and gentle cycle will probably allow it to stay shapely. [SEP] I love the fit of this flowy leopard print dress.  Right now, I am wearing it with boots and leggings but it would be just as cute with sandals in the summer.  I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 127lbs and the small fit beautifully.

My 18 year old daughter loves the way these look! [SEP] This is the first pair of sunglasses by SKYWAY I have reviewed that leaves me disappointed. There really isn't anything good to say. Yes, they are lightweight but that's because they are flimsy. The way the sunglasses are made you really get no shade from the sun. The lens/frames have a straight feel. You can see it in my photos. There is no bend in the frames so you get full on sun. Also the nose pads go right up to the tear ducts. They say you can adjust them but they feel way to fragile. In other words, if I saw these in a store, I would definitely not buy them. I am crazy about SKYWAY sunglasses but in this case I'd be crazy to recommend anyone to buy them. [SEP] After I went to see ""Rocketman"" in the theaters, I was on the lookout for some funky sunglasses to wear this summer. These are exactly what I wanted: aviator-style, bright colored, and large for my small face. I've always been partial to 'rose colored glasses' but for those who aren't used to seeing a pink world, the bottom half gives you a golden color when you look down.<br />My only warning on these is the very thin gold frame. The case these come in is very pretty, but I won't be using it. I have a feeling opening and closing them will be hard on the little hinges. These are too pretty, and I wouldn't want them to break. I've always been in the habit of storing my sunglasses open, so I can grab and go, so this won't be a hardship for me. [SEP] Cool almost aviator looking sunglasses. They come in a nice protective case, the lenses are large enough that it blocks out all the sun from my eyes, and the black/gray color matches everything. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was because the earpieces are a bit thin, and seem very breakable if not careful. Other than that I love them! [SEP] Thin, inexpensive and not particularly attractive in my opinion.<br />Come with a white plastic case.  Nothing special.  Just keeps them from getting scratched up.<br />In my opinion these glasses are just too big for most faces too.<br />Don't expect much for what you are paying anyway.<br />These are more cute than they are functional. [SEP] These glasses are definitely more for style than use. They aren't even close to being dark enough to provide any actual sun protection. The arms are flimsy and I do worry that the glasses will fall apart. On the plus side, they are light and comfortable on my face. The shape is great and the pink fade to yellow is super cute. If you are looking for a pair of glasses as an accessory for your photo shoot to complete your look, these are perfect! Just don't wear them in the sun and think they will help you out. [SEP] These are cute but very delicate - some might say flimsy. As expected, the SKYWAY sunglasses make everything look pink and/or yellow, which can be fun - but in yesterday‚Äôs late afternoon sun, even under an umbrella, they didn't provide  any notable amount of shading my eyes from the sun. They‚Äôre not round, as described, but are a rounded rectangle. They do sit evenly on the bridge of my nose and are comfortable, partly due to the near weightlessness - that is how delicate they are. These come with a nice spring-closure protective case, but the case is soft, and it will only protect these from scratches, not breakage. The sunglasses come with no instruction sheet, so there is no way to know what the company claims their benefits are. To me, these are only cosmetic in nature, and are not useful as eye protecting glasses. They‚Äôre going in my Halloween costume bin. [SEP] These sunglasses are great. They are crystal clear right from the pouch. The frames feel a little thin, but for the model they are perfect, nice and light on your face. So far they have not been scratched by sand or my cars dash, so that's a major plus. Worth the money! [SEP] I‚Äôd like to begin this review by stating that I‚Äôve worked in the optical field for 12 years, I loved receiving this item, because I can definitely attest to the quality of this product!<br />The frame is gold shiny metal, with pink to yellow gradient lenses.<br />The temples are metal all the way, make sure you don‚Äôt have an allergy to metal prior to purchasing.<br />The glasses are gorgeous and even though they measure small in size, they fit pretty good on a big head.<br />The nosepads are soft and adjustable.<br />The frame is not of optical quality, you will not be able to add prescription to this frame, it is to be used as is, non prescription. The lenses are a very fashionable ‚Äúin‚Äù color, however, they do nothing to actually block the sun, they‚Äôre for looking cute only! Although I‚Äôm sure they have UV protection.<br />They are very light weight.<br />They also come with a soft protective pouch to carry them around!<br />Overall a cool looking pair of shades. [SEP] These came with a nice white material case. They are light weight and comfortable. The lenses are lightly tinted, and don‚Äôt provide too much protection in blinding sunlight. However, the roses hue is fantastic for driving around dusk or dawn. Something about the color makes everything pop more. They are super cute and look and fit great.",3,True

Easily folds up for taking backpacking or even just sightseeing (in case of a random shower). Where this falls short is in the sizing. This runs very small.

The material on the jacket (I have the black and the white jacket in this style) is really thin but it feels good and is comfortable.  The sleeves on the white jacket are slightly transparent but the body is not due to doubling of material.  The side pocket zip up so things won't accidentally fall out.

[SEP] Ordered an extra large and couldn't get my other arm into it.  Extremely lightweight and porous, meaning it gets you wet if it gets wet. I suspect it could be useful for some kind of brisk autumn walk but be aware of the sizing issue.  It's made of 100 % polyester and has super deep pockets.  It's too light to be a windbreaker but might make it as a running jacket because it's so light. Can't really address it because I couldn't use it.  I do give it some props for being able to be stuffed into the size of a baseball. so if you get one that fits it could be a great emergency jacket in the glove compartment.

[SEP] I really like these loafer liner socks.  They fit and feel really comfortable.  They're light and breathable, and it also has a light plastic lining on the inner heel to keep the heel from sliding down.  Very happy with these socks. [SEP] At first I was skeptical about these no-show socks because I got them the same day I got some thicker Adidas socks. But after trying them out, I really like them!! They are a little thinner than some, but they are made of cotton and are soft and comfortable. I like that the top is a little deeper than other no-show socks I have had, but they are still no-show! The heel stays in place, but it bunches up a little for me, maybe because I am only a size 7. [SEP] I hate socks! They are normally my least favorite piece of clothing.  But I also commute and wear sneakers to do it.  In the summer, regular socks become almost unbearable.  Step in these foot liners to save the day!  I wear a size 8 1/2 shoe and these fit perfectly, with some extra stretch if needed. They come down too far over toes to wear with heels without showing, but they are perfect if you want a super thin sock.  They are comfortable, protect my shoes from odor, and are easy to wash.  They‚Äôre a good deal for 8 sets in several colors (white, grey, neutral, black.) There is just enough gel at the back of the foot and around the edges so that they stay put on your foot. [SEP] Turning them inside out, here my assessment, the stitches are nicely tensioned, meaning tight adjusted.  The borders are well designed, but the border at the heel has about 14 elastic  stitches, and just half would be enough, since they're well programmed/positioned.  The clear rubbery application at the heels is also well designed and manufactured.  The seam above the toes is noticeable but it shouldn't be an issue, unless your shoes, like the loafers, or snickers have a seam just above it to cause extra pressure and potentially some marks on your skin.  The elastic in the middle of the socks has loose ends and this will only cause problems if you cut them, especially the one closer to the toes, so don't do it.  The best feature, those socks don't add much volume inside the shoes and stay in place as expected.  The package came with an extra pair. I got 9 pairs instead of 8 as the link informs, 3 black, 2 grey, 2 beige, 2 white.  I really liked them, regardless of the imperfections. [SEP] Buena.calidad [SEP] Like them [SEP] These minimalist sock liners stretch to fully enclose the lowest parts of the foot from toes to heel. I wear a shoe size 7 and these feel okay, with good length overall and room in the heel, but maybe slightly small in the toe, like my toes are being pushed together. The fabric is a bit stiffer and thicker (and more absorbent) than similar socks I have. A gel strip at the upper inside-back keeps them on my heels all day with zero slippage. I machine-washed and air-dried them and they came through nicely. They‚Äôre a good liner to pair with my Skechers Harmonious shoes. [SEP] We ordered this 6 pair set of Panvbo Socks for my Mother-in-Law who is Diabetic.<br />These are working out great for her so far. She says they are very light and comfortable, not to tight which can be uncomfortable for People with Diabetes or Neuropathy, but just Snug enough to not move around in her Shoes and the triple wide silicone heel grips are keeping them from slipping down.<br />They also wick away perspiration keeping her feet Dry and the Mesh Cotton design is also breathable so her Feet don‚Äôt overheat and Sweat to much anyways.",3,True

[SEP] I sent this to a 20 year old who absolutely loves it.  I believe it was going to be worn  to a college function and probably out clubbing. She said it is very nice quality and fits great. [SEP] This dress is beautiful. It is extremely long. I am 5'9 and its long on me (can't see my feet). I orginally ordered a XL because reviews said the dress was thin and I didn't want it to stretch too much to appear see through. The XL is slightly too big (but still wearable). My dress showed cleavage and I wanted it to fit more like the model so I ordered a L to see if it is a better fit. The L arrives today, I will update my post when I receive it. This dress conceals back fat even thou it is backless... great fit. I weigh 225 lbs, big thighs, 40DD breast, curvy, smaller in the waist. I will post pics when I wear the dress.<br /><br />I returned the XL, the L fit better. I snitched thr cleavage opening as I was attending a work event. Recieved compliments all night [SEP] This dress could never be worn in public. It‚Äôs very see through. I‚Äôd definitely wear it to a pool party though! [SEP] The dress was and is gorgeous! If you're short it will be long but 4-5inch heels will help. If you are well endowed up top, please know that your dress will not, I repeat WILL NOT fit like the model pictures shown. If you're uber confident with your twins playing peek-a-boo, by the damn dress you won't regret it! They will be on display but in the sexiest way possible. Oh and boob tape is your friend if you do it right. The way is dress is cut in the back you won't be able to wear your usual bra. You can still pull off spanx if you're into that kind of thing. Great purchase! [SEP] I ordered the Carmel colored off the shoulder dress for a New Year‚Äôs Eve event. I am a 6 ft tall woman, size 16 up top and 18 on the bottom usually.  Amazon recommended the size XL for me which also seemed to be my size according to the size chart.  The dress was was a good 4 sizes too small.  I‚Äôd say the XL is a small American size 12.  And that would be a short size 12 - this dress is not for tall girls.  Perhaps I could have gotten away with the top half fit because of the stretch, but the bottom of the dress was closing at all. I was also disappointed with the quality of the fabric - it‚Äôs pretty thin and I imagine that one snag might ruin the fabric. Maybe you could get away with the thin fabric with a good undergarment underneath it, of if you want the dress to look sheer and flimsy.  I know the price is low, but I‚Äôm still very disappointed.  I‚Äôm returning the dress. [SEP] Brown off-shoulder wrap dress, XL, 5‚Äô2.5, 200, 38DDD: The best part was delivery, dress arrived on time via Prime. Out of the bag it was crumpled and smelled a little smoky as if someone else had returned it. The color was not as dark as the brown one pictured, it was not shimmery, the fabric was thin and cheap, and there was only lining in the sleeves. It‚Äôs a no for me.

It's a good thickness and much nicer than a lot of basic t-shirts out there. [SEP] Apparently, sizing is inconsistent.  One reviewer mention the torso was too long.  Ours was WAY too short, like Winnie the Pooh too short.  Shoulders and chest size would have been fine but this is almost like a men's crop top.  Very odd.  My husband is 6'2"" and 280 lbs.  HE normally wears a 2XL in Carhartts, which he loves. This shirt just failed.  Machine washing it just made it worse.  My first Amazon clothing piece that actually disappointed me. [SEP] It feels like a very nice material. However there is an extra seem in the back that I've never had on a t-shirt, it's not really a problem, just odd. [SEP] The material is decent but the sleeves are very long and the torso is very short. Say goodbye to lifting your arms at all. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again.

"Awesome 360 Men's Classic Tie Necktie 2 Pcs Set, AT190529012",[],[],,4.1,9,11906,"This is a cute little tie set.  The black tie is decorated with breast cancer awareness ribbons and the pink striped tie has silver threading running through it.  The packaging is nicer than I would expect from tie of this caliber.  The quality is definitely low end but if you aren't planning on wearing the much, it shouldn't be a major issue for you.  The big problem is their length.  They are super short!  My husband's torso could be said to be regular to long, and the ties only came to the bottom of his chest area.  They looked like silly clown ties. [SEP] On first impression the ties come nicely packaged and would make a nice gift presentation.  I understand there are a variety of designs that ship but mine were exactly as pictured in the Amazon listing:  one black tie with a logo that another reviewer called a breast cancer awareness logo (I don't think it is but it is similar in look) and one brightly striped pink tie that stands out not just because of its vivid color.  Within each pink stripe is a glittery silver thread that sparkles as you move the tie.  The silver thread is not visible in the Amazon image.<br /><br />The positives:  the ties seem well-constructed.  They are a little narrower than I'm used to but not so much that I wouldn't wear them.  Being 100% polyester they feel a bit coarser than silk ties but they can be machine washed, too, which may be a benefit to some people.  There is a second cloth tab on the back that sports the manufacturer's name and serves as a second loop for tucking the tail of the tie.  The tie length will be fine for most people who don't require an extra long tie.  The negatives:  if you like the feel of silk ties then you won't be happy with this fabric.  And, for me, though I don't  wear the most conservative ties, the silvery glitter makes the pink tie unsuitable for my work environment.  For someone who likes a little more flair and/or for a special occasion, though, it will be an attention-grabber.<br /><br />All-in-all it's a nice starter set and a nice gift set as well if the colors fit to the wearer's use.  Right now the ties aren't available on Amazon so I can't see the current pricing but if they're in your price range and you are okay with the colors and the material, I think these are a good option. [SEP] These Awesome 360 Men's Classic Tie Neckties look very nice. They are well packaged too. Of course, they are 100 percent polyester so these are not top-of-the-line ties. But they do look as if they are. The colors are vibrant and they look great when I'm wearing them. Good looking ties. [SEP] These are definitely mid-priced ties but honestly they look amazing. My husband has been wanting to dress more ""professional"" lately so we got a few of these ties and he honestly loves them. He loves the feel and the width and length is perfect for him. As a gift it's great. It comes in a very nice box and is packaged and put into the box very nicely which is always great when you're buying something as a gift for someone. [SEP] Not something you would necessarily want to gift to someone in the box it ships in, but the ties are decent quality. They are quite soft and look nice.<br /><br />A good package for the price in my opinion. [SEP] Really like these ties. I received exactly what was pictured. a pink and white striped tie, and a darker black tie with ribbons.<br /><br />I really love the striped tie the most. the look of it is great, and paired with the right shirt this thing pops really nicely. I definitely do not feel like I am wearing a candy cane with this on. I love tying a double windsor with these and it stands out with a nice big knot.<br /><br />The other tie in this group with the pink and darker pink intertwined ribbons, kind of reminds me of the pink ribbons for breast cancer. I really like this aspect of the design, as it is all over the tie in a repeating pattern. It hits close to home with the nod to breast cancer awareness since my sister in law is a survivor.<br /><br />A tie is usually just a tie, and I have tons of ties, but out of all the ties I have, I probably only wear a handful. These two will be in my regular rotation.",3,True
Artgully Statement Necklaces For Women Silver Choker Necklace For Women Necklace Set Indian Necklace Sets For Women Oxidized Indian Jewelry For Women Statement Necklace Chunky Necklace Boho Necklace,[],[],,3.3,57,9357,"You can wear this as more of a choker length or hanging lower about 3-4"" on me.  This is weighty, in a good way!  Solid links join the chain to the actual pieces of the metal designs.  They are nicely spaced and really does look cool on..very noticeable.  looks like oxidized silver.  Has a slim hook for closure and enough extra chain to allow for the different lengths to wear.  Made by Indian artisans and comes in a drawstring bag that is stamped Art Gully..Glocal Crafts [SEP] This is an odd, but cool necklace.  The silver charms jingle like small bells whenever you move quickly, so know that ahead of time.  The cord is what's so odd.  It's a cord like one might use for upholstery, with a knot in the back that allows for tightening and loosening the necklace so it can be slipped over your head.  It leaves a fair amount of clunky cording hanging down your upper back, but it also allows the wearer to choose how high they want to where the necklace on their chest. [SEP] I love the whole look of this necklace, and the little ""bells"" are a nice touch. I was a little confused by the cord part. I tried for way too long untie it, but it turns out that it is just a loop so you can adjust the length.<br /><br />The only negative, and it's not really noticeable while you are wearing it, but the ends of the metal section were cut off. So a few of the links have kind of rough edges on the end. [SEP] I‚Äôve had mixed experiences with this ArtGully brand from India, but I really like this necklace of shiny silver metal. It is very attractive and eye-catching and seems sturdy, as well. Recommended. [SEP] Beautiful necklace. It's a very densely woven metal neckpiece, which despite being so tight you can't see between the links, is very flexible. There are lots of little silver... flowers? .. on the links. The bottom edge is just about solid with little bells that tinkle quietly. It looks like it's had black painted over it and then rubbed off so it's just in the low spots. It's held up with a tight, hard cord of black cotton (?) that is adjustable. It would make a great necklace for belly dance. The only problem is that after a few hours my neck started to get sore. I live with old injuries, though, so I suspect that's a personal problem... but it is pretty heavy. [SEP] This is very pretty and looks even better on my skin.  It's not flashy and goes with everything.  It's high quality. I really like it.  Thank you. [SEP] The choker has the potential to be really cute however the product came broken. I also wish the choker had a little more weight on it. [SEP] This necklace is an adjustable length that would fit just about anyone. I have a pretty thick neck and there is still plenty of slack. The clasp is an S style that doesn‚Äôt close entirely and it is on the left. It can be hard to put on without looking in the mirror. It has the quality of most costume jewelry but it is heavy, so you‚Äôll know if it falls off. It‚Äôs got kind of a punk style to it. Comes in a very nice hard case. [SEP] I am impressed with the manner of packaging and presentation of this jewelry. Shipped inside a taped up zip lock bag, an oversized drawstring fabric bag contains a nice thick, soft plastic box. The choker necklace is inside a plastic bag, and well protected inside the plastic box. You get the sense that the company cares about the safety and presentation quality associated with their product. I like that.<br />The choker is nicely designed and very eye catching. The one element that I would change involves the manner to attaching the chain ends of the choker. There is a simple hook that you affix to the counter chain links. While it works and is effective, I would have preferred something akin to a spring loop that would secure the connection. This is the only 'flaw' that I could detect, and dinged it one star for that reason.<br />Otherwise, the necklace is stylish and attractive, with a functional, sensible packaging that protects and showcases the choker.<br />Attached is a series of photos showing the unboxing, and different aspects of the choker. Ruler provided for size reference.<br />I think this is a worthwhile piece of jewelry, that would draw attention to the wearer's neckline.<br />I can easily give this a high recommendation. [SEP] This statement choker has a unique, almost industrial look.  It will not go with every outfit but with the right dress or top it's a knockout.  It is lined with tiny bells but, for me, couldn't be heard.  I think that they are best suited for active, disco activity.  Nothing against the design, I just don't move that much.<br /><br />Overall, I find this an unusual and quirky piece of jewelry that's affordable for the career gal.",3,True

On one side putting in the screws was a little tricky.  Great replacement product. [SEP] Comes with all you need [SEP] Good replacement for the original [SEP] Regardless of whether or not they included a small screwdriver, or the stiffness of the material, or the size of the buckle - this product does not fit the X40. [SEP] The band works and was easy to install. However the adjustment strap is just a touch too wide for the buckle making it a bit of a struggle to put it on. Also the small band on the buckle side that holds the excess adjustment band is a bit too loose and can slide off under the stress of a golf swing. It will be interesting to see how this holds up over time.

I contacted Garmin's customer care and they stated that the GPS chip is IN THE BAND on the X10, so I cannot replace the band unless I get a band with the chip embedded in the strap, which these bands do not have.

[SEP] These shades are very nice! First of all they come beautifully packaged. I am all about packaging that is wrapable (comes in a sturdy, square box) and it's perfect. They also come with a little pouch/case that is of good quality. The glasses themselves are very nice and fit awesome! [SEP] Same price you would pay for sunglasses in the drug store, but better quality.  Lenses and frame are sturdy.  Great peripheral vision coverage.  Unless you have a very petite face these should not appear too big.  The sunglasses come with a carrying case and a cleaning cloth.  I accidentally dropped the sunglasses face down on the concrete and was surprised to find that there were no scratches.  Overall a very good value for the price. [SEP] They're a bit pricy.  My daughter likes them because they fit her round head and are dark.  Polarized to cut glare, and a simple style. [SEP] They‚Äôre ok, they come with a nice case. But it‚Äôs youre looking for quality spring for the Oakley‚Äôs or costas. Compared to my husbands costas  you can feel the difference. But on a budget these will do the trick!! [SEP] Cheaply-made frames, with serviceable lenses. Heavier-duty hinges. Not terrible light management as they removed a lot of glare, don't stare at the sun through these. Lenses are ""progressive"" in that they're darker above and lighter below. First outdoor picture is naked camera eye (bluer sky). Second pic is with the glasses covering the camera. Comes with a thin lens cleaning cloth. Not sure I would have purchased these if I didn't get them free in exchange for the review. Confused but not impressed by the ""designed in Italy"" label [SEP] I didn't realize these lenses ""fade"" from very dark at the top to very light at the bottom. (Is that called ""graduated""?  Just to be clear, there are no hard lines--it's a gentle fade) Some people love this.  I'm not one of them.  I'm looking for replacements for a pair of broken sunglasses and these aren't going to be that.<br /><br />They are very light weight, which is good for extended wearing, but it does sort of lend a ""cheap"" feel to them.  Will they last?  Well, since I'm not planning on wearing them all the time like my old ones, I'm afraid I won't be able to say for sure.<br /><br />As for the style--they feel very 80s to me, but I understand that's sorta' coming back in fashion?  Still, I tend to like a little better peripheral coverage.<br /><br />My personal opinion for these is 3 stars.  If I liked graduated lenses, I would probably go for a 4.  They aren't bad, but I've had better. [SEP] I did not expect the level of quality these sunglasses provide. They offer visual clarity equivalent to another brand that starts with ""O"" at a much lower price. They are comfortable to wear, and they are now my go-to sunglasses for fighting glare while driving. And they look good on women as well. [SEP] Very well built sturdy glasses. They are definitely polarized and take the glare off the water. Fit Nicely. They come with a case and cloth for cleaning. [SEP] These sunglasses üï∂ seem to have a lot of glare for being polarized. Unisex style IMO.  The frames are very lightweight and remind me of dollar store glasses I buy if I forget my good sunglasses. The sunglasses are light and don‚Äôt hurt your nose or ears.

This year is all about having fun and living every moment to the fullest! Why not always feel cute and look your best.'],,3.1,55,33448,"My new favorite jewelry vendor is Earlums. I've gone on a spree; I now own 6 cuffs by them and just ordered another. This particular design appealed greatly to me, and I was not disappointed when they arrived several days ago. I have worn them every day and it is fun to add other small colorful earrings (if the piercing is big enough to accomodate, of course) to spice things up a bit. The cuff and earrings are so very light and comfortable I hardly feel them at all, and they look so pretty; I am constantly tucking my hair behind my ear so as to see them better (and to make sure others see them too!). I read in several other reviews that they are made of plastic. The designers did a convincing job of making them look like metal because I would never have known - although the fact that they feel so light I guess should be a clue. I am absolutely enthralled with these reasonably priced and very pretty pieces of jewelry! [SEP] Bought this for my niece who absolutely loved it. The sellers were great as well, and when I experienced a problem with the order they quickly corrected it. [SEP] I'm really loving my ear cuff earring especially because it came with another earring for my other ear. It wears well, I always get complements & asked where I got it. Very pleased [SEP] i don't know what it is but when I wear these earrings I feel so sexy and beautiful. Total confidence booster for some reason. I wear these literally every single day [SEP] fast shipping!  nice product!  what's more to ask?  nothing, the clasp doesn't hurt!  :)<br /><br />the clasp was a bit small though [SEP] I was pleasantly surprised when I found that this set came with a matching earring for the other (non-cuffed) ear. The cuff fits and says in place and the whole set is very cute. The only downside is that the ear cuff can hurt after a couple of hours because of the way it squeezes your ear. My solution for that so far has been to scoot it up or down to an area that isn't already tender. [SEP] I have been looking for this type of earring for a while, and finally found this pair, which look beautiful and are at a completely reasonable price. Therefore I recently purchased these earrings, and I must say that they are EXACTLY what I wanted! The little leaf charms are absolutely beautiful: delicate and simple. I have never had earring cuffs before, so I wasn't sure how they would feel, but I'm happy to say that they are more comfortable than what I could even imagine. As I said, I've never worn anything over the cartilage area of my ears, and as soon as I put the cuff on I couldn't feel it at all. Additionally, the cuffs are slightly malleable, so you can pinch them to the tightness that works for you. This also means that you can (within reason) put the cuff wherever you would like along your cartilage. Overall, I would say this is a great deal for this pair of earrings and I couldn't be happier. If you are looking for a nice, sturdy, lovely pair of earrings with cuffs, don't look any farther! [SEP] Product came on time [ about 3-5 days ] and it is the cutest ear cuff ever. I got so many compliments on it. And the price is awesome! [SEP] Not only did my order arrive at lightning speed, the ear cuff is totally cute! Can't wait to wear them! I bought this cuffs for my forest elf costume this Halloween (2011). I recommend this item and to shop at this seller!!! [SEP] This ear cuff looks wicked cool when I wear it and I get compliments on it all the time, I also like that it come with a matching leaf earring for your other ear. The only reason that I didn't give it a full five stars was that when worn for a longer period of time the ear cuff started rubbing against my cartilage and breaking the skin, but if your cartilage isn't very thick (like mine) than you should be good.",3,True

Perfect style with a round neck and short sleeves.<br /><br />Comfy and casual. Perfect for skirts or pants. Really nice for those cooler days and great for Spring.<br /><br />Made of 100% Cotton and best to hand wash and dry flat. [SEP] This is a good short sleeve sweater. It is warm as it should be. The colors are bright without being overwhelming and the bunny is very well defined.<br />I wash all clothes I buy prior to using them. The sweater fits tighter than it should but I don‚Äôt know if it was due to shrinkage after washing it, if it was that smaller to begin with or if its a combination of both.

[SEP] As another reviewer said, this doublet does not compare with my triplet 10x.<br />The area of focus is very small, only in the center...the rest is blurry.<br />The triplet has focus throughout the viewing area.<br />Would not buy again.<br />If you want good viewing, through the full area, buy a TRIPLET, not a doublet. [SEP] Great for geology [SEP] it's basically a required piece of kit for the field biologists out there. If you want to see small things big, this is one way to do that. [SEP] Not so sure about this one.  The 30x is a killer deal.  The 10x focus distance is about 5mm, way too close to use much without a light source.  So I wasted $2, big whoop. [SEP] Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on ones with coated optics. They cost more, but are worth it.<br />On the other hand, this was great, for the price. Perfect for loaning to a friend, for the classroom, or rattling around in your car.<br />And if you lose or break it, no big deal. [SEP] To my surprise this came labeled as a Doublet, which means it has two lenses curved to compensate for distortion and color fringing. And it is noticeably better than other low-cost loupes I have tried. Those folks who find it too small or distorted are probably not familiar with using a loupe. Try this way:<br /><br />Remember: THIS IS NOT A SHERLOCK HOLMES READING GLASS! Do not try to hold it near the object a foot away from your eye. You will see a ghastly distorted image, even from the top-quality Bausch & Lomb Triplet loupe another reviewer compared it to.<br /><br />Instead, hold it VERY close to your best eye, so close that your eyelashes almost touch the glass. THEN move the item close to the magnifier until it is sharply focused. Or move your head and lens toward the object. Keep the eye-to-lens distance constant; vary the object-lens distance.<br /><br />If you look at a dollar bill, you will be able to see George Washington's ENTIRE head in the circle of the lens. The extreme edges of his wig may be less crisp, but if the bill is flat, the entire face will be very sharp. Even very fine lenses have minor problems at the extreme edges. Each of the seals on his right and left fit completely within the circle. And the detail will be crisp and clear. Now go back to Sherlock style and see the image degrade. Only the tiny central area will be viewable this way. Watch real jewelers at work and you will see how they do this.<br /><br />At first you may have to close the other eye. As you gain experience, you may learn to keep both eyes open as you use the loupe, reducing strain.<br /><br />A 10x lens like this is what is specified to examine and judge a diamond for inclusions. If you do this professionally, you ought to get a top-quality magnifier which might be easier and more comfortable to use for long periods. But I certainly find this meets and surpasses my needs. Quite a value.<br /><br />If you use this correctly, you will have trouble seeing any difference between this and the Bausch & Lomb triplet that costs over TEN TIMES as much! And you can let the grandkids play with it without fear!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I have no connection with the vendor. Just trying to help :-) [SEP] This is better than, &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. Only thing I found was the distortion at the edges. Other than that I am satisfied. [SEP] This does a real good job looking at coins especially for a 10X Magnifier. For Serious Coin Collectors I Recommend the 30X as well.

I am planning on embellishing mine with ribbon to go with a favorite dress, but you can also use this as is at the beach for some serious shade. A lovely and versatile hat. [SEP] This is the first &#34;straw&#34; hat I've ever had that has fit me comfortably. Maybe my head is perfectly average, but it fits comfortably and stays on (even on breezy days)  without having to sew on a piece of elastic to keep it from flying away (as I've had to do with previous straw hats.<br /><br />It's not exactly &#34;straw&#34; but a synthetic straw-like weave that looks pretty realistic but is much more durable and resistant to wetness. The weave is tight so that no sun filters through and I like that the brim remains stiff and doesn't flop, thus providing coverage for face, and some back, shoulder, and neck.<br /><br />I love the bright blue color. It doesn't match any of my bathing suits, but still looks nice and makes it easy for my grandkids to spot me. [SEP] Great hat and so thrilled that it was shipped in such a way that it was in perfect condition upon its arrival. Love the extra wide brim and the bold bright color. Looking forward to my next cruise so I can look sharp on the pool deck. [SEP] This hat brim was much larger than I expected and the color is BRIGHT blue.  I wore this to the Vegas pool and it shielded my face perfectly while being able to sun my entire body.  It was lightweight and I packed it in my suitcase - smashing it down, and was able to pop it back out without any damage. [SEP] To be honest, this is a gorgeous hat. The color is vivid, the weave is well-made and the overall structure is pretty much perfect. Unfortunately, the only problem I have is that it's too big for my petite noggin. I do have a really small head, so if you have a normal or slightly large head, it should fit just fine. Five stars for the hat itself. No stars for my disappointment (cue violins ;P).

The texture is present but not overwhelming. A delight.<br /><br />--Brockeim [SEP] When it arrived it was bented.

I believe it was a great buy if it wasn't bent [SEP] I absolutely love this hat!  The shade of blue is a beautiful cobalt -- even prettier in person than I thought it would be from looking at it online. I can't speak to others' experience, but this hat fits my head perfectly, and I have thick hair. I always thought I had a big head, but I guess not, after all!  The hat is made of paper straw, so it's lightweight and just the right amount of floppy. The weave is a little loose, which means it doesn't get too hot, but it also doesn't let in too much light. I wore it all summer, and it held up well -- I expect to get years of use out of this hat. Definitely a bargain for under $20! [SEP] I own much more expensive floppy sun hats that pale in comparison to this one.<br /><br />I have a 22.5 inch head (with thick hair) and this fits me well with a little room which his appears to be on the small side of average for woman.<br />I love the blue of this hat.  It‚Äôs a true primary cobalt.  I like the plain and simply look that just adds a pop of color.<br /><br />This hat is pretty thick and seems like it will hold up well to being packed and toted around.<br /><br />The brim is wide enough to provide good coverage.

If you haven‚Äôt had polarized lenses before you will be surprised at the clarity that you can see . The polarized lenses remove reflections from glass also. These come with a nice soft case . [SEP] These sunglasses are for a smaller face which, lucky for me, fits perfectly. My husband tried them on and looked pretty silly. They come with a carrying case plus a little card that shows you they are polarized. I used some Ray Bans that are 100% polarized to look at the card provided, then a pair of regular, non polarized glasses and finally these. As you can see by the picture, they are almost as good as Ray Bans when it comes to the polarization. Great pair of sunglasses for the price! [SEP] I ordered the tortoise color and am very pleased with the fit and style of these sunglasses. It looks retro without looking too obviously hipster - the effect is more subtle than other retro glasses I've worn (For example, Cat's Eye sunglasses). They come with a black faux leather case (envelope style) and cleaning cloth. The quality is very good and they look more expensive than the actual price. They also deflect strong sunlight as well (It has UV400 protection). Overall I have no complaints. [SEP] I have a photo of myself back in the early 90s rocking a pair of glasses just like these! Not sure if id go purchase another pair but if these are youre style, they're a for sure win. Good quality, good sun protection, built to last.

I have a low bridge nose and these are a little too high for that kind of nose, but they are still nice over all. I feel very stylish in these days. I recommend them to anyone looking for decent, fashionable glasses without wanting to break the bank. [SEP] Not a bad pair of polarized sunglasses. The frames remind me of ones my father used to wear, real retro. They cut the glare and are UV protected. The only con is they feel a little frail and the plastic might not hold up.

It also feels super sturdy which shows great quality. The lenses - oh the lenses- they're just amazing! It feels like you have photoshop on at all times while wearing this guy. The colors are enhanced at the same time it protects my eyes. I absolutely recommend them! [SEP] I wear glasses and don't want to pay and arm and a leg for a pair of prescription sunglasses.  Because of that I have to find sunglasses that will fit over my glasses.  These fit snuggly over my glasses without allowing any of the glasses underneath to be seen.  They stay put instead of sliding down my nose.  The tint to the glasses it set perfectly.  It blocks out the sun without being so dark I feel like I can't see safely.  I would absolutely recommend them. [SEP] These are stylish and comfortable. The nose pads don‚Äôt hurt your nose bridge after a while like some other cheap sunglasses can. The frame is lightweight too.<br />I got these sunglasses for my wife and she liked them a lot. I saw that they say that they were unisex, thus I tried them too.

If this was crafted by a real ""artist"" they would NOT put such a disturbing mark on the front of any shoe. The second big flaw is that the toe sections were NOT sewn in to the sole to match the other shoe/sandle. As u can see in the pictures, the left toe piece of leather wasn't gathered/cut right before sewing into the sole so it sticks way out and the leather has to fold itself irregularly making it look like some amateur sewed this together.  Quite dissapointing for a $100 sandles. now what am I going to do.  I feel ripped off because if I return them it will cost me another $50 (restocking penalty) plus if I did return them they won't refund money for sandles that have scratch marks on soles due to walking on cement.<br />And for the third most disturbing flaw is that they didn't bevel the edges of the leather pieces or soften them in any way. This is most important because they are cutting into my ankles (so I beveled the leather uppers so I dont have to wear bandaids). It allows the leather to slide past eachother (and ur skin) more easily and the leather to feel softer and look like a true artist made these not just pumping these out of a factory and calling them ""hand made"" because an actual person stitched them together. If u look at all shoes from that stand point, all shoes are handmade.<br /> I am very dissapointed at the lack of quality, I'm sorry but I'm not, there's alot to to say about what's wrong with these. But they are real leather,  thick leather,  like #8 leather (1/8"").<br />They do hurt my feet out of the box (other then blistering my skin)  but that's to be expected (for one thing the edges aren't beveled and I have to wear bandaids because of this) because of unworked leather. If they would have taken the time to soften the leather & beveled the edges they wouldn't hurt the feet out of the box.  If softened they would feel more like a cloud (almost like suede).<br />Bottom line is that I will have to break these sandles in which will void the return policy (that I would have to pay for)  anyway.  So its a lose lose situation.<br />Oh one more thing, as u can see in my pictures, they are very very thin in width so buyer beware.<br />UPDATE- Two Hours Later:  the stitching has broken in the toe area due to walking. If the recess for the stitching was cut deep enough normal wear would not have torn/ripped the stitching so fast. So that's what I'll  have to do very soon.  That is to take the stitching out, cut deeper grooves into the soles for the stitching to set into deep enough NOT to be so easily ripped/worn out thru normal use, and then I'll re-stitch them myself.<br />UPDATE<br />- One Day Later:  As far as the shoe mis-match I took it upon myself to remedy the problem since their quality control guidelines and (artisenship) is again inadequate.  See pictures, I had to take a large section out if the left shoe üëü  so it would come close to matching the right show.<br /> Emergancy Alert ! Just got back from ER because while wearing this sandles I lost traction on the steps and fell the entire flight of stairs in our house. I broke 2 ribs and somehow gashed my leg (?). So, I just got done mod'ing these sandles again to put 1/8"" thick real rubber soles on the existing leather soles, pictures attached.<br /> Obvious I must (and do) like the basic design of these sandles or I wouldn't be going thru all this trouble. Plus I dont want to throw away $100 shoes. I'd rather spend a little more and make them GREAT shoes.<br />  Next I'm replacing the inferiorly stamped buckles (20¬¢each) with ""real"" solid brass buckles ($2-$3 each). Thats my next update.  Unless amazons takes this review down first, I will keep updating this post.<br /> These sandles may have at one time been made by a company/person who actually cared about quality but now these are made for (Assumingly) profit and quality has been compromised for the almighty dollar (üí≤). I'm not trying to destroy this manufacturer.  I'm letting the consumer know what to expect before/after purchasing. That's all.<br />UPDATE AGAIN:<br /> The upper part ripped right out of the sole and I had to stitch it back together the best I could.  See picture.  I wore these sandles for less the 2 months and (if I wasn't able to fix them)  I would have had to throw a $100 pair of shoes out.  Buyer beware, these r not worth $10 let alone $100. I just don't know how long I can keep repairing these sandles.  R they even worth it ? I keep asking myself that.<br />UPDATE 2<br />Yes, I know,  but I bought another pair to modify. I LOVE THE STYLE of these so, now that I know what to expect I can modify these more easy.  This time I stitched/secured all the straps to the soles before I glued rubber soles to the bottom preventing any slips and falls and eliminating broken rids as in what happened the 1st time. Comment: these are wonderful sandles but they are not built to last (hence my notifications ). I added more pictures to show my progress. I hope people how buy these realize that thay a ""fall hazard"". Soles made of leather can be very slick and they will make u fall under certain conditions (I broke two ribs slipping on the steps).  So PLEASE beware.  I'm adding even dumbdeire pictures to help u make the proper decisiona.<br />UPDATED AGAIN 10-1-2022<br /> I DO LOVE these sandles.  The last 5 pictures are the 2nd pair where I did sew ib all the upper straps to the sole again.  I replaced the cheap stamped buckles for solid brass ones. I also glued real rubber soles on to the sandles so as not to fall again. I can walk down steps with security now. I did keep the ""natural look of leather on this 2nd pair and just spent hour working the leather by hand until they became soft.  The toe section on thus pair isn't as bad as my 1st pair so I intend to keep them just as they are.<br /> The 2 biggest complaints (well maybe 3) is the cheap stamped buckle and the uppers not being sewn into the soles.  And maybe the fact that there is no rubber soles on them.  Hmmmm wait a minute, that's the entire sandle.  Hmmm.

The brim is slightly curved and it is comfortable especially in warmer weather. Although it id dubbed a &#34;dad&#34; cap, it would be fine for moms, kids and anyone else who appreciates a nice baseball cap. [SEP] Nice hat with the brand's name, REBEL printed on the bill. Its a a chambray denim that is very appealing, but the fabric feels slightly feminine though advertised as a mens , even going so far as to say its for Dad. The hat has grommets for air circulation and an adjustible strap in back. [SEP] It's okay, but it's very small for a grown man's head. It looked ridiculous on my husband and one of our grand daughters will likely end up with it.  So I'm somewhat disappointed at the over all size of the hat.. [SEP] Everybody who wears denim jeans and shirts needs a denim cap because they look so cool together. However, the Rebel Canyon Men's Denim Unstructured Dad Hat has more than just style going for it.<br /><br />The cap is very light weight and almost feels like it's not even there when you wear it. The cap is very comfortable and it is adjustable to fit most sized heads. I especially like that, instead of using a Velcro fastener, Rebel Canyon selected an adjustable back strap with a metal fastener to adjust the size of the cap. It's more retro and that fits with the cap's style. While the Velcro is easier to use especially if several people wear the same cap, I find that the back strap with fastener to be a more reliable manner to adjust the cap size.<br /><br />While wearing the cap is a walking advertisement for Rebel Canyon, who wouldn't find the idea of walking around with the word &#34;Rebel&#34; marked on their forehead to be something of a statement!

Higher Standards Cloth Face Mask Reusable Washable and Breathable Material Made of Two layers For Better Protection Stylish Masks 3pack,['Ear Loop closure'],[],,2.9,15,550,"There are three black masks with the HS company logo in this package and all of them fit well but are loose in the chin area.<br /><br />None of the masks have a filter pocket or bendable nose wire. They also do not have adjustable ear elastics.<br /><br />The masks almost fit me perfectly if it were not for the loose chin area. These are still usable but are not yet perfect. If they were from fitting all over, this would have received 4.5 stars from me. I personally do not like having a company logo on a mask.<br /><br />In summary, these are not my favorite masks since they do not mold to my face but they are still functional. The current price of $29.99 comes to $10 per mask which is on the high side of competitively priced. [SEP] I was looking for large masks for my husband with a large face/beard, but without being able to tighten the ear straps or pinch the nose bridge to fit, it just sort of sagged on his face and was gapping in places. [SEP] Works just fine like a face covering should and it is washable and reusable. Works great for me and i like it. Thanks [SEP] I got the Higher Standards Cloth Face Masks to add to my mask collection.  I am not impressed with these at all.  They run very large and do not fit my face properly.  The masks lack some of the things I look for when purchasing masks.  For example, there is no adjustable nose piece.  The ear straps are not adjustable.  There is no filter pocket.  Plus, they are rather expensive for what you get. [SEP] the listing indicates that they are created in the United States of 100% cotton. I couldn't confirm that because the labels didn't indicate so. The cloth does not appear to be cotton. They have a synthetic gloss to them, and the straps are stretchy. Cotton might be used for the white lining. I looked for the Higher Standards brand on the internet, but all I discovered was a supplier of smoking accessories. Each mask is individually wrapped in plastic. The logos do not appear as vivid to me as they do in the photographs. Workmanship looks to be excellent. If you require a huge mask, you may be willing to pay the extra expense. [SEP] I really dislike these masks.  They fit me very poorly.  They seem to be more fitted across the nose int the pictures but they are not and they lack a metal nose piece.  This causes them to fog my glasses very badly.  The masks are very crinkly - they make a lot of noise.  There is also a a mesh lining inside the mask that is uncomfortable.  Essentially I like just about nothing about these masks. [SEP] This mask fits tight but seems a little small for my face. The ear loop is elastic, but not enough to fit comfortably over my ears without bending them forward, which makes the mask prone to come off. It is a one size fits all product, which might be great for those with smaller faces than mines. For mr, it is an uncomfortable fit and do not represent good value. The craftsmanship is good and the mask is lightweight and durable. Comes with 3 in a pack.",3,True

[SEP] These are thick and flexible. It was easy to get the name tag out and back in. The cables are light, but seem like they will securely hold the tags. I would not hesitate to buy more. [SEP] These brightly colored luggage tags have a wire loop to secure them to your luggage and thus ae less likely to break and allow the tag to become lost. The tag itself is made of silicone, they are bit oversized and very brightly colored for easy identification. You can fil out your address information on the card and put it inside the tag. There is a slot on the tag to allow one line to be visible without removing the card from the tag. Conceptually this is a great idea with the bright color making it easy to identify and the wire loop which won't break. At this point I'll have to see if after a number of trips whether the size of the tags gets them caught on other luggage and tears the tag but so far so good. [SEP] These are great luggage tags for helping to differentiate your bags from others and to make sure your information is securely attached to your bag should your bag be lost. The issue is the little window/opening. It doesn't do much to protect your information card inside the bag from damage if exposed to water.

On the other hand this zippered bag by Bagail is really a step above those designs.<br /><br />The nylon sacks will keep your shoes contained but if you happened to have loose dirt come free from the soles of your shoes it can come free of the bag and end up on your other belongings - not so with this zipper closed bag.<br /><br />This bag is designed to completely protect your shoes and your clothes from your shoes.

I like that it has plastic on the inside so if my shoes are wet and sandy from walking on the beach I dont have to worry about them messing up the rest of my clothes. This bag will fit sneakers, sandals, or heels. It's not large enough to fit super tall boots in (obviously)! This is way better than wrapping my shoes in plastic grocery bags like I used to! [SEP] I got this travel shoe bag because I was planning on doing some traveling. I was planning on going to a formal event which means I need to bring formal shoes with me.  The bag was well built and design, it was able to fit my shoes with ease. The bag is also relatively light so it did not add substantial weight to my luggage. The bag is also well made with a sturdy zipper so I expect this will last for a while. Overall highly recommend it if you are looking for a bag to store your shoes while you travel.

It is a nice blouse but it just isn't quite right maybe because it is too big for me. It is casual and can not be dressed up. So it is not the best but not the worst either. I hope this review helps you with your choice to purchase. [SEP] I received this top in the denim blue color, and I quite like it.  The fabric is soft and flowy and covers a multitude of flaws. The top is very comfortable to wear, though when it is hot and humid outside, it isn't very breathable as the fabric and traps the sweat.  The actual color isn't as light blue as it is in the picture on the listing. It still falls in the blue family, but it's more of a blue-grey in real life. Care is pretty straightforward - wash on cold, hang to dry. I've not had any issues with wrinkles so far, either when it's hung to dry or while wearing. The crochet detail around the neckline is pretty, though be wary of snags.  I am 5'6"" and find the length to be fine as the hem falls below my waist and when I lift my arms my tummy isn't exposed. The arm openings could be a little smaller. Depending on the bra you wear and where the band sits under your armpits, it might be flashed when you raise your arms. This top does indeed run big by close to a full size, so if you would like it to be more fitted than flowy, order a size down. [SEP] I was suppose to receive the 3X but instead received the 2X size.üòî<br /><br />It's more of a Bluish Gray in color than an actual Blue Blue color. It has an eye catching design around the neck / bust area. Short fluttery sleeves.<br /><br />Thankfully ... it does stretch (thank you, Spandex). The only problem with that is that you can than see every lump, bump & roll on my body (no thank you, Spandex).<br /><br />** Keep in mind that this is not the actual size shirt I usually wear or was suppose to receive. **<br /><br />The shirt is thin & light weight. Has a Silky type feel to it but it comes in a great longer length (like 55 inches long).<br /><br />Overall, an okay shirt. Not really my style but would probably look great with a flowing longer skirt or leggings. Giving you that boho hippie type vibe.",3,True

AMEXI Wooden Polarized Sunglasses Women Men Lightweight and comfortable Rectangle Retro Brand Sun Glasses 100% UV Blocking Dark gray,"['Mirror Coating coating', 'Bridge: 17 millimeters']",[],,4.9,27,5647,"I really like these oversized polarized sunglasses with wooden arms. They weighs 24g which is the equivalent of a little over 9 pennies which is really lightweight in my book. They come with a nice, wooden case and well made. [SEP] I just love these sunglasses.  They are very well made, and do a great job at cutting down on sun glare.  I have a narrow head and these fit nicely and they don't bother the bridge of my nose.  They look awesome and I love wearing them.  They come in a very unique bamboo case. [SEP] Pros:<br />-Great, basic style<br />-Lightweight<br />-Side wood detailing is very original & well done<br />-Lovely little wooden case<br />-Sturdy<br />-Nice to look through<br />-Comfy on your head<br /><br />Cons: none! [SEP] These are very nice quality polarized sunglasses and I do recommend them.<br /><br />The come with a thin wooden storage box, a drawstring storage pouch, a cleaning cloth, and a little card that you can use to test that they are polarized.  The earpieces do seem like they are real wood.  I got the sunglasses with black lenses and am very glad that I did‚Äîthey are a nice level of darkness to block the sun‚Äôs glare, and the polarized effect of them is very good to also block the sun‚Äôs glare.<br /><br />I have a relatively small face and these fit me well, both in the width across the front of the face and the physical size of the lenses.  They do not slip off my nose or face when I lean forward.  The right earpiece is completely plain(wood), and the left earpiece has the name of the company and the company logo very lightly engraved into the wood at the temple.  It‚Äôs not very dark or obvious though.  That may be important to those who either like obvious company brand/logos on their sunglasses, or who prefer plain.<br /><br />At this time, there is no price advertised, so I cannot comment on the value.  However, I am very pleased with these sunglasses, they are good quality, and I like them a lot.  I will definitely be wearing these.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope that my review helped you! [SEP] I ordered this ""AMEXI Wooden Polarized Sunglasses"" because I wanted to give a gift to a dear friend and since I own various pairs of this same product I can now assure the glasses are perfect. They come in a very nice wood box along with a piece of microfiber cloth to keep them clean and a sure tightener. The glasses uses polarized lens for a better protection. The plastic frame is nicely accompanied by the wood's glasses legs. I am very happy with the value for the money. I recommend this pair of glasses  100% [SEP] I have another pair of these glasses with the blue reflective lenses.  THOSE glasses are so cool but I am not a fan of them in bright direct sun as I prefer a much darker lens.  These lenses on this pair are darker than the colored lenses.  So I like that a lot.  They are a bit better in bright direct sun because of that - but again - I would prefer a much darker lens.  It could be just me - I like to walk around and hate the sun bothering my eyes in any way.  You can see your eyes through these - so that is generally a tip off that bright sun will not be blocked that well - if you can see your eyes.<br />They come in a cool lightweight wooden case, along with a polishing cloth, and a softer sleeve case.  Plus a really nice bonus - they come with a nice little screwdriver took on a keychain.  Super handy and nice to have if you need to tighten the glasses' screws - or ever fix them.  Hopefully I will not need to do either - but super nice touch to be include. : )<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""helpful"" button.  Thanks! : ) [SEP] Loved these.

Nice larger size for men! Hope you found this review and photos helpful! 5 Stars! [SEP] I was looking for a replacement pair after I broke my favorite pair of sunglasses that were similar in style to these. These are great and definitely worth the price. I don't like paying much for sunglasses because I lose or break them easily. The only thing I don't like about these is the nose piece gets caught in my hair when I place them on top of my head. My old glasses had that built in to the frame. I also wish the metal was silver rather than gold. But overall, these are a great buy!",3,True

[SEP] love them [SEP] They are beautiful, and shinny, but unfortunately the part that actually goes into your ear gets bigger the closer you get to the front of the earring. That means that it's easy to get in the hole, but as you push the earring into place it stretches out the hole, and hurts. I couldn't even get these in all the way because it was too painful. I have never had a pair of earrings that I couldn't wear because the post was too large. So for now they just look nice in my jewelry box. Not really sure what I'm going to do with them. [SEP] EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED! These took over TWO MONTHS to receive. Very cheap looking, poor quality . [SEP] Very pleased with my earring [SEP] They are so cute love them!!!!!

"Camptrace Beanie Tail Winter Hats for Women Warm Knit Messy High Bun Ponytail Hat Visor Outdoor Runner Beanie Cap (Pink, one Size)","['100% Nylon', 'Pull-On closure']",[],,3.9,31,1973,"Oooh I am loving this more than I expected. It is lined with fleece- super cozy and warm. The outer knit is soft, sturdy, and a good medium weight. I like the mini visor. I love that I can just put this on  my head whether my hair is up or down.<br /><br />I am a big fan of winter hats, but this just added some versatility to my choices. It will keep majority of my head warm, keep my ears warm, shield my eyes a little from sun or glare. I think it will be cute and functional once the colder weather gets here.<br /><br />The dimensions provided in the product description says it fits 21.6"" to 23.2"". Just so you know, if you happen to have a big cranium like I do- which measures almost 24"", this fits fine. I'd say there is room beyond that too. [SEP] This is the greatest hat ever! Okay, maybe that was a bit exaggerated. There have been an awful lot of hats to say 'ever' but this is a great hat.<br />This is a knit winter visor hat that is fleece lined and has a nice big open spot for a pony tail or even a larger up/other style. It's so soft on the inside I didn't want to take it off after trying it out but it's not quite the weather for it just yet. I'm not hoping for it any time soon but it'll come regardless and when it does, I'll have the perfect hat! There are many color choices available and one size fits most.<br />I love this hat and probably will need more! [SEP] The cold dawn run is a wake up call best accomplished without that rough, strange polyester dampness that you have to 'run through' and rush to take off first when the run ends.  The fleece lining makes it special.<br /><br />Looks great. Better than expected. [SEP] My hair is always in a messy bun. I have been using headbands over my ears for my winter walks, but I was excited to try something with a hat brim. This fits well even over my glasses and stays in place. It reminds my kids if a Pok√©mon trainer look. Cute & functional. [SEP] This messy bun beanie hat is so SOFT!  It really feels good on my head.  I don't have big hair but I can certainly see how those with big hair, buns, top ponytails and other big hair styles would like this hat.  I still will wear it anyway just because it's so comfy. The visor helps block bright sun light and I can see myself wearing it this winter on the tennis court.  It's very well knitted, soft, stretchy and a lovely shade of pink. [SEP] I am always looking for just the right hat for winter running. Usually knit hats drive me nuts as the knit can be scratchy on my ears. I was pleasantly surprised at the cozy fleece lining inside this one. It is not itchy at all and is so warm that I can only wear it for a short time running before I get too hot. I've only tried it in the brisk morning so maybe in winter I will be able to keep it on longer. I may have to get another one as a back up.<br /><br />This hat fits well and covers the part of my head I like covered for running but leaves me room to put my ponytail out the top. I'm stoked that I found one with a rim for sun protection. That is one of my favorite things about this as I usually just run with a band. I can't find anything I don't like about this. [SEP] I ordered this to wear while working outdoors on my farm. The band is lined in a ultra soft fleece like material. It is very comfortable. Plus, the lining helps keep my ears warm. In order to fully cover my ears, the brim sits pretty low on my forehead. It's okay, but not ideal. The opening requires a high ponytail, which I find uncomfortable. Because the opening is big enough, I twist my hair into a mess on top of my head instead. The brim adds a tiny bit of sun protection which is nice.<br />Overall, this farm gal is pretty happy with her new pink hat. [SEP] I had no idea such a thing existed!!  Its perfect!!  Fits my head (my hat size is 6-7/8) just right. The open top for ponytail or bun, the brim to keep sun out of eyes, the soft fleece lining, it is just ingenious. I look forward to wearing this when the weather cools off for all outdoor activities. I could not find laundering instructions in or with the hat and I have not laundered it yet. I plan to wash and dry it with the rest of my clothes on normal and if the hat doesn't do well I will update this review. [SEP] So as a naturalista, this is perfect.  When wearing my hair pulled up in a band, this is great. My bun can breathe and  I get more coverage than just the ear muffs and or the around the head ear protectors.  Very good material and is made well.  I would like to see the lining made with silk or satin to protect the hair.  I like it!  Thank you [SEP] Pink is my favorite color so I was happy to receive this pretty pink winter visor. I don‚Äôt even wear it with a bun, I just wear it normally and it‚Äôs super comfortable. I could wear with a bun as well that‚Äôs what I like about this hat, you can wear it any way you want. It‚Äôs versatile and whichever mood you‚Äôre in for, bun or not you can wear it accordingly. I‚Äôm actually surprised by the quality, I really didn‚Äôt expect much quality-wise, but it‚Äôs made well and appears durable. The material is so soft and the inner fleece lining keeps your ears cozy. I love my new winter beanie visor and would recommend it.",3,True

They come arranged artfully in a nice box, just wrap and go. [SEP] I like the ties a lot! Nice quality, sturdy and well made, and very colorful. However, my ""2 tie mixed set"" was not that at all. I received the same tie x 2.  I gave one away to a friend. Sad I didn't get the two, but happy to share the tie with someone. If I could change anything about the amazon page  for these ties... have the ability to ""mix"" but custom the mix a bit. Because if I'd have paid for this ""mixed set"" and got what I got... I'd be very disappointed and upset. A fair TWO STAR amazon item. [SEP] It's pretty interesting to order a tie and not know what you're going to get, but I'm not sure that's entirely ideal. I got 2 of the same tie, both of which are a mild, inoffensive, checkered purple pattern. I was excited to get the bright pink tie pictured on the site.

Stocking Fox Ballet Dance Tights Convertible for Women Girls 2-Pack White Age 11-14,['Hand Wash'],[],,4.7,26,8086,"These 11-14 size tights fit my almost 10 year old average sized niece perfectly.<br />There is a hole on the bottom.<br />These tights didn't bunch at her heel or anything, they looked like normal tights.<br />My niece did try them with the foot turned up at the ankle and actually, I kind of liked that feature.  Sometimes at weddings, kids take their shoes off and dance, and then I worry about the tights getting all gross and dirty from the dance floor and holes getting in the bottom from too much wear. Also if your daughter is wearing these with A dress and boots/ socks then the convertible foot can help with less bunching.<br />With that feature, they can be pulled up and then no worry about either of those problem!<br />I'm thinking about converting to convertible tights from now on!<br />The 11-14 size fit my 9 year old daughter perfectly, so you might want to size up if you're 13 or 14. [SEP] I think it‚Äôs a personal issue of comfort, but my 10 year old wasn‚Äôt too keen on them, they fit like any type of stockings/hosiery and sometimes they ride up or bunch in the ankles. [SEP] These are well made, comfortable and pretty. They fit as expected, just right for a girl who is 4' 8"" and 80 lbs. [SEP] I bought these tights for my granddaughter.  Upon arrival I checked the material for workmanship and durability.  The seams were stitched well and the material felt sheer, yet durable and well made.  I was happy with the quality of the tights.  After having my granddaughter try on the tights I checked them for sizing and the sizing appeared to be accurate.  My granddaughter indicated that she liked the feel of the material.  My granddaughter has worn these tights several times at this point and they have held up very well.  I am very happy with this purchase.  Thank you. [SEP] I got this for my 9 year old granddaughter who does ballet and she loves these tights.  She said they fit perfectly and is glad to have an extra pair.  The tights held their shape after washing and they were also washed in a machine and not just hand washed. [SEP] These are comfortable, have a good stretch, and do not snag easily. There are less transparent than I was anticipating, which is great. They do look a bit awkward around then ankles when used as footless tights, but I guess that probably comes with the style.<br />Overall, these are good for dance classes/days where you sometimes need footed tights, and sometimes need to go barefoot--or even to use in between classes.

Ldurian Beaded leopard earring For Girls Trendy Square Handmade Colorful Bead drop Earrings for Woman,[],[],,3.7,26,895,"These earrings add an exotic flair to any look. They even have a bit of sparkle when they catch the light. The backs are a little on the delicate side, but that's to be expected with costume jewelry. Check out the other offerings from this brand. They make good costume jewelry.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] These earrings look exactly as pictured on the product page.  They are beaded with tiny black and white beads and would be great to wear with any outfit.  These could be worn to casual and fancier events or just to the office or shopping.  I like them pretty well.  They aren't heavy and won't pull your earlobes down. [SEP] If you have any leopard print tops this is the perfect pair of earrings to go with it!  These earrings have a very tribal look with the beads, yet are fun and classy.  There are 3 different colors of beads used, white, black, and a brown color that looks like deep gold when the light shines on them.  Each square is about 1-3/8‚Äù (3.5 cm), and there is a piece of fabric glued to the back which gives the bead a little more support and should protect your hair from getting tangled with the beads.  My only concern with these earrings is it appears the only thing holding the post section and bottom square together are 2 little threads each with 2 beads and those threads don‚Äôt feel very strong.  If this catches on anything like a jacket collar or zipper one of the threads could break and it would not be an easy fix.  Other than that, these are a very nice pair of earrings.

This will help other users like you to make informed decisions before spending their money! [SEP] My ears are super sensitive to weight and I struggle to find dangly earrings that aren't too heavy. These fit the bill. They are unusual, which I love, and not so heavy that I can't wear them all day.  I do recommend them! [SEP] I really wanted these to be nice to gift to a colleague, but they are sort of clunky and look cheap. They come in a nice enough gift box but they look like the beads were glued on. [SEP] Earrings arrive inside the nice glittery box, with a textured insert. The earrings themselves come attached to a cardboard, and inside a plastic zip lock bag (which serves to nicely protect the jewelry during transport).  You could attach the earrings to the black insert, to highlight the earrings, or leave them on the cardboard. Personally, I liked it on the cardboard, with the dangling part of the earrings spaced apart. These are not haute couture jewelry, but attractive and well made.  Probably suited for a variety of situations, depending more upon the personality of the wearer.<br />Attached are photos to show real world imagery, with a ruler for size reference.<br />These would make a nice gift for an age range of teen to adult, in my opinion.<br />Based on accuracy of description, and the quality and design...I'd easily recommend these earrings. [SEP] These are beautiful! I was worried they'd be too bulky or gaudy looking, but they're perfect. Surprisingly lightweight and don't irritate my sensitive ears/skin. They're the perfect statement piece without being over the top. [SEP] Cute earrings. [SEP] These earrings are pretty, lightweight and definitely get noticed. Leopard pattern is the new thing and  is made out of small beads but beads completely took over this pattern and I honestly don‚Äôt see leopard patter when looking at these earrings.

"Bellivera Women's Sun Hat Visor, Portable UV Face_Shield Protection Cap, Premium UPF 50+ Sunhat with Adjustable Headband Black","['Buckle closure', 'Hand Wash Only']",[],,4.3,85,9699,"At the height of the pandemic last year, I'd seen someone wearing this type of sunshield.  It's more drastic than the smaller clear plastic shields, but it serves two purposes: sun shield and personal protection.<br /><br />While most of us are vaccinated and they have relaxed the mask requirement in NYC, I worry that the Delta variant may spread further.  I like that this sun shield helps protect against direct exposure from other people (along with masks and social distancing) as well as protects from the sun. [SEP] I am satisfied and very pleased with this sun hat visor. The fit is adjustable and it feels very comfortable when I‚Äôm wearing it. I like being able to pull the large visor down to shield my entire face from the sun‚Äôs harmful rays. I can see clearly through the visor without any issues with vision. I like the look of the reflective design. This visor is lightweight and sturdy. [SEP] Very well at sun protection! Easy to wear and not too heavy. Able to wear regular glasses with it. But too much reflections that are very disturbing to the driver! Not sure safe to drive with it on! [SEP] I like this sun protection cap. We live in California where sun is out most of the time. This cap works great for long walks, running, beach time. You could see through the visor well from the inside. From the outside, it is reflective. Its fixed on the head by Velcro straps and could be regulated. Also it not only protects the face from the sun but looks very stylish. [SEP] You looks like an alien when the visor pulled down all the way to cover your face (my dog was startled when he saw me wearing the hat with visor down). However hat is functional and practical. The visor not only blocks harmful UV light but also shield you from wind and dust in windy days or the droplets in crowd.<br />The extra large visor is coated with light reflection material like one way mirror. Others see the wearer like face is covered by mirror, however to the wearer who viewed from the other side it still have good visibility.<br />There are Lock buttons on each side, I assume they can lock the visor in desired position. However I found it makes no difference when it slid to lock or unlock position.<br />The hat can't be folded because of its unique one-way mirror visor. Maybe the visor can be detached  from head band for easy storage by operate the lock buttons. However I was not able to rotate the buttons like the video in product description page.<br />Not sure the durability, seemed the visor is easy to be scratched. Even though the scratches wont affect the hat when wared in normal way (visor up). [SEP] This visor is great.  It provides full face coverage and protection.  The visor is reflective and tented.  You can see through it with it down.  It comes with a cover to go over the visor portion for a more solid coverage. [SEP] The sun hat visor offers great protection from the sun's harmful rays. Living in Florida with the intense sun all year round, I need protection from sun exposure while playing golf, visiting the beach, running, or even going on a quick errand. The sun visor has UPF 50+. The visor has a reflective cover so it looks like an astronaut helmet which is not really attractive but works for sun protection.<br /><br />The sun hat visor cap can roate a full 360 degrees so you can adjust the cover depending on how much exporsure you want. The visor not only blocks the sun but it is also waterproof and seems to be heat resistant. It has an adjustable head strap so sizing is not a problem even for my large hair. There is a canvas like visor cover that comes with the order. I take it off during mid-day workouts and place is back on for my evening jobs.<br /><br />If you like being in the outdoors and need sun protection, this visor is for you. [SEP] It helped so much in Vegas.<br />Helped me because, I had eye surgery [SEP] This is a good sun  shield. I took  points off  because it not long enough  for me . The adjustable headband has velcro  which is good ,but it squashes my styled hair,  If you don‚Äôt want to mess your hair and want more length coverage go with waycom sun cap (it holds on the temples) But if you have short wide face with short or ponyailed  hair  and you use it for active sport and need tight  attachment to your head its good shield for you.  The shield has two loops  and it comes with the hanging rope shield holder with  a lock button  and  2 metal hooks. [SEP] Makes me look scary but its a good sun blocker",3,True

I don't like the flopping around of boxers which is why I buy this style. But these don't really do well for me because I am in between their sizes.<br /><br />But, the quality is very good, though I'm not sure it justifies the 11$ per pair price tag. [SEP] The sizing on these is just perfect.  The length is good, no more greetings for Phil McCrackin...  the legs are nice and just the right about of tight.  This means they don't ride up while also allowing you freedom and feeling of movement.  Great soft material that doesn't irritate the skin, these are pretty good boxers. [SEP] I got these for my son to try and he loves them!  The fabric seems like cool cotton but it is a soft modal.  A nice waistband that is not too tight, just right.  The only thing in question is the fact that there is no fly.  That seems odd for a man. He is still considering that but thinks that it will be OK, just some getting used to. You can't beat the softness of the fabric- these briefs are super comfortable. [SEP] I like these. All the space you need for your, err, bits, but still with plenty of support for said bits.

These jeans will fit everyone differently, likely no matter the size. We don't all have the same proportions- calves, thighs, butt, hips, waist..  The size 22 that I have that fits me, may not fit your 22. Or maybe it will fit even better. Best bet is to read through all reviews. What I will do is provide you with measurements for the 22 and then you can decide.<br /><br />KEEP THIS IN MIND- the tag reads:<br />Size 22 Skinny/Stretch/Mid-Rise/Ankle Length<br /><br />Measured FLAT:<br />Waist: 22"" wide (so 44"" around)<br />Hips: 24.75"" (so, 49.5"" around)<br />Rise: 13"" (measured from crotch to top hem)<br />Inseam: (measured from crotch to bottom of leg about 26"" (where it lands will depend on how jeans hang on you)<br /><br />Additional measurements:<br />I measured directly across lower hip area. I guess this would be bum area. This is 26"" (so 52"" around)<br />Width at upper thigh closest to crotch is 14"" so 28"" around<br />Midwway point, near knee area is 9.75"" wide, so 19.5"" wide.<br />Midway between knee area and bottom hem (to try to get calf size) is around 9.5"" (19"" around)<br />Width of bottom opening is 7.5"" (so 15"" around)<br /><br />I am 5'10"" with a long torso. Even so, I still have long-ish legs. These jeans land above the ankle on me. Not a capris, not a full length jean (your experience may vary) but long enough to be adequate with heals or flats, or low boots.<br />I am 300lbs or so. I have an hour glass shape, and have a squishy lower belly (""apron"") that can make fitting extra awkward. These are a little loose in bum and thighs- not so much to be sloppy. Actually I find them surprisingly comfortable. Accommodates my lower belly flarb.<br /><br />Simple zip up with button. Looks like regular worn jeans, but lightweight; and with the stretch, it allows for greater comfort and overall fit. Bottom hem has fray (""raw') and a couple of intentionally worn areas. Subtle- not obnoxious. Trendy. Full size rear pockets. Shallow front pockets with one small coin pocket.<br /><br />98% cotton, 2% elastane. Just stretchy enough. Machine wash cold with like colors. Tumble dry.<br />Made in Mexico<br /><br />Not a fan of the name, but the good experience with this pair of jeans has piqued my interest in their other offerings.  Would be nice to get away from yoga pants ;)<br /><br />And because of that I will give this 5 stars. But really this is all a matter of preference and the fit on our individual bodies. Main thing to know is is that sizing is pretty accurate overall (not like a 22 is fitting like a 12), and the overall quality is fine. Wish I knew the price.  Anyway, if I experience anything worth sharing I will be back to do so. Will include pics soon. [SEP] These jeans are distressed. Although I am not a fan of pre-weathering it does look authentic. The fabric is soft and they are true to size. They are short; not capris but above ankle for sure. They are comfortable on and look pretty goid.

These jeans really surprised me, by how much I like them.  They fit perfectly and are very flattering.  The only negative thing I have to say about the jeans, is that they do get a little looser as the day goes on. [SEP] great quality [SEP] A little bigger than my wife anticipated but stylish and nice!

Excellent stitching, double layer fabric, padded chest, minimal bouncing, flattering back design, snug fit, but the size ... oh the size... I'm 112 lb and 5'5"", and by all means I'm considered a US size S. I ordered a size M based on the size guide in the listing, and I still wish it'd give in a little more. It goes a little better without the padding. Trust the sizing guide recommendation.<br />I'm not taking away any stars because of sizing being inaccurate compared to standard conventions, as in their listing they clearly state their definition and measurements, but be really really careful. [SEP] I am 5'-8"" and 130 lbs and wear a size Small shirt with 32B bra size. I ordered the medium sized bra in black color. The fitting is perfect. It is comfortable to wear. It stretches and is form fitting. The back has the cross bracing which adds a nice sex appeal.<br /><br />The material of the fabric is 95% polyester and 5% spandex. Unfortunately, the bra material is not breathable and the fabric does not absorb moisture. I get so sweaty at the end of my workouts and usually find my bra soaking in sweat, but this bra just retained moisture and not absorb it. I found my yoga mat just wet from my sweat which I wanted to avoid. [SEP] Soy 34C orden√© talla M y me qued√≥ perfecto! las costuras son muy buenas y de excelente material.

[SEP] This sports bra has great support. Material is thick and sewn well. The removable cups are pretty thick, large and stiff. Definitely more padded than most sports bras. I usually get medium sports bras and this fit true to size. I like mine tight though to keep everything in place while working out. A large probably would have worked too. For reference I am a 32DD. [SEP] My wife is typically a medium for sports bras, so that's what she ordered for this one. It fits nicely except the straps in the back are a little tight at the upper back.

This is a fine product and worth giving a try if you know that compression works for your child or want to see if it will work.  Our problem had nothing to do with the product itself and it may be worth a try for struggling parents looking for anything that will calm down their kid with sensory issues. [SEP] Bought these for kids with sensory issues. As soon as they put them on, they liked them, but 10 minutes later, they were complaining that they felt restricted.<br />I asked them to make it through school and they can take it off when they come home. Child number one came home and took it off immediately and child number two was more bold. He pulled his arms out from under his top shirt and lowered the entire shirt down to his waist when he got to school because he felt it was very restrictive. I ordered based on the sizing description, but were terrible gauges on whether they are the right size. Reading the packaging, it says you should be able to put your hand between body and shirt.

When it fits crossbody,  it fits nice and flat.  I can put a wallet,  reading and dark glasses,  and of course,  my coronavirus mask.  And, as you place things inside,  they will get mixed up,  but you can SEE everything.<br /><br />Nice, handy,  attractive bag for various trips!

When I am locking up my office at night I can use the flashlight on my phone while keeping it safely tucked inside this protective purse. The best part is that I don't have to use as much isopropyl alcohol on my devices at a time when it is in such limited supply. It is well made and offers excellent protection.

Thank you so much üòä ** [SEP] The regulations for the Arena and Superdome require a see-through bag, so I finally decided to order one rather than keep using the tote my firm gave us all when they put the regulations in place.  This will be so much easier to carry, it's large enough to hold the things I need to have with me. [SEP] I paid over twice this for a similar bag at a store prior to a concert.  This bag is well constructed, with rounded edges, reinforced seams, a small inner pocket for keeping smaller items handy, and a wide adjustable shoulder strap that adjusts in length from over the shoulder and tucked under your arm, to a cross-body. [SEP] I really like this clear plastic bag that can be carried into a NFL stadium.  I enjoy concerts and one day I'm optimistic mass gatherings will be permitted again.  Even in smaller venues, purse checks are standard so anything that makes the process quicker and easier appeals to me.  This purse bag has an adjustable shoulder strap that can also be worn as a crossbody bag.  The contents are easily viewable.  I like that the zipper is on the top side so  that it's worn against the body to keep the contents secure.  Within the bag is a smaller zippered pocket for added organization which is about 4.25 inches deep and 6.5 inches in width.  My Android phone does not fit into that pocket, but it would be good for carrying keys.  While I'm waiting for concerts, this clear bag is also very useful for organizing items in a suitcase.  It's easy to see the contents and keeps small things together instead of getting lost the larger spaces in suitcases.  My rating is 5 stars because this is a great value for a versatile clear bag. [SEP] This purse looks better in real life than it does in the online pictures. It's sturdy, attractive and has an inner pocket for little items that could get lost in the big part of the purse. It is sporting event compliant!! I'm very impressed with the product and price. [SEP] A very good solution when you are in the airport travelling with family. Always with tons of documents, prints of the airline tickets, reservations, tours, vouchers, travell authorizations, cards, eye contact boxes, keys, etc etc etc.<br />As this is transparent plastic you don't loose time looking, and you don't need to open one hundred of times to double check where are the documents, the keys, te reservations etc. hahahhaa<br /><br />The quality if very good both the plastic and the zipper.<br /><br />The size is very good, not small and not too big.<br /><br />I recommend it. [SEP] I love this bag and can't wait to use it for NFL football this year.  It meets the requirements, is roomy (but not too big), and even has a small zippered compartment inside the main bag to ensure your important items - license, credit card, game tickets, etc, are extra safe.  The cross body strap is adjustable so it will be perfect for everyone! [SEP] This is a pretty nice bag.  It is not cheap.  The strap is not detachable, so you don't have much flexibility there.  The zipper for the second pocket is inside the big pocket.  The bag is flat, meaning the it does not extend.  It fits a smaller tablet.  It is a good buy, if you just want a purse to bring to a stadium game.  If you want to use it for storage, I would pass. [SEP] This is a ""with it"" bag that the younger members of my family will love.  You can see all your junk at once.  That is the blessing and the curse of the bag.  However, If you are wearing it,  you know it conveys a clear picture of its contents.  Perhaps it will force us to be neater.  In any case, I think that it is a cool item.",3,True

Enjoy your selection!']",,3.5,17,6835,"This bracelet, at least the one I received, looks pretty much like what the picture looks like. It's a rose quartz stone set in a gold looking setting on a gold chain. The stone looks more natural, not shaped but set as it may be found in nature. The chain doesn't seem to be of very high quality so it doesn't look all that great if you are wearing something on the nicer side. The clasp is shaped like the letter S and is slightly tricky to get but once you do it seems to be pretty firmly in there. The hard part is trying to slip it in without bending it or bending it too much because once you start bending it the little bit of metal will weaken once it breaks it'll be a mess to get the bracelet to stay on.<br />If you like what you see in the picture and you really like it, then you should like it. However, it does look a little on the lower end of the jewelry scale so keep that in mind. I really like the rose quartz part of it. It's a very pretty stone. It's definitely the best things about this bracelet. [SEP] This definitely has a handmade look that might be rustic and charming for some, or maybe a bit sloppy for others, depending on what you like. I didn‚Äôt see pricing info, but I would put this in the $6-$11 range. Anything more than that would be a little high for what you get. [SEP] I disagree with reviews that called this bracelet cheap looking. I think it looks like what it is: gold plated brass chain and beads with a rose quartz stone set at the center. The quartz is rough and unfinished, which is a look I happen to like. The chain is loose links, and the closure is admittedly a bit iffy. But the metal absolutely does not look like plastic! It‚Äôs a rustic piece that will look great worn with casual outfits. [SEP] I feel like this is a bracelet a traveler might buy to support a good cause--a poor villager in a remote location with limited supplies.  The stone is rough and looks like it was picked up off the ground and merely washed.  The stone in my bracelet looks like a corner broke off, but the craftsman soldered it into place anyway.  The soldering is well done, though, and not likely to release the stone.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, the findings and chain are not of the same materials, and they look cheaply made and could be easily broken.  The ""S"" clasp is difficult to navigate with one hand, and it requires the metal to be bent, which means it is weakened and will likely break.  The weight of the stone causes the bracelet to slide around the wrist, so it's not easy to see while wearing.  As the stone matches my skin color, it's really not easy to see regardless.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product unless the quality of the materials improves, the stones are more polished and weigh less, and maybe some other pinkish beads were added for more bling around the wrist.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for this review. [SEP] This bracelet is more impressive in the product profile pictures than it is in real life. The quality of the materials make this bracelet look like a toy. The chain feels like plastic, the beads are cheap-looking, and the rock is plain and fits the holder oddly. The clasp was difficult to figure out; one of the pieces had to be bent open. [SEP] I'm actually a little disappointed in this bracelet. Although I love rose quartz in combination with gold, this particular bracelet is a bit clunky and the clasp is difficult to use. When I ordered it, I somehow expected something a little more ""refined"", delicate, and ""artistic"" for lack o a better word. This just seemed like a hunk of quartz thrown between to findings and put on a bracelet. I can't explain it exactly, other than to say I don't find it as attractive as I had imagined.",3,True

OLIEYE Classic Pilot Women Polarized Sunglasses for Men Womens Polarized Mirror with Case Sun glasses,['Mirror Coating coating'],[],,3.9,29,6982,"These cool looking shades come with a really nice case with a magnetic clasp and a cleaning cloth. They are well made and carefully packaged. They kind of remind me of a style the stereotypical TV cop might wear. Although these are really nice shades, I docked a star because I just can‚Äôt justify paying $30 for sunglasses. They might very well be worth it, but I‚Äôm the type of person that will lose them or break them and end up having to buy another pair in a few months anyway so I try to stick to the cheapest ones. [SEP] I love these OLIEYE Classic Pilot sunglasses.  They are marketed for women but I am a 58 year old man and love them.  I usually hate wearing sunglasses and either find them too bulky or cumbersome.  And then especially on vacation I get stuck in brig\ht sun and wish I had a pair.  Often sunglasses fit very uncomfortably as well.  These fit me very snugly in a good way.  They are not too tight while also not going anywhere.  They have very large lenses which I really like and the glasses are especially great for the lenses don't even touch my cheeks.  The sunglasses are very lightweight and feel very nice on.  The fact that they will block out so much light and feel nice as well make them the first pair of sunglasses I like to wear.  They honestly fit as if they were made for me.  So for men or women I highly recommend these glasses. [SEP] After a month of ordering this glasses, they broke and considering I did not abuse them There is not other reason than the poor quality excuse. Because of the short period the last me I would not recommend this sunglasses at all. [SEP] I couldn‚Äôt help myself because, these really remind me of Top Gun. Haha! I‚Äôve never worn a pair like these and they‚Äôre pretty Cool. I always wear Polarized Glasses though and these definitely are. They‚Äôre tinted fairly dark too, so the squinting of a crazy bright day should be well under control. They come in n a nice looking Box, a separately package Cleaning Rag and a Polarize Test Card to show you the difference of a Polarized Lens.<br />  I would definitely refer these. [SEP] These are terrific sunglasses! They cut the glare and shade your eyes without making it so dark you can't see anything.üòÇ They are nice quality and sturdy not cheap grocery store, flimsy sunglasses. Comfortable nose pieces. Look good on men and women. The case is really nice too, sturdy so the sunglasses won't get crushed, soft inside so they won't get scratched with a magnetic closer. They also come with a cleaning cloth. Comes in a nice box if you'd like to give as gift. I would recommend these. [SEP] These are nice aviator-style sunglasses.  There is good shade from the sun - I didn't feel like I was squinting while wearing them.  It's also not too dark - I could see well.  The style is not the best for my face, but I don't think it looked bad.  The glasses are relatively light weight (I usually wear frameless Maui Jim's, which weigh *nothing*), but they still left little marks on my nose.  The case is nice, with a magnetic closure. [SEP] These are great for every day wearing. I use them especially while driving. They hold up nicely and protect my eyes from the sun. They also aren't too dark and they stay on my face. [SEP] These glasses are good quality and classy looking. They don't look great on my face shape, but that's not anything wrong with the glasses. The glasses come with a nice case and cleaning cloth. Refer to my photos to see the test of polarized lens. [SEP] These glasses are comfortable to wear.  They come in a nice protective case that includes a lens cleaner cloth.  If you like Aviator style sunglasses, these are right up your alley.  They protect my eyes from the sun and don't do any weird things to my field of vision (with some sunglasses, I get nauseous because it distorts my vision or displays rainbow like patterns viewable on car windows, etc.) .  I like these a lot but I took off a star because I prefer a more curved fit in my sunglasses. [SEP] These are typical aviator style glasses and they look and feel nicely made. comes with a nice case and a cloth. Really comfortable too.

I dnt really generally care for the white colors inside the link buts its nice. Very pretty, would recommend. [SEP] These hoops are classy and nice. They aren't heavy and I like their size, not too large but not so small that you don't notice them. I also like that they have some white on them, they stand out from other regular gold hoops.

[SEP] So cute and stylist<br />I love them<br />Didn‚Äôt realize the from was white but I love that [SEP] These earrings pretty much match the descriptions and depictions in the product details. But, i think it needs to be stressed that they have a white coating on the outer side, with gold borders, and totally gold tone on the inner side. One could easily misjudge the pictures into thinking it's the lighting causing the white aspects on the earrings. And, it is vaguely mentioned, and somewhat mysteriously described as 'white links'.  Anyway, besides the odd wording, the earrings are visually appealing.<br />Where it lacks is the backing clasp. A decent clasp would have made these earrings a more elegant and definitely higher grade. They include a gift inside the box: a rather simple corded bracelet with 'pearl' attachments. It's cute, but instead of that gift, appropriate clasps would have been wiser. My personal opinion.<br />The earrings are a nice size, not too small, nor oversized. They are visually attractive, bordering on elegant. They are versatile enough to be suitable for casual and nicer situations.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference. Provided rotation views of the earrings to give a full rendering, with close-ups of important details.<br />The earrings have a pleasant design, and are well crafted. It merits a 3.75 - 4 star rating. And a moderately high level recommendation. [SEP] These are beautiful chain earrings.

The burgundy color is disappointingly darker than I expected, and is a very dark brown - not much lighter than the black headband.  I thought they'd be lighter in color.  The quality seems okay but not great - just a thin presumably plastic frame covered with fabric and muffs.  The ear pieces are quite comfortable, with ample padding and a soft touch to the faux fur.

It has more pockets than anyone could ever use, is built very well, and looks stylish.<br /><br />A woman's purse is often about style, and this one has it done right. I got the &#34;rose&#34; color, and it looks a lot better than the product page, more of a deep pink than rose in my opinion.<br /><br />There are a number of things that stand out.<br /><br />+ Construction. The leather is thick and  strong; you can tell it is genuine. A dual set of hidden magnets keeps it closed securely, but allows for easy opening as well. Construction is single stitching, but the stitching is close together and very well done. The zippers are a darkened metal that work really well against the rose color. The shoulder strap is somewhat thin - this isn't designed for heavy weights - but ties in well to the design.<br /><br />+ Storage. You might have to call &#34;Indiana Jones&#34; to find stuff in this purse. It has a main zipper, an inner zipper inside the main flap, a large zipper on the outside flap that can hold full size sheets (folded over, of course), and an external zippered compartment. In total, six places to put stuff, in addition to six slots for credit cards, conveniently accessible once the main pouch is opened.<br /><br />+ Style. It just looks really sharp, with a triple fold when closed and those darkened metal zippers. You will look good with this one.<br /><br />There is one thing to consider when contemplating purchase. This is a &#34;business casual&#34; purse, not meant for formal or evening use. It is great for all around wear, due to the sturdy leather, and it will look good wherever you go, but it would be a bit out of place in a formal environment.<br /><br />Summary: A great general purpose purse to carry lots of stuff in style. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Please note that I received this free of charge, so I could review it. [SEP] I was looking for a way to downsize from the utility handbag I'd used for years, and this bag really solved the problem.  The size as pictured is deceptive; it holds a lot more than I'd expected!  There's no need for a wallet because of the numerous pockets and card slots, so there's room for currency, change, a cased phone, a checkbook, pen, and more.  That means I have to be careful or I'll have it weighted down as much as the utility bag was!  If I could change anything about this bag, there would be two additions:  1. I would add a zipper at the top of the card slot areas for double security and, 2. I would attach an eyeglass pocket to the outside back.  But the magnets that hold the flap in place are very strong so my concern about possibly losing credit cards has not been an issue.  I bought the deep rose-red bag and in addition to all the other positives, the color is spectacular!  It's well-made; the leather is smooth and attractive, the seams are neat and the overall quality  is outstanding.  One day I hope to have a black one! [SEP] Definitely would not call this red.  But color aside, it appears to be the perfect purse.  Unless you want fuchsia though, go with the brown or black. [SEP] Versatile is an accurate choice of word for describing this clutch.<br />This bag is great for being a clutch, shoulder bag or a wallet and is small enough to accommodate all those functions. Small may be a misleading word, however. By small I mean it's not a bulky bag but in terms of volume, it is impressively large on the inside. There are multiple pockets, both zippered and not, on the outside and inside; storing a bunch of things in this is easy and it can accommodate a lot. There is one zipper on the top of the flap that covers the inside which goes down the length of the clutch when opened. It is an enormous pocket in terms of length, depth and width. It is the entire size of the clutch. There's another, smaller zippered pocket on the backside which is about half the size of the clutch which can hold quite a bit of stuff as well. The top flap of the clutch is held down via magnets so it's not free to open without some force. They're not incredibly strong magnets but sufficient for the purpose to prevent the flap from opening easily. Once the flap is opened, there is a zippered pocket on the outside that is half the size of the clutch much like the pocket on the backside. Next to that zippered pocket is an open flap that has six individually lined slots for credit cards and/or ID cards. That flap is also the size of half the clutch so there's room for other items like cash, not just the credit cards. Next to that flap is another open flap that has six more individually lined slots for credit cards, a deep pocket, and a zipper lined interior pocket for holding those more important things. Like I said, there are many pockets to hold multiple things simultaneously. It's a lot bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside.<br />So now moving onto the build quality. This clutch is actually really well made. The leather appears and feels to be of higher grade. It is scratch resistant as the product site claims and is thicker than you might expect. It's not at all flimsy, thin, or cheap feeling. The walls are sturdy and it has some weight to it; it's not overly heavy but it's not the lightest either which, in my opinion, is indicative of its quality. The zippers, too, are all of higher quality. They open and close with ease and do so flawlessly. All the metal: the zipper, its handles, and the side clips for the shoulder strap is coated to provide a smooth and silky surface. The zippers all have nicely designed matching handles. The coating is a nice touch and add to both the appearance and function of the bag. These may seem to be minor details but they've been adequately addressed by the company so as to provide a quality product. That leads me to the lining on the inside of the bag. The entire bag and all their pockets have individually lined interiors. The lining has a silky smooth texture and a nice, attractive design. I really like the material that's been used on the inside; it looks beautiful and feels great. It's not a felt interior so things won't get caught on it. Moreover, as I said before, the pockets are individually lined as are the credit card slots so everything is compartmentalized which makes organizing everything into their spots that much easier. Lastly, the stitching is excellent. The entire bag is stitched properly and efficiently so that it doesn't fall apart after just one use. It is also the same stitching and design around the entire bag inside and out for continuity which makes its appearance that much more elegant.<br />The bag also comes with two straps. It has one shoulder strap which brings the bag down to about waist level and another strap meant for wrists if you prefer a clutch like feel. I, personally, use the wrist strap over the shoulder since this makes a truly elegant clutch. I did get the &#34;red&#34; version but it's more of a pink/red mix rather than a traditional red color. In any case, it's actually really pretty and goes great with quite a few outfits.<br />pros<br />-very versatile bag- can be used as a clutch, shoulder bag, or a wallet with no straps- in any case, it's lovely<br />-individual shoulder and wrist straps are provided<br />-really well made bag<br />-leather is of higher grade as are the zippers and its handles<br />-zipper and handles are all coated for smooth and silky texture<br />-all zippers have the same circular designed handles<br />-many many pockets: 3 exterior zippered pockets, 2 open pockets with a total of 12 individually lined credit card slots, and one interior zippered pocket<br />-flap is held down via magnets so there's no constant unbuckling as my other purse has<br />-can hold a variety and multiple items<br />-excellent stitching<br />-interior lining is silky, smooth and all the pockets are individually lined so no pocket communicates with any other including the credit card slots. Each card is separated from each other.<br />-thick leather ensures this won't fall apart easily and reinforced the high quality feel of the bag<br />-really well packaged<br /><br />This is one of the best clutches I've ever owned at this price point. Not only does it accommodate all my daily things but it can hold a lot more than I was anticipating. It's appearance can be deceiving in that respect. The interior lining is both lovely and functionally superior to other materials. The bag looks and feels great. Overall, it's not cheaply made nor does it feel that way. I love the way it was packaged, as well. It came packaged between cardboard flaps, in a microfiber like bag which was placed in a plastic bag which was then in a larger plastic container. All that packaging ensures that it arrives in flawless condition as mine did. Excellent in every way.<br />I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. The company did not compensate me and discounted merchandise does not ensure a positive review. My views and opinions are completely my own, honest and unbiased in every way.

First off: the neckline was very high and not very sexy. I cut mine down and haphazardly sewed it back together. The waistline is very itchy where the seam is sewn together. I had to wear high waisted shorts underneath. The fit is off. It was too large in the chest but a smaller size wouldn't have covered my booty. I ironed it like 3 times but it was still wrinkled. The choker kept spinning around because the velcro clasp wasn't centered properly. I just wasn't impressed at all. It worked for Halloween but I wouldn't recommend. [SEP] Very cute!

The chain is on the thin, dainty side, which I like. The bar isn't big, by any means, but it's big enough to add a touch of beauty to an outfit. It's filled with clear stones, so it sparkles when the light hits it. It's obvious the quality isn't super fancy, but it's still nice and has an elegant look to it. [SEP] Pretty necklace! I like the size of the bar and the cubic zirconia are sparkly. The chain is decent and feels strong. It gives you extra loops so you can adjust the length. Lobster clasp is strong. Overall this is a nice necklace! Comes with a pouch and box so it will make a nice gift!

In fact, I am very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The necklace is elegant and shiny, and looks well-made. It doesn't look any less beautiful than an affordable necklace like it from the jewelry stores. The curve is even and the necklace itself is dainty and pretty. The gold plating looks more valuable than its cost. The stones look like diamonds. This will be a nice gift for a young lady's birthday or graduation or on the holidays.

This necklace can easily be layered with other, more petite styles.

Smooth, glossy and a very nice saturation of color between the different stones.<br />They are fairly evenly matched in size as well, and while small, fit nicely together in the hand.<br />This set doesn't include a storage bag or box, which is fine since I already had a tray in mind for their placement.<br />Nice set. [SEP] I love these little rectangular stones. They have a wonderfully smooth polish & one of them has a gorgeous metallic sparkle. I would have rated them at 5 stars, but the product photos shows these with much more color than they actually have. For this reason I have included photos. I also included a photo of all of them in my very small Irish lass hand. I included the hand photo due to the surprising amount of reviewers who are complaining about their small size. All of this info. is presented clearly by the seller. As stated, the only thing I found off is these aren't as vibrant as pictured. Otherwise they are great.<br /><br />I collect crystals & stones in many polished shapes plus rough cut. Generally, I love them all. I have them displayed throughout my home. I ordered these to go in a decorative tray with others on my small alter. The tray has yet to be filled to my liking, so I am glad to have these to add to it. [SEP] They are cute and the perfect size, can even be used on a diy [SEP] So pretty - these Chakra Healing Stones and Crystals are all unique, and cut into approximately the same size of rectangular cubes at around 3/4"" long and 1/2"" wide, and polished to a shiny appearance and super smooth feeling.  The package contains 12 different stones and crystals of various colors and healing properties.  They are small, and perfect (whichever ones you choose) to be used as a nice companion riding in your pocket, ready to be put into action by using the touch of your fingers, by providing a nice natural calming and soothing feeling. [SEP] These are gorgeous little tumbled stone lozenges about the shape and size of an actual candy.  It's tempting to put them into your mouth!! They have bright, saturated colors and feel great in your hand.  Very visually appealing.  They aren't big (each one is about 2 cm long) but they're eye catching.  Beautiful for display or, of course, using for spiritualism. [SEP] These are pretty tiny, especially as I have other similar rocks that are larger little cubes.  You could easily carry these all around with you in a pocket at one time.  They should have included a drawstring pouch so you could easily do just that though.  They are still nice ‚Äì especially for someone who wants to maybe wire wrap these as pendants or carry around with them in a pocket.  They are finished smoothly and I could almost tell what rocks were what.  The rose quartz just looks like a cloudy regular quartz.  The amethyst I could only tell by the specific amethyst striations ‚Äì otherwise it may not look like it to others. But rocks are all different so just do not expect to receive exactly what is in the stock photos.  You will also be expecting something larger probably too.

They don‚Äôt weigh much either. It‚Äôs a nice collection. [SEP] Healing crystals are one of my favorite things to collect.  I was extremely impressed with the quality of the crystals which are genuine.  The price is more than right, and you won't find this less-expensive anywhere else!  I enjoyed this so much, I bought another set for my daughter because she fell in love with my set, and kept trying to take it.

This comes with 12 different stones that are well polished and seem to be a good quality.  They come with a small bag that can be used for carrying them.  I did not look at the exact dimensions of each stone before ordering and was surprised at how small they are.  However, that was my mistake.  The seller clearly lists and shows the size of the stones.  There are a variety of purposes listed by the seller, however, I do have an issue with two of their suggestions.  First, they state that the stones could be used as a paperweight.  If you use more than one stone, then yes they could be paperweights, but just one stone would be too light.  The same with using them as a bookend.  These are not big or heavy enough to be used as bookends.  Besides that, I really like the stones. [SEP] Smooth and not rugged/raw like other charara stones own<br /><br />Very small polished stones, about the size of a coin.<br /><br />Can be used as Mancala (game) pieces if you wish<br /><br />All are roughly the same size, but there are some variation<br /><br />Not sure about meditation and therapy purposes, but can see how it can keep you focused when concentrating on fixed objects. Or you can just rub for luck seeing the smooth texture of each stone.<br /><br />Seeing the small size wished they included draw string clinch bag so they don't get lost",3,True

Pearl Dangle Earrings Silver Earrings Classical Freshwater Cultured Pearl Earrings for Women,[],[],,4.0,31,9505,"These are supposed to go through pierced earlobes.  I thought at first, because of they way they are designed that they would kind of slide onto my earlobe but they would fall off after taking 3 steps.  I also thought that the curved posts might be too thick but they slipped through my piercings just fine.  They look nice too.  Just don't keep pushing it further through the piercing hole because the post widens as it gets closer to the pearl.  Ahhh.......the pearl.  It's very pretty and bigger than I though it would be.  The metal on the earring is very silvery shiny too.  These would be good to wear casually and to more formal events. [SEP] These earrings are quite pretty. The small freshwater pearl is set in an attractive curved silver-like base that is easy to slip into my ear piercing. It‚Äôs hard to know how the pearl is attached ‚Äî if it‚Äôs glued in (I don‚Äôt see a drill hole) I worry that the pearl may disengage at some point. These earrings work well with a t and jeans outfit or a casual dress, but aren‚Äôt dressy enough for anything too formal. Perfect for popping on for a quick trip to market. [SEP] Just as described. They look cute and would be suitable for a young teen or an adult looking for a modest earring. My ears are sensitive and these didn‚Äôt bother them at all. I‚Äôm worn them quite a bit over the last 2 months and they still stay on well, and look like new. The Pearl is attached solidly, not like some of the cheap Chinese ones offered that fall out of the setting at the first opportunity. Similar in quality to what you‚Äôd find at the mall in one of those accessory shops like Claire‚Äôs [SEP] Perfect. Love them. [SEP] Cute pearl dangling , however I worry that with no latch on the earrings, it's easy to accidentally knock it out. In addition, the prong or hook on the metal is a tad too thick and uncomfortably stretches my ear piercing. [SEP] These ""fashion"" earrings, made of cultured freshwater pearls and some unknown metal, were priced right, at least.  They did not win any accolades from my lady, as she found them uncomfortable and obviously cheaply made.<br /><br />We obtained these based on the lovely photos.  In person, though, the earrings lacked the elegance of those in the photo.  The pearls looked simulated rather than real, while the teal cardboard box and plastic wrapper did absolutely nothing to help bolster the earrings' appearance (or giftability).<br /><br />My lady found the posts unconfortably thick, and the metal that came into contact with her ears made her ears itch.  She only managed about an hour of wear before having to remove them.<br /><br />While the price was right, too much else was wrong to merit a recommendation from us! [SEP] OK, these can't be real freshwater pearls compared with pricing of the same elsewhere.  They are white orbs which do look like pearls.  They are surprisingly pretty for $5.  The earring has the fish hook loops and the set comes without backings.  I have sets of those little rubber backers that I will use.  They do look quite nice on and I have a real pearl pendant necklace that these look very nice with! I had no issues with the fish hook loops being too large for my ears - but I've had pierced ears for decades now so maybe the holes have stretched out?

These are not meant to be expensive earrings - they are about what I would find at Target or Kohl's. The setting is a bit different than standard stud earrings, which I like. The post itself is a bit wider than other earrings but don't present a problem for me. These come in a small plastic bag so you would need to find your own box if you plan on giving these as a gift.

The best part is that they are ""Dri-tech Moisture Control"" socks, which means he can wear them to work - he works in a factory and wears steel-toed shoes - and his feet are comfortable and they don't get sweaty when he's been on his feet for almost eight hours.<br />He reports that they're just a bit cushy, which helps; they stay up so he doesn't have to be pulling them back up. He really likes these socks. [SEP] Definitely moisture controlled. Doesn‚Äôt sweat or get sweaty in shoes! Mid calf doesn‚Äôt cut off circulation or become too tight and stretched. Bottom is comfortable for heels and ball of feet. [SEP] As reported by my husband, these socks do their job in a middle-of-the-road kind of way. They are somewhat thick, somewhat soft, and don't bunch at the toes. All of this was true after one wash, so I'm optimistic that these socks will last for a while. His feet don't sweat (that's him bragging), so I can't say if their advertised wicking property is effective. His one complaint is that they are a bit tight on his calf.

While checking myself out in the bathroom mirror, I thought to myself ‚ÄòI look like I am wearing a bathrobe over my work clothes.‚Äô And then the realization occurred that I didn‚Äôt have to consider this purchase a learning experience or force myself to wear it because I had it, but could use it as a bathrobe. It is super soft and has a tie in the middle, so it is perfect for that purpose. There is no noticeable difference after cold water washing. [SEP] The coat is light and long enough for chilly weather like Spring or Fall. I'm 5', 100 lbs and the coat bottom just passes below my knees. This coat is size M, it seems like S might be even fitter for me. The material is a bit rough, I'll probably have long sleeves underneath while wearing the coat.<br />The string at the waist holds it well if it gets windier outside. The coat do have pockets but it was completely sewed up, I guess if I really like pockets I can slowly cut the entrance open for the two pockets. From inside, the pockets look deep enough for fit phones or short wallet just fine. [SEP] I ordered this lightweight coat for my adult granddaughter and she absolutely loves it. It is not heavy, like a traditional trench coat, which makes it perfect for spring/autumn weather, and even the cooler summer nights. We both love the style. It is classic enough to be worn to work, but casual enough so that you can wear it everyday, too. It's a really needed addition to any wardrobe, and I am kind of shocked at the lack of higher rated reviews. Maybe it is all a matter of expectation. I love that you can machine wash it on cold and then hang it to dry. It's perfect for those days when the weather can't make up it's mind on whether to be warm or cold! We both highly recommend it!",3,True
WiliW Women's Control Top Pantyhose Black 3-Pack Silk Soft Sheer 20 Denier M,"['Polyamide,Silk,Elastane', 'Hand Wash Only']",[],,3.2,29,4268,"I was impressed with the WiliW Women's Control Top Pantyhose because they are sheer and feel very silky, I'm way past due on a mani-pedi and thought I would surely snag them as I hurriedly tried them on. It's been a long time since I tried on pantyhose, and they survived with minimal damage and no runs. I am 5'3"", 119 lbs, and typically wear a size small in bottoms. The size medium was a perfect fit, so they do run small. You'll want to size up if you are average height or carry a bit more weight. The control top was okay, but will not perform the miracles of good shapewear. I am not aware of any pantyhose that can. I consider this three-pack to be an excellent value, especially for this quality. I highly recommend these!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much üòä ** [SEP] These are nice and they have great stretch. I received the MEDIUM and I'm about a 14-16 through the middle (skinny legs!) I can get them up around my waist, but they are tight. THREE PAIRS. Good construction and materials:: 85% Polyamide 15% Elastane 20 Denier. They stay up! [SEP] So hard to find in department stores, these hose fit the bill for anyone who isnt comfortable with the bare leg look. Adds color, style, and just the right amount of compression. Fits well and washes easily. [SEP] These WiliW Sheer Pantyhose don‚Äôt seem that durable. More like the stockings you wear once or twice than throw out. Good thing there‚Äôs three in the set then. Snag very easily on almost anything and one had several random horizontal snag lines all over. The ‚Äúcontrol top‚Äù is very thin and really just a slightly thicker fabric than the legs. So if you‚Äôre looking for that type of support you won‚Äôt find it on these.<br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, 115lbs, 27‚ÄùWaist and 35‚ÄùHip, usually Small but have the Medium and they fit well.

Do not recommend. It is a fair deal for three pairs but you can find better, actual control tops, with higher quality for even cheaper. [SEP] Nice tights, good quality.<br />True to size. [SEP] Absolutely love. I read the previous reviews and sized up and that was perfect for me. I am 5‚Äô3 125lb and typically wear a S and I ordered a M and it fits amazing. [SEP] Absolutely love.

Watches for Men Ultra-Thin Minimalist Waterproof Fashion Wrist Watch for Men with Stainless Steel Mesh Band (Black),[],[],,3.7,46,34368,"I ordered this as an early Christmas gift for my partner, and I'm glad I did. It has lots of nice features, including:<br /><br />--It's ultra-thin, therefore lightweight.<br />--Stainless steel band, which gives it a more expensive look.<br />--It comes with a mini screw-driver to adjust the band.<br />--A spare battery is included.<br />--The face is easy to read, and it is luminous as well.<br />--Easy to adjust date and time.<br /><br />It also comes in a gift box. Besides those nice features, it has a nice price too.<br /><br />So my partner is really enjoying his early Christmas gift! And I think most guys will enjoy wearing this watch. :>) [SEP] I asked my husband to try out this ONTHEEDGE Minimalist Men's Watch. He first stared at the name on the dial for a while before realizing that the name was actually ""ON THE EDGE."" He immediately liked the clean styling of the watch dial. There are even number hour markers, a date calendar window, and a chapter ring that goes around the outer edge of the dial, but the dial still seems very well balanced and uncluttered. He said that the center sweeping second hand does not land squarely on each second marker as it ticks around the dial, but noted that it's rare to find that on quartz watches that are many times more expensive than this watch. The watch sets easily and keeps time well. The black mesh bracelet looks perfect against the black polished watch case. On my husband's wrist, the watch looks very handsome. This ONTHEEDGE watch is truly attractive and very affordable. What makes it worthy of 5 stars is that it also has several extras that make it truly special. It comes with a small flat head screwdriver for adjusting the watch bracelet clasp. It also comes with extra replacement batteries and a small microfiber cleaning cloth. The real surprise for my husband was that the watch actually has glow-in-the-dark luminescent paint on the hands and the hour markers. That's very impressive for a watch at this price point. All in all, my husband is very happy with this watch. [SEP] Comfortable on the wrist and easy to read face. Simple to adjust. [SEP] This is such a nice, sleek, thin, modern looking watch. I gifted this to my husband and it was a perfect design for his style. [SEP] I collect watches and my collection is of high-end, luxury watches. Still, it‚Äôs nice to have something to wear that looks good and that, if it gets broken, it‚Äôs not going to cost a fortune to repair. In fact, this watch is a toss away in the garbage if anything happens to it, it‚Äôs not worth repairing.<br /><br />The primary functions of a watch, in my opinion, is to reflect a reasonably accurate depiction of the current time (and date if included) and to look good. At this price, I do not expect to be handing it down to my children or grandchildren.<br /><br />This watch tells time just fine. It‚Äôs a typical quartz (battery-run) watch and it‚Äôs likely more accurate than a handmade, $50,000 watch. So, no problem there.<br /><br />Setting it is very easy, just pull the crown out and turn, the date changes very quickly. Pull the crown out some more, turn, and set the time. Press the crown back in, and you‚Äôre finished.<br /><br />The above steps will show you that this watch is easy to use and easy to read. What it will also tell you is that it is a typical cheap watch. When I set the time, the hands swung free, almost as if they re about to fall off. The ‚Äúcrystal‚Äù is made of glass and is likely to scratch. When holding the watch you will see that it has almost no heft or weight to it, it is made of very thin material which, to be fair, also makes for a nice thin watch that will fit under a shirt sleeve cuff.<br /><br />The bracelet is in a matching black color (not deep black) and the clasp is very thin (see photo with the watch on its side). Since the color is painted onto the clasp, it will likely scratch very quickly as will the bracelet and, likely, the bezel.<br /><br />What you have here is an accurate timepiece that is meant to look good for a while (and, in my opinion, it does) but this watch will not last long, at least, it will not look very good for long.<br /><br />It comes with a small screwdriver to help you adjust the clasp but with no instructions, ‚Ä¶  just put the screwdriver in the hole on the top of the clasp (watch face facing you), with the tip of the screwdriver pointing to the end of the bracelet. Lift up and the clasp will slide, when it‚Äôs in the position you want, just press down on the clasp again to tighten.<br /><br />The watch comes with an extra set of batteries and a nice presentation box.<br /><br />For the price, as long as you know what you‚Äôre getting, it‚Äôs a nice watch. If you plan on wearing it every day, especially if you‚Äôre tough on watches and jewelry, you might want to think twice.<br /><br />Recommended with the above caveats.<br /><br />Review of: Watches for Men Ultra-Thin Minimalist Waterproof Fashion Wrist Watch for Men with Stainless Steel Mesh Band [SEP] Sometimes you just need a practical watch for everyday classy looks. This watch fits the style and class and on the plus side its not expensive. That doesn't mean though that its cheaply built and will fall apart. From my inspection of the glass to the clips and the mechanism that's inside.<br />The watch has been functioning very well for some time now and it clearly tells the time accurately. The date is easy to read and large.<br />The band is not normal for me as I like to have the classic leather bands more but this was the stainless steel mesh which was soft of the wrist and comfortable for all-day wear.<br />I had no problem wearing the watch for over 8 hours.<br />Really for the cost and function, I can't find a reason to give it any cons. It even came with a little tool to adjust the strap length. Even the box was very nice and easily a great gift for anyone this holiday season.<br />I can't say what the battery power will be but I hope it won't die quickly as other reviewers have mentioned.<br />Looking forward to wearing this watch more often. [SEP] This watch is really nice. I seen some people in the reviews say that there's broke after a short time but my boyfriend has had zero issues with his. It came nicely packaged with no problems. It's pretty lightweight & isn't hard to tell the time like on some watches. [SEP] They look great. Slim, sleek, and practical. Super high value. One thing I don't like is that it's kind of hard to adjust the date. There are 2 clicks when you pull the crown, the first click is for the date, and it can be challenging to get it right.<br /><br />There are other similar slim minimalist watches out there on Amazon, but I like these better than the rest because the watch face is much clearer and easier to read. [SEP] Seems like an OK watch.  Keeps good time etc. But after 2 months the battery was dead.  They included spares, so I'll have to see how long the spares last. [SEP] Perfect for men, its more luxurious in person !! Definitely a special occasions type of watch! Perfect for a gift for a friend, husband or son !",3,True
FINELOVE Rose Gold Plated Round Opal Stud Earrings Hypoallergenic Ear Stud for Women,[],[],,3.8,35,2930,"The opals looked fine, but the gold-plated stud looked very cheap.  I wore them once, and my earlobes didn‚Äôt like them, which made me wonder if they really were gold-plated.  I can wear gold only - everything else infects my earlobes, so these have been put aside.  I wish the settings looked like quality, as the opals look good. [SEP] I think these are very pretty earrings. Opal doesn't sparkle like a diamond but instead you can see various colors in it. The gold colored part of the studs just shines. These earrings are clean and simple. I have small ears, so stud earrings will always be my 1st choice. Also included was a wipe to clean your earrings and little rubber backings (as well as the traditional backings). You can tell when a seller is proud of their product and want their customers to be satisfied. Bonus - seller included a really cool hair tie with faux pearls - I love it and with long hair, it really comes in handy. I think these would make a nice gift, especially if the person's birthday is in October (opal is their birthstone). [SEP] Simple looking opal stud earrings.  No complaints.  I have sensitive skin and I am happy they are comfortable to wear and do not irritate my ear lobes. [SEP] Cute simple pair of earrings. They‚Äôre a little cheap.  Good for every day use, but not really formal wear.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- rose gold is pretty. And so is the opal<br />- it‚Äôs simple, can wear it daily<br /><br />Cons:<br />- it‚Äôs cheap.  The description sets the expectation though (don‚Äôt wear while spraying hair spray or taking a shower, etc.)<br />- opal isn‚Äôt too sparkly [SEP] My girl's review: These earrings come with lightweight, hypoallergenic studs that are very comfortable. They are lead-free and nickel-free, and although the doublet opals are very small, they look great in good light. They're sparkly and change color according to the light. I think they're a good deal at the current price of $12.99.<br /><br />They're small and inexpensive enough to be suitable for young girls, and they arrive in an attractive box, so they would make a perfect gift for a birthday or other occasion. However, they don't look like kiddie jewelry and are also great for adults.<br /><br />The four prongs give these earrings a vintage look that is attractive. Five stars because of the nice look and low price. [SEP] I received the 8mm earrings. They are nicely made and attractive. The Amazon description says these earrings would be good for babies or young girls but I believe these earrings are too big in diameter for smaller ears.<br /><br />The stones on these are lab created white opals but look very real and are nicely fiery. They are set in a non-allergenic rose gold. The description on Amazon mentions 14k and 18k rose gold so I'm not sure which it is.<br /><br />They come with regular rose gold plated backing and also include soft plastic backing to cover the ends of the posts so they can't poke you. [SEP] Bonitos [SEP] For the price they were perfect. No complaints at all. Very strong made and more beautiful in person. Definitely happy with this purchase.",3,True
Basic Model V Neck Summer Dress for Women Button Up Tie Knot Sleeve Floral Dress Elastic Waist Boho Dress,"['100% Polyester', 'Button closure']",[],,3.3,10,927,"This dress is a standout! It has so many beautiful details that I absolutely love. The fabric is lightweight, silky, and has no stretch. There are buttons up the front of the dress. As a busty gal, I appreciate that there are a few more buttons than usual at the bustline. This ensures that there are no gaps between the buttons. I love this attention to detail. There are ties at the elbow sleeves. The empire waist is elasticized. The length hit me a few inches above my ankle. It makes the dress look very elegant. The overall fit was just shy of being snug on me. I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be able to button the buttons at the bust, but it worked out fine. Overall, I think this is a beautiful dress that deserves a place in your closet.<br /><br />For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the medium.<br /><br />Thanks so much for reading this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] I was very surprised by how nice this dress turned out. I usually don't like synthetic fibers, but this dress is so cute and the fabric is silky and nice that I am willing to overlook my fiber snobbery. The biggest plus about this dress is that it's very figure-flattering and can be dressed up or down. It does run small so considering ordering up a size. In conclusion, I am very pleased with this and plan to wear it many times this season. [SEP] This is a very beautiful dress, when you take it out of the package you really get to appreciate the full affect of the pattern of the flowers and the flowing style of the dress itself.  It has many details that make it special like the way the material drapes and the three quarter sleeves have a tie on the ends.  I also like the v-neck. I did find though that it was a little snug in the bust for the size.  This dress can be worn to many occasions such as the beach, to a shower or even into the office.  I wore mine to Church.  I would recommend the dress for anyone and it does have a good price and it comes in other colors. [SEP] This is a super cute floral print maxi, perfect for fall. I love the bold large flower pattern, and the 3/4 sleeves have a great tie accent. The fabric is thin and slinky. Much slinkier than I had expected but still comfortable. I wear about a size 6 and the size medium dress feels slightly large on me but still looks good worn a little looser. There is also an elastic in the back for stretch which might suit someone who wears a size 8. [SEP] This is a pretty, flirty dress perfect for summer or a party. It fits well and I like the silky feel to it. I was worried about the pattern, but it's actually quite nice and not as bold as I feared. [SEP] They sent me the wrong size but luckily I can fit into the smaller size. This dress is also very thin. It‚Äôs a cute print though.",3,True

I wear a women's 8.5 and these were too big for me. If you typically comfortably wear men's socks (women's size 10+), these should fit fine, but for anything smaller, they won't. [SEP] These aren't bad, but when I saw that they're Merino Wool I was expecting them to be a little thicker. I could be wrong but they actually appear to be mostly spandex material and on the thin side. They still seem like a decent pair of socks, and they are comfortable. They also feel fairly durable and should hold up through many hikes. Overall they're just not what I expected though.

"MISSJOY Womens Boho Lightweight Open Front Cardigan Casual Colorblock Long Sleeve Loose Knit Sweaters Cardigan (2-Black, L)",[],[],,3.0,28,7073,"These MISSJOY High Waist Yoga Pants with Pockets Soft Stretchy Active Yoga Leggings Tummy Control missed the mark.  First, the good part.  Phone pockets!  I love a yoga/legging with a phone pocket for working out so that I can go for a run or walk without having to carry my phone in my hand.  This way it doesn't slip out of my sweaty hands.  That's why this got 2 stars.  However, for everything else, I can't see myself ever realistically using these for exercise.  First of all, as a 5'10"" tall woman, these hit me at my mid-calf, so they look more like capris than a 7/8 legging, which is what the picture looks like.  These are stiff and don't really have a great stretch.  However, they aren't really great at tummy control or support.  Additionally, these are not high waisted.  I understand that I have a long torso, but most of my quality HW leggings stretch and hold to my torso.  These did not.  They sit below my belly button and do nothing for tummy control.  If I were to pull these up, they'd just slide down and give hella camel toe.  These are also not squat proof, which is a fancy term for they will be see-thru if you wore things to a yoga class or out running.  Therefore, I would say there other HW yoga/running leggings out there worth your time. [SEP] This is the second d product I‚Äôve received from MISSJOY and unfortunately, the same issue I had with the yoga/bicycle shorts is the same issue I have with these Capri yoga pants. First of all, the pants have a good stretch to them and the fabric feels comfortable. However, the brand needs to seriously consider putting a drawstring in all their shorts and pants. Wow these fit in my butt and thighs, they are terribly too big in the waste and I just have an average size waist for someone my size. Every time I wear these and been down it shows my back side! If these had a drawstring that would prevent this issue from occurring and would allow you to tighten the pants at the waist. Please consider adding a drawstring! The pants are made of 80% nylon and 20% spandex and are made in China.  See my pictures for more details. [SEP] When these Yoga Pants arrived, I was pleased that they were size Large.  Normally I wear size 14, so hoped these would fit even though they looked tiny.  I was hoping for ample stretch.  The pants material is a thick 80% Nylon and 20% Spandex.  They also have a nice feature of interesting shaped built-in pockets, so I thought, ""oh goody, these should be great"".  Well, not so!  No problem pulling them up on my legs, then......no more!  They resisted going any farther!  I managed to wrangle the pants a little way up my backside, but as soon as I let go, down they went!  I've heard of ladies having a muffin top, but apparently I have a muffin gut/butt!!!  So sad that the sizing is so off, because they obviously are very well made Yoga Pants. The stitching is well done, the crotch is reinforced, though the rise did seem rather short.  I have no idea if the Tummy Control actually works, or if they would stretch too much to show my underwear, (though they are very thick when not on).  As for bending over, or if the pants would reach up to my waist, we'll never know!  I was so hoping! [SEP] I was a little disappointed in these leggings. I was excited to get a pair that had pockets on both sides, but they‚Äôre just not comfortable enough that I will wear them a lot. The pockets are deep, and I do love that. Deep enough to hold any phone out there. They‚Äôre a nice material and length. But they are tight!  I ordered the right size, but I really had to pull to get them up. They kind of wrinkle up on the back of the thighs like something died when it‚Äôs too small. And the description says high waisted but to me these are not high waisted. I have several pair of high waisted leggings that come to my belly button, and these do not. And not only that, they ROLL. The waistband rolls every time you sit down or bend over. I really wanted to love these, but they‚Äôre just not comfortable enough. These will probably make their way to the bottom of my drawer to wear when my favorite ones are dirty. [SEP] These yoga pants are extremely soft. I was super excited about putting them on. They feel amazing against my skin. They have two extremely deep pockets that almost go down to my knee. They are a good length and I like the stitching on the side.  I liked that they were not pants length but more pedal pusher length.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fabric is a double edged sword. The soft stretchy fabric which is 80% nylon and 20% spandex does not stay up. They are very low rise. I bought the right size according to my measurements which is a large in this case. The band has no grip. There is no tummy control because the pants band will not stay up. They are completely unusable and unwearable.  I can't walk in them so moving while working out would never be possible. [SEP] I ordered these leggings in my usual size large and while I can get them on they just keep falling below my stomach. I would never be able to workout in these leggings as I can't even walk around without worrying they are showing a little too much of me. To be fair though my problem area is my stomach for sure as that's where most of my weight seems to go.  Now whether or not you could go up a size and not have the falling down issue, I really am not sure.  It's a shame because otherwise the leggings are well constructed.  The seams are good and after washing on the delicate cycle in cold water and letting them air dry, there were no further issues with construction. [SEP] I already have a multitude of leggings, but justified adding these to my stash because I wanted to try some with pockets for my phone.  I was quite excited when they finally arrived and I could try them on, but unfortunately, these are a big NO for me.<br /><br />I was afraid these might not fit because of ""foreign"" sizing, so I was pleased when these fit fine as I was pulling them up.  Then, all of a sudden my ""pull up"" just stopped.  Turns out these ""high waist"" pants are NOT high waisted at all!  The rise on these aren't even normal waisted on me.  Technically, the pants fit but they stopped so low that it gave me flashbacks of wearing low rise hip-huggers in the 90's.  Not a look I want to bring back.<br /><br />Maybe if they were normal pants, a waist that low might be okay, but for yoga?  I could barely move without flashing someone, much less bend over and stretch around.  Also, I'd be afraid to put my phone in the pockets (the ONE feature I was looking forward to!) because I'd have concerns that the weight would cause the pants to sag down further.  Perhaps I needed to size up in these - the legs fit fine though, so even if a bigger size had ended up higher on me, they might have been too baggy in other areas.  I'll probably pass this particular pair to someone smaller to see if that might help.<br /><br />For anyone who is still interested in these (maybe low-rise lovers!), going up a size or two might be beneficial.  Otherwise, I don't recommend these at all. [SEP] I wasn't expecting the Large to be as small as they were, but they were still pretty comfortable.  I like the pockets they have, as I can put my phone in them as I am walking.  The other thing I really like about these pants, is that you can't see through them.  Some pants I've purchased in the past are so see through, which is so frustrating, but that's not a problem with these.  Overall, I'm pleased with these. [SEP] I am 5'4 and weigh 170lbs and ordered the Large.  I should have ordered the XL.  These fit but as soon as I walked around my  abundant posterior made the leggings gradually slip down, lol.  I never had leggings do this before.  But whenever I sat down or walked, my leggings would do the slip and slide down my bum.  Very embarrassing to correct in public, having to pull my leggings back up.  The material feels like nice moisture wicking material and it is thin, which I like as I live in Florida, no need for thick warm leggings here.  Aside from the sizing, these are great leggings if you are not bootylicious. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:7406618ef0226d234a0de36f6a17a218]] Let's start with the pros and why I gave these leggings 3 stars. First, the stitching is amazing. I don't have to worry about any of them unraveling in the washer and i wouldn't dry this material. I would hang dry then. They have a pretty good stretch on them and they do feel very comfortable.  I also like the pockets on both sides and they fit my Samsung S10 just fine.<br />Now to the cons and why it didn't receive 5 stars. This silky soft material doesn't allow for any physical activities. Truth be told, just walking cause the leggings to slip down and I am constantly pulling them up. If I were to squat down, they would slip down.  I have a little gut and it would roll down underneath making it uncomfortable.<br /> Walking my dogs with these was torture, dogs pulling one way, leggings going south. If I were to just put them on to wear in the house, it would be fine but that's all I would do. Not recommended for anything physical.",3,True

The rose gold has a nice warm tone and doesn't look brassy at all.<br /><br />I did have two small complaints. First, I lost a crystal right off the top of the ring shortly after I got it. Second, the rose gold platoon is wearing off a little on the inside of he band. I do wear the ring everyday so it could simply be the heavy use it is subjected to. I think it would be handy if the seller provided a few spare stones withy the purchase for the sake of replacing any that go missing.<br /><br />I received a discounted sample of the product for my unbiased and honest review.

This shirt makes for a great dress or casual shirt. Also, it's not orange but a very soft pink/red. [SEP] Well made, well fitting casual chambray shirt. My husband finds it comfortable, and it looks good on him. Material is a little heavier than some but not hot because it's cotton. Launders well, and if you pull it right away from dryer and hang, it doesn't wrinkle badly. [SEP] This is a comfortably fitting shirt that allows some flexibility in ""between"" seasons--sleeves buttoned down or rolled up, it's up to you. Cotton chambray is a slightly rougher feel, but gives the fabric a little eye-interest. Loved the color, though I had to tell my spouse it was green rather than blue. [SEP] ok so this shirt is made of a nice material and its wearable even in the heat. i had my fathyer try it on for size reference and he is a large and the shirt is a large and it fits pretty well. the only complaint he had was the collar was loose  guess he prefered a closer fit but that is just a preference. this shirt has a nice color its seems like a grey with a hint of blue and it will match with many color combinations. the shirt seems like a jean material so it will look nice when paired with jeans for that jean outfit look but the top is not made of a jean like material. it is not the softest feeling but its not very rough. it still has a relaxed fit. overall he sees pleased with the shirt and the option to roll the sleeves up or leave them down. the shirt is quality and thick but still light enough to wear in the hot weather. the shirt looks exactly like what you see in the display pic. [SEP] Some small touches set this shirt apart from your usual lightweight chambray shirts. The collar is thinner than standard oxford shirts and there‚Äôs a contrasting stripe at the pocket. These work for me but might not be to everyone‚Äôs liking. Also, the sleeves have a button and tab band for rolling up. The fit is probably your average fit as opposed to a slim or husky fit.  And sleeve length works for an average person but I think anyone with longer arms might find them a bit short. I really like the orange color -  it‚Äôs a kind of light orange sherbet shade that is perfect for summer. The fabric is slightly thinner than other chambray shirts that I have, making it suitable for warmer weather and climates.  If you‚Äôre looking for a traditional button-down oxford this obviously is not it but it‚Äôs nice once in a while to have something a little different. [SEP] The reason for the .5 knock on the rating: it comes out of the wash a little wrinkly.<br />Other than that: spot on and sturdy and comfortable and attractive. It's a near match for heavier denim-esque shirts I  got from work & I can wear it when the weather is warmer in place of them. A little more money thank I would usually spend on a shirt, but it is a good purchase. Recommended. [SEP] Good shirt at sales price but color is a bit off, far lighter than in the picture",3,True

The white hat probably won't fit my daughter until she's about 10 months. They're very cute though. I will update when she's uses them outdoors. Also the white hat doesn't have much of a shape. [SEP] These sun hats are super cute and so useful! The chambray bucket hat is a nice light blue with delicate details on the trim and the white baseball cap is lace, so I love that they both look girly. Only the bucket hat has a chin strap. When I received the hats and tried them on my daughter they were a little bit too large. I washed them and put them through the dryer and they shrunk slightly so they fit her better now. She is 8 months old and average size for her age. I always make sure to have a sun hat on her when we go outside so these are very useful and cute with her outfits. [SEP] Arrived very quickly and are a great fit for our daughter!  Perfect for a summer day or a trip to the beach! [SEP] Good fabric, does not fit well [SEP] This is a very cute set for the very young ones (under a year).  They are designed with UPF sun protection.  The best part is that they come with a chin strap that the little ones get used to quickly.  No more fly-away hats.  There's a feminine bucket style hat with a ruffle plus a baseball style cap.  They're both in muted shades so they'll go with anything.",3,True

Womens Warm Cozy Cashmere Feel Winter Scarf for Women Soft Woven Cat Scarves Solid Color White,[],[],,2.9,7,6978,"I'm really torn about this product. If you're expecting a women's size scarf you'll be sadly disappointed. It's very small, the size that would fit a young child. It is soft, however, and very cute. If you purchase this scarf knowing that you're getting a child's scarf, I think it's a good buy.  But because of the way it's advertised, I'm docking two stars to what should be a five star child's product. [SEP] I rated this scarf 1 star because I believe it failed meeting specifications under which it was marketed. For instance, the advertised length of the scarf is 71 inches. However, as you can see in the picture attached, it measures 30 inches from pom-pom to ears. Also, there‚Äôs no fringe, and, because of the cropped length, it cannot be wrapped around your neck more than once. I also believe it lacked anything similar to a ‚Äúluxurious cashmere feel.‚Äú While I believe the stitched cat face is cute, the rest of the design lacks follow through. [SEP] This bunny scarf is cute, but very small. I like the concept and think the idea is adorable. However, I would have preferred if the scarf was a little longer. It feels a bit claustrophobic when worn, because it is so short. It's constructed well and for the right person, could be a winter staple. [SEP] This Jeff & Aimy Warm Luxurious Cashmere Feel Winter Scarf for Women is okay. It is soft and warm, but, doesn't seem quite long enough to work as an effected scarf. [SEP] This cat scarf is cute, but I thought it looked child-sized when I first saw it. It took awhile to figure out that the ribbed section above the cat head is a two-sided tube. The ball goes through the ribbed tube to secure the scarf. When worn this way, it does fit an adult snugly. The problem I have is that there is a defect on mine; one end of the ribbed tube is stitched closed with the tag. I will have to remove the tag so the tube is open.",3,True

However, these sunglasses have held up very nicely.  They're easy to clean and very sturdy (they've been handled by a five-year-old and ""lost"" in an oversized bag and still stayed together nicely).  I was also happy to see they arrived in a box, not a pouch.  I'd ordered another pair of glasses in the past and they showed up in a flimsy pouch inside a lightly padded envelope. [SEP] Ordered these for my hubby but when they came my 14 yr old saw them & that was that. He wore them every day for about a week, put them in a softer-sided case, took them in the car & when we got where we were going he took them out to wear them & said they were broken. Not sure what happened to them but unless they were stepped on they should have held up longer than a week. [SEP] These mirrored aviator glasses are sturdy, well made, and attractive. They come in a soft, protective case. These will be perfect to wear with my police officer costume. They are lightweight and fit comfortably. These are ideal for everyday wear too. [SEP] I really like the color of the lenses, the look aviators are very nice, but they really don‚Äôt look good quality. They fit ok, but the lenses are a bit too big that once you put them on, it hits right by your under eyes almost cheek area. I have a lot of sunglasses and eyeglasses and none hit on my skin like this one does. It‚Äôs a bit uncomfortable at I think it shouldn‚Äôt rest on your cheeks even with the grips it has to stay on your nose. Little recommend to buy! [SEP] Looks good - like a movie star - depending on your face shape of course. I like the blue color. It comes with a metal picture that you can barely see a white fish if you look really hard - but put the glasses on and you can see it immediately like it was black lines - like a magic trick - really impressed my daughter. [SEP] Unlike some other aviator glasses, these have a very blue metalic reflection on them.  The size and shape are just about right and they feel comfortable to wear even after a long time.  There's no very visible distortion from the lenses and that's also important as it doesn't affect ones vision.  Lightweight with thin ear pieces is good as they will easily fit under your headset.  Pretty good glasses in my opinion. [SEP] I ordered these SKYWAY Classic Aviator Sunglasses as a gift for my husband. These glasses are oversize and can be worn over his glasses.  The TAC Polarized Lens‚ÄìUV400 Protection Coating block 100% of harmful UVA & UVB rays. Visually restores true color, eliminates reflected or scattered light. TAC polarized lenses are impact and scratch resistant, lightweight and durable [per the Amazon page]  . The lenses are blue and mirrored; so that you can look around without anyone knowing where you are looking.  The glasses have a lightweight metal frame. These are good sunglasses that are reasonably priced. He likes to wear them while he does yard work. [SEP] My wife loved the look of the sunglasses but they were made way too big. The glasses just fall off of her face, perhaps her nose is too little. These may better for someone with a larger face. Aviators are a tough fit for a lot of people. [SEP] I like these sunglasses. I think the mirrored blue lens looks cool.  They're a little on the cheap side, but then again, they're only $15. So I wasn't expecting much.  They are polarized, and come with a little cardboard thing showing you can only see the fish with the sunglasses on to prove it.  And they're pretty light weight (hence my cheap side comment), and come with a cheap carrying case.  My wife doesn't really like the sunglasses on me, but that's probably because I've never worn aviators before, so she'll just have to get used to it! ;-) [SEP] I've been wearing this blue mirrored sunglasses to the exclusion of all my other pairs since the day they arrived.  I absolutely love them. They're 100% polarized and they keep my very sun-sensitive eyes happier than my other airs. Plus, they look great.<br /><br />These are aviator glasses and will look good on men or women. They are lightweight but not flimsy and the mirrored coating has been taking a beating for a month with nary a scratch to show for all my abuses. I would buy these again.",3,True

Orchid Row Women's Fashion and Trendy Faux Fur Neckwear Neckwear Scarf Shawl Premium Quality Fur,[],[],,3.6,16,84241,"As far as the material, it's really soft and cuddly like kitten fur. It's not long enough to be a scarf and not short enough to be a neck muffler.  All I could really do was put it around my neck. I suppose it will be fine under a coat or jacket like that.<br />I'm also not sure about the word ""wanted"". It seemed cool when I ordered it but I showed it to several people who had jokes.  But, it's easy enough to fold it so that the word doesn't show but then, what would be the point?<br />Otherwise it is well sewn. I would maybe recommend this for a teenager. I'm keeping this one for myself though because it really does feel nice. [SEP] Orchid Row's faux fur neckwear is very fashionable and that's pretty much where it's functionality ends. It's great as an accessory and doesn't offer much more in any other way. I don't much appreciate the WANTED detail on it. Not only it doesn't add much to the design, it even takes a great deal from it. Not something I would really wear out to either work or much else. [SEP] I will definitely be wearing this during winter time. It is definitely a fashion statement, bigger than expected, and great material. Although I liked the text size and material I did not like how easily the faux fur transferred to my shirt. Perhaps the materials together conflict. Either way it is a lovely fashion statement piece! [SEP] This is an awesome faux fur neckwear.  While most of us use ordinary scarves of all material from cotton to silk. This is completely different and very statement-making. It's a large thick faux fur kind of scarf that's unique in style & design.  It's incredibly comfy, fashionable & versatile.  This scarf will go with all kinds of outfits. I'd probably mainly use it in colder temperatures though.  Material appears durable.  I love this scarf and highly recommend it. [SEP] I very much liked the warmth and length of this scarf (it's as long as a non-fur version). There were just a couple of things that made me take that last star away: it's a little scratchy and when I got hot, it was extremely uncomfortable to have it touching me and the writing on it is kind of stark and better off worn by the young women in the house. [SEP] My granddaughter loves this scarf.  She claimed it as soon as it arrived.<br />She likes the ""WANTED"" graphic on the scarf and says it is ideal for cold, windy weather.<br />It goes with any color.<br />It is very well made of quality materials. [SEP] Scarf is really cute. It‚Äôs soft, stylish, and keeps me warm. I like how long and wide it is. It covers my neck and the front of my body-perfect for winter! [SEP] WHEN this was used in colder weather, it was seen as being a fun item that provided warmth, a  level of cuddliness and style.  It has been put aside so the family can argue about who gets to wear it first when it is cold again.  a family favorite",3,True

Overall it has a nice design but you should order at least 1 size up. My only complaint is that it's not completely accurate to King's uniform in the show. The buttons on the back should have x's like on the front and there are solid black lines that should be fold-like patterns as shown in the show. Also, it's just a little too baggy for my taste but it doesn't ruin the overall product. Those are just personal nitpicks but other than that I highly recommend if you're a fan of the Seven Deadly Sins. [SEP] I guess for the money you pay it's ok.

The toggle makes it far easier to put on than the traditional clasp, and it looks rather expensive.  This is a great addition to any mans wardrobe, be it at the office or at the club later in the evening.  I am very satisfied with this piece of jewelry-I'm certain that you will be satisfied with it as well! [SEP] This Tribal Hollywood quarterdeck men's leather wrap bracelet is nice. The use of leather and stainless steel for the metal findings should make this bracelet durable. I'm a jewelry designer myself, but I only occasionally make men's. My husband seldom wears jewelry, but I'll make jewelry for my son. Which I chose this bracelet for my son. I had a little difficulty getting it on through the loops. I like that it has 4 strands and the styling is fashion forward at the present time. I really like it! [SEP] This bracelet looks great. The quality justifies the price and the look is next level. I get a lot of comments on this one. Highly recommended. [SEP] ....the clasp is just not the greatest.  I've been a fan of Tribal Hollywood for a while and I do reckon they make some great accessories.  This is another stylish good looking accessory of theirs, but wow, this clasp system is their worst yet.  It's a simple T shaped bar that fits through the leather loops.  Already today it's come off my arms 4 times already.  There is a small metal hoop you can move up the leather to help secure the T bar a little more but eventually it will move down.  So good looking sure, but just not very secure, do not develop a personal attachment to this. [SEP] This is a decent bracelet, it's even attractive and unobtrusive enough to wear it in a professional setting. My husband thought it would look nice to wear to work but it was so tight there was no hope of that.  It cannot be adjusted. Other than the fact he can't wear it he was pleased with how it looked and really wanted to enjoy it. [SEP] My husband really likes bracelets - well, bracelets and watches. So, I am always on the lookout for interesting new bracelets for him to enjoy. Because he's a little rough on stuff, bracelets don't last too long. He actually had a similar style leather bracelet that we got about six months ago, and we had to superglue it back together - so I am hoping the metal clasp on this one is sturdier. The three bands means that it is more breathable on his skin and as warmer weather approaches, I think that this will be a favorite. The brown leather is nicely braided and he was pretty enthusiastic about it when he opened it. It makes a great gift, and has a nice velvety bag with a drawstring enclosure that is included. My husband has a larger wrist size, and this fits him snugly, but not too snugly, so I would say that it definitely runs to the larger side. [SEP] Nice bracelet. Looks great.",3,True

I would say the band is a little thinner than I like (it's about 1.25-1.5"" - I prefer a 2-3"" waist band). These are not leggings that hold your tummy in the way some leggings do. The material on these leggings is definitely a polyester and is rather giving instead of providing a tighter and supportive feel. I am not a huge fan of the pattern on the bottom, especially with the text ""ZOANO"" and ""MORE THAN SPORTS."" It's just not my style. I do like the other patterning. If you have bigger calves, like I do, the pattern is printed onto the material so it spreads and shows the white grooves when on my calves and distorts the pattern some. These are okay and I will wear them, but they will not be my go-to, nor will I look to purchase more. [SEP] These yoga pants have a nice, firm feel to them, with some compression from the fabric.  I like that rather than them being too stretchy.  They are comfortable and they stay where they are supposed to.  What I don't like so much is the print on the blue part.  I thought it was just a generic blue design and didn't realize how much the letters stood out.  I'd much prefer just a generic blue design.

[SEP] Very nice pants!<br />My 13 year old daughter loves these. She rides horses and thusly has pretty strong, muscle-y legs. Most pants in her size fit her well through the legs and seat, but are a little loose around the waist. The elastic waist on these helps with that. [SEP] These pants are on the thin side.  The colorful part, while it looks cool, it seems to stretch and turn white, making it appear cheap.  The band at the top is not thick/wide like I prefer though it does seem to stay up well.

Aside from that, it is simply built and uses color blocking for an interesting look.<br />The velvet band is full removable, so you can always switch it with something else if you like, but you definitely have to use something because it hides some very visible stitching.<br /><br />The style is really neat and makes a statement, so if you like the photo, you‚Äôll definitely like the hat!

Very attractive when slanted slightly to the side and a little over one eye.  The hat is a little loose on my head, but that is easily fixed with some Velcro, to help hold it on in the wind.  The dark blue top and band are almost black against the royal blue brim.  This will look great with jeans or casual pants.<br /><br />By the way, the web page says this is a ‚ÄúWranger‚Äù hat.  What the heck is that? [SEP] The recipient of this hat said it's her new favorite dress hat. Stylish, fits well, doesn't get overly warm, doesn't leave marks on her forehead, and isn't obnoxious. The two colors work well together and with most outfit choices. This hat is a winner! [SEP] This is a cute hat that is also classy and fun to wear. It is made of a thick, stiff felt brim with a softer felt top. There is a velvet trim bow that is not attached, which makes it easy to adjust how/where you want to wear the bow. You can also change this velvet band out for other bands of your choice to add some color or to match a particular outfit. I like the versatility of this hat. It's a decent quality and affordable hat that makes it easy to add some personality to your wardrobe.

I can say with all honesty, the top part is not bad. The ribbon is nice. I've seen many vintage hats with this color combo/velvet thing going on, but the brim...the brim ruins it all. It looks like a Halloween costume. Like cheap felt. I am not a fan of the brim. I think I shall decorate this hat and make it a fourth of July hat, anything to hide the brim. It's a little big, but really that's to be expected. I'm a 21 and I believe this fits like a 22. The brim is somewhat floppy while the top has a fedora style, so points for being interesting [SEP] I love this hat!

I'll probably have to stitch it to the hat.<br /><br />The ""one size fits most"" is not accurate in my case; I will have to put some Velcro into it in order for it to fit properly.<br /><br />It is good-looking and, I suppose that, at the price, it's a reasonable value.<br /><br />I'll wear it until it falls apart and then I'll just discard it.<br /><br />I can't say that I'll miss it when it does ""go.""<br /><br />All in all, a disappointment, especially in view of the fact that most other Amazon products we have ordered previously have been of excellent quality and great values.<br /><br />Too bad ...

They are not so tight that it feels as if the life is being sucked out of you like some compression socks, instead, they are comfortable, and makes my feet and legs feel great, during and after wearing them [SEP] Be very careful these socks are very slick on the bottoms. I ended up falling down a flight of stairs. I am going back to Dr. MOTION. Alittle more expensive ,but the bottoms are not slick . [SEP] Compression, comfort and appearance are all important  as well as price  . [SEP] Love the way they fit. They dont slide down or make my feet smelly. Great profuct! [SEP] Great value use them for work since I'm on my feet all day good compression and nice and long . They go all the way up to knee doesn't cut into middle of calf if you have muscular calves super comfy. [SEP] Helping me with sciatic leg pains and support due to back injury. Great seller that offers quality products. I am thankful as these are working for my need. Colors are palatable for everyday wear. [SEP] Very well made [SEP] I don't wear socks normally, but due to an upcoming surgery, I will have to wear compression socks for awhile. I bought these socks early so I could ge use to wearing them before my surgery. These socks are not too tight, yet offer just the right amount of compression and comfortable enough I don't mind wearing them. They also don't look too bad under my Birkenstocks, the only shoes I wear, as I don't like shoes much either. This had worked well when living in California, but not so well now that we are living in Minnesota.<br /><br />Update: I‚Äôve had my surgery and now  wearing my compression socks to reduce the swelling. I‚Äôve now had  all three medical professionals that have helped me put on my socks, comment on the quality of theses socks. They‚Äôve said they haven‚Äôt seen socks as nice as these. If I could, I change my star rating to a six stars. Kudos. [SEP] These socks are fine, but there is zero compression.",3,True

I liked giving her a nice pair that is polarized and has eye protection from the sun‚Äôs rays. They are lightweight and sturdy and look good on. [SEP] These are great for driving. I hate driving into the sun, because I run on the short side for the sun visor to do much good, so I need good sunglasses. These are ideal for that. I love the clarity of polarized glasses, and these deliver on that front. These outperform some of the more expensive glasses I've had. [SEP] These sunglasses offer stylish protection with the black and white/clear design. Cool casual sunglasses. Note: doesn‚Äôt include case / bag has no structure, so they don‚Äôt protect the glasses from things other than minor scratches. [SEP] These sunglasses fit a little bit larger. They can fit a larger head as they have a  bit of room for stretch in the plastic and the hinges. The sunglasses are plastic and a very lightweight plastic at that. They are barely noticeable on the face. The rims are thinner and size and the lens portion does offer as nice coverage for the eyes. The lenses are fairly dark and do a nice job of filtering sun. The sunglasses are of average quality. I do like the black rims as they match most outfits. The sunglasses also come in a soft pouch for storage. Overall is Lott feels average. Given the quality they seem overpriced. [SEP] These sunglasses are like those filters that you can get for your camera that increase the contrast between the clouds vs the sky so that the clouds look more beautiful and the sky is more blue. They do a very good job of taking the glare off. Driving by a very long bright white sidewalk with lots of reflection, these sunglasses clearly make that more comfortable on the eyes.<br /><br />I‚Äôm not a big fan of the square shape of the lenses but that‚Äôs not the fault of the glasses. The earpieces have a zebra pattern on them and the word ‚Äúsunglasses‚Äù is printed on them which I am also not a fan of.<br /><br />The best thing about these glasses are the way the lenses make everything look as you see through them. Soothing. A lot of sunglasses actually make me feel nauseous because they have a slight distortion to them. That does not happen with these sunglasses.<br /><br />These sunglasses do not have the nosepieces attached with wires‚Äî the plastic rests right on the bridge of your nose. That makes them hotter to wear in the summer weather. I prefer a little space between the glasses and my face for the air to circulate through.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with these glasses‚Äîespecially the lenses.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be. I hope that my review helped you! [SEP] These sunglasses sit comfortably on my face. They aren‚Äôt heavy. They come with a storage bag, and even a warranty.  I love the look of them. There is only one thing I‚Äôm not crazy about, the word sunglasses being on my sunglasses. [SEP] These polarized sunglasses are strong but lightweight. Everything is easier to see. The polarized vision is really cool.These are a great price‚Ä¶one cannot go wrong with these. [SEP] Polarization is a little uneven, which is normal for most brands without a big O on the side, but I figure I'd start with my lowest gripe 1st. The lenses aren't very dark at all, so much so that at the bottom it feels more like you aren't blocking any sun at all, which is really confusing on the eyes. The frame is clear, which is not smart at all because the manufacturer and country of origin is written in white on the inside, allowing it to show through backwards. That white inside paint flakes off leaving bits on the side of your face. The frames are not shatterproof at all and will break if you sit on them, it's the lenses that are shatterproof. Unisex is maybe... but they sure don't look good on men, so take that as you will. Lastly, who writes ""sunglasses"" on the side of sunglasses? It's like writing ""car"" on the side of your car. At least the chrome trim on the side is shiny I guess and they aren't uncomfortable. If you got these for next to nothing in price you'd probably chuck them in your beach bag and care little about damaging them or getting them covered in sunscreen, which is a nice thing compared to expensive brand-name shades, so +1.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please click so below. Thanks :) [SEP] Full Plastic frame with cool looking mirrored lenses. UV Protection coating and polarized lenses, the perfect choice when swimming in our pool in the backyard.<br /><br />Very lightweight and shatterproof; even the lenses are shatter resistant.<br /><br />Best idea for the Florida sun, helps protect my eyes! [SEP] Cute design and comfortable fit. I got these as sunglasses to keep in my husband's car because I always forget to grab the pair out of mine when we go places. They fit nicely and do a good job of keeping the sun out of my eyes. They come with a cloth drawstring type carrying bag.",3,True

They are well made but the sliding ball can come off if you extend it too wide. I've had the ball come off a couple of them and you'll never get the strings back in rendering it basically unwearable. Overall, these make great gifts for you or anyone else and I highly recommend them. [SEP] These make for a great gift and are perfectly packaged...  what I love most is that it has a secret message that only you know about... It would work for a male or female of any age. I have been wearing it for over a month now and have not experienced discoloration. I wear it while I sleep, shower, and wash my hands.... I think this would be awesome to give your sisters right when you found out that you were expecting as a surprise... ""Guess what?"" gift that only you and your sisters will know about.

It‚Äôs really cute and I am super proud to wear it because I love my nephew so much. The string is a little thin but it‚Äôs petite so I love it.

The packaging is also wonderful- the bracelet came in perfect condition in a sparkly box with everything wrapped nicely. This is a perfect holiday or birthday gift for your favorite Aunt! [SEP] Pretty, and delicate. With such a short word, there are not many beads on the string.<br />The dots are round gold beads, the dashes are cylindrical black beads. There is a knot at each end of the word, so the beads stay with each other.<br />The bracelet comes in a nice, sparkly box. [SEP] So cute!  These bracelets go with everything!

They come in a cute gift box that is literally ready to be given to your loved one.  Beautiful item and unique idea. [SEP] Ldurian Aunt morse code bracelet.  Great 14k gold plated bead bracelet.  The black silk cord is nice and easy to put on and take off. I like all the different sayings they have for these bracelets.  The idea is so unique and neat. I have several of these bracelets and someone is always commenting on how neat they are. Great quality unique gift for someone or for yourself.  The bracelet is well made. [SEP] I really like these bracelets. The black string bracelet is very thin. There is a bead that secures pushes up securing the bracelet. It is not a good mechanism as it comes loose pretty often. I have found the bracelet on the floor after taking off my jacket. It gets caught in my jacket easily and the clasp is not strong enough to secure it. So, be careful and mindful.<br /><br />I love the fact that the message is in Morse code and therefore not a whole lot of people will know what it says. It makes for a great gift. The beads are gold plated in 14k gold.<br /><br />The bracelet comes in a ready to gift box.<br /><br />I think any aunt would love this (I do), especially a new one.

The pendant itself is shinny but the stones are small enough that is hard to definitely say they are diamonds. Nonetheless the shine appears to be the real deal.<br />The main negative I have is the box it comes on. The box is intended for the kind of bracelet that you open up, which is too long for this kind and aesthetically makes this one look even smaller than what it is. When gifting it, this is not a good thing...  Also, while the rings appear to be two pieces interlocked, this is a one piece deal.

"Ldurian Layered Necklace, Set of 2, Choker Chain with Disc Y Bar Pendant, Layering Drop Lariat For Women, Dainty Minimalist Jewelry (14K Gold Plated)",[],[],,4.3,63,581,"There are two delicate necklaces in this set. The circular studded one has a 16"" choker length chain that is adjustable to four lengths. However, I doubt anyone is skinny enough to be able to use all those adjustments. I had to use it on the longest length.  The long bar has a 20"" chain but extends an additional 4.5"" with the extra piece hanging at the end. This chain is adjustable to five lengths.  Both necklaces can be worn at once or separately. The long bar looks great on a solid colored turtleneck. The small necklace looks great just on a bare neck with almost any blouse as it sits right at the throat.<br /><br />I think the current price of $19.99 is competitive for this. Be aware that the chains are thin and are easily knotted. Care has to be taken when storing and wearing. This is definitely a very attractive but delicate adjustable necklace set. [SEP] To me the Ldriance CZ & bar is a hit. You get two trendy necklaces (complementary designs) for the price of one. One is a bar and the other is a circle. They can be worn together or separately. They are dainty and very feminine. They are 14kt gold plated pieces, and I did not notice any irritation to my skin. These necklaces are nickel free and hypoallergenic. They can be worn casually or dressy. They are super cute, fun and reasonably priced.  I‚Äôd recommend these for yourself or someone else. [SEP] Two unique designs that look intriguing together -- a circle and a line. They're a lovely 14k gold plated set with one longer chain and one shorter chain for layering. The straight one is sleek and the round one is textured with sparkles. I love these! [SEP] Gorgeous just omg its beautiful [SEP] This layered necklace would be ideal for someone with a dainty, slim neck.  I can usually wear a 16‚Äù chain comfortably; however the jeweled necklace felt like a choker even though I adjusted it as much as I could. The longer necklace was very simple to adjust with just a tug on the chain. By midday, the two got tangled together and became uncomfortable (see picture). I was bummed because at work, I received compliments on what a pretty necklace it was. [SEP] THES TWO NECKLACES ARE REALLY DAINTY AND PRETTY.  LOOK LIKE GOLD.....VERSATILE [SEP] Really pretty necklace! It is very subtle but really flattering on the neck! I usually react weird to cheap necklaces but for some reason this one causes me no problems. A really good gift idea too, more expensive looking than it is!!!! [SEP] Very cute necklaces. They are dainty and they go with every outfit. The necklaces are not linked together. They are two separate necklaces! And can be worn together layered or individually. The set is beautiful and i would definitely recommend it ! [SEP] This is a pretty necklace and seems well made, but it is just too short for me.  I think this is more for a teenager. [SEP] This set of two necklaces is absolutely gorgeous! Generally, gold is not my favorite color, and I normally prefer silver or even black gold, but this is a pleasant surprise! The chains are delicate and shimmery, without kinks and twists. The CZ diamond pendent glistens under the light, and has a very expensive look. The gold bar is slim and hangs beautifully from the necklace, and the position of the hanging is adjustable from the necklace itself. Again, they're absolutely gorgeous. They will go well with both formal and casual fashion. Highly recommended!",3,True

I tend to get over-sized glasses because I hate that ""edge"" fuzziness when the glasses are smaller and your eyes can focus through the glass as well as beyond the edge of the glasses.  It bothers me, so the easiest thing is to get big eye frames.  These are just that!  The pink-rose color is very soothing as well.  They come with a case - the kind that you squeeze open and drop them in - easy to put away.  Nice sunglasses! [SEP] Really cute sunglasses. They're lightweight, comfortable, and come with a nice case. They don't block the sun as well as say a pair with black lenses which is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5, but they still do block some, they're more for looks than sun protection. [SEP] These glasses are pretty fun, I have to admit! My kids love me to wear them lol! The only downfalls to me are that the nose pieces get caught in my hair when I put them on my head so I have to put them in my purse when we go in anywhere or I don't want them on for whatever reason. Might not be a big deal to everyone! And they come with a cute leather case for easy storage! [SEP] These glasses have pink lenses that are oversized. I love how cute and stylish these are. The frame feels thin and delicate. [SEP] These remind me of Elton John glasses. They are big, flirty, eccentric and fun. I am not cool enough to pull them off on a daily basis, but like them for dress up or Halloween. [SEP] Wow these are almost bigger than my face.<br />The color is cute. And of course they are lightweight and feels like plastic, but we‚Äôre not expecting luxury here at this price range.<br />They‚Äôre fun sunglasses you can throw on and throw around and not worry about them.<br />I have high cheek bones and medium small face so they were not flattering on me at all.",3,True

So I was in search of some smaller options to wear that wouldn't get caught up in the band. These are sweet little earrings with definite sparkle. They are quite comfortable to wear, lightweight and easy. I like how they came with two styles of earring backs to choose from, plastic and metal (I chose the rubbery plastic ones). The ""rose gold"" metal tone is very bright, and not very realistic looking, just so you know; it's almost coppery, but you don't really notice it once they are on, since you basically just see the shiny stones from front view. I just didn't know what to wear in my second earring holes to go with them because the different metals seemed to look strange together. I still like them quite a bit. Also, the gifted hair band was nice, but I thought it was odd that they included a wet wipe. [SEP] I really like rose gold, and I like this more modern squared off hoop.  These ratings are very easy to put on and super cute.  They look very realistic and classy. [SEP] These would make for a nice gift for a young girl or to fancy up an outfit. Pretty nice quality. [SEP] These ear rings are tiny.  They are so tiny they are difficult for me to put in.  Plus, they look a little strange on me.  They look much better on my tween daughter.  The rose gold color looks odd to me - almost coppery.  Fortunately, my tween does like them.<br /><br />They come in a nice box making them giftable with a bonus rope bracelet. [SEP] These are super cute! The rose gold is super shiny and it's 14K so it wont make your ears green. The CZs all match in size and sparkle well. Superb quality for the price! Very happy with these! They came with a free pearl ended hair tie too, so you can put your hair back and show off your beautiful new earrings! [SEP] Peso ligero. [SEP] Lovely dainty earrings, zirconia are very sparkling.<br />Stud is standard size, not too thick or thin. So it should fit most people without any problem. I have small ear holes, so this is one of my biggest complains with some earrings.<br />Color is true rose gold. Finally able to match with a rose gold necklace I got a few weeks ago!<br />Came with a not-so-nice jewelry box and a hair tie (or maybe a bracelet? Not sure about that). [SEP] These earrings do appear as depicted. They are about 1/2 an inch long, and the rhinestones sparkle against the copper-ish color to give them a lovely appearance.<br /><br />They came in a simple box, which held a thin layer of dark foam in the bottom. The earrings, however, were not connected to this layer and lay free. The front of the box was also smudged with black spots.  I'm hoping this was a review packaging because it definitely gives a cheap impression. There was also a 'free' bracelet/hair-tie thingy included as well as a wet-wipe.<br /><br />While one earring was in good condition, the other was bent halfway down the stub at about a 10-15% angle (damaged before packaging), which is not only disappointing but makes it difficult to slide the backing on. Again, this gave a very cheap impression and ruined any joy I might have had with them. The pair comes with two backings‚Äîone matching the earrings, the other the usual clear rubber. They fit snug (ignoring the damaged one) and will keep the earrings from accidentally falling off during wear. They are cute, but simply aren't in good condition. [SEP] I love the daintiness of these rose gold bar hoops! They fit nicely in the ears and I did not feel any irritation while wearing them. The diamonds make these sparkle so much! I like that these of more of a bar earring look when looked at straight on. Such a super cute set of rose gold hoops!",3,True
Hissox Men's Women's Fun Novelty Patterned Casual Crew Socks White with Grey 1 Pair,[],[],,4.0,13,11145,"These are a real good quality sock.  The pattern is woven right into the sock and is very cute.  My granddaughter saw these and BEGGED me to let her try them out.  They were a little big on her (12 yrs old) but she wore them around the  house all day and refuses to take them off.  Guess she is keeping them.  I did try them on and they fit comfortably and were surprisingly supportive.  She says they did not fall down or twist funny and she says there are no weird seams or bunches inside the sock.  This are a winner [SEP] I requested these socks for my stepdaughter, who has two dogs that look virtually identical to the picture portrayed on the socks.  These are not the highest quality socks; as others have noted, there's no dedicated heel.  But the material is soft, and unlike other patterned socks I've had, they're smooth and comfortable on the inside.<br /><br />I think they would make a nice novelty gift or stocking stuffer.  They are shipped in a pretty silver mesh bag with a ribbon closure, which adds a little class.<br /><br />My only criticism is that they are described as ""unisex"" in size and being appropriate for men and women.  I seriously doubt many men could wear these.  As you can see from the attached photo, they're basically an ankle sock on me (a woman who wears size 8.5 shoes). [SEP] The pattern on these is adorable but the socks have no heel and they're very small. They can stretch a lot to fit larger feet but the stitches stretch apart as well and then the socks become see-through and lose softness, while the pattern distorts. Without stretching, the socks look exactly the size of kids' socks.<br /><br />These socks are made of printed polyester, not a cotton blend with knitted-in designs like most novelty socks. [SEP] These dog socks from Hissox made a lovely gift for a dog-loving female friend.  Despite being advertised as unisex, the sizing, packaging (a lavender bag tied with ribbon), and the delicate design of the socks indicated these were aimed at females.<br /><br />The material felt quite thin, and my friend who received them felt the socks were ""warm weather only.""  Fortunately, the material comprising the socks held up well despite being thin.  In addition, these novelty socks did not have the loud colors and outlandish patterns usually associated with such socks, making them more versatile with different outfits.<br /><br />I recommend these socks to ladies who love dogs! [SEP] These are cute and would make a cool gift for a dog lover. But there is no way they are ever going to fit on a standard male's foot because my size 10 tootsies give them a run for their money. [SEP] Unisex Animal Pattern Breathable Novelty Printed Crew socks.  Created for ladies who love their pets!  Very comfy, cute socks!<br /><br />They are very stylish,  made of polyester and elastane. Easy to wash and wear!  They are lightweight, versatile and sweat wicking! Very comfortable for all-day wear. One size fits all.<br /><br />One size fits all?

Filgate Leather Glasses Case Handmade Personalized Sleeve Glasses Pouch Black,[],[],,4.2,15,3434,"When it comes to cases for glasses, my husband has a tendency to break or ruin them.  Let's see how this measures up.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This case is made from bonded leather- that means leather that is blended into fibers with a plastic sort of binder that makes it stay flexible, yet strong.  It is sewn up the sides leaving the top open for glasses.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This fits both reading glasses and sunglasses that are not oversized.  They stay in the case without slipping out easily, yet the case is tough enough to protect them.  It is strong enough to survive my husband so far.  He tends to be rough on things like this.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For reading glasses, eye glasses, and sunglasses that are not oversized, this case is tough and will protect glasses well.  It is moisture resistant, protective and thick enough to protect glasses from average use.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />Five stars- if it can last for my husband it is impressive so far. [SEP] This is a basic, leather glasses case. I am using it to keep sunglasses in for the car to keep them from being scratched, and the case is perfect for that. It's very soft and flexible, so I don't think it would protect your glasses from being crushed but it's better than having no case at all for sunglasses in your car or reading glasses kept on a nightstand or end table. [SEP] Rather stiff leather product. Glasses fit nicely in the case that is not lined. There is a pressed logo on the front of the case. Personally I prefer a soft leather case, it takes up less room but this is good for an environment where the glasses are knocked around, perhaps a briefcase or luggage. [SEP] Will fit large standard flat reading glasses, but won't fit glasses with curved frames and/or lenses like sporty sunglasses.<br /><br />Material is of high quality leather, interior will not scratch the lenses. Has a very classy look to it<br /><br />Leather may scratch and leave line indentation with most blunt objects (like keys or capped pen tips) if pressed on hard enough at exterior. Even so, will leave a nice rugged look to it, yet thick enough that it won't penetrate through to the glasses itself<br /><br />Have a minimalist slip in-and-out design<br /><br />Has a large opening for easy access, but it opens itself to external objects like lint, dust and small trinkets from getting in especially if you toss it in a crowded drawer or compartmentalized bag or box.<br /><br />Stitching is really good, no loose treads<br /><br />Overall, I like the minimalist design and material used. Just keep note if you own glasses that houses curved frames/lenses as it most likely not fit [SEP] Simple design, leather outside and an inner material. Works well for my reading glasses. Always like the smell of leather and it should outlast imitation products. [SEP] Traditional 'pocket liner' type glasses pouch which will certainly offer great protection to glasses from abrasions and other dirt. Does however, offer negligible protection from crushing or being sat on :-( [SEP] Needed a slim glasses case and this was perfect. Exactly as described and excellent material and workmanship.",3,True

This has the simplistic style of a mans solid band- yet, comes with a new modern edginess to it.. I really liked a lot!<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant that the cobalt blue would appear cheesy and ‚Äúbubblegum cheap‚Äù however, it‚Äôs the cobalt blue that I like the best about this. This has a silver stripe thru the middle.. and the stripe is cut into ring (imbedded) or, ‚Äúcanal‚Äù style. This makes the ring stand out a lot more and does so, in such a classy way.. This does not disappoint! note: my 17yr old decided against a high school class ring as, the $$ was too steep for 2yr. of use. (Let‚Äôs face it..class rings are super cool when in school- but, post graduation it gets shelved. That is if, it hadn‚Äôt been lost yet?!!)<br />So, in Leui of class ring- we chose this tungsten ring for him and he was smitten! (Best part of all?! Bet you can‚Äôt guess his school colors.. Yep! You got it.. Cobalt blue/Silver!!) **Hack: anyone looking for an alternative idea to a class ring‚Ä¶ Regardless of matching the color, this ring does a nice job of filling the void with something unique and nice to wear/own.<br />As for comfort, The edges are finished smoothly with a soft comfort fit and the attention to detail has not been overlooked. I really like how this has been smoothed for wearing comfort.. Yet, the ring itself still keeps very defined straight edges and lines. (I feel rounded/sloped edges have a wedding band look ..and this was not what I wanted. Especially for my 17yr old high schooler!) **note:<br />I realize some rings can be unisex..(most days I prefer men‚Äôs band due to the width.) Sure! this could be worn by either.. BuT, I do feel this has a total masculine vibe to it- just FYI!!<br /><br />As for tungsten? it has worn fantastically with no scratches/dings. My son is involved in some active classes ie, Weight training, stage tech, PE class.. all causing wear and tear in/on the hands. After a week plus of wearing.. I don‚Äôt see a single scuff! I also expected because of weights class, the pressure used in the hand would have bent or, misshaped the ring to his grip.. Nope! this is, rock solid just like it arrived.<br />For anyone considering this ring- I am 100% impressed and would say, it will not disappoint. This comes in a standard flip top ring box ready to gift or, store.. definitely a ring that will last a long time! [SEP] Gorgeous!! This is a stunning gold ring with an awesome insert made of royal blue- Wow! My son who‚Äôs a teen and just now, getting into the wearing of jewelry- wanted a ring he could wear everyday.. this is perfect for that. Now, he is just torn between wearing on his finger.. or, on a chain- which he loves that look so, you can see the royal blue interior..!!<br />I loved the trendy but, unique look to this ring- being this is worn by a teenage boy who wanted a ring, just a ring that is not 100% wedding ring only- and well, that is a bit hard to find! I will say after seeing this in person... it is nice! Nice enough to wear without looking like a bubblegum ring- it is solid material and it‚Äôs great bc, this metal/finish doesn‚Äôt scratch. I love the fact he can use to do whatever activity and not muck up the ring... A lot of men‚Äôs wedding rings can‚Äôt even make this claim. My husband has to get his ring buffed out from time to time.. and trust me, its a quality 24kt gold from the fancy jewelers!<br /><br />If someone is in the market for a ring to cover the void in the wedding band department- this could be a perfect ‚Äúfill in!‚Äù TBH- Not sure if it would have the longevity of a ‚Äúlife long‚Äù everyday wedding ring..?! But, we all know that there are reasons, needs and times when .. not wearing your real wedding ring is a must. Bam! This would definitely be a good supplement and fill the void of a wedding ring or, be a great ‚Äúbody double!‚Äù -And for this use, it would look the part and not fail at its job. (Honest- I equate this to a solid sterling silver ring for women without the softness of ss. .. so, I‚Äôm here to say, tungsten is pretty sick!)<br />The ring is really sharp looking- The use of a quick polish cloth can make it shine like new and we‚Äôve kept this on while snow sledding.. weight lifting and even hanging in the hot tub one night!

The center of the band is black and the outside is silver, but you can only tell in certain light, mostly the ring looks like a charcoal color from far.

He's been wearing the silicone bands, but then I came across this ring on Amazon, and it worked out great!

I haven't had any issues with scratching or anything so that's a plus in my book!<br /><br />I wouldn't use this as a wedding ring unless you're into that kind of style and simplicity, but it's great otherwise. [SEP] This is a very good and durable tungsten ring.  It is true to advertised size and fits my finger well.  I am not one for fancy rings and like using this as my wedding ring and keep my actual wedding ring in a safe place so I don't loose it or damage it while at work or working out in the garage.  Tungsten makes for great rings due to its strength and durability.  But with those features does come some extra weight.  It is heavier than your normal/typical ring but this is to be expected.  This does not bother me at all but for those sensitive to extra weight you may not like this.  The color is nice and looks great.  Easy to clean.  There are many rumors on the internet that in emergencies tungsten is too strong to cut off, this is simply not true.  Hospitals and emergency crew with the ring cutters can still cut off tungsten if needed. [SEP] The ring is reasonably attractive. It looks exactly as pictured. However, the listing claims it's made with 'meteorite,' and it isn't (it failed the magnet test), so this is deceptive advertising. A ring like this containing real meteorite will easily run you $300 or more. This is a fine substitute, if you're interested in appearance and aren't particular about what the ring is actually made of, but I'm giving it one star because the merchant is claiming it's something it's not. [SEP] This is a very attractive ring with a band that resembles precious metal on the top and bottom with a black ring in the center.  It actually looks like bling.  Although the ring is merchandised for men in the ad copy it‚Äôs certainly a good choice for the ladies.  It‚Äôs eye-catching and very smart looking.  The surface is extremely shiny and it‚Äôs my understanding that with tungsten it will retain this surface.  I am the one who wears this ring occasionally because it is hypoallergenic - no redness from allergic reactions ‚Äì this is a plus.<br /><br />The main reason for my exploring tungsten rings is that my boyfriend is always working on his car and metal rings can be dangerous.  This type ring is scratch resistant plus, more important, will shatter in case of emergency and not deform and cut of blood flow to the finger causing serious injury.  There‚Äôs nothing but plusses with this ring choice.",3,True

There is also good compression in the calf area.¬†<br /><br />I ordered the large/extra-large because I take a 9 to 9.5 shoe. However, I find that these are a bit long (and looser than their small/medium) as I have to roll the top over to prevent it from coming above my knee. They fit me perfectly, otherwise. However, since they are on the large side, I'm passing them off to my boyfriend.¬†I have several pairs of these socks and have worn their¬†socks all day. It feels great wearing them. I also love the styles they come in.<br /><br />These are not only ""fun"" but they are medically helpful for my plantar fasciitis. I wash socks like these in a lingerie bag and lay them flat to dry.¬†Currently, there is no price listed on Amazon for these socks but I would expect them to be priced in the $12.99 to $16.99 range. The only reason I lowered my rating one star is because they are larger than the size specified; otherwise, these are 5-star socks in my opinion. [SEP] These compression socks are freaking tight but do fit well but wouldn't hurt for them to be a size larger. Otherwise, they feel great and really help with the pain I have in my legs and such. [SEP] Well made socks and nice color combo but my husband said they were too tight for him even though they are a size XL. [SEP] Helps my legs not hurt while running or standing all day, the compression is just perfect [SEP] Love these socks! The material is quality and thick, but not too heavy. There is a nice cushion under the feet and it snug fit from foot up to the knee. These socks are better for a taller person - fit perfect up to the knee.  Very pleased in the compression pressure. [SEP] These socks worked well for me, the compression on them was great and they fit me well.<br /><br />Quality: These socks are made up of very high quality stitching. The socks go way up past my knee up to my thigh area when I put them on and stretch well to reach that high, yet the compression stays very strong. These really push tight around your calf area, knee, and upper thigh as well as the lower feet and ankle areas. This means these will help your circulation and keep your muscles in place, warm and do the intended job well.<br /><br />I was really impressed with these, I wore them to help prevent injury while running and playing sports as I was not in shape. These felt good, kept my legs warn and it feels like they keep your muscles in place and help circulation. I am happy with these. [SEP] I wear a men's 8.5 shoe size and decided to get the large, which fits mens 8 - 12.5. So, it was a wise choice, a perfect fit, in terms of foot size, length and compression. They fit with a perfect amount of compression, not too tight, and certainly not loose. The top of the socks end over the calf, just below the knees.<br />The graphic element is fantastic, I feel like my legs looks like they're wearing a superhero costume. haha. And with the compression, this may be true. Now, I'm not going to exaggerate and say the socks turned around my life. However, as I mentioned, the fit is very snug, affording a uniform degree of compression while not feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.<br />Inspection of the socks found no defects, no flaws, no bad/errant stitching. The socks are very well made. The fit and appearance are top notch. I'm glad to wear them, and to show them off.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br />These compression socks earn a solid 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:eddd73af75685f0e7e7dd9bd321c925d]] they fit well and are very cool looking using with robotic like cosplay [SEP] I wear a size 9 shoe.  I have these in the L/Xl recommended for my shoe size.  I do have pretty standard size calves while my daughter has larger ones (she wear the same size shoe as me).  I can wear this without any issues and have a comfortable compression.  She on the other hand can't wear these over her calves.  The material is comfortable but it isn't for larger legs.",3,True
Zalalus Women's Vintage Fit and Flare Cocktail Dresses Plus Size 3/4 Sleeve Wedding Guest Floral Patchwork Formal Party A Line Dress with Pockets Black X-Large,['Zipper closure'],[],,3.9,38,10715,"Beautiful dress! If you have a longer torso or slightly bigger chest than average, this will not fit properly. The skirt rides up too high. Disappointed it did not work out. [SEP] The dress was perfect for the wedding we went too!  The material are sturdy, and the dress has pockets which is a plus for me!! [SEP] I absolutely love this dress!  it is so easy to wear.  For comparison, I'm 5'8""/170lbs and typically wear a 8/10. I used the size chart provided by the seller and because I was in between a L and XL, I bought the XL.  Honestly thought the L would be too tight.  Because I'm tall, this dress is obviously a little shorter on me; however, not so short that it was inappropriate to wear to work.  Paired with heels, it's just right for a day at the office.  The waist is a bit big, but not so much so that it looked awkward.  Even had a coworker tell me she had dress envy :)  Life is short, buy the dress! [SEP] Just like other reviews said, one of my favorite dresses ever!  I have a little mom-pooch and it‚Äôs flattering!  I added a wide black belt and wore it to our semi-formal Christmas work party.  Lots of compliments and pockets are a serious bonus!!! [SEP] Ordered an XL which fit great as material was stretchy but could have probably gone down a size and ordered a large instead. It‚Äôs a little short, as I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù but I paired it with leggings and it looks great. [SEP] Purchased this dress to wear for a holiday party. Received tons of compliments! Very nice dress. Everyone was shocked that I found it on Amazon. [SEP] I bought this dress on a whim for a holiday party and I am so excited about it! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3, weigh 210, and have a 40DDD. I purchased an XL because I wasn‚Äôt sure how loose or stretchy the material was. I typically fluctuate between XL and XXL . The dress fits, but it is a little tight under the arms. I should have gone with an XXL, but no complaints as it was still wearable.<br /><br />The belt did not come with the dress. I bought it separately on Amazon and it definitely compliments the dress.<br /><br />The quality is really good too. It doesn‚Äôt feel or look cheap. Despite the tightness in the upper arm area, the seams don‚Äôt make a sound like cheap clothing normally would if it‚Äôs too tight haha. I highly recommend! [SEP] It's very beautiful, many ppl asked me where I buy my dress :)<br />I'm 40 yrs old, I'm 5.8"" and 180 pounds<br />XL was perfect for me... [SEP] Loved it! Wore it for a work Christmas party. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô 6‚Äù and wear a large normally. [SEP] The dress came in oddly shaped and so I returned it. Torso was like a Medium and the rest was an XL. It fit nicely coming up then it just stopped, such a cute dress though.",3,True
Louis Pelle Hand Painted Leather Triple Zip Pocket Crossbody Bag For Women Original Art Work,"['Genuine Leather,Leather']",[],,4.2,24,2718,"My wife likes this bag, it has ample storage and it is made out of what appears to be a durable material so far. But she liked it better in the pictures online. In person, it seems a little more... I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, but maybe ""cartoony"" would be appropriate. It would probably go better with kids/teenagers. It just doesn't give the same impression in person as it does in the pictures, especially for adult use.<br />Otherwise, it is a good bag in all other respects. [SEP] This is nice for an extended trip I took.  I like the separate zipper pockets.  Hardware is good.  The purse is colorful,  easy to spot.  I like the inside as it is deep enough for larger items.  Long adjustable strap for crossbody.<br /><br />Nice purse,  good quality!  Looks good! [SEP] This purse is super nice, exceeds my expectations. It's real leather and has that real leather smell. It's a little bigger than I thought it would be, but that's fine. The design is clearly hand done, there are some smudges and scratches, but they aren't glaring. The pockets are huge and plentiful, two inside one of which is about the size of a cell phone and three on the outside. [SEP] This purse is very pretty and really eye catching.  It pairs well with a variety of clothing colors.  Despite its small footprint, it can easily fit a small tablet, phone, Kindle, water bottle, and toiletries.  It has several compartments, so it's easy to organize.  There is a small inner pocket that can hold a wallet and keys.  The leather is soft and the lining feels sturdy.  The zippers open and close smoothly.  Overall, I really like this purse, but it's a bit on the heavy side and I don't think I will use it for travel because of that.  It's great for an everyday purse though. [SEP] I am so happy I made this choice! It‚Äôs leather, it‚Äôs beautiful, it‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs colorful, it‚Äôs handcrafted! It reminds me of my hippy days, and that makes me SO happy.<br /><br />Be aware that there may be small imperfections because of the handcrafting, and because of the nature of leather. In fact, embrace them! My bag is uniquely mine!<br /><br />It‚Äôs not overly large, but holds a lot. The main part of the bag easily holds my wallet, my phone charger, my earbuds, and the lens kit case I carry for my iPhone photography. Everything else goes into the three deep exterior zippered pockets. There‚Äôs a smaller zippered pocket on the inside and a small open pocket for keys or lipstick. The strap is generously long for crossbody wear. You can shorten it, of course, but if you‚Äôre a bit fluffy, like me, it‚Äôs easy to adjust to fit. I wear a 2X. The buckle was set to the center of the available holes and it was loose on me out of the box.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this bag. I also hope this review was helpful to you. If it was, please take a second to hit the ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù button below. [SEP] I bought this for my wife. The colors are kind of faded and it looks sort of retro. Kind of a southwestern vibe to it. I like it and so does she.<br /><br />Not a giant purse so you can't stuff everything in it but good for just normal use. [SEP] In looking at this item, I was almost certain that this would be the kind of bag and kind of decor that a younger member of the family would have found instantly appealing.  What surprised me more is that the older member of the family actually laid claim to this bag (though hasn't switched to making it their primary bag) and no they couldn't have it.<br /><br />The decor on this bag is colorful and appealing, and the bag itself seems to offer plenty of utility and usage.<br /><br />Smell (which is an issue I've seen and experienced in the past when it came to purses/bags for Mrs. Terpfan1980 or the next generation of potential users) wasn't off-putting or distracting at all.<br /><br />4 solid stars from the potential users in the household here. [SEP] Or at least hand-painted leather.<br />The bag has 3 main zippered pockets with 2 more inside the main partition and one smaller zippered pocket on one side of the bag for a total of 6 of which 5 have zippers.<br />Quality appears to be acceptable. Nobody will confuse it with a Gucci or a Prada but it's functional and it's hand-painted so it looks good.

But please note that I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.<br />===<br />Review begins:<br /><br />I did not think my wife was going to like this at first. Shows you what I know. She loves the construction, the multiple pockets and the artwork on the bag. The bag is genuine leather, it is roomy and she has enough zippered pockets to keep everything secured and organized. It is a cross body bag, so it is comfortable to wear day or night.<br /><br />Recommended buy.<br /><br />End of Review<br />===<br />Thank you for taking a minute out of your busy life to read my review.

I receive no monetary compensation for my reviews, but try to help potential buyers make an informed choice. [SEP] What drew me to this purse was how pretty it looked online and I was just as happy with it when it arrived. I've been wanting to switch to a crossbody purse, but most of them were to small for all the things I like to carry with me. Just about everything I had in my huge, shoulder killing purse fit in her. I can carry a large checkbook wallet, my phone, keys, mints, glasses, phone charger, Kleenex packet, powder, lip balm, and a few other things in this purse. If I didn't carry a checkbook wallet, there would be a lot more room. It has 3 zippered pockets on the outside and one on the inside. The only thing that doesn't work for me is the cellphone pocket is too small for my iPhone X, but I just used that pocket for something else and put my phone in one of the zippered pockets. I'm super happy with this purse.",3,True

The lenses are very light colored, so I would want darker glasses for a day out in the bright sun. I found myself still squinting from the glare of the sun when I wore them on a very sunny day.<br /><br />Overall, these glasses look good, but won‚Äôt do the job in the bright sun, which is why I wear sunglasses. [SEP] Very much like designer frames; I love the gold and blue trim and the oversized lenses; they are tinted light blue and very unique. They also come with a durable case. I'm going to have fun sporting these! [SEP] I loved the look of the blue lens, but unfortunately it does nothing to protect my eyesight from the sun.  The lens work fine while driving only because my car's windows have additional tenting to help protect my eyesight, but whenever I exit the car, I find myself squinting and my eyes hurting from the sun with the glasses on.  Also, the frame of the glasses are flat and the lens are triangular in shape.  I discovered that this is not flattering to a round face. [SEP] These do not block sun, glare, look cheap, and are not even trendy nor stylish. They are cheaply made... I wouldn't pay more than a few dollars at the most for these. [SEP] I'm not impressed with these at all.  They are VERY cheaply made, flex and bend quite easily, and the lenses are far too translucent.  They look neat from really far away and have a stylish appearance, but from even a moderate distance you can see how poor the quality is.  Even the case they come in is incredibly flimsy and cheap looking.<br /><br />Avoid the waste- buy something else... [SEP] I would have to pass on these sunglasses.  They don't block hardly any sun at all, only having the faintest of blue tints.  They are not polarized, so they won't reduce glare.  I have doubts that they block UV rays like they claim.  And they aren't made particularly well.  I was hoping for a cute pair  of aviator glasses and these don't fit that image.  They are rather huge for women's sunglasses, but not in a good way.  There are big sunnies that are cool, but these aren't them. [SEP] The glasses are very good looking. They are large on my face but that‚Äôs how all aviators look on me. I absolutely love the color of the lenses and the frames are sturdy. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about the glasses is that they don‚Äôt really block a lot of sun which is the whole purpose of sunglasses so it‚Äôs a little bit disappointing.",3,True

Brown Cut Acrylic Bead Pendant Black Tibet Silver Necklace Earrings Jewelry Set,[],[],,3.9,356,11554,"I bought these to use as accents on the tie-backs for my living room curtains but hesitated to buy them due to lack of positive evaluations on some of this company's items about stones falling out.

Its a great product and arrived much sooner than I expected . thank you :) [SEP] Looks just like the picture [SEP] Delivered on time.<br /> But, it was missing an ear. [SEP] Doesn‚Äôt change my skin to green. Still wear it often [SEP] I was extremely pleased when I received the amulet it lived up to the picture, it's got a great finish to it and it looks very nicely detailed. I will say I'd like the chain to either have been longer or had an extra longer chain included because although I'm wearing it while my fianc√©e is away it's a gift for him when he arrives to the states and I'm concerned the length won't comfortably fit him but for the price I don't mind seeking out a longer chain as well as the fact it's not a cheaply made necklace where it's nearly permanently mounted to it like with Some less expensive jewelry that you can buy where if you try to change it out it's like it'd be ruined ... Well I'm very happy with this amulet and I know he'll love it we're big supernatural fans and I'm curious to see how the antique look on the amulet itself hold up in time wether or not it'll fade or anything but I actually feel confident it'll stand the test of time nicely. I recommend it. [SEP] Wear it all the time. Not like the one in the show. This one is thinner (like the face doesn't stick out, kind of flat) and darker in color (like in picture not gold like in show). But i love it. I have yet to receive compliment on it... Just waiting for a supernatural fan to notice it... [SEP] It's basically a double sided talisman, the same face on both sides. Other than that, it's a perfect replica. A decent size and for the price it's hard to argue with how close it is to the one in the show. [SEP] Got what I paid for. Very nice necklace but the string broke the minute my daughter put it on. But the seller was so nice to work with me with the matter. Very happy customer now great customer service",3,True

[SEP] These are beautiful boots but they seem more like house booties than something to wear in the snow.  But they can definitely be worn outside.  I wish they came in my size because they are so well made and cute.  These are very soft on the inside and should keep feet warm but I don't know how waterproof they are.  The soles are light weight but don't flex much at all but seem durable.  As of this review I don't know how much they cost. [SEP] These boots run large. The footbed is a little big, the upper with it's split design is huge and very loose. My daughter usually wears an 11-11.5 and the size 10 in these boots fits her. These boots are very cute. My daughter loves tu and multiple people have asked me where I bought them for her. They are also pretty warm and very soft. They are easy to get on and off. They have poor traction on the soles and are slippery on smooth floors. They are completely unsuitable for wet weather. They are not even slightly water resistant. Water ruins the look of the boots and gets your feet wet, which is kind of a problem for a winter shoe. You cannot wear them in the snow or rain. [SEP] These boots don't hold up long. After about 2 or 3 wears  these boots look like my daughter has had them for months. [SEP] A little big but soooo cute! And since their boots she does fine in them. She has very slinger feet. Very cozy and even easy to wash without losing product on to other clothing. [SEP] I ordered these for my granddaughter and they are beautiful and very good quality. Cute design and details like little bows on the back of the boot. The soles of the shoes are very sturdy, and the inside is plush sherpa with memory foam insoles.<br /><br />My granddaughter is 5, she loves these and doesn't want to take them off. Adorable with pants or dresses and overall great, warm boot for winter. Love them!

Orchid Row's Women's Fashionable Everyday Lace Trim Light weight Travel Scarf Black,[],[],,4.5,22,261,"This is a light weight, sheer scarf. It's polyester with nylon lace. The lace is wide with a frayed-like edges. One reviewer described it as eyelash edges and I think that's pretty accurate. It is thin and see through and will not offer much warmth if that's what you are looking for in a scarf. It is well made, but I'm not crazy about the way the lace is attached at the corners. The pieces of lace overlap and create a messy look. Other than that, it's nice looking and it doesn't seem to wrinkle easily. [SEP] This seems to be a lovely black scarf.  It's very light weight and goes with practically everything.  I can't wait to wear it this fall with some of my sweaters.  I haven't washed it yet - I don't normally wash scarves unless they get dirty because I don't want them to lose their shape.  This one looks kind of short in the picture, but is actually fairly long.  The lacey fringe makes it very soft and lovely. [SEP] Beautiful with nice lace work. Hand wash, line dry, and do not iron the lace but you can iron on a very low temp or steam clean. It is long enough to be used to accentuate your outfit in a ton of different ways or if you need to use it to cover your head. Like the photo, there is tons of fabric and its sheer. Great for summer attire or to jazz up an outfit. [SEP] I originally purchased this because it was inexpensive and I didn‚Äôt want to pay very much for a solid color scarf. The value of this is way better than what I expected and I am so thankful to have made the purchase! Will definitely recommend these to other customers. [SEP] Portable and simple. [SEP] Scarf, wrap, shawl, mantilla, whatever you call it this is a versatile part of any wardrobe.  It‚Äôs great to take on vacation because it‚Äôs a multi-purpose accessory that can be used day or night.  This is oversized but can be rolled to fit in a tiny corner of your carry-on.  Good choice that serves many purposes. [SEP] This is really cute, but super thin and wispy. It looks like it is too thin, like you washed it and it got eaten in the dryer. I still use it because it is light and travels well, but it is not a favorite. I would rather have a longer one that I can more easily wrap. Also, the material is kind of scratchy. It doesn't wrinkle though, so again I deal with it. [SEP] The Orchid Row's Lace Trim Lightweight Travel Scarf is lovely, very feminine and versatile. The lace adds a nice dressy touch to the scarf. It will add class to any ensemble. The material feels good and, with proper care, it should last for some time. [SEP] I wanted to like this, but the lace just looks SO incredibly cheap that I can't wear it with anything.  I try to pair it with outfits and always end up putting it back in the drawer.  I agree with other reviewers that the fabric is very soft, so that is worth a few stars.  Just not my cup of tea. [SEP] The Orchid Row's Lightweight Lace Trim travel scarf is a very lightweight wrap, but it is really large, much larger than a standard scarf. It is so large that I used it as a ""wrap dress"" for my daughters when we played dress up. It is a bit thin, and can be easily hung on something, but the lace trim is very nicely sewn and the texture is soft and light. It's not as comfortable used around the neck as a scarf because of it's size, but it's also usable as more of an over-the-shoulder wrap or around the waist as a swimsuit cover.",3,True
"Awesome 360 Men's Swim Trunks Beach Board Shorts, Blue Stripes L",[],[],,3.2,6,4620,"Usually, quality items that have stripes, line up. These don't. These are very thin material and getting them wet may be an embarrassment to the wearer. Wearing them around the house would be fine. How they fit, don't know. I will give them to the Boy to see if he wants to wear them. [SEP] I'm quite a fan of the Awesome 360 brand, their clothing items are always hip, great quality & offer so many fun styles. These men's swim trunks were no different than the quality I've come to expect with the brand.<br /><br />Right away you can tell it's well made, tight stitchings, no loose threads, waistband offers a relaxed elastic. There's a bright white mesh undergarment attached to the interior of the shorts as well as the two front pockets. There are no back pockets which makes these shorts mainly functional for swimwear. Had it added back pockets one would be able to add these to their casual wear. Sometimes after swimming guys can throw on a t shirt and head to the hot dog stand, bar, or run errands with their swim trunks if they have enough pockets. These don't appear as versatile, but one could still try if they carried a minimalist front pocket wallet as these are very lightweight and dry quickly.<br /><br />I love that the drawstrings are patterned to blend in. It goes without saying my hubby loves his swim trunks, he says they're roomy, very comfortable and are the perfect length arriving just above the knee.<br /><br />Both the colors and designs all mesh well together making these an attractive pair of shorts to wear. Don't be put off by the pink in these shorts, the design and color choices still make these masculine in style. We would definitely recommend these shorts [SEP] I currently have a pair of swimming shorts from this brand, and I really love them.  We took them to the beach and I had no issues with them being uncomfortable or being too thin.  These ones seem very thin and with the color I am worried they will be see through when wet.

"Leather Toiletry Bags for Travelling Men/Women, Shaving Bags for Men",['Zipper closure'],[],,4.2,25,657,"Wowza! Are you kidding me..?!! This is almost too classy to be a toiletry bag.. it is classy and sexy, 100%. Boom- mic. drop.. it‚Äôs just that great!!<br /><br />Opening the bag you can smell the leather like a brand new horse saddle and personally- I was shocked! Every ounce of this is classy. I‚Äôm so looking forward to giving this to my husband who does a lot of business travel.. and has a birthday next week.<br /><br />This has two zipper compartments on either side.. making organization simple and easy. I love the fact you can separate products into two sides. One side for dry items such as: cologne bottle/tooth brush/medications.. the flip side: shaving gear/ shampoo/deodorant.  The separation will keep things neat and tidy. This is soft sided and leather shows a bit of a worn-in look. The inside is lined with a nice fabric- the handle and zipper pulls are made of same quality leather.<br /><br />For the price point, you are getting a top quality and very usable toiletry bag‚Ä¶ This makes for a great gift that I‚Äôm certain will be loved by the recipient. Being genuine leather.. this should last for years to come! Hands down I recommend!!<br />Hope this info. helps.. feel free to let me know! [SEP] This leather bag is sturdy. The brown bison leather had a weathered look. It is divided into two zippered compartments. The black lining is water resistant. Capacity is decent. There is also a small exterior zippered pocket. The zippers are strong and run smoothly. It is sturdy and unisex. [SEP] My millennial sons love anything made out of this weathered-looking leather. This is a fairly simple, but nice, lined dopp kit with two zipped sections and a side zipper. At first I thought the zippers were going to be a little rough, but after a few time, the metal zippers are working beautifully. A great kit for any man's Father's Day or other occasion, or just because they need/want one. Recommended. [SEP] The Leather Toiletry Bag for Men and Woman is a fantastic bag, I love the color and feel.  The inside is roomy and I was able to fit in all my products.  The bag seems to be well made and sturdy but at this time I can't comment on long term use.  I would definitely recommend this item. [SEP] I love leather.  This is a nice gift for a gentleman friend who keeps a shaving kit, or travels and needs a nice carry bag for toiletry items.  Also suitable for girls who like leather.  Nice for steam punk style cosplay as well. [SEP] Unlike others I find this bag to be a very good size.  Not too small yet not too large it holds everything I'd need on a trip.  There's room for the shaver, beard trimmer, and other toiletries I typically take on a trip.  The 2 larger pockets are quite nice and supposedly water proof (I've not tested this but they look like they'd be).  The 2 smaller zipper pockets should hold smaller medicine containers but are on the same side of the bag making them not quite as useful as they seem.  Still, they're OK for the intended uses.<br /><br />The leather is a good quality and soft with strong stitching.  The handle can work from one end or the top and each large compartment has its own zipper (not a dual affair like other's I've used).  I like that.<br /><br />This one's a keeper. [SEP] This is a very nice toiletry bag.  I travel a lot and needed a new bag.  I've been using the same bag for about 15 years and it was leather.  The outer shell was still intact, but the inner shell was completely gone.  This new one is great as it is genuine leather with twice the pockets as my old one.  It has a nice pull handle and looks great and appears to be very durable.  It holds all my stuff, and then some!  I look forward to many years of carefree use. [SEP] The bag is attractive and roomy. However, the dye bleeds for some reason. I have never owned any leather that bleeds when coming into contact with water. I set the bag on the vanity to remove the packing material, apparently, I set in on a few drops of water because when I moved the bag, the drops of water were brown. I wiped the bottom and sides of the bag with a damp paper towel, and the quite a bit of the dye came off. I guess if I keep rubbing, it will eventually stop coming off. I would expect better quality for a bag that costs almost $30. [SEP] A classically-styled leather toiletry case. It's branded as a shaving kit, but has enough room for quite a bit additional.<br /><br />There's two same-size compartments and a small side pocket. It's good looking, a decent size, and would fit most of my travel-specific bathroom items.  Pictured: In an adult male grasp (L/XL glove size), and also with 2 cans of Edge shave gel inside it for scale.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />* It's not quite big enough for the ""modern"" male-- if you have a hairbrush, or hair products, or contact lenses, or other ""additional"" items beyond the stuff everyguy needs-- you'd likely need to carry a second case.<br />* There's nothing to keep wet and dry items apart, and the leather is not going to be breathable when the case is zipped. Bathroom items are inevitably at least damp, if not wet...<br />* Another issue, it had a rather strong smell when first unpacked (it faded after a while)-- the smell of tanned leather that was packaged right away rather than left to air out.<br />For these issues, which detract but don't affect core function, I dock a star.<br /><br />This classic design has been superseded by organizers for a reason-- those of us who would buy a travel-specific case most likely want one made with modern materials, wet/dry designs, and organizer pockets. But if you want a good old-fashioned case, this is a fine choice. [SEP] Very nice toiletries bag. It is genuine leather lined with black fabric. It has two separated sides that close at the top with a zipper. There is also one small zippered pocket on an inside sidewall of the bag as well as an external side zippered pocket. It feels well made. I have used it to carry meds when I travel and am pleased.",3,True
"UNACOO 3 Packs Loose Fiting V Neck Stretch Tee Shirts Short Sleeve for Boys and Girls(White+White+White, l)",['Tumble dry low'],[],,4.3,28,7076,"UNACOO 3 Packs Loose Fiting V Neck Stretch Tee Shirts Short Sleeve for Boys and Girls are pretty thick and heavy for a tee-shirt.  So, I would say these are not for a hot summer day.  They don't really feel like 100% cotton.  There is quite a bit of stretch in them.  Therefore, I honestly think they are 100% cotton.  Especially since I washed then and they barely shrank.  So, I think they are actually a cotton/poly blend with some elastane.  The size I received was a 9-10T.  I have no idea what size that is, but my 7 year old now wears a size 8 or Medium in most clothes.  These fit him perfectly with room to grow, so I will have these t-shirts for longer than just one season.  (So long as he doesn't get them too grimy!)  So, I would say that the 9-10 is actually equivalent to an 8-10 or medium.  They are kind of boxy, but overall a decent t-shirt set.  Says 3 pack, but what you actually get is 3 t-shirts.  I like these better than the crew neck ones by this brand because I just like v-neck over crew neck any day. [SEP] This pack of 3 is perfect for my son.<br />The fabric is thick enough to warm him without suffocating him. It is also super soft and stretchy. The Vneck is usefull as you can wear it as a 1 layer.<br />The only thing is that it is short and wide. The mold of these shirts is weird. But as a first layer is not a problem. I would not use it as a regular t shirt.<br />They wash pretty good.<br />Overall is a useful/great  pack for cooler temps. [SEP] I like how soft and stretchy the material is. I would prefer the length to be just a tad bit longer. When my 9 year old raises his arms, the bottom of the shirt comes up, revealing his stomach. Because the material is so thin, and the length is short, he wears these as undershirts. [SEP] I got these for undershirts for my son.<br />The quality was okay.<br />They were a little see thru but served the purpose of what I wanted them for. [SEP] We recently got a vinyl machine so we've had fun putting vinyl on all the things, lol. These are basic, white v-neck tees. The material has a fair bit of stretch to it. They work well as undershirts or as a plain white tee for embellishment. [SEP] These tees are very soft and smooth 95% cotton, 5% elastane. These are nicely made and a great weight for warmer days or wearing under sweaters, etc. These wide enough around to fit loosely, which is good unless you have a really skinny kiddo. The sleeves are average short sleeves, and overall the fit is good. I just wish these were about 2 inches longer, but they‚Äôll work as is. Overall, these are soft, comfy tees that seem as if they will hold up for a good while. Very pleased with the texture and feel of these tees.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

They didn't irritate my skin or cause redness, and the quality is good esp for this retail price. I am very impressed with these and wear them often. [SEP] It annoys me when products like this are listed ""for men."" Of course anyone can wear these--it just depends on your personal tastes and style. I like the look of these, with their black spikes, and I also like that they're on the small side. They're a comfortable weight, and I find the clasp easy to deal with. I do have some issue with the post, however. It's curved, which makes it difficult to put these on since my piercings are in a thick part of my ear. [SEP] These were a little bit difficult to get into my ears. I am not sure why. While they did look nice after getting them on, they were uncomfortable to wear. [SEP] Great [SEP] These are really cute punk earrings. I love them, they look so good and are pretty eye catching. Easy to put in and take out, these clean easily as well. I'd recommend! [SEP] These novel earrings have a ""Punk De La Punk"" attitude. I love the way they even make my ears speak for themselves.<br /><br />Look at the nice presentable box they come in -- a nice place to safely stow these earrings when the time comes when I will once again need to be respectable for work.<br /><br />The earrings are thick - but lightweight -- as one person said they are a little hard to take off but I Do Not Care-- because my earrings usually sleep with me. They are easy to clean -- make sure there is a mesh stopper in your sink.<br /><br />Sure you can possibly find them cheaper elsewhere but that happens all the time. I'm happy with these wonderful ego boosting earrings.<br /><br />Now, is there an identical bracelet to match? I would LOVE one. [SEP] Cool punk rock looking spiked earrings. Look like they‚Äôd feel heavier than they are, and they are a full wrap look all the way to the back of the love. The closure on one was a little snugger than I expected, but was able to get released with assistance. [SEP] Though these are advertised for men, my wife will use these as part of her Halloween costume.  The clasps are very difficult to open and close.  They are great for a single use, 1x a year wear for a costume.  She thinks that the quality will not hold up for heavy use, as the clasps is very difficult.<br /><br />As a costume accessory, it is 4 stars.  As an every-day wearable item, the clasp is too hard to manage, and it is 3 stars. [SEP] The presentation lifts the gifting option for this pair of earrings. The earrings are nicely designed and appear to have good quality construction. The titanium steel has a nice sulvery lustre. The weight is lighter than it would seem visually, which is a good thing. The hinge and locking mechanism work well.<br />While the title states that these are Men's stud earrings, I consider them to be unisex, usable by any gender. In fact, I do not have pierced ears. The significant other gleefully accepted them, and said they were cute, would be fun to wear casually, to meet her girlfriends...shop, eat..... She said the 'post' was unusual and took a bit of maneuvering to put it in and out. But, that it was worth it.<br />An interesting design, well crafted. Inspection found no flaws or defects. I imagine over repeated use, the hinge won't be as tight, but that's true of most hinges.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference. While they have a 'tough intention' it is an eye catching and attractive piece of casual wear jewelry. As such, it garners a 3.5 - 3.75 star rating, with a moderately high level recommendation. [SEP] These are nice earrings: a decent weight for their size, easy to open and close, and sturdily constructed. What you see in the photos is what you get. Four stars because it's a little challenging to get the posts through my ear piercings. Recommended for the punk rocker in your life.",3,True

"Orchid Row Women's Fashion, Trendy and Chic Ranger Hat with Velvet Band Black/Burgundy O/S",['100% Wool'],[],,3.4,25,3430,"All of the hats we have gotten, my daughter and I have had to learn to share.  They tend to be in demand now and then.  When this hat arrived, however, I am thinking of hiding it.  It is THAT COOL.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS HAT LIKE?<br />This hat is really cool.  It is made from what appears to be pressed wool felt.  The brim is stiff but flexible.  The brim is the color of a nice cabernet wine.  The cap is a beautifully formed cap that has an indentation on top that is PERFECTLY set.  The band on it is a poly velvet which is tied at the side leaving two nice tails on it.  It is a shiny velvet which looks surprisingly classy.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS HAT PERFORM?<br />This hat has been crushed, thrown and sat on and it is still doing great.  A little bit of reforming and it looked like new.  I don't recommend long term crushing, but it really is a nice hat.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS FIT?<br />I have a head with 21 inch circumference and this hat fits very well.  It is not so loose that it will fly off, but it is firm enough of a fit to stay on in reasonable breeze.  Winds, well, forget it.<br /><br />IS THERE WIRE AROUND BRIM?<br />There is no forming wire around the brim.<br /><br />IS THERE A BAND INSIDE?<br />There is a black grosgrain ribbon band on the inside.<br /><br />CLEANING?<br />Because this is felted wool, it needs to be carefully spot cleaned.  You do not want to soak this with water or squeeze it out if you can help it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a really cool hat.  I have a hard time finding hats with brims that balance well with the crown and flatter me.  This hat flattered everyone that has tried it on so far. It is easy to care for and seems to be resilient.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I hope to post a photo of this hat as soon as I am able to.  For now, I wanted to at least review this hat and let you all know how much I love it.  It goes with several dark red and black jackets that I have as well as other outfits. [SEP] As of this review this hat is priced at $19.99 and I would not want to pay any more than that for it.  I don't think it will last a long time as the material is soft and very flexible.  The brim is nothing to write home about being narrow and flimsy, but for a kid or a teenager the hat is fine.  My teenaged daughter immediately claimed it when I pulled it out of the box it came it. [SEP] This is a very nice  wool felt hat with a pretty black velvet bow.  It has a suggestion of ""western hat"" to it but is not a cowboy hat and would never be mistaken for a men's hat.  It says one size but it is small for my head and  is not very flattering on me.  2 of my 3 grown daughters look really cute in it though (the ones with the smaller heads)<br />If you have a normal sized head and remotely feminine features, this will be adorable. [SEP] This hat is very attractive and beautifully finished, a handsome item that would compliment many of the more modern styles.<br />It is very dressy and has an exceptionally dramatic look.<br />The blue rim on this fedora-type hat goes beautifully with grays and blacks and most clear blue clothes.<br />The style goes well with suits with skirts or trousers.<br />My younger granddaughter looks particularly attractive in this style of hat. [SEP] This Orchid Row - an Amazon brand - hat with crushed velveteen band is a felt hat that holds it's shape. It has a nice, wide brim and a grosgrain ribbon lining the perimeter inside the hat. This hat is maroon with a black top & black, crushed velveteen (contains polyester) band.<br /><br />The hat feels like it is made out of felt with a stiffener added to it. The hat holds its shape very well and the brim is not floppy. The crushed velveteen band is removable, which is good since I am going to replace it with a leather braid. [SEP] Looks good but it's way too big for my head. I dont think I have an abnormally small head but am second guessing now... [SEP] This is a fun, sturdy, fashionable hat that my granddaughter really likes.  It offer her warmth with a bit of flair and it is different from what her friends wear.",3,True
Vitaltyextracts Boho Chocker Chain Tassel Star Choker Necklace for Women Necklaces & Pendants Collar (Silver) ‚Ä¶,[],[],,3.0,24,479,"Disappointed , as the picture shows this to be much bigger then what it is, and the length to be short, as it says this is a choker like the new style is.<br />This  necklace is at least 18, 20 inch long at its shortest .<br />The stars are the size for a child. If this was shorter it would have looked ok with the small stars.<br /><br />Do not get hair spray on this or shampoo.. [SEP] This is a very pretty necklace.  The stars are petite and very complimentary to the overall design.  The chain is delicate without being too thin (no need to worry about breakage if your careful and don't yank it).  Clasp was easy to use and held tight.  It was a bit tangled when it arrived but we sorted it out easy enough.  It is a good length (not really a choker length but more of a upper chest type length).  The star points can sometimes poke or catch so if your real sensitive to this you might not find it as easy to wear for long periods.  Color is silver and doesnt look cheap or plasticy.  No funny skin discoloration or adverse reactions.  My wife said do not wear it while working out as it seems to twist and poke a lot more with more intense activity. [SEP] Was packed very good and i had no issues with the item during my usage with it. Highly recommend it [SEP] This is the perfect necklace for the 4th coming up. But it can work for any event or work. It is dainty. Comes with a extender. I am using the extender in the picture. This is just a cute little necklace. If you take care of it , it will last you. Look up how to take care of costume jewelry. I hope this has helped. Thank You [SEP] This is a pretty cute little necklace, definitely not a choker and really no way to make it a choker. It‚Äôs about equivalent to the jewelry I buy my daughter at Claire‚Äôs or Justice and wouldn‚Äôt expect to pay more than that price range. It will definitely find its way to her jewelry box.  It might be cute for the 4th of July, but other than that, I cannot see myself wearing this. [SEP] delicate silver chain with little stars spaced about an inch apart - adorable and works either by itself or with other jewelry.  My daughter loves it [SEP] This looks nothing like the photograph. It‚Äôs very cheap feeling, much longer and not a choker. The stars are larger and it‚Äôs just a regular cheap looking necklace. I‚Äôll probably give it to my 12-year-old cousin because I can‚Äôt wear it. [SEP] Cute stylish idea of a choker but not a choker. It's a normal necklace length, at the tightest setting is isnt tight around my neck as a choker should be. The stars are also a really thin metal, and feels cheap.<br /><br />The way they are attached to the chains of the necklace are by thin eyes of the stars. They are bound to break.<br /><br />Cute idea lack of quality. [SEP] Not chocker, but it is on the small side for a full length necklace. I thought it was little circles on the picture, but to my utter glee it is little stars. Gorgeous. No allergic reaction... Perfect addition to my jewlery/accessory collection. Sutiable for any occasion. Dainty and girly... Love it!<br /><br />Jewelry Maintenance and Precautions<br />1. Often wipe with a soft cloth make it often new.<br />2. Laundry bathing should be timely to remove all kinds of jewelry, to prevent jewelry case alkali products.<br />3. Avoid contact with hairspray, perfume, skin care products together.<br />4. When not wearing, be sure to thoroughly dried before storage to be placed, in order to avoid moisture to make them lose their luster.<br /><br />Please Note:<br />1. Size indicated in the pictures.Please allow slight difference in size due to hand-measuring.<br />2. Due to differences between monitor displays, actual color may vary slightly from image.<br />3. 100% Money-back satisfaction guarantee. [SEP] I personally found this necklace to be very cheap and for lack of a better word cheesey looking. This necklace came up on my Vine queue. I like what's supposed to be .925 silver. I decided to try it out. It reminds me if those $1 necklaces you get on that one app where they claim to be silver and come from China. It's very cute and would be nice for a very young girl 10-12 years old. If it costs more than $2 it's too much. Also the clasp would get stuck open. It comes in a little zip lock bag. I really don't recommend this necklace.",3,True

All in all it's a great piece to have around. I would only say it shouldn't be worn in the pool or shower. [SEP] Perfect for a teenager,  cute casual look. [SEP] This bracelet is much more sturdy than I imagined it would be. It feels perfectly balance with the use of leather strips along with decorative string. The piece works well with most of my casual attire not to mention other casual bracelets of similar color tones. I have gotten many inquiries as to where I got this from! [SEP] This is noticeable because of the multi strands of assorted beads, disks, etc.  Looks cool on.  Controlled by the cords so opens widely to accommodate all wrists.  Close by pulling on braided cords each end..Sturdy [SEP] Thick yet stylish bracelet that makes a statement in a good way. Eyes are always on it and compliments are always earned while wearing it. Love the colors and love how it truly feels strong, sturdy, and from the Earth. Definitely suggest getting as it enhances and makes any and every outfit pop. [SEP] I really like this bracelet. It gives me an instant casual, laid-back look. It's possible to tie it by yourself as demonstrated in the attached pictures. Once tied, the strings are pretty long and I found I had to tuck them under the bracelet when I washed my hands. Also, it's slightly big on me. Even at the tightest setting, it was a little lose. Doesn't bother me, just letting making you aware. In the picture online it looks more brown than black but that's not the case in person. There are two thin outer strands with beads and a black leather center band with it beads. It'll go nicely with jeans & a tee shirt. [SEP] I've always loved multi-layered bracelets that are connected to one another, but finding a good quality one is hard. This one, however, I believe would last quite awhile before coming undone or even breaking.<br /><br />What I noticed first when I put the bracelet on was that it tightens really well around the wrist; bracelets like these usually don't tighten completely -  leaving an uncomfortable gap that makes it feel like the bracelet is going to fall off after a few wears. I was also glad that the tighten strings (the strings which hang on the back) were long enough that I didn't have to use my teeth to tighten the bracelet (which most of these types, I usually have to).<br /><br />The only setback about this bracelet is that after wearing it a few times, it began to get looser and not tightening enough to stay put on my wrist. And then I noticed some of the threading was coming out of the main part which holds all three pieces together. So, this is a good bracelet for certain occasions, but not every day wear, which was disappointing because I do love the look of this bracelet. [SEP] Easy to wear, so cute. I‚Äôve had it for a few months and it is holding up well [SEP] This looks like the photos.  Nothing really extraordinary about it.  The center leather strap is pretty basic in looks.  The two outer bands/bracelets are just thick threading with beads on them.  This is your standard slider style bracelet.  You can slide it open to put on over your hand then pull the two points together to close it to size.  The beads are a bit thick, if wearing while typing you will notice this on your wrist.  Overall, it isn't bad but more for teenage/young adults. [SEP] Love it",3,True

The sewn edge seams and zipper top allow water to easily leak out.<br />For this reason I docked one star.<br />Otherwise I really like these bags.<br />I think the bags are well made and the design/wording is cute.<br />These would be a good gift for a new mom.<br />They come in a plastic bag with a cute saying ‚ÄúMom, You‚Äôre a superhero, period! [SEP] Got these bags for the stroller but to be honest, I am not sure what I am supposed to do with them. They are cute but they are kind of small which is why I am not sure what they will be used for. [SEP] This set of 5 zippered pouches are all a good size - four are the same size and one is much larger. The ""smaller"" ones are by no means ""small"", but good sized pouches that can store a reasonable amount of stuff/little things. The zipper is good and glides effortlessly. I'm not sure what this material is called - pleather? but it is obviously not leather.<br /><br />I know a lot of people often mention smells of a product whenever they leave a review so I do have to warn that these will have a strong initial smell and I highly recommend leaving them open and out for a few days for the smell to dissipate. I don't like the smell but I am realistic and understand that some items will have strong plastic smell when they are brand new and right out of the packaging. I'm only on day two but the strong smell is still there so do allow a few days before you start using these.<br /><br />I got the black one with white lettering and did notice the lettering does have some slight bleeding. It is dry, of course, and won't get on your hands but you can see the slight bleeding over the edges of the letters. It isn't bad and not very noticeable unless you look really closely. These bags are great for anything baby related or even things like makeup.<br /><br />I noticed on this description page they said ""top quality leather"", but do make sure you know this isn't real leather. I personally prefer that it is faux leather anyway, for ethical reasons, and just wanted to mention that here so nobody is disappointed thinking they are getting 5 animal leather pouches.<br /><br />Overall these are durable zippered storage bags that is great for organizing stuff. Aside from the slight bleeding lettering and strong smell, these are well stitched. [SEP] This bags are super cute! But I feel the description is deceptive coz it‚Äôs not real leather and waterproof. That aside I still give this a high rating of 4 stars coz it is well made and comes with different sizes. Depends on how you use this, this can last for a long time until your baby is a toddler. Another thing, the zipper are good but not great, I wish they use a thicker kind and not the basic kind coz if you will open a bag a few times a day I can see a quick wear and tear on the zipper part. Not planning to use it to keep wet clothes/items so the waterproof part doesn‚Äôt bother me, if this is part of your decision getting it, you will be disappointed coz the inside is not waterproof. [SEP] These bags are adorable. Love the fact that they are all waterproof, not just the one for wet clothes. Super cute labels on them that would be a great addition to any diaper bag. My one complaint was the bags had a smell when removed from the box. I have left them to air out for several days and they still have the smell. I will keep trying. Otherwise very cute and functional. [SEP] Right off the bat you can tell these are not authentic leather pouches and that they really are made from ""leather material"" like the description says. They look good but definitely need to be aired out because they smell very chemically. The smell does go away so that is a good thing. Other than that, these pouches are good and sturdy. The zipper is also strong and doesn't seem like it will break after a few uses. The pouches are big enough to hold pretty much anything you want. They help keep you bag organized. They are a little on the pricey end though. for pouches that are not real leather, they could be a little cheaper. Good looking pouches that work well but just a little pricey. [SEP] Lightweight, stylish and fits perfectly in any standard sized diaper bag/tote bag. This would be an amazing baby shower gift! No momma (or dada) wants to dig through the many baby items that get thrown into the diaper bag just to find their keys or debit card. This keeps everything tidy and organized! [SEP] Used these for my small to-go diaper bag and big diaper bag when baby stays with grandma overnight. It works very well in organizing all the essentials in terms of clothing, diapers, trinkets etc. Sometimes you just need to grab a small sack for a change and not haul the whole bag with you, and these bags make it happen. Very nice and good quality. I use the super mama for all of my essentials when I am on the go. Great prduct! [SEP] These are a perfect gift idea for a new mom. This will be very helpful when you're on the go and have a wet diaper or messy items. This will keep the diaper bag very organized and easy to find what you need. Great quality too. [SEP] I absolutely love these for my diaper bag. They help everything stay organized and not get crushed. Love the black and white as they are gender neutral and go with any bag.

[SEP] I‚Äôve been using these for winter hiking and running, and I love them. Nicely padded, supportive (can non-compression socks be supportive? Somehow I feel these are), and attractive enough. I wear them with medium duty walking shoes when spending the day walking around DC, and they are a difference maker. [SEP] These are VERY nice socks!<br />I received them in a size large which is supposed to fit women's sizes 10-12.5. I typically wear a size 9 in women's sneakers and found these to be a little snug. They still fit but I can't imagine a woman with a size 12 foot fitting into these comfortably.<br />Other than that I have no complaints. They are well made with good, durable stitching and very comfy to wear.<br />These will be perfect for the freezing cold winters where I live. Socks are just as important as footwear when it comes to keeping your feet warm. These are thick and cushioned. I can't wait to try them out in a few months! [SEP] A good pair of socks is so important. There's nothing worse than developing blisters. You don't have to be miles out on a trail for that to be a problem either. Getting them in the center of a city when you're away from home would be just as bad. One of the best ways to avoid blisters is to have a well fitting pair of socks and to keep your feet dry. So, when wicking material was made which moves the moisture away from your feet, who the heck didn't jump on buying wicking socks?<br /><br />Well, here you go, if you're looking for a pair. These are excellent socks for hiking (trail or city). The material is very good and it does a good job wicking away the sweat. The fit seems pretty excellent, maybe just a tad, a quite small tad, snug. That may change over time. Best of all for the fit, they're made, left & right. I love it when socks are made that way because they always fit better. Although, it does mean you need the light on to put your socks on the right feet. They even look fancy with all sorts of tracery stitching around the top. A truly good pair of socks. [SEP] These socks feel okay. They feel a little sung for being a large pair but not to the point of discomfort. The stay up on the calves well, for now. They feel well made, strong seams, and are nice and thick. They breath well to help prevent foot sweat. Color and design are only secondary to function, but they have a really nice look to them too. [SEP] I bought these for rollerblading just to get a little extra cushion. They are really great. I feel like my ankle is protected even more and it just gives that extra comfort while wearing skates. [SEP] I like to hike and walk, I've even been known to indulge in a 5K run now and again, and I have to say, these socks are just so comfy to wear.  They are a thick material which is great for absorbing impact on the feet, the material is also wicking, so you don't get that icky sweaty foot feeling like you do from most artificial material socks.  Good socks for almost any use! [SEP] These are thick, durable and supportive hiking/trekking socks that are well-sized to wear with hiking boots or shoes.  They go up to below my calf just above my hiking boots.  They are most suited for cool or cold weather because they are not thin.  They have supportive bands and bands for extra cushion. [SEP] I shouldn't have to work quite so hard to pull on a pair of sockets.  They are thick and warm and attractive, but they are also tight and after several hours of wear, they do leave an indentation around my calf.  They are just a little shorter than I would like as well, although I wouldn't mind if they were more comfortable.<br /><br />I do not find myself wanting to wear these very often, even though they really look nice (the bright blue is very sporty).  That says alot.  Not terrible by any means, but I've got socks that suit me better.",3,True

[SEP] I got these leggings in a small, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 163lbs they fit perfectly, and I‚Äôm by no means small.

They are also stylish and tru to size I would highly recommend them [SEP] Super cute style and color. Kind of a muted sky blue with a slight grey undertone...very pretty. Form fitting but not too tight. Soft material. [SEP] There appear to be two kinds of yoga pants: stretchy slacks that are cut rather like most pants, and fitted tights that hug your legs and butt (for good or ill). These are in the latter category.<br /><br />I like them a lot. The yoga pants manage to be snug without being tight. They fulfill their destiny, in that they're flexible and lightweight, and they stretch just-fine when I'm working out. Also, the pants went through the washer and dryer without a problem.<br /><br />And did I mention that they look good? It's like I am walking around with racing stripes.<br /><br />They're cut true-to-size; my Small was just right. I'm short (5'1""), and the ""extra"" fabric schooched just-right around my calves. (By which I mean, I do not look like a dork.) I think they'd be fine for someone up to 5'5""... or taller, if you don't care about workout pants being short.<br /><br />The yoga pants advertise a back pocket, but don't get your hopes up. The only thing that'd fit into that ""pocket"" is a locker key. If you want to stick your phone in a pocket while you work out, you're out of luck. There'd be no place for a real pocket on pants this form-fitting! That's not a problem as long as you set your expectations correctly.<br /><br />I like these yoga pants. You probably will, too.",3,True

The underwear are soft and have unique, kid friendly patterns. They did fit as far as the waist. There is an elastic band and they did hold up the underwear for the day. However, as he was wearing them for the day, they began to get loose. They were so loose that when he pulled up his pants, the underwwear would puff out of the top. When I tried to fix it, I noticed they were too loose to stay in place and just came up with his pants as he pulled them up. Overall, I think they are okay. [SEP] These boxer briefs fit true to size. They are soft, stretchy, breathable and very comfortable to wear. The waist is stretchy, the front is comfortably lined, the leg openings do not pinch. Cute designs are a plus. I recommend them. [SEP] These pairs of underwear fit well and the designs are cute.  I think they could be a bit softer, though my little boy thinks they are plenty comfortable. [SEP] B, the 10 year old boy, loves these. They are not your plain-Jane undercrackers, and he enjoys that aspect. Most of it anyway. Some prints are too ‚Äúyoung‚Äù for him (per B) but he wears them anyhow. I think he likes those too actually. [SEP] These underwear run really large. I bought them for my 2.5 year old and they would fit my 5 year old. They are also definitely a boy short cut not a boxer brief. They are well made with nice thick cotton and a cute print, just order a couple sizes down if you want them to fit. At least they are too big rather than too small so my son can grow into them eventually. [SEP] I got these for my 5 year old who loves dinosaurs. The designs are cute and the underwear is well-made but these do run large. I would say they would be better for a 6 or even 7 year old. (My son is a normal sized 5 year old.) Go at least a size down. [SEP] These boys boxer briefs are soft and the designs are kid-approved. I washed (cold water) one pair and compared it one right out of the package, and there was no shrinking in the wash. They fit as expected. [SEP] My 6 year old son LOVES these underwear!

They are delicate, but unique. And so lightweight! I would definitely recommend them. [SEP] The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because one of the earrings arrived tangled and kinked a bit as shown in the picture.<br /><br />I just thought if I had wanted to give this as a gift for it to be like that it would have looked like I had taken these out or used them or something. So if you want to give these to someone just take them out of the box and make sure they're not wrapped around themselves!<br /><br />Other than those two details(which I was able to fix in about 30 seconds) these earrings are great! They are beautiful and sparkly!<br /><br />I like the versatility in that you can wear them up as a cuff or just down and dangling. The stones really catch the light and shine!<br /><br />They seem well made and they're really nice! [SEP] I had been wanting to try this style of earring, but was worried they would be too heavy or uncomfortable. Turns out I had nothing to worry about. They are super light weight and because they don't have the backs sticking into your head, you can actually keep them on when you catch some zzzs. My pair easily slid into my ears to keep them from falling and even came with traditional backs if I want longer earrings. Overall, very happy I gave in and gave them a try. Will look into others of this style. [SEP] This earring is light weight, has the perfect thickness and super comfortable to wear. It is very stylish and looks really great on me. [SEP] I love, love, love these earrings. They don't weigh much, the cuff holds onto my ear without making it painful (only one fell off once during my work shift), and they are mega pretty. I thought I couldn't do this style because I only have the one piercing on each ear, so I'm happy that I found these! [SEP] This was a good gift but I did have to find a nice presentation box to put them in.  Pretty to look at. [SEP] These are not the normal type of earring that I'm used to seeing, so I figured I'd get a set for my wife to try out. She likes them. They're light, and are noticeable. She's not sure about the 'C' going on the ear, as it might be bothersome over some time, but she can deal with it. I think they're cool looking, and sexy. You don't see a set of these very often, so they catch the eye.

These look nice on him. Before these, the last time I'd seen him in a tie was on our wedding day, over 14 years ago. So, I don't have a great deal of comparison to go by, but we like these. He got the chance to try out two different sets. They both have the pink striped tie in them. It's on the sparkly side. The white stripes have silver thread intwined in them, so that adds the glittery look to it. It's definitely one that stands out. One tie has a breast cancer logo on it and the last one is light blue/grey, with dark blue and light grey dot-like squares on it. That one is much more traditional in look. So far, we've been pleased with these. [SEP] These ties look a little different than the photo, but are still decent looking ties. The issue I have with them is that they're not great quality. If you need a quick tie in a pinch, or are working in an office where jobs require a tie but you're entry level, this would work for you. They're obviously not quality from just a glance, so not great for formal or for a job where you need to look your best. [SEP] The grey one is great! Classic and goes well with most suits. The other one though has metallic, silvery threads so the tie sparkles. The pink stripe is very summer-y and fun, but the sparkles in the tie make it almost kitsch-y. My husband will never wear  a sparkley tie.<br /><br />The quality seems decent and is in a standard tie size. Not thin like the hipster ties but not comically large like from the 70s. Just standard. [SEP] AWESOME 350 MEN's CLASSIC NECKTIES<br /><br />My husband says --<br /><br />These are very attractive ties for wearing for any occasion.  They are 100% polyester and are machine washable.  Not sure if I would try that!<br /><br />These ties are soft with a nice texture and finish.  The pink striped one is 2 1/2"" wide and looks great with my crisp white shirts.  The blue dotted one is 3"" wide and is more 'quiet'.  I would wear this with a nice powder blue shirt.

With a smaller size, I think it might‚Äôve landed a little higher up and looked better, but as it is right now, it‚Äôs not really the most flattering thing on me. Cool concept though!

I‚Äôm very confident that there are many items from this brand that I would love- unfortunately, this just wasn‚Äôt one of them.<br /><br />Next, I have no problem with the fabrics used. I like the light grey color. It is soft particularly on the inside, stretchy-comfortable. It is thin enough to be airy and flowy which I like. I can definitely tell I would have loved this if the whole cut/design/shape was just changed completely.<br /><br />Alright, so the part I don‚Äôt like- the way it fits/looks. I‚Äôm not really into crop tops, but I figured this could be nice to lounge in with a tank top underneath or something, but it still looks and feels way too strange because of how huge it is. The length of the arms is insane- I get that you are supposed to pull it up and it would have an oversized look, but it is too much. I would say it probably goes past my fingertips by 5-6 inches. Also, the arms are incredibly wide- so wide that with the hoodie being cropped it nearly creates a square shape when you hold your arms out to the side. It just isn‚Äôt flattering in any way- at least not on me. I saw another reviewer say something similar to this- it is like they made an XXXX-Large hoodie and then cropped it just below the arms.<br /><br />Would I wear this in public? Never.<br />Would I wear this around the house with people around? No.<br />Would I wear it around the house when I‚Äôm alone? It is looking like a no. It just feels really strange wearing something like this.<br /><br />A normal hoodie with this fabric would have probably gotten a 4-5 star review from me. A cropped hoodie that was not so incredibly huge everywhere also could have possibly gotten a favorable review.<br /><br />The fabric, I give a 5 because it is comfortable and breathable. I would give a 1-2 star rating based on design/shape/fit. To be fair, I will give a 3 star rating because it seems well made when it comes to stitching and materials. Perhaps this style just doesn‚Äôt suit me. I‚Äôm not sure what I will do with this hoodie now as it is basically unwearable for me.<br /><br />Anyway, I‚Äôll be sure to update this review if I somehow find a way to wear it or use it. I can‚Äôt really recommend this based on my experience, but some people may actually like it. Like I stated before, please don‚Äôt avoid ordering from this company just because of this item, especially considering I have a dress from them that is awesome!<br /><br />For reference, I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and about 145lbs. I usually wear size 6-8 pants. The tag says medium/large. I felt like I was drowning in this hoodie and yet very exposed at the same time.<br /><br />I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know-thanks! [SEP] I love this sweater, it is oversized and has a very relaxed fit. I wear it around the house and it's very comfortable. [SEP] This hoodie is super comfy. It‚Äôs really soft on the inside. It‚Äôs one-size but looks great. It is a lighter material so it‚Äôs good for cooler summer evenings or breezy days during the fall. In the photos I am wearing this with jeans and a tank top. I think it would look really cute in high-waisted leggings as well. The arms are pretty long which I like because I have really long arms, but they may be too long for someone with short arms. There are no draw strings on this hoodie. The bottom of the hoodie has a raw edge so it slightly curls up. This does seem to wrinkly easily. Overall, really cute, comfortable, casual hoodie! I will be wearing this a lot this Fall!! [SEP] I don't know whether this was intentionally sent to me like this, but it arrived with a huge stain and several small holes in the front. I don't really know what else to say. The pictures speak for themselves. [SEP] This sweatshirt is nice and comfy, the crop isn't too severe, which I like. Definitely a good sweatshirt to snuggle up in in fall weather",3,True

I can say it has and meet every expectation. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great front pocket compact wallet. [SEP] Really like this product. I wanted a front pocket wallet and this fits the bill. Wish it could handle a little more cash on the money clip. [SEP] This company is great, they worked with me until I finally settled on the eclipse. It is the greatest wallet around and I have tried ridge and others. You can‚Äôt beat the product or the customer service. If there was a higher rating than 5 stars they would get it. [SEP] Have been using a Fidelo Carbon Fiber Wallet for about 3 years now, but with the band going around the ""portrait"" portion of the rectangle.  Decided to try one with the band going around the ""landscape"" (wide) part.  I like this much better, as it is easier to get the cards to slide in and out of the wallet. [SEP] I have used this brand for years and love the quality and craftsmanship.  Very pleased with my purchase. [SEP] Nice way to carry money and credit cards. [SEP] This is my second Fidelo wallet. I haven't used other brands, but I haven't had any issue with Fidelo. The RFID blockers adds pretty good thickness to the wallet, but it's not terrible. Looking at the product initially, I thought I was going to have trouble getting my cards in and out, but I don't. I also like how the money clip flares out to product your cash. [SEP] I ordered this in need of a minimalist wallet because the one I own was not able to hold all my cards and junk.!!! Like I said junk. But as you see my cards, cash,and Junk are all in there I haven‚Äôt even changed the covers yet it‚Äôs good to go for me. Also if you need to carrr more $$ than use the money clip on the other side yes you can get 2 $ clips. [SEP] I wasn't sure how this transition would go, from the ""George Wallet"" to a minimalist. Hubby is a nurse and this fits easily in his scrubs or bag. He has both the money clip and the band attached, but I've noticed that he uses the band for cash. I think it took some getting used to but he was tired of breaking all of his cards along the refer strip, and after using it about a month, I think he really likes it. I like it so much I'm considering ditching the wallet/almost a purse I have for one of these. [SEP] This is a very high quality product and it was a great bargain with Amazon's Christmas deals.  3 options for outside color choices, black, gray and a black pattern.  It even comes with replacement screws, not in a little plastic baggy but in a metal container with a screw on lid. It also includes a screwdriver.  The screw holes are recessed.

Blulu 2 Pieces Soft Satin Head Scarf Sleeping Cap Bonnet Headwear Head Cover Turbans for Women (Set 2),"['Satin', 'Hand Wash Only']",[],,4.1,762,20580,"So very pretty, comfortable and fits really well. I plan to use when driving or riding in the car or truck. I hate having my hair blow in my face  this works well. [SEP] It's hard to keep on because it's slick material.  Looks in picture like it has a round top, but it is actually pointed on top and looks funny.  I really wouldn't buy them again. [SEP] Hides lise of hair [SEP] I bought these to use at night to keep my hair from getting damaged. And while I wish I could tell you all how that went, they were too small to fit both my head and my hair (I tie my hair up on top of my head at night; it's thick 3A hair that goes past my chest). I could wrap them around my head without my hair tied up and they'd be a bit loose but there's not enough room for my hair when its up which is the whole reason I got them. For those of you with smaller heads, thinner or less hair, or who just want to tie them around your head I think these will work beautifully for that purpose which is why I gave a neutral 3-star review.<br /><br />What I can say about them: they are very smooth and silky, however the insides aren't as smooth (I saw another reviewer mention turning them inside out and think that's a smart idea). There's a bit of elastic in the back which gives you some wiggle room and the ties are pretty long (they wrapped around my head twice with a few inches left to tie a bow). They're also really pretty (I got the black and pink combo and they look exactly like the photos). Overall, I would buy these if you think they'll fit your head and hair, or if you just want to wrap them around with your hair down. If they were just a bit bigger I'd recommend them 100% to anyone and everyone.<br /><br />Pros: silky, pretty colors, not too expensive, elastic plus ties to ensure a good fit.<br /><br />Cons: too small to tie your hair up if you have a bigger head, and the insides aren't silky/as smooth. [SEP] My mom loves them [SEP] Cute pattern, but cheaply made in my opinion. The front inseam was torn and I disliked the back design. I'm returning tomorrow. [SEP] Love the scarfs They fit perfect and don‚Äôt come off at night. Very stylish I can wear them out [SEP] A little too big for my small head, but great quality. I love mines. [SEP] They loved it. It has two pieces that you tie and fits on your head like a hat. Its not a triangle type scarf. They love it.  It doesn't slide off your head like the box scarf that you fold into a triangle.

Orchid Row Women's Printed Maxi Chiffon Kimono Ruana Wraps Green,[],[],,4.6,17,723,"This kimono thing looks really awesome. I really enjoyed the look of it. Super light, so it is great for warmer weather. It does come a little past my calves, but not quite to my ankles. [SEP] I wasn't sure what to expect with this ""Kimono"" but it drapes nicely and though it is a light chiffon material provides some cover. It doesn't have a belt or any ties.  I personally use it indoors, mainly as a cover up, but find it an attractive print and material. [SEP] I love this floaty kimono. I decided to use it as outwear and wore it over a black top and jeans. It looked very nice and ""arty"". I tied up the bottom half to shorten it a bit. I also plan to wear this as a beach cover up in the summer. It's quite nice and much better quality than I was expecting. [SEP] While the colors are not as vivid as I'd like this is an attractive kimono. It would look great over a white, off-white or cream dress. [SEP] I have to say that this is the most vivid green I have seen in some time. I have also received the black and white one too -- they are so comfortable. I find the colors vivid, the material is lightweight and practical. I am 5 foot tall and it goes to just above my ankles. I usually wear it over my pajamas as I figure this is perfect for summer and privacy among a house full of teenage boys.<br /><br />I think this is fun to wear -- and my mom agrees too since she received the black and white one. The colors really are vivid and it is hard to feel depressed while wearing these stylish colorful kimono. I am sure that this would be appropriate to wear out of the house too.

It barely wrinkles even when wearing.<br /><br />My kimono is a dark hunter green with flower designs in shades of red, pink, royal blue, white, beige, black.  It is very attractive.  It does not has a closure but that's OK.  This kimono would also look great with a pair of jeans with a tee shirt.  Or one evening I wore it with black dress slacks and a black turtleneck and I must say it looked every elegant.  However, as stated, it is my summer robe.<br /><br />This is comfortable and easy to care for.  You can let your fashion imagination run wild and wear this to any number of places with so many different and unique outfits.<br /><br />Makes a great gift for yourself or someone you care for. [SEP] I have gotten a lot of compliments on this Kimono. The colors are very pretty - I love the combination of the green and the floral motif. It's very comfortable to wear and really dresses up a tank top and jeans. [SEP] I wear this as an outer layer with a tank top and leggings or a skirt. It serves well as office wear, adding a bit of color and flair to the office environment. It keeps my arms covered enough that I am not assaulted by the office's overly enthusiastic air conditioning, and looks good in the process.

"Prottoni 40"" Garment Bag - Carry on Suit Bag with Shoulder Strap - Water Resistant",[],[],,4.0,20,253534,"I just began a job that requires a lot of travel. I purchased this bag to use as a personal item on flights. So far I have used it for one trip and it worked excellent! I put my laptop, purse and other electronic items in it, along with some snacks, toiletries, and reading material. It is slightly larger than the airline requirements, but I did not have it full, so there was no problem and it easily fit under the seat. Then for the week I used it as a laptop bag to carry items to the client (including a pair of walking shoes to use on the walk back to the hotel). Worked like a charm and I highly recommend! [SEP] This item is a must have for short trips!  I am a presenter and have 3 back to back days of teaching, and since I have to put other equipment in my carry on I needed a bag that fit under a plane seat for my clothing and essentials.  This bag is perfect for my 3 day trips.  It fits a pair of shoes, 3 outfits, and essentials very nicely.  It also has great exterior pockets that I put my tablet and other things I want to be able to access easily in the airport and on the plane.  This fits under the seat on American Airlines and United without trouble and leaves some leg room as well.  The quality of the bag is also exceptional, especially given the price.  It is easily comparable to a Samsonite bag that was priced at about four times what I paid for this.  It is also better than a lot of the underseat duffels I looked at because the pockets are so accessible on the outside. Which is important for me in the airport because I like to keep my ID cards, boarding passes, etc. tucked away but easy to access as I navigate the airport. I would make this purchase again and again, and if you are looking for an underseat option that can fit a good bit of stuff, I would highly suggest this bag! [SEP] Had to return this bag as it simply wouldn't meet our needs. Below are detailed the pros, cons, and neutral points of interest (if any).<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Feels VERY sturdy, including zippers (but see below); fabric is pretty hefty and handles are attached with metal hardware. I was really happy with how strong this bag felt and was all the more disappointed that the design flaws were dealbreakers. :(<br />-Fairly convenient size and shape.<br />-Decent lining, feels like it could wipe clean readily.<br /><br />NEUTRAL<br />-Strap is wide but unpadded. Could be comfortable for a modest amount of walking<br />-Has some 'skid protection' on the bottom, in the form of a couple of textured 'pads' of a hefty, flexible material. Marking this as a 'neutral feature, however, since they are both placed more or less in the center. I'm not sure how much protection they offer the bottom of the bag, especially the corners where wear is most likely. Almost a con.<br />-Clothing straps are flimsy elastic. They're functional, but I suspect they will lose elasticity in a hurry<br /><br />CONS:<br />-The padding situation on this bag was bizarre. The inner walls of the bag are well padded. These are the walls that touch your (presumably soft and not fragile) clothes. The outer pockets--where one is likely to place fragile electronics--are NOT padded. The closest you can get to padded protection for a tablet or laptop would be the zippered mesh compartment in the 'suitcase lid.' The listing shows what appears to be a small laptop in the mesh pocket, but the mesh is NOT strong enough to hold anything heavy; plus, you would then have to expose your clothing in order to access the electronics for any reason. Very poor design.<br />-The outermost side pocket is where there SHOULD be pen storage and little pockets for a notebook, wallet, etc. It's only about the thickness of the zipper, so it's too narrow for anything else.<br />-Instead, they have fairly useless pockets in the INNER side zipper pocket, in what SHOULD be a padded electronics pocket. Please note there is ZERO padding on the outside of this pocket, and the listing photo shows a laptop/tablet stored there. I would not wish to keep my electronics there.<br />-This one is a DOOZY. There are two arched zippers on either end of the bag. I say 'arched zippers' rather than 'compartments' because there is NO SPACE WHATSOEVER there! It's like opening a door into a blank wall! The space is literally the width of the zipper. What can you put in it? A pack of gum? A tiny notebook? You wouldn't want to put anything valuable, like cash or coins there (about the only other things that could fit) because it's a single zip--you have to unzip all the way around (or at least from bottom to middle top) to access it, and there's a good chance it would fall out in the process.<br />I cannot adequately express how disappointed I was in this. I had hoped against hope that one of these compartments led to a shoe or dirty clothes bag. If it had, I would have overlooked the other issues with the bag and happily kept it.<br />-One of the zippers (the track, not the zipper pull) was bent due to the way the bag was folded for shipping. It catches each time you try to use it. Again, had there been a shoe compartment, I probably would have tried to re-shape the bag and re-condition the zipper, which otherwise seemed strong.<br /><br />Wish list for re-designing this bag:<br />-move the organization pockets to the outermost compartment, add a pen slot or two<br />-pad the compartment next to that one for electronics<br />-get rid of the absurd arched zippers on the ends--and replace one of them with an actual shoe/dirty clothes compartment! (Yes, I know it would impinge on the clothing storage space, but it's such a great feature.)<br />-KEEP the wonderfully sturdy construction and apparently tough zippers.<br />-KEEP the protection on the bottom of the bag, but add at least two more and maybe a center 'dot,' and position them better to better protect the base.<br /><br />If that golden day of re-design arrives, we'll gladly get a replacement. Until then--we returned it unused. Maybe it will find a home where these design issues won't be deal breakers. [SEP] My only complaint is it's not a stiff/hard sided bag. Still can't find the 'perfect' bag for two laptops, CPAP, SoClean, and toiletry liquids for airline travel. [SEP] Why spend big money on a big name brand boarding bag when you can get this excellent, moderately priced, bag that arrived intact and on time - excellent product. [SEP] Nice bag but bigger than I wanted. I love the sleeve on the back. It sits nicely on top of my carry on bag. I just wish that it was a little smaller. Nicely made. Worth the money. [SEP] Despite what the description says, the measurements of this bag when folded once are:<br /><br />23 width X 21.5 inches tall. The thickness would be whatever you put in it. [SEP] seems very nice [SEP] Bot this for my husband-HE LOVES IT! [SEP] I purchased this boarding bag for an upcoming trip. I haven't used it yet, but I am impressed by the workmanship of the bag (very sturdy fabric and construction) and its details.  I appreciate the outer organizing pockets, which are just right for passport, credit card, wallet and more, as well as the fact that it opens flat for packing. There is a shoulder strap plus a handle on the bag itself. The size appears ample to fit a change of clothes, my purse, a kindle, a makeup bag, a camera, a glasses case, small umbrella, and everything else I would plan to carry on, without being overly large, a really convenient size and shape. It could fit in the overhead bin or a plane or even under the seat in front of me. There is even a pass through strap on the back that just fits my rolling suitcase handles, so I can slip it easily over the handles and then wheel both together. I am very pleased with this purchase!",3,True

Orchid Row's Women's Fashionable Everyday Lace Trim Lightweight Travel Scarf Spice,[],[],,4.1,20,6283,"This scarf is pretty. The color is something like a muted paprika. I thought it looked like something a bit fuller than what it actually is, but it is more of a long thin scarf than a square type scarf. The fabric is sort of scratchy and not as smooth as I would like. I will wear this over clothes as an accent piece but not wrapped multiple times around my neck for warmth. It just doesn't feel great on my skin. [SEP] The spice color this lightweight scarf is beautiful. It is a rich red that is universally flattering. The scraf itself is 100% polyester and trimmed with nylon lace. The fabric is soft and sheer. Versatile, it can be used as a scarf, shawl, belf or headcover. It travels well. Although the directions say to hand wash I have successfully laundered in a lingerie bag in cold water on the gentle cycle and line dried. Turned out perfect. The only criticism I have is osf the lace trim. I do not like the raw, unfinsihed edges. I realize that the finge, eyelashlook is popular but to me it looks sloppy and cheapens an otherwise attractive accessory. Not a deal breaker because it is otherwise a lovely scarf. [SEP] I'm very pleased with this scarf. It's lightweight as described and would travel well since it wouldn't take up much room. It's made of polyester and nylon and has lace around the edges. The color I have is an attractive orange-red shade. The size of the scarf makes it versatile since it could be used as a lightweight shawl or as a scarf, which could be tied in a number of way. I'm pleased with the color and the style of this scarf. [SEP] Beautiful Scarf!<br /><br />It has a simple lace detail and easy to dress up or down. Perfect for cooler days. I tried it on under a jean jacket and it looked amazing.<br /><br />It is a bit sheer and there are a number of ways to style and wear this scarf. The color is bright and fun and the look is very feminine. It may not be warm enough for extremely cold days but otherwise, a very nice scarf! [SEP] This is a beautifully made fashion accessory that really draws attention in a classy way.  The color is vibrant and the lace is beautifully constructed.  When first taking it out of the package, it appears to be almost shear.  But as you fold it and actually wrap it around the neck, it has a more substantial look and feel.  It makes a beautiful gift for the woman with sophistication. [SEP] ..the color is wonderful. It's still a little warm for me to put anything around my neck. My granddaughter borrowed for dinner in a nice restaurant and said she used it as a,wrap instead of around her neck but knows it will be lovely to wear with her favorite dress so sounds like she'll have to borrow again. I washed and air dried a couple of times now and it's constructed well, sewing, has held together great. I do love the color! [SEP] To keep my shoulders warm [SEP] What a pretty, lightweight scarf. This will be perfect for fall or spring because of its' weight. I love the color. True to image. Size is as described.The drape is nice in the beginning, but it tends to sort of just &#34;hang&#34; there and needs to be fluffed up so it doesn't look like a narrow, long piece of fabric just hanging there. This is generally why I prefer scarves with more weight/bulk. However, this is a nice addition to my collection. Hand wash, line dry, iron if necessary. I already ironed due to the creases from being folded for shipment. It ironed beautifully. I will not hand wash it, I can tell you that much. I will wash on the delicate cycle, cold water and hang to dry. Hopefully, it will hold up. [SEP] This is a very nice lightweight scarf (the body is a sheer polyester weave and the lace trim is nylon) and it is not bulky at all. I can feel swallowed up by scarves like this that are too stiff and/or bulky. This has a nice lankiness to it.<br /><br />It is long enough to be twisted and knotted in a number of ways. I walked into a store in France once, wearing a scarf like this, looped once around as in the photo. The saleswoman clucked a couple of times before running over and showing me a bunch of different ways to tie and wear these scarves in hopes that I would see the error in my ways. I have not looked back since, so I highly recommend looking up a couple of scarf how-to's on the internet and making the leap from loop-and-droop to everyday French chic!<br /><br />Other notes:<br />‚Äî The color is gorgeous - a saturated coral, but &#34;spice&#34; as the manufacturer calls it also works - and wearing it instantly gives my skin a rosy cast.<br />‚Äî It is an easy travel piece. I hung mine in the bathroom while showering and the steam eased out any wrinkles it had from being folded in my suitcase.<br />‚Äî Hand washable.<br />Bottom line: This is a welcome addition to my wardrobe, especially for travel when I can use to add a big splash of flattering color to the neutral palette I travel with. It's a gorgeous color for any season. [SEP] This is a really nice scarf. It's high quality material, light but durable feeling, and the color is gorgeous. I love pairing this with a black or white shirt and jeans/leggings. It's large, which means you can unfold it and use it as a shawl in a pinch if you're cold. I knocked off one star for two reasons: First, while it's durable enough to hold up to the two trips I've already taken it on, I wouldn't put this in the washing machine. And considering I'm not the cleanest eater and always spill on myself, that's frustrating. It's definitely a hand wash item. Second, it's a little expensive for what it is. But all in all, it's an attractive scarf and I'm glad I have it.",3,True

GLADDON MODA Shoulder Bags for women Black Grey,[],[],,4.0,14,588,"I am personally not crazy about this bag because it is so large. It fits my 12.9"" iPad with its cover with no problem and has room to spare for wallet, phone, keys, etc.<br /><br />The front is buff colored with two strips of dark brown and a buckle in the middle as decoration. The reverse side has a generous zippered pocket that will fit a small writing pad. The interior is a snap closure with one zippered pocket and two slip pockets on the opposite side.<br /><br />There is a regular carry handle and also a longer shoulder strap. What is interesting is that the shorter carry handle is gray to match the gray strip down the middle of the bag. However, the should strap is buff colored to match the rest of the bag.<br /><br />In addition to the above, the bag also comes with a ""Moda labeled"" clear plastic string-backpack-type ""bag"" shown in the last photo.<br /><br />In summary, this bag is not for me as I do not like its large size, shape, and style.  It is made of faux leather and looks and feels cheap to me in person. The cloth interior feels nice, though and the zippers glide easily. On the positive side, since it is made of PU leather, it is easily cleaned and maintained. It is spacious but I was not looking for something so large. It is functional and useful but, after having seen it, is not my style. However, if someone is looking for a large bag that gives the appearance of leather from a distance, then this might fit the bill. [SEP] This is a really well made pleather handbag.  Great shape, lot's of pockets and stylish.  I'm just not cray about the color.  It's like a dirty gray.  The stripes and the ring help offset the problem I have with the color.  It's the right size without being to big.  I think it's a more casual handbag.  Their are two straps.  The shorts one is wider for a more up close and personal feel or you can use the longer one for a cross body effect or just to wear it as a shoulder bag. [SEP] The size is big but such a nice good looking bag. I love it and the packaging is very nice . [SEP] My wife reports that this bag is a quality product and made of nice materials but its just not her style. [SEP] This bag looks nice (keep in mind it is not made of real leather) and it is quite large. Ideal for carrying tablets, books and other bulky staff. As a mom, I appreciate the value of a bag that can fit all I need in one place. It comes in a neutral beige color with some grey and black details. The metals are golden and it a longer strap is included. It is a practical bag for everyday use. [SEP] This Gladdon Moda Shoulder Bag is a nice contemporary bag that has enough room to carry everything you need. It's a bit larger than most of the bags that I carry, but I have two daughters and a granddaughter who will love it. It is made of PU leather [fake leather] that is easily cleaned. There is an outside pocket where you can put your cell phone or anything else that you need to get to quickly. It comes with a clear duffle type backpack, too. Although this isn't my favorite bag, it is a nice bag that will work for anyone who likes larger bags. [SEP] Beautiful bag very stylish a bigger size tote it came with a longer strap which confuses me as the shorter one does not come off.  However I like the shorter one so I‚Äôm totally ok with that I would recommend as it is a very nice purse . I‚Äôm giving it only 4 stars due to the strap issue [SEP] Got this for the wife thinking it would be just what she'd like, and she does, but she prefers smaller handbags, as this one is a bit larger than I thought it was. Plenty of storage pockets, a great leather feel, a zippered side pocket, and a sturdy strap. I'll go ahead and give it to my daughter, as she like these larger bags, and the style and color (a darker tan), goes with just about everything, and the way it's made, it should last a long time. I don't think it's too big, but what do I know about fashion other than 'thinking' this is a nice gift...and it IS.

My husband says he wishes the watch face was just a little easier to read. Since it doesn‚Äôt have numbers, those thin little boxes can blur together at first glance. It comes in a nice box, on a mini, puffy pillow, making it an easy item to gift. I‚Äôd recommend this watch if you want something very basic, functional, and inexpensive. [SEP] This old fashion watch has an old-school charm to it that‚Äôs great for the older gentleman, or for folks that like vintage style. Featuring the weekday, date, and time, it is also functional. Attractive case, nice band, and a simple, clean face. [SEP] This is a basic watch . Nothing fancy . It‚Äôs an analog watch . Cheap materiel . [SEP] I have to say, there isn't a lot to this watch, there's no bells, no whistles, no smart connection to your phone.... instead you have a watch of classic simple elegance that pairs well with casual or evening attire.  It defines class. [SEP] The watch came packaged poorly - and the box was broken, which was an initial disappointment. Overall this is a very basic watch.  Cheap materials, vinyl band. It is very readable, and would be ideal for someone with poorer eyesight. The design is clean and simple. [SEP] The Alloro Men's Day and Date Quartz Analog Wrist Watch is a decent men's watch for someone who is looking for a mid-level work/casual watch.  Although its about 1/2"" thick, it is not heavy (which tells me the quartz face is pretty thin.  The packaging states that it was made in India.<br /><br />The watch displays Hour/Minute/Second, the date, and the day (with Sunday in red).  The windings of the watch are loose as the hour/minute hand swing very quickly when adjusted.  Does not give you a sense of high quality (as several of my other watches do).  The face is a nice white color so it is easy to read the time and the numbers are black roman numerals.  The Date & Day are also large enough for me to read without being either TOO large or make me wish I had my reading glasses on.<br /><br />The back of the watch is stainless steel so it is theoretically scratch resistant.  Its also has ""A Quality Watch"" printed on the back which if you have to say it implies that its not.  The band is some type of leather and I'm not a fan.  Its thin and short (and I have narrow wrists) and the adjustable strap doesn't stay on the end of the band (its too wide) so I'm constantly fiddling with the watch.  Will end up buying a new band sometime.<br /><br />At this time, the Alloro Men's Day and Date Quartz Analog Wrist Watch is not priced, but because of the quality level I would assume its in the $20-25 range.  If its priced higher than that, I will lower my review because it isn't worth that much.  It isn't a WalMart special $15 watch, but its not a $40-$50 mid-level watch either.",3,True

I had to read the description carefully to figure that one out. The shirt is pretty thin and light weight. The material is just ok. It‚Äôs not as soft as I had imagined.

Take one star off cause I think it is overpriced [SEP] This shirt is smaller than I'm used to in a size medium(I'm 5'4, 135 lb, small busted), I usually get a medium to have some room but this is snug. I'd definitely size up for a relaxed fit t-shirt. It also doesn't have any give to it. It isn't as expected with the description of an ""ultra soft fleece lightweight"" shirt. It's not soft, not stretchy and not fleece like in any way. It reminds me of an H&M t-shirt in the cut, definitely a slim fit. Overall I was disappointed..

My only issues were it was more like a choker on me so then the tiers going down just looked ridiculous. I am going to need an extender. [SEP] This is a pretty necklace. It doesn't have the highest quality look or feel to it, but it's not bad either. The chain has a shiny look to it and the moon/stars have a bit of sparkle to them, too. I do think I would have liked it better a little longer, but it's a nice in between length. The shorter part isn't a choker. It's not *that* short, but it's closer to my neck. It's a nice casual option for certain necklines. It comes with a gift box, bag, cleaning cloth, and a little card. I do think it'd make a nice gift for younger ladies(maybe teen/tween).

This necklace is very light weight and dainty. I love how it looks in person.  It's very pretty and sparkly.

The chains do get twisted up on my neck.  I also feel like I have to adjust the moon because it keeps flipping around.<br />It comes in a nice giftable box. [SEP] The packaging gets the highest marks. It comes in a nice box inside of a pink velvet bag. It's ready for gifting right out of the package. The necklace itself looks nice and it sits at a good length. The only issue I have is that the product description is right on; the necklace is ""Dainty"". I'm not referring to the size of the charm, because that's actually a perfect size. The necklace feels like it's one small tug away from breaking. It doesn't feel cheap, but it does feel like it's kind of delicate. [SEP] The packaging is pretty--a drawstring pink cloth bag with a white box inside. The delicate moon seemed like a good idea, but it just didn't work for me. I had trouble figuring out the double layers and difficulty using the clasp to put it on. The extender is a good idea, but didn't really help.  It was much shorter than I expected--the chain with the moon began above my collar bone. I had so much trouble taking it off that I finally just pulled on it and, of course, the delicate chain broke.  Others seem to have better luck, but this just didn't work for me. [SEP] This is a great piece for either layering or wearing on its own. It's well-made and has a dainty, delicate design. I am impressed by the quality of this. It was a lot nicer than I was expecting. [SEP] Very pretty and dainty necklace. Love the star and the moon. I felt the charms could have been slightly bigger and would have created a much more eye catching elegant appearance. But still enjoy it for how it looks around my neck with a vneck or low cut top on. [SEP] Pros: The necklace is really shiny and pretty. It hangs nicely when you first put it on. The jewels are petite and expensive looking<br />Cons: The chain tangles up almost instantly. It might be good for a dinner night, but if you are going out and moving around the multiple chains wrap up into each other and it looks bad [SEP] This necklace is so pretty! I love how small and cute it is. The gold is really shiny so it stands out a lot but I think it's the perfect amount of shine to brighten up an outfit. Like any necklace that's stacked, it does tangle but that's a given. The necklace is very comfortable and doesn't pinch the skin! I've gotten so many compliments since I started wearing it.

They seem like lounge pants only. The tie around the waist and belt loops is unnecessary to me. I think the company should rethink this fabric due to the pilling that I have experienced with another pair of their pants and now these. This fabric just doesn‚Äôt look like something to wear out.<br /><br />These also aren‚Äôt my favorite lounge pants by them. I have two other jogger style lounge pants by this brand that I really like. They both use a similar fabric that is so soft and different form this fabric.

"YEEPSYS Biker Shorts for Women High Waist Workout Yoga Shorts with Pockets Running Shorts Pants Non See-Through 8"" (Smoky Black, L)","['Pull On closure', 'Hand Wash Only']",[],,4.2,26,6780,"They're alright. They fit as expected but they're more sheer than other similar shorts that I've had. They're breathable, though. Comfortable. No issues with the seams [SEP] These are nice workout shorts, but I got them just to wear around the house, as I don't wear shorts to exercise. They are stitched very well and the fabric is quite substantial. It has a nice stretch to it and bounces back without getting distorted. I love the pockets, even though I probably won't be using them very much other than maybe a tissue.<br />For reference, I ordered a size CAXL/USL. I'm 4'11"" and have a 39"" hip and 32"" waist, and they fit great. This size fits without being too loose or too tight. They hit about 4"" above my knee. They will be nice and comfortable for the summertime. I will machine wash them in cold water and hang or lay them flat to dry to help keep them looking new. [SEP] I have long & thick legs, so finding shorts that are long enough and don‚Äôt roll up is a chore. I also like having a pocket on the sides. These don‚Äôt have a ton of tummy support but I don‚Äôt really mind. These are more of a casual biker short, though it has worked fine when I‚Äôve exercised in them. [SEP] I have multiple pairs of shorts similar to these that I use for running -- I like the pockets and fit better than traditional running shorts.<br /><br />These, however, seem to slide more than the other pairs I have. I don't know if the stretch is just tighter or if the seam is slightly shorter than most of my shorts, but when I run a decent distance, the legs slide up slightly and they're less comfortable. They work fine when I'm on my bike. Beyond that, they look nice, have a good fit, and have worn very well after multiple uses. [SEP] I picked up a pair of these women‚Äôs biker shorts for my wife and she‚Äôs quite happy with them. In her words:<br /><br />I wanted a longer leg, higher waist, but no seat padding for shorter rides. These shorts are perfect. The fabric is soft and breathable with a jersey-like feel. (Note, the description says they are 88% polyester, but my tag says they are made from 88% nylon and 12% spandex ‚Äì no polyester).<br /><br />I would describe the fit as firm, but not tight with no gaps around the leg. The pockets are deep and wide enough for my Samsung phone. I normally wear a size 12, so ordered a Large. I didn‚Äôt realize this was CN large and US medium, but they fit perfectly the first time I put them on. However, be advised ‚Äì if you plan to run them through the washer and dryer (which I do), you might want to order a size up, because they shrunk just a bit (not enough to prevent wearing them again). Other than the shrinkage, they came through the first wash just fine ‚Äì no frayed seams, no pilling, and the same soft jersey-like feel. [SEP] The fabric is not smooth and stretchy as it supposed to be. US size M is larger than normal. Side pockets are pros. [SEP] These shorts are fabulous.<br />They wash well, they feel comfortable, they are pretty breathable (when I was sweating in them I didn‚Äôt feel all nasty).<br />The fit is great - true to size. The pockets fit my iPhone nicely. Good size pockets.<br />Overall really really happy with them. [SEP] This biker shorts has side pockets, perfect for carrying your mobile phone. It‚Äôs comfortable, soothes the tummy, and best value for money. [SEP] Fit true to size!<br />Very comfortable<br />Made well with great material<br />Overall highly impressed! [SEP] My wife reviews these:<br />I like the fit and feel of these bikers. Worn for walking and yoga workout with no rubbing, slipping, or discomfort. Seams are good. They have a little stretch and compression. My initial reaction to the waistband was hesitancy--it has about a .5"" piece of elastic that runs through it. I thought it might cut in, roll, or cinch my stomach. It didn't. It's not something I've seen in other workout shorts or pants but it works in this product. True to size.

They come in a soft case and a tagboard box, and both were crushed in the mail, so the sunglasses I received were squished in places. I tried to bend them back but the nose pieces are so thin I was worried I'd snap them. So they're still uneven.  They're for smaller/narrower faces, and the lenses are a little taller than I like. But for a smaller person they'd be really cute if you got a pair that wasn't crushed. [SEP] These sit on the bridge of the nose and are not real comfortable. They do a good job of blocking the sun and they look ok for my oval shaped face but I don't wear them for long periods of time because they get uncomfortable.

It really needs to be at least one size smaller because it just sort of hangs on me.  I love the coloring and style of this skirt and the pleats are phenomenally well done. [SEP] I wanted to LOVE this. I find it gorgeous in person and absolutely adore the skirt. The fabric feels luxurious and the pattern is just the right amount. Even the waist band has some shimmer running through it, but it all works and isn't too much.<br /><br />I am 5'3 and a size L/ 10/12 with an hourglass figure. I was so disappointed that way it flairs off the waistband added extra bulk to where I didn't want it. This may look fantastic on a slim frame, but I don't find it flattering for my figure :( Bummed! [SEP] At first glance, this skirt gives one an impression of elegance. The color is nice and the velvet has a nice feel. I think the waistband, which is black elastic is a little loose. My one complaint with this skirt is that the bottom edge is not hemmed. Not only is it not hemmed but the cut is not straight and has a bit of a rough look if examined closely. Now, this could have been given a small zigzag stitch that would have covered this nicely - I have done this before on fabric that wouldn't take turning well.  I gave the fabric a bit of between friction and the velvet does fray slightly so this might be an issue if you would be doing a bit of sliding into and out of cars or chairs.<br /><br />I received this skirt via Amazon's Vine Program with no expectations but that I provide my honest opinion all thoughts expressed are my own. [SEP] This skirt is a mauve color, it is pleated which is all the rage right now. It has the leopard print design on one side of the pleat. So from one angle you see mostly the mauve color and from another angle you see more leopard print. it is a velvety type material and has an elastic waist. The waist band has the extra feature of having two lines all the way around, that are a slight sparkle look, to give it a little bit of a classy design over being just plain black elastic. Several different sizes could wear this. The size is Large which I wear and it fits me but I almost wish I had a medium. So I think good two sizes bigger than me could wear this with no problem.

They come with two straps, one short and one a little longer.  The short strap has a chain looking thing with the strap woven through and the longer strap is just a thin piece of (vinyl) something or other that looks pretty cheap.  The purses are small for sure so in that way exactly what I was looking for but about all that fits inside is my phone (barely), license, debit card and if I squeeze it really hard, my keys.  Once my items were in the bag I had a hard time closing it but managed to make it work.  There is a pocket inside which is a total waste of fabric because so little can actually be put in the bag you just don't need it. [SEP] This is a pretty purse and works okay for a night out.

It doesn't have a button. [SEP] I'm a big fan of having some classic black basic pieces in my wardrobe for every season. This Charis Allure open front blazer misses the mark on a few issues for me. The blazer is lined which is a plus but the outer fabric, although lightweight and ideal for warmer weather, is a structured polyester weave and not a fabric I'm usually drawn to. They have also added sewn in shoulder pads which give's the blazer even more of a prominent silhouette. The blazer sits at waist length sitting shorter in the back and tapering longer in the front. Quiet honestly the shape reminds me of a maitred or server's jacket. Don't get me wrong, it looks good on but the shoulder pads are throwing me off as I haven't worn them since the 80's.  I think that I'll probably sew a hook and eye on the front to be able to close it and give it a more finished appearance. The biggest problem with the fit is the length of the arms. I am 5'6"", 127lbs and I usually have a problem with sleeves being too short for my lanky long arms. The arms on this Charis Allure blazer are inches too long. I've posted a photo to show you how they come down to my middle knuckles. So please keep that in mind as you may have a bit of alterations to do. I've posted some photos, one close up of the fabric and a couple more with me wearing it. I'm a failure at taking selfies but wanted to give you a better idea of what this looks like. I'm going to leave this one up to you, depending on your needs this may be the perfect blazer for your needs, but I honestly don't think it sparks joy for me. I do hope I've helped you out a bit with your choice. [SEP] The medium fits to size and seems to fit even over light weight sweaters easily. It's collarless and no button closure. The back and waist taper nicely inward. the seams on the back and waist are done very well. Despite the fit, I really didn't like the material. It's kind of a rough lined material that reminds me of the blankets that airlines used to give to its sleeping passengers. I'm also not too fond of the shoulder pads. It seems very old fashioned. Overall, it's ok for work purposes even if it seems really conservative. [SEP] The fact that I would even use wonderful to describe a blazer is saying something. Blazers are something I tend to only wear for interview and professional meeting situations. I ordered this at the same time as a 3/4 length sleeve blazer from the same brand, and when that one came first I was dreading getting this one in the mail because that one me and a few friends could share it because it was so wide. This one, on the other hand, was pretty darn close to a perfect fit. It is lined and actually reasonable comfortable, and it has real pockets. The outer fabric is not super refined which makes it look more casual, so I probably wouldn't wear it for an interview, but I wore it over a dress to go grocery shopping and it felt good. I think it will be good to dress a little nicer on travel days, or to wad up in the bottom of a bag for an emergency wardrobe change. The fabric does seem to be very forgiving in the wrinkle-potential arena. [SEP] The sleeves are too large. I like the color and the fabric. Light weight. [SEP] The Charis Allure Women's Casual Work Office Open Front Blazer Jacket is stylish and well made. The jacket works equally well with a dress, skirts or even jeans. My wife finds this to be one of her favorite jackets.",3,True

Remove the split ring, of course, and save it for your keychain. I like that these are thicker than the thinner ones usually sold for hair. They don't tangle as easily and don't pull my hair.

I LOVE the subtle colors - they just about match everything in my wardrobe. This was a delightful find! [SEP] This 5 pack of coil wristband key chain set is great! They are made of high quality material, durable, and great value for the money. Each wristband comes with a metal keychain to add keys. The coils are flexible, durable and when stretched they go back to the original size and shape. I highly recommend this versatile keychain. [SEP] I was surprised when I opened these that they were so rigid. Barely any spring or stretch. I put it on my wrist and it actually felt awful. My wrists are small-average size, and while it fit it was really uncomfortable. The plastic is hard and doesn't move. And, I noticed that two of the bands had seams that were already falling apart. I was expecting a soft, stretchy band that would be easy to take off",3,True

With copper being the base metal, I can expect that in time, the copper will cause the jewelry to turn green. If you are one of those that has an issue with plated material, this will probably not work well for you. [SEP] SEUSUK Moon Necklace Gold Pendant Dainty 14K Gold Fill Waxing Waning Moon Lunar Phase is a pretty and delicate pendant necklace. I worried a little about the chain but the young family member that it was meant for is fine with it. For her, the main thing was the clasp. If she was good with the clasp, the rest was fine. She likes the pendant as she is not into clunky jewelry. She prefers more subtle pieces which is why I decided to select it to try out and she's happy with it so I am happy with it too. [SEP] This is a very cute and delicate gold necklace - the pendant is shaped like the crescent moon. The pendant is about the size of a dime, so if you're into subtle jewelry, this is for you. The gold chain is on the thin side, so it will probably tangle easily - that would be my only critique. Otherwise it's elegant and classy, perfect for all occasions. [SEP] I don't think I received the correct necklace.  I got a quarter moon gold colored necklace that's real cheap. [SEP] It's obvious that this isn't an expensive or high quality necklace, but it still looks nice. It's simple, but lovely, and works well with a large variety of outfits. I didn't find it irritating on the back of my neck like some necklaces I've tried. It's also adjustable, which is perfect for coordinating with various necklines. It's not fancy, but I really like it. [SEP] I normally never wear gold because I'm not fond of it.  But I think when it comes to moons, starts, and other celestial shapes, it doesn't have the gaudy look that I normally associate with it.  So I opted for this.<br /><br />And I was mostly very pleased with it.  It's a simple pendant, of a crescent moon with some texture.  Yes, it doesn't look like an expensive piece of jewelry.  But it's nice and dainty and goes well with a lot of my work shirts.  The chain is thin but I haven't noticed it tangling in my hair (and I ever wore it to bed to test this theory). It unsnaps easily but I imagine too much force would be easy to snap the chain so it's not a piece of children.<br /><br />Pretty, and I like the texture on the moon.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2019 [SEP] This is a cute little necklace that has a nice weight to it and looks nice. I like that the chain is adjustable. Perfect gift for a teen girl, young woman, or a New Agey type who likes the moon. [SEP] This looks much more expensive than what its selling for. Its an absolutely beautiful piece and very delicate. The chain is lighter than what I would prefer and my hair gets twined up into it, but its so beautiful and the price is right...  This would be a perfect shower gift or favor. [SEP] This necklace has a very thin chain and a very small pendant, and would probably only be good for a young girl.  I suspect that the woman in the product photo is very petite.<br /><br />This item is 14k gold fill, which if you know much about jewelry, it means that its probably going to be hypoallergenic, which is a good thing.  But it also means it has an extremely small amount of actual gold in it. It would be difficult to consider this as buying an asset that will hold value.<br /><br />I think this would be good for a gift.  Overall, I don't really recommend it. [SEP] This is a ""fashion jewelry"" necklace that is not going to hold up well over time.  it is cute and I will wear it but I will be sure to take if off when I get home, not get it wet or leave it on overnight.  I like it but i am realistic that it is not a durable piece and will take precautions.",3,True
"Awesome 360 Men's Cotton Stretch Classic Fit Boxer Briefs, Grey, 3 Pack, L",['Machine Wash'],[],,4.2,9,9414,"This hits nearly all the marks that I find important in a pair of underwear. First off, they are comfortable. The fabric is very soft, and thick enough to be substantial, but not so thick that they hold in a lot of heat. The elastic waistband is snug but not binding, and there's no tag or seam to cause irritation.  The legs do not ride up. It does not have a fly opening but I'm fine with that.  I've not had any fabric shrinking after laundering (including drying them in a drier on medium heat). No loose threads or poor stitching.<br /><br />The only mark that it falls just a bit short is the fabric fiber. I normally prefer 100% cotton for the breathability. This is only 30% cotton with the balance being poly. That's great for durability wash after wash, but I would prefer a higher cotton content -- perhaps 50% -- to balance out the poly. These have been comfortable even though it's been quite hot, but I'd still prefer just a bit more cotton in the mix.<br /><br />But even with just 30% cotton, these have more than enough positives for me to consider them as excellent boxer briefs. [SEP] My husband always wears this type of boxer brief, even in the hot Arizona summer, and the ones he has been buying are pretty expensive. There is no current price listing for these, but as a lesser known brand, I would expect them to be a better value.<br /><br />The fabric of these is lighter than his other ones, and that is a good thing here. The elastic is more comfortable for him, too. Overall, he really likes these. There is no fly opening, but he never uses that anyway, even on his that have the opening.<br /><br />Once these are available again, you'll have to comparison shop, but if they are reasonably priced, I'd certainly get them for him again.

I‚Äôm glad I did.<br />  They are pretty comfortable. They‚Äôre 70% cotton, so enough to breathe and feel like cotton but, they are 30% polyester, so they won‚Äôt shrink too much. I do think a little more form for support would be better, compared to my normal wear but, these are also Completely new to me, as I said so, I do like them and have the feeling I will actually start to use this style in the future.<br />  My only other concern is longevity. I only say this because, they seem so thin. I‚Äôm sure this is a part of why they‚Äôre So comfortable and for that, I‚Äôm happy. I simply want longevity. I won‚Äôt know that, without Time.

[SEP] [[VIDEOID:939e09d6f9f2b4ce94172c648ae9a1e]] Review of:  Forcool Arch Supoort Snow Socks, Merino Wool Knee High Padded Breathable Outdoor Anti-blister Race Skiing Socks for Youth Men Women, 1 Pair Medium Dark Red<br /><br />While I don‚Äôt hit the slopes anymore (my knees can‚Äôt handle it), I do attempt to walk as much as I can.  Usually, anywhere from 6 to 8 miles a day.  And I know first hand how critically important it is to have on a decent pair of socks ‚Ä¶ they have to be think enough to provide good cushion, they have to be smooth and comfortable to wear, they have to fit well and they have to keep your feet both cool and dry.<br /><br />A 7 plus miles walk earlier today showed that the ‚ÄòForcool Merino Wool Socks‚Äô come out with marks in every one of those categories.<br /><br />After the end of my walk, my feet felt fine.  No hotspots, no spots where blisters might form ‚Ä¶ both feet were both cool and comfortable.  Very nice.<br /><br />I normally wear around a size 7 in shoes and the size medium socks I received are a perfect fit.  It is so nice to be able to wear a pair of socks that actually fit correctly and not have to settle for a sock that will fit anywhere from a size 6 to a size 12.  Kudos to Forcool for not putting out a ‚Äòone-size-fits-all‚Äô type sock since those type socks never fit anyone really well.<br /><br />There are numerous spots on the socks (highlighted in orange circles on the pair I have) where extra cushion has been added to the socks.  The areas include the skin, above the heel and on the bottom of the sock on the bottom of the foot and near the arch of the foot.  This extra cushion, especially in those areas where your socks will really press against your shoes/boots, is a really nice extra to have in order to ensure the socks are comfortable to wear.<br /><br />These socks come up almost to my knees but, of course, depending on your legs they might not come up as high but they should, at least come up to your mid-calf if not higher.  They are the just-right tightness around my calves so they stay firmly in place without being so tight they are uncomfortable.<br /><br />The ‚ÄòForcool‚Äô socks are thick; easily thicker than dress socks and thicker that most other walking socks on the market.  No need to double-up with these socks.  They might not be quite as thick as some higher-end hiking socks I‚Äôve used in the past but they are more than thick enough to be comfortable.<br /><br />Bottom line ‚Ä¶. These are really nice socks that are worth your consideration. [SEP] Got for skiing and they work great with ski boots. Very comfortable, stay dry, warm. [SEP] I have Reynaud's syndrome, so keeping my feet warm is a challenge. These were comfortable and provided extra warmth due to the height and thickness. There's enough padding to make them comfy without shoes; they are not so bulky as to require a lot of extra room in your boots. I wore these to walk the dog and my toes didn't turn white (also, they aren't too tight in the toes, which can be another challenge). They seem to be well made and I expect them to last a while. The design is suitably trendy. Recommend!",3,True
Crndzsis Womens Cashmere Feel Classic Plaid Polka Dot Pashmina Shawls Wraps Scarf(20 Colors Available),[],[],,4.5,24,1974,"This cashmere polyester blend is as soft as expected. I have the ""red and black"". One side is a deep gray (not quite black) with red, and the other side is the opposite: red background with the dark gray (not quite black). Typical in size and weight- light to medium weight, long and wide;allows for functionality as a shawl, scarf, mini blanket, etc.<br /><br />No complaints or issues that I can think of. [SEP] The Crntzsis scarf/shawl/wrap is very pretty.  It is red and charcoal. The pattern is large checkered blocks (i.e., plaid). The pattern isn‚Äôt overpowering, even subtle. This scarf is soft and feels great around your shoulder or neck. The fabric is a blend of cashmere and polyester.  It does not itch or irritate my skin. It is a nice size, which makes it easy to drape around your shoulders or neck. It can be worn dressy or casually and goes with everything from jeans to a skirt. It is reversable, which is a really nice feature. There isn‚Äôt too much fringe (it is short and discrete), which makes it look more expensive even though it retails for less than $25.  Overall, I think this is a pretty sweet accessory that would make a nice gift for yourself or someone else. [SEP] This shawl/wrap is so soft and warm very stylish and can be worn in many ways. Also it‚Äôs long and not bulky at all. The red is like an burnt orange and the black it‚Äôs like a charcoal grey [SEP] This red and black pashmina/shawl/wrap is stylish and soft.<br /><br />It is long and wide, but not bulky. This makes it easy to wear in many ways. (Example: you can use it as you would a scarf, without burying your neck in tons of fabric.)<br /><br />The red with black has a plaid pattern that is sharp-looking and which you can dress up or wear more casually.<br /><br />As most reviewers (including me) have mentioned, it is VERY soft. However, I'm rating it four stars instead of five. Why?  Because: it is not bulky or heavy, but very lightweight. Therefore, it is not extremely warm. I think some folks may want something warmer in a shawl like this, thus the four stars.<br /><br />That said, I think this is a pretty and practical way to add a little soft style to your wardrobe. [SEP] FANTASTIC product. This looks and feels so much more expensive than the $20 price tag suggests. It's nicer than other shawls I've seen (and purchased) for more than three times the price. I have the red/black version and love the cashmere softness and beautiful drape. I plan on giving several of these for holiday gifts and will probably add to my shawl collection, too. Highly recommended. [SEP] 23/Sep/19<br /><br />PROS<br />+ Cahsmere is incredibly soft and premium. I can't imagine anything softer than this!<br />+ Design is pretty cool because you can combine black with red stripes / red with blakc stripes or both.<br />+ Lenght is adequate to get creative.<br />+ Soft, soft, soft!<br /><br />CONS<br />- Absolutely none so far!<br /><br />I have said this before and I will say it again.

This will help other users like you to make informed decisions before spending their money! [SEP] I just love scarfs.  I love having the extra warmth around my neck in the cooler months.  I also think they look great and add to an outfit.  this scarf is made well and looks great on.  Love the colors/style of this scarf.  Very happy with it. [SEP] This pashmina is perfect for my office that can be hot or cold depending on the sun that day! It's thin so fits in my desk but quite soft and warm. It hasn't gotten fuzz on my clothes yet and I am planning to bring it with me for work travel. [SEP] This shawl is actually cuter in person than online.  The ""black"" is more like a very dark charcoal gray and the red has orange undertones, softening the oftentimes harsh look of black and red.  It drapes well and is very soft and comfortable.  It is nice enough to wear with work slacks but would work equally well with jeans.  I'm a big fan of cashmere and, while this cashmere blend does not feel exactly like high quality cashmere (what does?), it is very soft and comfortable and drapes well.  It is a lot softer and more comfortable than the mediocre quality cashmere that many stores sell.  I hope they get more colors in. [SEP] This car is very nice quality. The red color is nice and vibrant and there are no snags in a yarn. It is very warm and I like that it provides full coverage and you can fold it multiple ways. Will be great for the Winter.",3,True
Milacolato 3Pairs Sterling Silver Thin Hoop Earrings Upside Down Geometric Hoop Threader Earrings Lightweight Loop Drop Dangle Hoop Earrings Set,[],[],,3.6,21,248991,"I love threader earrings - and these ones are distinct and different.  These are the perfect size, not too big.  They thread easy in the piercing and are so lightweight I can wear all day without even feeling them in my ears.  There is no rust even in humid or rainy weather - wish they came in more shapes but these 3 are easy to rotate! [SEP] Milacolato earrings are thin - very thin. The shape and thickness kind of reminds me of a fish hook. They are comfortable. I accidentally slept in one pair Thanksgiving night. (I was exhausted) They're so thin that one can't tell that one is actually wearing anything. Two pairs of hoops close with one end going through an open circular catch. I didn't include pics because it would've been redundant. (See customer review photos) The silver is paper-thin and a nice enough quality. One pair is shaped like a wishbone. I'm not crazy about that pair because they look odd on. I wasn't sure how to put them on at first. Came in a gift box. A decent set of hoops for those with sensitive ears.<br /><br />*Update: Do not sleep in the earrings. Originally, I said they were comfortable to sleep in. Obviously I don't know jack! I never really sleep with earrings on because...OUCH! However, it happens. Again, I accidentally fell asleep wearing the middle pair pictured in product description. Oh my goodness! It left an imprint on my ear so fierce that I thought my ear was being lopped off. They're thin. The thinness can cut life a knife. I didn't become Picasso, yet, it was close. Whew! I do not recommend falling asleep in any of these. That said, the earrings are holding up surprisingly well and are still very comfortable...during the day! [SEP] My 12 year old is in love with these. Requested these as her first set of hoops. They are thin and not too much for a pre-teen. Very happy with the item. My daughter has sensitive ears and after a few days she is still having no issues and reports they are comfortable. [SEP] Very nicely made and appear to be genuine sterling silver! Shipped quick in a lovely box for gifting ‚ù§Ô∏è [SEP] These were not what I expected them to be. I thought they would be big and bold! They were so thin and small, and one pair I don‚Äôt even know how you put it in your ear, not the look or style I thought they would be. [SEP] I got these earrings as I liked the design and pattern.<br />But when I actually received them, they were not exactly like what was in the product description.<br />I could not get confidence about the quality.<br />They felt quite flimsy. [SEP] I like the designs of these earrings, they are larger than I anticipated. They are easy to wear and stays in without issue [SEP] It was a little difficult to tell from the picture just how minimal these earrings are.  If I wear my hair down they are barely noticeable, slightly more so if my hair is back or up.  The description say sterling silver, but it's hard to tell by looking because they are so thin.  They appear polished but not shiny.  I would describe the finish as flat. Not matte.<br />They range in size from 2 inches to 2.25 inches.  I like that they are lightweight and don't pull down on my ears.  If you're looking for thin, lightweight minimal earrings then you'll be happy with these. [SEP] Earrings came in a blue jewelry box and each pair in a ziploc-type bag.<br />They are very easy to put on. I thought they were not going to look nice since they are ultra thin, but they do look very nice for casual or formal attires.",3,True

It also has a mineral crystal to prevent damage. The face is black, red and blue dial with white stick and numeral indexes and M Motorsport logo. The watch has an hour hand, minute hand and a second hand. The band is a silicone strap. The watch is not meant to be in water deeper than 50 meters and is water resistant, NOT water proof [SEP] This gorgeous watch is sporty and fun. The face is easy to read. The band is comfortable and easy to adjust. It feels great on and is easy to read. Comes nicely packaged in a branded box. It is a watch only. No tech, chronographs, date etc. It tells time reliably. Nice. [SEP] True sporty style and eye-catching for sure, just like the car. The BMW colors are vibrantly displayed at the bottom of the face, which is surrounded by a big steel bezel and contrasted nicely with a black strap. This is a sports watch in every sense but your mileage will go way beyond as it looks great at mostly any time. Hubby loves it. [SEP] This BMW M Motorsport Stainless Steel Quartz Watch is a BMW motorsport inspired analog wristwatch. And by ‚Äúinspired,‚Äù I mean that it‚Äôs an officially licensed BMW logo motorsport quartz watch with the three stripe M logo on the dial, the watch band, and the strap buckle. The setting crown is also signed with the BMW logo. The watch has three hands (hour, minute, and second) and a small calendar date window at the 6 o‚Äôclock position. The face of the watch is interesting to look at, and definitely has a motorsport aesthetic. The dial resembles a car dashboard gauge and the bezel looks like a car tire. The hour marker numbers are black and offset nicely against the silver color dial. While I found the time legible and easy to read, the calendar date is a bit small and less so. The polished stainless steel case is approximately 42mm across, 47mm lug tip to lug tip, and is about 11mm thick.<br /><br />In terms of wearability, my husband wore this over the last week on his 6.75 inch wrist and found it very comfortable. He said the 2-piece silicone watch band is sturdy, works well, and feels good on the wrist. He also found the sporty look of the watch very appealing. He said that the watch is easy to set via the crown. He also tested the accuracy of this watch against our radio-controlled clock and found that down to the second, it lost no time at all during the course of the week.<br /><br />My husband said that overall, this is a good-looking and accurate everyday sport watch. The only issue he had was that this is a BMW motorsport watch and he doesn‚Äôt drive a BMW. Unlike other motor/auto-inspired watches he owns that are not brand specific, this one is branded for BMW motorsport. If you don‚Äôt own a BMW or you‚Äôre not a BMW enthusiast, it seems a bit too much to be wearing the watch bearing so many of the company‚Äôs logos. For the BMW Motorsport fan, however, this is an attractive, well-working, and comfortable BMW watch. [SEP] good [SEP] Unique and nice looking. Hubby loved it. Very sporty looking and comfortable. [SEP] I really like this watch. It's got a wonderful, solid feel to it. Setting it was nice and simple, both the date and the time. Operating the stopwatch is easy. I like the feel of the buttons and the positive click they have. The watch face is stylish and cool.<br /><br />However, it's all attached to a wretched band. It's really bad. I don't have very thick wrists (at all) and this band was almost too small for me. The material is kind of crappy. It feels scratchy. It's hard to tuck the strap into the keepers, which also look like crap.<br /><br />Keep the watch. Ditch the band. [SEP] The face of the watch is too small for a man‚Äôs wrist. Quality is more like a $50.00 watch.

I like the silver mirrored finish and the polarized lenses offer excellent clarity. The frames are slightly rounder than traditional Rayban Aviators and they are the perfect size for either men or women. Not so large that they are overpowering on a woman's face and they do not make me look like a fly, which is usually the case. However, they are substantial enough to fit most men as well. Even though they are inexpensive, The lenses are a very neutral grey tone and they do not distort or blur my vision many inexpensive sunglasses have. I am thrilled to have found these lightweight sunglasses and highly recommend them. [SEP] The case is ok for protecting your sunglasses, though it is soft, so be careful not to squish them, and they included a microfiber wipe to keep them clean and smudge-free. The mirrored lenses look good and block plenty of light on sunny days to protect your eyes. Nice quality all around! [SEP] These glasses are comfortable and have a nice tint that is not too light nor dark. I use them often for driving and as well as an accessory to my outfits. They stay firmly on my face and I don't deal with having to frequently push them up my nose. Of course, if this happens to you, they can easily be adjusted for free at any eye care store. I recommend these slick shades - especially for looking cool ;) [SEP] These sunglasses are lightweight and comfortable to wear. They look very stylish. For no more than there is to them, they are surprisingly durable enough. I like how dark they are. These protect my sensitive eyes from the sun and also from very bright lights. [SEP] Nobody expects much from $20 sunglasses and these are not an exception. After wearing them for about six weeks, I took them on vacation. Our resort had salt water pools and I went swimming with the glasses on a few times. I probably should have taken better care to wipe them, because the water ate through the coating on both sides and they are now useless.<br />That's probably on me, though my wife has nice prescription sunglasses and did not have the same problem. I guess you get what you pay for. [SEP] Instant cool look lol. Great way to get away with wearing no make up! In all seriousness though, these sunglasses fit well - not tight so they didn't leave those dreadful nose impressions, and not loose that they fall off when you look down. Polarized feature makes them perfect for driving. Highly recommend! [SEP] I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I didn‚Äôt have very high expectations for these glasses. I figured they‚Äôd just be an inexpensive pair that I wouldn‚Äôt mind losing at the beach or breaking at the park. But OMG I love them! They‚Äôre beautiful, they look great on, they are very flattering and the size of the lenses isn‚Äôt too big and gaudy or too small.  they're hands-down THE most comfortable glasses I‚Äôve ever tried on. It‚Äôs like they were custom made to fit me! They are very lightweight and have a very thin frame which could possibly cause them to break easily, but they do come in a nice protective soft case that I‚Äôm hoping will prolong their life. They are also polarized which is a huge bonus! Seriously these are my favorite glasses! I had ordered them with the intention of giving them to my husband but... that‚Äôs definitely not going to happen! [SEP] These mirrored glasses seem well made, are very light weight (.66 oz), comfortable to wear and come with a nice, soft, non-leather case. That's the good part.<br /><br />The lenses are very dark. It makes things in shadows harder to see. Didn't notice any polarizing effect. Worst of all, light shining on sides of face reflects off the inside of the lenses making it look like there‚Äôs something on the lens obscuring view. Very annoying.<br /><br />Minor note: Under product description, manufacturer says, ‚ÄúTIPS! To avoid damage . . . use clean water and 'included cloth' in case.‚Äù No included cleaning cloth came with these glasses. [SEP] For the price point these are not bad glasses.  They are pretty gender neutral and I happen to really like this style.  The frames fit my face and nose nicely, they don't dig into my head or the bridge of my nose.  The shading of the lenses is very pleasant and a covers a good portion of my face.  These do come with a case, but in all honesty I never use cases.  I am the type of person who owns inexpensive sun glasses and tosses them all over.  This have joined the collection of the ones I like, pretty sure they are on my Jeep dash right now.

We knew they would be small from the description but to be honest they are a little smaller than we even expected. I actually thought it would be just a tad bigger, but for a child or just someone who wants really small and delicate looking hoops, these are very pretty and very shiny! [SEP] These earrings are so dainty and pretty. I was excited to see that they were small hoops that hug the earlobe. They look more expensive than they are. The downside is I won't be able to wear them because one earring doesn't latch shut so it is useless. The other fits snugly in the back of the earring and closes shut. The other doesn't close in the back with the post. So disappointing!

The key is fit.  Let's see how these worked out.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE JEANS LIKE?<br />These jeans are really well designed.  They have great seaming, and the work on them is good quality.  The denim is what I will call medium weight.  The fabric has some stretch, but is not VERY stretchy.  The waist is designed to hit just below the waist.  The legs are very slim.  The ankles are skinny.<br /><br />POCKETS<br />The pockets are pretty deep which is one thing that drives my husband nuts- shallow pockets.  They are not so shallow that everything is gonna fall out of them. The change pocket is very tiny, but works.<br /><br />ZIPPER<br />The zipper in this is a locking zipper so it won't be as likely to work its way down on its own.<br /><br />ABRASIONS<br />There is wear and abrasions on the pocket edges, hems, and crinkled on the knee area.  It is not extreme and is not so bad that this will cause the pants to wear out really fast.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE FIT?<br />These do fit my husband and are very fitted.  He said they are reasonably comfortable, but they are a bit on the snug side.  They give and move and will stretch out over time as most spandex pants do.  They shrink back into size when washed and dried.<br /><br />WAISTBAND?<br />Some waistbands stretch a lot but others don't and even though the pants stretch a lot, the waistband gives very little making them uncomfortable.  This waistband barely stretches which can cause problems for those with stomachs who tend to expand when they eat or drink or for those who have a bit of a belly but thin legs.<br /><br />HOW TO ORDER<br />I would suggest ordering a size bigger.  My husband wears a 32 but these are a bit snug.  A larger pair would have been better.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a well designed pair of stretch jeans that are skinny, but give, these are nice.  The waistband does not stretch overly much so ordering a size bigger might be wise.  Great cut jeans for slim European styled figures.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  The waistband should be stretching more than it is on these to match the give in the pants.  They are still a nice design though, just need to run a bit stretchier in the waist. [SEP] 3.5 These have a good stretch and are sort of comfortable for jeans, but compared to some women‚Äôs stretch jeans, not really. Some of those feel as comfortable as sweatpants or leggings, and these aren‚Äôt there. They are comfortable in a ‚Äúcomfortable for jeans‚Äù way, which is to say, compared to stiff scratchy non stretching things, they‚Äôre better.<br />Just because they‚Äôre for guys doesn‚Äôt mean we need to do this, you know? Just use the same fabric. [SEP] I took a chance on selecting these jeans for review because the size on the product page only said ""32"".  I had no idea what the length would be. I have since discovered that they are 30"" length.  Unfortunately they are short on me since I can easily wear a 32 to 33 length.  But, these are still wearable since the legs are very slim and negates the short length.  Had they been wider legs that would have been a problem.  Overall - the material is durable denim and a very lovely deep blue color.  It has mottling as if the material had been creased which looks really good.  They legs can easily be folded at the cuffs and there's a lovely red thread on the inside that will show if they are cuffed once.  The waist is not not high, and the jeans are comfortably below my waist closer to my hips.  I know these are advertised for men but they fit my female body perfectly except for the length.  I washed and dried them in the dryer and they came out fine with no twisting or shrinking that I can detect.  They are a little bit stretchy too which is just wonderful! [SEP] At 6 foot, 170 lbs, the 32in fit lile a dream. Theyre super skinnys but they feel comfortable and breathable. The color does fade after first wash---I wish it didnt because they were so nice and dark (side note: wash separate because they will bleed). But they still look good after the fade. The lightest of distressing on one leg is perfect for me; it says something but doesnt have half my leg out there. Good jeans. Recommended. [SEP] Good quality jeans. These are skinny, but have quite a bit of stretch.  They are comfortable and look good with the dark color. [SEP] The Genuine Assembly jeans I received to review are a dark wash with a little bit of manufactured wear at appropriate spots, but there are no rips.  The fabric, cotton with 28% polyester (Cool-Max), is a sturdy denim weight.  The webpage does not list the inseam, but the pair I received had a label that listed the length as 30‚Äù although they are actually 29‚Äù.  The width of the leg at the hem is 12-1/2‚Äù, a slim fit.<br /><br />They are well-made with a heavy-weight zipper and reinforced pockets. I wore them today and felt good about the way the jeans looked. [SEP] These fit fine in the length and waist but they are simply too skinnny...really tight and for those that have developed calf muscles - forget it. Won't work without cutting off the blood supply to your feet and ankles. I give these a neutral rating since may work for some but be aware that skinnny means really really skin tight, [SEP] This was our first experience with this brand. The waist of the jeans is labeled as a 32, and this sizing is/was correct. You could probably be a 33 waist and still find these comfortable.  The legs of these jeans are definitely skinny.  On a 14 year-old, 6', 170# boy they were almost too tight even though his legs aren't overly muscular or even on the big side. The fabric is stretchy, but skin-tight is the best way to describe how the legs of these jeans fit. He even had a hard time getting his size 12 foot through the legs and the opening at the cuffs. Anyone not a fan of skinny jeans will want to skip these, but anyone who loves a pair of painted on skinny jeans should give these a try. Though advertised as men's jeans, these might be better suited for girls/women. His older sister tried these on, and they fit her much better. Her legs are very willowy compared to her brother's build so she didn't have any complaints about the legs feeling too tight. The waist was a bit big, though a belt fixed that and a tunic top worn along with these jeans made for a cute outfit.<br /><br />The jeans are well-made without any funky seams, loose threads, or a bad zipper.  When washed there is some dye release (so use a color-catching sheet), but no shrinkage or significant wear to the fabric. They've held up well to be worn at least once a week for several months (by my niece who claimed the pair as her own since they don't fit her brother).  I'd have to say these are more jeggings than skinny jeans, though.",3,True

I wear a 0 in Ann Taylor and Banana Republic, a 2 in Tahari and Tadashi, an XS in Zella/Athletica, etc....so I went cautious, I am buying this in a size 6 now. [SEP] Gorgeous!!!!!

Was a little oddly down. [SEP] good quality, just the waist size is 27 inches, just fit when i was hungry.. i order size 4 as usually. [SEP] Fabric quality is amazing, I must say I was very very skeptic about ordering this skirt but I must also say it far exceeds my expectations!  Oh my goodness! I wear it on mothers day and I got a lot, I mean a! Lot! Of complement. As fast as size goes I believe it more like European sizing . If you follow the sizing chart though you can't go wrong. And the price is fantastic!!!!!!  I wish they had more colors because I would buy them all. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.  Shipping was very fast I got it in 2 days.",3,True

The four leaf clover is easy to see as well, the charm is much larger than I anticipated, but it's not so large to look awkward. I got a lot of compliments on it when I wore it. The only difference between what I received and what I saw on my computer screen was the color of the inside of the moon. It's not clear as it's pictured, it's more yellow. It doesn't change how good it looks though. Very unique and great gift, and I would definitely buy again. [SEP] Bought it for my mom birthday!!!

I am allergic to nickel and these have not caused me any issues. I would recommend! [SEP] I was so excited when opening these! They're gorgeous. The pattern is great, they're vibrant and nice sized. They come with backings, but they're the tiny cheap ones.

[SEP] I wore this all day at work, probably about 12 hours in total, and they were very comfortable.  I like that they are footless because I can wear them comfortably with socks and booties with a skirt.

They did not run or pill or anything of that nature. [SEP] Fit as expected. Just what I am looking for. [SEP] Comfy, soft, footless tights.  This is a nice set of 2 pairs of tights.

[SEP] These are definitely stronger than the Hanes and L'eggs pantyhose that I've tried. They are footless which can absolutely come in handy when wearing open toe shoes. They don't squeeze at my ankles.<br /><br />They seem heavy enough to withstand a decent amount of activity. They are see through from my upper thighs  up. They keep me warm and still have a  sheer look to them. The control top is not very tight. It's actually  pretty comfortable. They go up a little too high. As I'm sitting, the tights are a couple inches below my chest.<br /><br />For reference, I'm 5'2 and 125 pounds. I went with the small. It fit me true to size. [SEP] Wiliw footless black tights.  These are great tights and I really like that they are footless. They are slightly opaque but not actually see through. Great for under dresses, scrubs, and long tops. I would not suggest someone wear these without a really long top to cover your rear end. Definitely dont bend over unless said top also covers your rear end completely. I am 111lbs 5'4 and I recieved the size small and they fit great. They are controlled on the top and have a decent light compression. They stayed up without sliding down my legs during work.

The brands for the other pairs ran small so were always a little too tight. I have a 34 inch waist so I ordered the large and they fit perfectly, not loose anywhere. I see other reviewers indicated there is too much padding, however, in my experience, this is how they should be. The extra padding in the seat feels a little funny when walking around,  but when seated on the bike the pad is just the right size to pad what needs to be padded. I wore these on a short 5 mile ride.  The shorts performed as expected. The legs didn‚Äôt ride up and the waist band felt comfortable for the whole ride. It was a warm day, but the material was very comfortable and there were no hot spots or chafing. These are a great pair of bike shorts and a good value. [SEP] I ordered a large and that is what came. I‚Äôm a size 36 in jeans. These fit just are a little loose. However these seem a little loose for being bike shorts. The padding is good and the America design/ flag is understated so it‚Äôs not obnoxious and actually kinda cool. I have worn bike shorts that have better padding but only time will tell with these if they are comfy etc. They don‚Äôt leave much to the imagination but we‚Äôre all human if you know what I mean. I think these would be fine under shorts or for short route around town. [SEP] I wore these today on a 30 mile ride. Nothing not to like. They fit fine, there's no chafing or hot sports, and they have the right amount of padding in the seat. Plus they are affordable. Me likes. [SEP] I have a few different pairs of bike shorts that I own and have worn over the years ranging from pretty pricey to pretty cheap.  These shorts are definitely in the cheaper side of things and I will compare these to other similarly priced bike shorts that I have worn.<br /><br />The overall material on these is not too bad.  Pretty stretchy and comfortable for the most part.  They are also not too thin either.  Some other shorts in the price range I have used were a bit to thin and revealing for my comfort.  These were adequate in that regard.<br /><br />Padding - I have seen many reviews stating that the padding is too much.  For this price range the padding is generally not going to be as nice as the fancier shorts that use more of a gelly type padding.  This is your pretty typical cheap padding that is going to be a bit thicker than your more expensive padding to get the same effect.  The thickness of the padding will not cause any performance issues while riding and you wont notice the thickness at all; however, when just walking around in these shorts they might feel a little more awkward then some others.<br /><br />Sizing - The sizing for me was just not right.  I got a large (which is about what I normally wear) and I am 5'10"" 195lbs with a 34 waist boarding on a 35 waist.  These were too big and baggy for my liking.  Not so bad that I can't wear them but definitely not my ideal fit and would opt for a medium if I could do it over again.  These shorts also have to much material for my liking as I can pull the waist all the way up past my belly button and a quarter of the way up my back.  I personally do not want my shorts to go that high but I feel like I have to pull them up that high to get the padding tight on my body to ride.<br /><br />Overall, for a cheap pair of shorts they are not awful.  I personally would spend a few more $ to get something that is better fitting and has better quality padding. [SEP] These shirts are definitely cushioned well in all the right places. They fabric is of spandex of some type  so they are lightweight and breathable. The fit is as expected.",3,True
Hugitout Women's Summer Surfer Wave BraceletÔºåHandmade Adjustable Friendship Bracelet Jewelry,[],[],,3.7,26,4646,"This type of bracelet is in fashion for teens. It is a big thing. With the multiple colors and the metal decorations, you have a bracelet that they will love to keep and share with their friends. My son, who is deceased, was born on St. Patrick's day, so I will give his daughter (one of the girls) the shamrock. The boy will get the Love bracelet for his girlfriend. A third bracelet will go to the other girl the hearts and the boy will get the infinity bracelet. [SEP] I like these bracelets, but they are for kids. Super bright colors. Super easy to put it on and out. Very light weighted. It will be a good idea for a gift. :)<br />The strap can be adjusted very small or large. [SEP] These are cute, little summer bracelets.  The colors are bright and the charms are nice, although very poorly made and already tarnishing.  The real issues I have with these are that the way the bracelets synch to secure on the wrist leaves at least an inch of the strand hanging off both sides of your arm.  They are also a huge pain to secure by yourself.  The other problem is the dyes used on the strands.  As soon as they get wet, which they will if you are washing your hands like you should, the dyes run and stain your skin.  These are besides the fact that the charms are very poorly made.  Definitely not worth the time, effort, and money. [SEP] Dont really know why the product is gendered when friendship bracelets are timeless and eternal and some of the ones in here are pretty great for anyone especially the infinity symbol and the lucky charm. Got complements wearing them and I like them.<br /><br />Found the quality to be great and holds up well for occasional wear for an outfit or two or just with meeting with friends. Due to the nature of it being a tied string and what not, it may pull apart eventually but its easy enough to tie back and maybe hot glue (assuming one is neat) together or one can probably craftily put some locking pendant attachment to it if they really wanted it to last. [SEP] Cute and cheap friendship bracelets for girls. Great to wear with any outfit and cute to layer with other bracelets on the wrist. The adjustable ties are perfect for small wrists. My daughter has been wearing these all summer long. So far the bracelets are holding to the wear and tear of every day wear. [SEP] These are cute Friendship bracelets that are composed of bright colored string and a lightweight charm.  They seem to trend in Elementary and Jr. High Schools, so younger teens will probably enjoy wearing/giving/trading these.  The string is adjustable to fit all size wrists and the 4 different colors are very bright and eye catching. I honestly as an adult, would not wear these as they do appear very juvenile jewlery.  They come in a very nice pink drawstring bag. [SEP] These are in for younger girls, I gave them out in lootbags at my nephew's birthday party, all the girls (7-12 yrs old) love them and wore them right away. [SEP] ok so these are cute and simple very easy to put on by yourself which is cool. and they are made no fall of slip off or untie. the knot allows you to adjust the size around your wrist. you get several colors each with a different or word. i wore the bracelet for about a week before the silver plating turned coper. because I kept the bracelet loose on my arm I believe that's why my arm didn't turn green. so I cant say whether it turns your arm green or not but it definitely lost its color after a week. but it didn't look bad after just not the bright shiny silver it was.. it became a dull color but still wearable. [SEP] My daughter was so excited when these arrived.  She thinks they are the cutest bracelets ever.  They are cute and easy to put on and take off.  My daughter is young and has tiny wrists, but she is still able to wear these bracelets and I can tuck the extra ribbon around to make it fit.  For my chubbier wrist the bracelets fit perfectly.  I love the bright colors of the ribbon and the pendants are cute as well.  My daughter's only complaint is that she thinks the shamrock should have been on the green ribbon.  I, however, like that they chose to not be quite so traditional and chose the red ribbon instead. [SEP] These are simple little woven bracelets that will give your wrist a splash of color.  They can be worn by guys and gals alike.  The size adjusts with just a pull of one of the strings.  I like the infinity symbol but there's others to choose: Heart, Clover and Love.  Perfect for hanging out in the summer or swapping with bestie.",3,True

They are so soft and comfortable for my little one! She loves to even sleep in them. I would absolutely recommend. [SEP] Great fit and good quality too. They embroidered really well.  Recommended [SEP] We use this mainly as a layering piece and it works well. It's not too thick and it's still breathable. The torso is a little shorter than we would have liked. [SEP] These shirts are exactly what I was looking for. The quality is very nice, soft, and stretchy. I like having a pack of plain white shirts like this because my daughter can wear them layered under clothing, costumes, etc., during the fall and winter time. I also took one  of these shirts and had it monogrammed for a specific outfit I had in mind for my daughter so that is another great aspect of having multiple, solid white shirts like this. Very happy with these shirts. [SEP] These are a nice option for layering. The shirts are soft and have a fair amount of stretch to them. My son has worn them under a fleece vest and also under a t-shirt. The sleeves were just a tad bit long, but it wasn't a major issue. He may grow into the shirt a bit more over the next few months. [SEP] These tees are very soft and smooth 95% cotton, 5% spandex. These are nicely made and a great weight for winter warmth, wearing under sweaters, etc. These wide enough around to fit loosely, which is good unless you have a really skinny kiddo. The sleeves are nice and long, and overall the fit is good. I just wish these were about 2 inches longer, but they‚Äôll work as is. Overall, these are soft, comfy tees that seem as if they will hold up for a good while. Very pleased with the texture and feel of these tees.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

Awesome! [SEP] Decent quality under shirt for kids. Material is decent it is on the thinner side of material. Shrank a bit after washing and drying but was still a loose fit on my 5 year old son. [SEP] I ordered these to use for crafting projects for my grandchildren. They are very soft shirts with some stretch. All the measurements are correct, except they do run a little short, so I would say they are more for children 7 to 9, but maybe not 10-year-olds, depending on the child's size. Otherwise, very happy with these. They are good quality and very well priced.",3,True

The phrase 'sleeping bag with a hood' is what sold me, and yet it still feels reasonably stylish. I love this coat, [SEP] Great coat for the price, nice and long. Bit small so order big! [SEP] I have an Orolay coat in a different style for the past two years that I have been wearing a lot in NY and have stayed warm and loved wearing. I wanted to try a different style although this coat was cute, it was too small in the shoulders for me, but I do love the Orolay coats. [SEP] Love it [SEP] Does not look as nice on as in the picture. I felt like the coat made me look like a rectangle and if you see me I am definitely a curvy woman. The red looks nicer. [SEP] Love the coat but not made in the USA .It's so cute however made elsewhere not American sizes . So I gave it to Amvets because I paid $40 to send it back and it came back for more postage because  the return address was wrong?! Don't order this, don't waste your time. It cut for a different culture of people and has to go back to that Country for refund which I never got. Sorry but I order a jacket from them and this coat and ended up giving both away! Live and learn. [SEP] I am a size 10, which is a medium/large depending on the manufacturer, and ordered an XL based on the reviews.  It fits very well, is incredibly warm and I've gotten many compliments on the coat.  I believe had I ordered a L, the sleeves would've been too tight. [SEP] I ordered XL, which is the size I use, and it was too small for me.  Also, the coat was too thick for my taste.  I returned the coat. [SEP] I like the coat. It keeps me warm. I'm usually a small so i bought a large and it's a tiny bit big on me. Keeping me warm through Seattle winter.

Painted Heart Women's Double Crepe Pleated Long Dress Large Rust,[],[],,3.5,5,4697,"This dress is pleated in the front. Kind of like a swoosh. It is a midi length. It is also comfortable and you can wear it as a casual dress or dress it up as a more stylish look. It is all in the accessories. [SEP] I ordered the correct size but the dress isn't very flattering - it is drapey and loose, just like the photo, but on a skinny person it looks like you are wearing a sack. This should have come with a belt to make it look less wide and floppy.<br /><br />It might look better on a curvy or full figured person, but on slender women it just feels formless. [SEP] I don't have the right body to pull this dress off. It just hangs odd on me and I can't imagine wearing it out. I'd say it runs a bit on the larger side. It fits me loose, so I don't know if a closer fit would have helped or not. I also don't like the material. It feels rough and has a cheap look to it. The inside of the fabric has a smoother feel to it, so it's not rough on my skin there, but I still feel the outside anytime my arms/hands move against it. I do have texture issues, but it's not pleasant for me. Unfortunately, this isn't the dress for me, but I imagine it will look perfectly lovely on someone. [SEP] This 95% polyester 5% spandex dress is very attractive  with a diagonal drape, eased boat neckline and short sleeves<br />The length is less than midi but hits at mid-calf which is excellent for the fall and winter season<br />The rust color is also a glorious color for this season.

They block the sun on the sides as well as directly in front. They are polarized as far as I can tell. They look good on. These aren't high end sunglasses and feel a little flimsy compared to name brands we already have. But as a spare pair to keep in the truck, these are fine. [SEP] I really like these sunglasses. The description says these sunglasses are for men. The style would look fine for men, but they didn‚Äôt come close to fitting my husband. Fortunately they fit me perfectly because I really like these sunglasses. They feel comfortable even when wearing for extended periods and they look good, too. I like the black frames and the dark lenses. The polarized lenses seems to really help cut down the glare even in very bright sunlight. They were great for just walking outside and also for reading while sitting in the sun. The glasses come with a very basic case, but it does the job to protect them when I‚Äôm not wearing them. [SEP] Though these glasses are marketed for men, they look great on me - woman.  They do a great job of blocking out harsh, glaring/blinding sunlight and they fit my narrow face well.  They seem to be well constructed.  My only complaint is that the nose pads have a small spot on them that tend to feel scratchy on my nose.  I will use some very fine grit sandpaper later on to try and smooth them down some, but other than that I think these are very good sunglasses. [SEP] These glasses are a classic shape. They say that they are unisex, but they definitely look more like women‚Äôs glasses to me. Especially with the delicate sides. They are flattering. I can‚Äôt believe how light they feel. There is basically no weight. They also come with a case and cleaning cloth. They are polarized as well. [SEP] These are retro and very stylish looking sunglasses. They arrived in their own case.  They are a great addition to my sunglass wardrobe. The silver color really sets these off as unique too. [SEP] My husband loves these glasses, enough so that he's retired all of his other sunglasses! They're light weight, fit his face nicely, and are the perfect shade to take away the glare of a Florida sunny day without damping out the colors! They look good on, too. The carry case is the icing on the cake! Definitely a quality pair of sunglasses, and I recommend them! [SEP] Bob loves these sunglasses, He said they work great for him driving. He drives long haul. They work great driving into the sun. They help with glare and with tired eyes. He really likes Skyway sunglasses. Quality made. Great deal. I hope this is has helped.

It would certainly depend on the individual.<br /><br />The added case was a nice surprise.  It is a little flimsy and a soft case but will certainly protect your shades while in your purse or pocket.<br /><br />At the time of this written review the cost of these shades was $15.00.

Bellivera Women's Portable Sun Hat Visor Adjustable Wide Brim Cap Folding Headband Sunhat Black,"['Elastic', 'Elastic closure', 'Hand Wash Only']",[],,3.4,74,11875,"This visor is very dark.

You can also adjust the angle of the visor.<br />Super light weight. Comfortable to use.<br />It does get a little warm inside if you use it very vertical.<br />The only issue for me is that it does distortion a little the view. Just like cheap/ bad sunglasses do. But for the amount of time I use it, it‚Äôs ok.<br />With covid around, every extra protection that you can use is welcome. [SEP] This Bellivera sun hat is nicely constructed. They used quality materials and the stitching is great. The band is comfortable and the tilting hardware, though a little stiff at first, clicks into position as it should. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt like the visor itself. Once you remove both sides of the cling wrap you‚Äôll see that the visor slightly distorts your vision. It‚Äôs not bad, but it‚Äôs noticeable. The visor also reflects back what you are wearing so you‚Äôll have random colors flashing in front of you. As someone who is sensitive to the sun, the uv protection on this is minimal and I definitely felt the sunlight glaring down on my face. [SEP] I like the style and concept, but this fits extremely tight.  I have a normal size head and this would cause a headache within a few minutes of putting it on.  I needs a longer, more adjustable velcro strap to really make it useable for more people. [SEP] Good coverage area, able to see through enough. But completely cracked when folding as instructed for storage--too brittle/fragile. [SEP] End up return it [SEP] This sun hat that protects you from the sun, is very nice, fits good, but is so dam dark. I can see it wearing it during a tan at a beach or besides a pool but not to wear it under the sun walking or strolling as you can not see through. [SEP] This sun visor is great.  Had a tiny issue with removing the some sections of the film because it‚Äôs sewn in with the seam but I was able to clean it up with tweezers.  The shade cover is adjustable and can be moved up or down.  It‚Äôs fairly large so you get good coverage.  This is great for protecting your face when working in the sun.  I wear this while gardening and working around the house. I would feel a little silly if I wore this out in public due to the size. [SEP] I really like this hat but the shading is very dark and does take some getting used to. I wore it out on the sunniest of days and it made me feel protected from both the sun and from passerby droplets of virus. Of course you still have to wear a mask underneath but any added protection is a good thing. The UV protection seems to be a very good barrier but that is also why it's so dark. It's a little hard to see through sometimes because of the darkness and the way that the light reflects on the curse of the visor but that just comes with the territory. It's far too dark to wear indoors but as an extra layer of protection outside it helps out.<br />Also another bonus is the way it rolls up to be compact, I can roll it and stick it into my tote bag easily with the attached elastic band. [SEP] I got this to wear outside during the summer. It works but it also gets very hot. But still a good option if you want or need this kind of coverage. [SEP] Masks protect others.  Visors help protect you.  Use both.  This is a tinted visor that's good for day walking here in sunny SoCal. It rolls up so it's good for take-along.  Handy. Useful.  Utilitarian.  Stay safe.",3,True

It was minimal, but I did feel that it added to comfort and some 'bounce back' when running or playing sports. I mention this because these inserts have a similar feature embedded into their shoe insert. The blue area (round on top and rectangular on bottom of sole insert) is this specific feature. Today's walk, I cannot say if it was totally effective, but if it's anywhere close to those sneakers, the added bounce will be appreciated.<br />The insert has a guide that allow you to cut them to custom fit. I would advise cutting larger than expected, and then trim accordingly. This takes a little more time, but better to take time, and gradually fit them to your shoe/foot, than to discover you cut them too short.<br />These inserts seem to be of average thickness and stiffer than your run of the mill shoe insert cushion. The thought behind this is that bounce back aspect. The gray areas of the insert is to provide some cushioning, but also rebounds as you step into it during activity. The blue area having more of the squishy rebound effect. So, if you are looking for a soft cushion to allow you walk on clouds, this is not the insert you seek.<br />This insert does not have any arch support. I think arch support is the leading contributor to foot fatigue. So, the absence of any support is disappointing. But, based on the product details, this feature was not expected.<br />Overall, it is a decent shoe insert, with ""Bounce"" technology as it's differentiating feature.<br />Photos are provided to give some real world images of the inserts, the sizing guides and the blue bounce ares.<br />I give this product a medium level of recommendation. [SEP] Was hoping they would be better. Not bad, but certainly not what I was hoping for. Better than what came in the shoe, but not by much. Not nearly as ""squishy "" as I thought they would be [SEP] These would fit size 11 men‚Äôs shoes at best; they definitely did not fit my size 12 shoes.

They do block out the sun quite nicely as the lenses are very dark and they arrived in a very nice little case. Those are the good points. On the bad side, these are so flimsy! I am afraid to pull on them to open them enough to get them on my face. They are that delicate feeling. They feel a bit cheap.

[SEP] These are completely flat and do not bend in any way around your face. They bleed a ton of light, and I found the wire frames to be flimsy and uncomfortable.<br /><br />However, the lenses themselves were nice and dark and the overall light weight feel of the sunglasses was a definite perk. They are also priced low, so if you just want some light weight throw aways, they would be a good buy. [SEP] While these are not bad looking‚Ä¶ they are extremely flimsy. I am hard on my sunglasses since I spend a lot of time outdoors. They aren‚Äôt just worn for looks but for practicality. So for me, I wouldn‚Äôt buy them‚Ä¶ and I plan on donating them.

They also stay on my face when I bend my head, so no fear of accidentally breaking them. They come it a nice pouch so that it's easy to carry them in my purse. Very well made shades for everyday wear. [SEP] Very thin and light, almost too thin. The stems feel like they will snap or at least bend very easily. They almost feel like a heavy craft wire.<br /><br />They do make things darker and easier to look at and are more than likely polarized. They are fine as an extra pair of sunglasses but are definitely not worth the money.  They are just too brittle feeling. [SEP] These are very light weight. They fit well and the lenses are medium sized for aviators. In other words, you get good protection , but don't look like some alien insect. The lenses are fairly dark, but not annoyingly so.. They come with a very nice leather-like case.  Very good quality at an affordable price. They do not have the ""cheap"" look of drug store sunglasses. [SEP] Flat, flimsy, cheep looking. I thoroughly regret this. These glasses were not what I expected just from looking at the picture [SEP] I do not care for these glasses. Never have I owned a pair of sunglasses that just sat flat across my face with no shape or curve or nothing. Now I have.<br /><br />I thought these looked like aviators a little from the picture.

[SEP] I really wanted like this sunglasses as I like the Aviator look, but unfortunately there not very comfortable to wear for two reasons. First, there very lightweight, so thin and can easily fall off. Secondly, the metal that goes behind your ear it pokes you as it‚Äôs just metal, doesn‚Äôt have like a rubber or something plastic cover the end of it.

Ldurian Inlaid Cubic Pink Zirconia Handmade Rope Weaving Charms Bracelet Black Adjustable Charm Gift for Women and Men (Skull),[],[],,4.1,5,6900,"The Ldurian Skull Charm Woven Bracelet is pretty cute in person. At first glance, the charm doesn‚Äôt really look like a skull, so if you like to sneak in a bit of goth or spooky, this bracelet could work.<br /><br />The eyes are not pink. They‚Äôre reddish, maybe salmon or imperial red. The other tiny clear crystals on the skull do not stand out unless I‚Äôm in very bright sunlight.<br /><br />The woven part of the bracelet is quite stiff. Normally this type of bracelet is easy to put on yourself, but this one is difficult to pull. I need to use my teeth to hold one of the ends so I can pull it closed. [SEP] Such a cute bracelet! Love the cute design. [SEP] This is a cute, provided one thinks skulls are cute, casual woven bracelet with a small, jeweled skull.  This bracelet is adjustable by tugging and pulling the dangling loops with the gold beads to adjust for wrist size.  It's tricky, at least for me, to get the bracelet adjusted to fit so that the beaded loops are basically equal in length.  The skull is tiny, and the zirconia jewels catch the light when there's bright lighting but otherwise the effect rather subdued.  I like this for casual wear but not while I'm home.  One of my cats immediately found the dangling loops irresistible so I had to remove the bracelet and hide it for a while.  My rating is 4 stars because of the difficulty in adjusting the loops and I expected the skull to be a bit more sparkly. [SEP] This is a pull slide style bracelet.  Where you can expand and then close to fit your wrist.  The materials are all pretty decent.  Gems in the skull seem to be secured nicely.  The skull isn‚Äôt flat so this is a round pebble sitting against your wrist though out the day.  I found that waring this as a very loose bracelet is more comfortable then against my skin.  Overall pretty subtle jewelry that is well made. [SEP] Such a cute bracelet! Love the cute design.",3,True
WXXM Mens Athletic No Show Running Low Cut Tab Socks 3 Pairs Multicolored,[],[],,3.7,10,7944,"Gave two pair to my biking-enthusiast brother in law who is a serious recumbent biker.

One pair went to my lounging enthusiast husband, who really loves them for comfy socks with his slippers and pajama pants in the evenings, watching TV.<br /><br />My sporty BIL loves them too. Very comfortable for biking, cushioned and no rubbing or irritation. So, active or couch-locked, they are great for anyone [SEP] Currently training for a marathon and these socks are perfect for training. There is ample amount of cushion in the toe and heel, making for a comfortable, long, run. I do like the snugness that they offer, I have yet to have one of these roll down into my shoe. I originally got these for my husband, but I think I wear them more. :) [SEP] These socks are colorful and seem strong enough to last awhile.  I wore them both walking and running with no problems.  Even held up in its first wash.  They do seem to run small, good for teenagers and woman, but not men with big feet. [SEP] So fun to have these colors! Fits great and functional.

I got these to help reduce swelling after surgery and this is working perfectly for me. I also love the lilac color.<br /><br />Note that they also wash well in a lingerie bag. I lay them flat to dry but have tumble dried them on low for a few minutes without any issue. [SEP] The only issue I had with this bandeau, is that I got shorted a second bandeau. It is supposed to come in a pack of two for the package I received. Other than that, it was comfortable enough. If you can get someone to help you in the back and sides so you don't have rollover or under. [SEP] Of course it needs to be snug -want it all to stay in place. Nice purple top and the inserts that are a nice touch. Not expensive just comfortable. [SEP] Oh my gosh, I love this bra! It's so soft and comfortable, I honestly can forget I have it on! The color is a lovely light purple.  I am a 42B and ordered the 3X and it's great. It stays down over my ample love handles, NO ROLLING! The cups are removable, which I did. I will be ordering a few more of these! [SEP] I've been measured & fitted as a 40D & decided to order the XXXL just to be safe size-wise. When I tried this bra on, it was a bit tight but not too bad. But, not only is the padding too small, it isn't anchored down in any way so it folded up while I was putting it on & it was a little awkward to try to straighten them out.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's easy to wash & dries nicely in the drier. It's also nice & soft.<br /><br />All in all, while I will use this bra, it will not be a go-to for me. [SEP] If you are looking for support, this bra won‚Äôt provide. However it is very comfortable especially on a hot day. My wife love this. [SEP] This is beyond comfortable! It also does much better than I expected in terms of support. I have never owned one of these types of bras before because of my size thinking there was no way it would provide any support or fit properly but figured I would give it a try. I am so happy I did. I also like that the padding can easily be removed as that was the only thing I didn‚Äôt love when I first tried it on.<br /><br />Great product at a great value. [SEP] I would say it‚Äôs just ok. I am a 42D and I‚Äôve been looking for a tube top type bra to fit my band width. It‚Äôs been a bit challenging but I was able to slide this on snuggly.<br /><br />It does have those strange cups in it which would be great if they were bigger but it just does not like right.<br />I hope maybe with a too over it that you won‚Äôt be able to tell. If you can I will attempt to take them out which actually I found they do have a convenient opening inside where the cups are so you can take them out. Which is a good idea when washing so that makes me like this a little bit better.<br /><br />Not a has tube top. Fits me at a 42D so I am happy about that.

"Adjustable Camera Shoulder Strap with Quick Release Plate, Comfortable Long Sling Neck Belt for All DSLR Camera Nikon Canon Universal - Black",[],[],,4.0,23,266380,"Quality product, well made and durable. The clip is spring loaded and locks when attached to the camera. An eyelet threads into the 1/4-20 threaded hole on the bottom of the camera most commonly used for tripod mounting. The eyelet includes a rubber washer to protect damage to the camera when screwing the inlet into the camera. Note** these eyelets can unscrew and become loose when walking and bouncing the camera around. Be sure to purchase a camera safety tether to be certain your camera won't go crashing to the ground. Otherwise I recommend this strap highly. [SEP] Hey, I consider myself to be a now, professional photographer...business owner and I need products that will perform, NOT embarrass me on a shoot and not rip my wallet in half while I am budgeting for my start-up business in the Bay Area. I had purchased this trap for my 1st camera (Nikon D7100) and LOVED it so much, I purchased a 2nd one for my Nikon D800. I mount my Tamron 70-200 2.8 G2 lens on it (HEAVY) 90% of the time and wear it around my shoulder. I clamp it to my side when walking and unclamp when I may be ready to lift up to my eye and take a shot. EXTREMELY helpful when changing lenses...like having an assistant to hold body for me. I once forgot I did NOT have strap on and went to change lens...thank God my mind clicked and said, ""Hey....hey...you cannot let go of your camera...no strap attached!"". Whew!! Lastly, have not used a Rapid Strap strap, so, I cannot compare other than a fellow photographer who DOES have one. I have not worn it, but, I do not feel as if I have ""lost"" anything by buying this similar product.  ONLY thing I have done was to put a small amount of electrical tape around the metal twist at the bottom where after screwing into camera connector to make SURE it does not somehow work itself loose and my camera drop.  Has never happened with either strap in past 4 years I've had the 1st one, nor this one. Hope you like it as well!! [SEP] Very good [SEP] This type of strap is SO MUCH BETTER than a standard neck strap for carrying a camera all day. I have one I bought on a trip a few years ago and love it. I bought this one for a new camera. It is essentially the same strap as the one I already have except the pad is shaped a little different and it has a under arm strap. The underarm strap will make it a bit harder to steal your camera, but it also makes it harder to lift your camera up to your eye. I removed that extra strap. You may feel different about it. Otherwise it is a good item. [SEP] Just perfect fit, great quality and as always fast shipping. [SEP] Used for my DSLR as well as my lumix300. The connection is small enough that you have space to change your batteries if needed be. I am always concerned that this will unscrew and my camera will fall off. Has not happened yet.

"Winter Ski Gloves For Men, Waterproof Touchscreen 3M Thinsulte Gloves",['Pull On closure'],[],,4.0,27,7350,"My husband's hands are very large, and it's a challenge to find gloves that fit well. This gloves size XL fit very well and even have a little room. They are well made and well stitched. They tighten around the wrist and keep hands really warm. There is a rubber strip on the right thumb to allow usage of touch screen phone without taking of the gloves and freezing your fingers. They cover the wrist, and genuinely keep my husband's hand warm and snug. Great for wearing outside or even driving. We recommend them. [SEP] Husband loves them however he is unable to wear them while on his ATV as they are too bulky [SEP] This glove keeps my hands warm in freezing temperatures. [SEP] These come with a rigid rubber ridge on the right thumb, which I initially figured was for wiping goggles and thought that it wouldn't work well but was a nice try.  To my utter amusement, the manufacturer calls this ridge a ""nose wipe"".  We all know noses run in cold weather, there's no getting around it unless it's so cold your mucus freezes (seek shelter immediately!), and we all know we wipe that on gloves and sleeves without a second thought.  These gloves attempt to make this less of a thing with a rigid rubber ridge on the right thumb, but it's simply too rigid and actually starts to hurt to use after a few swipes, and the way the ridge is sewn into the glove there's no removing it so I'll have to live with it.  It's only a minor annoyance, thankfully.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a wonderful pair of gloves.  They keep my hands warm and even have a pocket on the back of them for those hand warmers things to go into.  This is great, but I'd have preferred the pockets to be on the palms as my fingers are always what get cold on me, and making a fist with a hand warmer in my palm is the only way I keep them from freezing sometimes when outside in the cold for a while.<br /><br />They also have elastic tethers to keep them from getting lost during a long day of skiing.  No need to put your pole in the snow and hang your glove on the end anymore, just let it dangle until your finished doing whatever you needed a bare hand for.  A simple, but nice touch.  Unfortunately if you don't ski, and don't need this, you need to cut them out since there's no way to remove them otherwise and they'll become an annoyance.  Believe me.<br /><br />These gloves are nice and warm without being too bulky, but because they're gloves the touchscreen accuracy is going to be severally affected.  These really should only be expected to answer calls without having to take them off, but if you can manage more than that good on you.<br /><br />I ordered the extra large because I have long fingers and this is the perfect fit for me.  I don't have a particularly wide hand, but that wasn't an issue as these gloves have adjustments to snug them up, so getting the right finger length is more important than other measurements in my opinion. [SEP] I've never seen a pair of gloves that had everything you need and want all in one! They've thought of everything here! I ordered these for my husband and he was super impressed and happy with these! He used them to shovel shoe and take the kiddos sledding and said he didn't get wet or cold inside these gloves. The pocket for hand warmers is a great feature and is the perfect size! The zipper closure and tuck away feature for the zipper is perfect too. These clip together for storage, have a nice cinch strap and another cinch with toggle adjustment and a leather stopper at the cord ends. Tucked inside I found wrist straps as well. They're fuzzy and soft inside almost like fur. They feel durable and well made. They're waterproof, windproof, sweatproof, touchscreen compatible, and have a mini squeegee on the thumb. I'm guessing the squeegee is for goggles but I'm not entirely sure. Overall, these are fantastic and I can't find a negative thing about them. I would definitely recommend them for sure! [SEP] appears to be good quality [SEP] I used these gloves for skiing and they were great. Hard to use for any fine motor skills but they kept me warm while skiing. [SEP] Where I live you need to bundle up in the winter.  I'm not much for outdoor sports or work my husband likes to ski and has to snowblow and shovel the driveway.<br />He found these comfortable and was able to use them easily while using the snowblower.  He also liked that you could make them tighter on the wrist and has a zip pocket. [SEP] They fit nice and seem like they‚Äôll be warm.  Very comfortable and seems to be great materials.

At first glance, it appears thicker than it is.  When wearing this wig as a fashion piece, you might want to  wear a hat since the scalp shows through on the top. Enjoy!

As long as you are not expecting a premium quality, everyday wear type of wig, this one is great for occasional use. [SEP] I am not a a blonde. I suspect most members of the blonde population of the United States are not either. However getting this nice wig and getting it styled to actually wear is going to be fun. It fits okay, and the hair seems thick enough and long enough to be styled into any appropriate look. As is, it would be pretty long and shaggy for most people over 25.

GLADDON MODA Women's Crossbody Bag Gray,[],[],,3.0,14,1975,"I think this pleather snake skin purse is really cute. It isn't going to cut it for people who need a super secure bag. I mean, if you drop it, the items may fall out, or sure someone could stick their hand in and take out your wallet. I think it is just a fun, purely pleasurable to look at, neat purse. Occasional use. Use if for the novelty, use it for a fun fashion choice, use it when you are going somewhere that only clear purses can be brought in for security reasons. That's a thing. Mind as well carry a cute bag while keeping security happy.<br /><br />It is a good size. Roughly/approximately 10""x7""x3.25"". The two main walls are a thick, clear plastic. Yes, you can see all your treasures if you use this. That is the only clear section, or windows if you prefer. The rest of it is a soft, textured snake print pattern pleather with gold detail. The overall color is in warm tones of brown, cream, black and as mentioned- gold. I think it is quite pretty. Nice stitching, nice overall feel. Doesn't feel cheap to me, and I tend to judge hard but fair on bags and such. I have no idea what this costs, so I can not comment on that.<br /><br />This bag comes with a small zip pouch- a textured weave of some sort. A coordinating beige color.<br /><br /> Also, this bag comes packaged with another plastic bag for storage or whatever. It is one of those backpack style plastic bags (see my pic).<br /><br />The strap is adjustable and can be shortened to shoulder use, or lengthened to cross body use.<br /><br />The top is open- think of it like a small, structured tote. It has one strap that doesn't exactly close it, but does keep it from being wide open.<br /><br />I like it! [SEP] The sides have an imitation snakeskin design, but the rest of the bag is clear. The strap is easy to adjust to get a comfortable fit at the length each person likes to wear a shoulder bag. It comes with a separate removable bag. This small zippered bag has the look of straw and looks good in the clear bag or can be used with other purses.<br /><br />Some jobs require employees to carry a clear purse and some sporting events and concerts allow only clear bags. I haven‚Äôt tried to use it in these situations, but even with the closed sides, I think this bag might work for that. The big drawback is that if I was taking this purse to a crowded event like that, I would want the top to close fully and there are large open gaps at the top of the bag. It‚Äôs a fun, casual bag and I have used it to bring a book, sunscreen, and a small water bottle to the pool, so the partial opening doesn‚Äôt matter. [SEP] This is a really nice see-through bag for those occasions/events that women are required to carry their items in a clear bag due to security reasons.  I had to do that last weekend when attending a football game.  This bag would have been great to have then but luckily I had another clear bag.  This one is much more purse-like and has a nice, smaller purse that goes inside it.  The clear plastic is good quality and durable and the mock snake skin looks really good.  The only thing I find a little bit of fault with is that this purse can't be completely closed.  It needs a snap or a Velcro patch to keep both sides of the bag very close together to prevent anyone reaching in and helping themselves to the contents.  Other than that I think it's a great clear purse. [SEP] So, If you want it to look nice, you better keep it neat! LOL<br /><br />Personally, I am really liking this adorable little purse and think it could be quite useful in different situations. At the time of this review, I had no idea what the price was, but I was curious and did a Google search for clear purses. I was astounded to find that they‚Äôre so popular, and most of the popular designers have them - Christian Louboutin, Chanel, Fendi, etc., selling for mucho dinero! Yep, I seen one similar to this one, selling for about $1500.00 (on sale!). Oh my!<br /><br />I‚Äôve been thinking about this extensively, and feel that this purse can be very useful, and may even change your entire image...<br /><br />#1 - Could be the Perfect Carrier for an Emotional Support Animal: üêÅ<br /><br />Just imagine yourself being able to transport a small Emotional Support Animal (Gerbil, Lizard, Frog, Wing clipped Budgie, etc.), in a lightweight and totally visible carrier. Whether it be by plane, train or road trip, your little friend will be in total comfort and you‚Äôll both have a full, unobstructed view of each other. You could even add tiny air plants to achieve a terrarium effect.<br /><br />#2 - Want to show your intelligence?üë©‚Äçüéì<br /><br />No problem. Display a copy of War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy. However, because the paperback is 1008 pages you may not have much room for other items. Be prepared for questions though, and if you haven‚Äôt read the book, you might find Cliff notes helpful.<br /><br />#3 - Looking for a Hot Date?‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />Go to a Bar and strategically place your purse close to you with a couple of boxes of various sized condoms, prominently displayed against the front panel.<br /><br />OMG...I can go on and on, but enough of the silliness!<br /><br />Seriously, I really do like the purse. It‚Äôs lightweight, very well made and stitched, and is just a nice size to carry essentials. The snake print effect  trim is made from PU leather (PU leather is an artificial leather material made with split leather (that‚Äôs the fibrous part of the hide left over from making genuine leather) which has been coated with polyurethane) but it doesn‚Äôt smell as in ‚ÄúPee-Yew‚Äù. The gold hardware and chain on the shoulder strap is attractive and it comes with a gold tone inner pouch. Personally, I prefer my own wallet, but would have no problem using the supplied pouch. The plastic windows are sturdy and seem like they can stand up to wear and tear.<br /><br />Coins look great loose in this purse, and would be convenient for toll drivers. Display your favorite makeup, or take it to government buildings, sporting events or concerts, to speed the process where purse inspections are mandatory.<br /><br />I sincerely Thank the seller for the opportunity to receive and review this adorable and unique purse!<br /><br />PS: If you have an Emotional Support Snake, I suggest you use a different carrier as it might terrorize it! [SEP] I‚Äôm a fan of chain and clear bags because they are so cute and stylish. This crossbody is good quality, has a nice strap to adjust and the bag inside of the clear one is very cute. It does compliment you very well as it has have chain strap which adds a more elegant piece to the crossbody bag.

It just looks kind of like something ""Peggy Bundy"" would carry on Married With Children.  I hate to say it but it looks sort of cheap and gawdy.  If you do like the leopard print look you might like this bag.  The bag portion is completely clear.....the trim is leopard print.  The material appears to be a thicker plastic and it seems as if it will hold up well with normal, every day use.......

The bag comes with the see-thru crossbody bag, the separate clutch, and a backpack type see-thru bag with the Moda Decal on the front [see the picture on the left]. It is a nice crossbody handbag that seems to be fairly sturdy. It should appeal to at least one of the girls.

[SEP] Hugitout Women's 14K Gold Plated Layered Pendant Necklace,Cubic Zirconia Double Chain Choker Necklace,Multilayer Necklace Dainty Personalized Jewelry with Gift Box and Greeting Cards<br /><br />This necklace came packaged very well and in a pretty box.  It is a very delicate looking necklace and would look good on anyone.  It has a nice sweet design that will work with almost any outfit.  The only thing I did not like was the chain.  It seemed to get tangled easily which will get annoying after a while.  Because of that, I probably will only be wearing this on occasion and not more frequently due to the chain. [SEP] This is a cute and dainty necklace.  This feels like costume jewelry and I expect it to last about one or two seasons due to its very light chain.  It is still very pretty and for a piece to update your wardrobe and be in style, this is a good piece.  It is versatile enough to wear for work or casually. [SEP] This item gets a ratings boost from the manner of presentation. Very pink drawstring bag contains some unexpected goodies included with the necklace. The drawstring bag itself is very nice: Nicely constructed and very soft material. The additions include a pink polishing cloth and a thoughtful gifting card (also a nice company card) The necklace is enclosed inside a very nice jewelry box with a hinged lid. It's a presentation box that you might expect for a premium piece of jewelry.<br />The choker/necklace is pretty, and well made. The 14k gold plating gives it a nice luxury sheen. The chain is thin, giving the choker/necklace a delicate appearance, which complements the small circular pendants. This can be considered a dainty, elegant neckwear...not a large gaudy piece.<br />Overall, for the cost, this is a very attractive and appealing necklace. Might be too late for Valentine's Day, this year, but if with this necklace as a gift, any day can be Valentine's Day.<br />Attached are photos to illustrate comments in this review, and show real world aspects of the product. Ruler shown for size reference.<br />This item merits high level recommendation. [SEP] the chain is not that dainty, it is kind of thick for my liking but doable. the thing that i really don't like about this necklace though is that it tangles, the shorter pendant will twist around the longer one and even the chain itself gets stiff from being stuck during the twisting. it's not pretty. the more you move the more they tangle together.<br /><br />length is fine and it is a beautiful necklace. [SEP] This is a really nice necklace!  The pendants are gorgeous.  The only issue I had was how short the chain is.  I had to use an extender to wear this necklace, so that it fell lower than my neck. [SEP] This is a nice looking double chain necklace with cubic zirconias accenting the larger of two circles. While it is a costume jewelry piece, it does not look cheap or tacky at all. The baguette stones are securely set and sparkle nicely - this is a pretty, understated necklace that adds a bit of sparkle without being overwhelming to wear. [SEP] Very pretty dainty necklace, Rose gold chain  with beautiful detail, reasonably priced, I would definitely go [SEP] It's presented with a little card, a lovely gift box and a pink velvety bag. Definitely meant as a gift, and inside all that, a delicate pair of necklaces combined into one. Perfect with my low-cut black evening dress.",3,True

I love how adorable these are, but also that they're made of easy-care fabric and well made. They wash well without shrinking or fading and are super comfy. [SEP] These rompers are light-weight and cool for hot summer days. We live in Texas, so that's important. I've gotten several items from the SillyApples brand. The items don't seem top quality, but good enough considering how fast babies grow out of their clothes. One thing that surprised me about the dinosaur print one is the dinosaurs are kind of like rubberized heat transfer decals on the fabric rather than printed with ink on the cloth, so it's definitely possible that may start to flake off with repeated washings. [SEP] These are so comfortable for baby. Love how roomy they're!<br />The color pattern on the white and blue are just so cute. The<br />black and white are not my fav but work as well. The snacks are<br />good and have not had any issues. They do wash well no fading<br />so far. They seems to run a little snug so size up! [SEP] We really like these rompers. They are light weight fabric that is soft to touch, cute prints and easy to wear - the material is stretchy so its easy to get in and out/change diapers in - has snaps to open and close without having to remove the leg like the carter ones . The reason i gave it 4 stars was the price. $20 for a 2 piece romper that is not even 100% cotton (its 60% cotton) feels like it is a bit much. But other than that, the prints are cute. The color doesn't run when you wash it with like colors in delicate cycle and we throw it in the dryer on a low setting and it comes out looking as good as new. Overall we like it and if you don't mind that it is $20 for something that isn't 100% cotton, go for it. [SEP] Super cute set of Silly Apples (An Amazon Brand) little baby boy short-sleeved rompers.

It's the all seeing eye of Horus. In ancient Egypt they wore this amulet for protection against evil. The bracelet is rather light in weight.

I mean, they stick on...and maybe don't pucker too much if you practice putting them on, but they don't lift enough.  It's like walking around with these things sort of hanging on. And, I'm a B cup, at best..probably an A.  I bet I could duct tape them 'up', but at what point are they no longer strapless?  I practiced a few times, but never felt 'held'. Maybe it's the type of tops that need this type of bra, but just not enough support for me. Maybe I'm too old (50).  Maybe there should be a 'suggested age?'  :) [SEP] wish i could use it more, the sticking gets weaker and weaker after only a few use [SEP] Awful no support, very large.... useless [SEP] I can't stand to wear bras with straps that fall off my shoulders and backs that squeeze me to pieces. This give me freedom as if I have nothing on, yet I'm covered. Takes a little practice to get right, but is great. [SEP] I chose this adhesive bra because it seemed so similar to one I had purchased previously, but can't seem to find anymore. It fit just as I was expecting, and the adhesive is VERY sticky so it seems like it is going to last for awhile. However, it's almost as if the adhesive doesn't go close enough to the edges because when you put it on, it seems to wrinkle a bit at the edge. This isn't so much of a problem depending on what you wear it with, but it could be visible under some tops or fabrics. For the people that are hoping for some extra lift, if you bend over and put it on from underneath the breast first, it definitely helps with lift and support! [SEP] I like nubra better, still did a good job! [SEP] They dont stick or work at all..waste of money. Ended up throwing away [SEP] This fell off! [SEP] I don't know if mine was defective, but even though it felt very sticky one side would not stay stuck for more than 5 minutes.

I had to send it back.<br /><br />Update 8/25/16: After Komene saw my review they sent me another bra free of charge, even though I had already returned and been refunded for the other one.

[SEP] The quality of the leather is decent and thick. But this really isn't a good coin purse because it doesn't open up easily. You have to poke your fingers in the pouch to get coins out or flip the holder upside down and shake. Standard coin purses have accordion style openings for a reason. This design ignores that reason and the result is something that is best as a credit card or business card holder. It does make for a decent business card holder.

Zonent Men's Colorful Funny Novelty Casual Merino Wool Socks Crew Socks,[],[],,3.4,31,6591,"They are quite warm!!!  They are colorful and fun! [SEP] I recommend these socks for yourself and they also make great gifts. [SEP] This is a thin, wool blend sock with a colorful design. I like the pattern very much. Do note that these are sized, so check you size before ordering or you may end up with a ‚Äúman‚Äôs‚Äù sock that fits a fifth grader! Recommended, but pay close attention to sizing. [SEP] Sizing is accurate, color and decoration is definitely fun and unique.  Warm and comfortable merino wool, the weight  is typical for a running sock, perhaps a light weight hiking sock thickness. [SEP] It says men socks but I've been wearing them and love them. They are very thick which I love, it makes them so comfortable. I'm not a sock person but I can wear these all day and not have any problems. Call me crazy, but I love the color and design of them as well! [SEP] Ordered a size large, received a small.<br />They'll fit my daughter so I'm not going to bother to return them.<br />For Merino wool, they don't seem very soft, more ""plasticky"" feeling.<br />Probably won't order another pair. [SEP] These are a great mid-weight wool sock. They're very soft and not itchy at all. The spandex and polyester that make up half of the fibers in the sock gives it nice stretch. I'm not really sure what the picture is on the sock. Maybe that's a giant rock hand coming out of the ground? I'm not sure. I've worn these winter hiking a couple of times (above freezing), and they've done just fine. They seem to be extremely well-made. The product page says that these are for men, but I didn't grow a mustache from wearing them, so I think they work fine for women as well. [SEP] I was shocked when I tried to put these socks on.  They were way too small for a mans feet.  Passed them to my wife to see if she could wear them,. [SEP] They absolutely live up to the 'colorful' description. They are fairly thin and were very small on me. I wear size 11 running shoes and they don't come past my ankle. They work well as a running sock and I can't say enough about Merino wool as a material. The spandex should help them survive more wash and dry cycles than socks with a higher wool count, but it may offset the wools legendary antimicrobial properties. Time will tell on that. I do really like the fun design and colors, there is no need to wear boring socks when working out. It is just too bad they are so small that no one can see how cool they look. [SEP] These aren't soft like silk, but more like a nice sweater.<br />They are medium thickness... not thin athletic socks, but not thick soccer socks either. They should hold up very well and not wear thin.<br />The thickness means they are warm, but have a natural wicking of moisture and heat... so they don't feel HOT.<br />Because of the thickness, could be an issue in TIGHT shoes, but otherwise, they are PERFECT.<br />Coushy and comfy.",3,True

ArtgGully Necklaces for women,[],[],,3.3,26,4602,"But they aren't. The oxidized silver gives them that antique look. Since the ear pieces do not work properly, I will have to fix them myself. I have the wire and the tools and so it should be fine when I am done. Looking at them, they would make a cute necklace too. [SEP] These beautiful earrings have an antique look to them that, combined with the ethnic design, have a gorgeous appearance. Nicely packaged in a protective plastic container within a natural fiber bag, these are ready to gift and are perfect for anyone who likes world art. Lovely! [SEP] (Reviewed by my wife):  These earrings are larger than expected and a bit heavy.  The design is beautiful - very intricate and lovely.  The pattern is very swirly and delicate, with a little daisy flower in the middle.  The packaging is also very nice - a cute little plastic tub that snaps shut, inside of a little drawstring pouch.  But I would not wear these earrings for longer than a few hours because of the weight. [SEP] I love the look of exotic earrings, and these certainly fit that description. However, they were quite uncomfortable and heavy, and they don‚Äôt hang right on my ear... When they‚Äôre on properly, they look great from the side. From the front, I can only see the back of the earring. Sadly, I‚Äôll probably end up gifting them to a friend. [SEP] These are a lovely pair of earrings from India .. hard to say what is the metal but they're nicely designed [SEP] I really like these earrings, a bit heavier than I expected (my piercings are really low on my lobes and heavy earrings tend to pull) but not too heavy. Exotic. Silver and black, fan shaped, about an inch and a half in width, an inch in length. [SEP] Whoa! These earrings are beautiful!  The craftmenship is beautiful. They are very finely detailed earrings. They are lightweight and non irritating. My wife has adopted this new style. Many people compliment her and ask where she purchased them. [SEP] I really think they are unique statement earrings, but I was hoping that the backs would have a design on them also. That's why only 4 stars. They aren't too heavy, but they are heavier than many of the earrings I have. I use the clear protectors for the back of the earring to help hold them in place better. You can find that on Amazon too. [SEP] These are pretty earrings.  Very ethnic.  They are a little large and a bit heavy--but not too bad.  But I've never seen earring fastenings made this way.  And it's terrible.  The earrings are unwearable because the wires are too thin and flimsy and they don't ""catch"" in the other side.  The wire is not quite long enough and the hold not set up deep enough or something.  The weight of the earring hanging from the wires--just pops the clasp open every time.  That's AFTER fighting for 5 minutes to get it in place once it's on your ear.<br />Epic fail on an otherwise lovely item. [SEP] I thought these were going to be silver but they have a gold/brass tone.  The hooks are extremely thick and I can't put in my ear holes without pain and burning.  Very pretty but I wouldn't advise unless you're used to wearing heavy earrings and your ear holes are stretched.",3,True

[SEP] I‚Äôve got a 26-year-old who loves getting new underwear (go figure). He‚Äôs 5‚Äô7‚Äù and an average build. Here‚Äôs his take: I‚Äôm not too picky about underwear, but I do like to keep cool and dry. These boxer briefs are mostly polyester (70%) and some cotton (30%).  The polyester helps them to keep their shape so that will remain where they are put.  They are a bit snugger than I expected (size medium) but still comfortable.  They have a nice wide waist band that does not rollover.  They don‚Äôt have a fly in the front but that is not a problem for me.  They do have an extra panel in the front to offer more support.  The quality is very nice and there are no loose threads or rough edges in the assembly.  If they do not hold up as expected, I will change my review. [SEP] Even though I recieved this product for free, this is my honest opinion and experience with this product.<br /><br />These boxers feel so soft and are really close to the look of really expensive brands. Me and my friend really enjoyed the softness of the fabric. These also dobt have the opening in the front which is a dream for us, we both never use that ourselves.<br /><br />They did have a slight tightness around the thigh area, enough to be slightly uncomfortable. I dont think sizing up would fix this problem, as the boxers were fine in the waistband and fit great everywhere else. The fabric is also really lint attractive, meaning everything sticks to it which can be slightly annoying.<br /><br />Other than a few minor issues these boxers are wonderful. [SEP] Got these for my son and we like them pretty well.  They're described as ""cotton stretch"" briefs, though they are actually 30% cotton 70% polyester.  Not especially accurate, but the fabric does feel more like traditional cotton than the currently popular dry-fit type of synthetic material.  The fabric is soft and very stretchy, with a comfortable waistband that does not bind.  The sizing is accurate, and with a very stretchy give they'll be pretty forgiving if your a little larger or smaller than the actual size.  These fit close, with tight leg holes - making them ideal for active pursuits where you don't want your underwear riding up and down or moving around.  I personally would prefer a little more give in the legs for everyday wear, but not a big deal.  Overall pretty nice boxer briefs, especially if you like a close fit.",3,True

"Charis Allure Women's Casual Blazer Lapel Collar Open Front Suits Long Sleeves Office Jacket, Black, Large","['Button closure', 'Machine Wash']",[],,3.0,10,4666,"A wardrobe staple for every woman. You can mix and match this blazer with any number of outfits and look great for an interview or look great at work or even for the evening when you wear over jeans. [SEP] I wear this at work all the time as an office sweater and I love it. Our office is freezing (aren't they all though?). It's excellent for a professional look, and it's just warm enough for a hyper air-conditioned office. I just toss it in the washing machine, no fuss, no muss. It's perfect. [SEP] This easy to wear jacket looks sharp for the office without looking too boring or plain. The fit is easy but flattering, and the rolled sleeve lands at the forearm for an attractive, Sami casual look. Great over shirts and pants or dresses alike! [SEP] I really like this blazer and that surprises me since I didn't think I would.  Women's blazers rarely fit me very well and this one fits me very nicely.  I love the pre-rolled up sleeves (I have very long arms and most blazer sleeves are far too short), and the light-weight makes it good to wear even on summer evenings.  It will go great with skirts, pants and blue jeans.  I haven't washed it yet but since it's made out of polyester I'd bet a paycheck it won't shrink or fade.  It's got some stretch and does not feel binding at all. [SEP] My wife, who is just about exactly average size for an American woman tried this on. She had to scrunch her shoulders to keep from damaging the garment. Her arms had no range of motion. So right off the mark this product is not as advertised. It is closer to a Small than a Large. Three quarter length sleeves may be a thing, but even when the snapped-up portion was released they did not reach her wrists. It would take a strangely proportioned woman to fit this.<br /><br />Taking a look at the jacket's construction, I was not impressed. The pockets were fake, just flaps where pockets should be. Anyone who has actually talked to women knows this is not acceptable. Women want pockets. It would not have damaged the appearance of the garment to provide pockets and would have only cost a few pennies, a definite strike against it.<br /><br />The stitching on the outside was adequate. I don't think the sleeves are going to come off in normal use. The stitching on the lining is another matter. The stitches are long and widely spaced and not terribly sturdy. The lining is not well sewn-in, and I am afraid it will start coming out in fairly short order.<br /><br />All in all this is not a good garment. The sizing is wrong. The construction is not great. The lack of pockets is worse than annoying. [SEP] This is a great blazer to tie your look together for a more professional or tailored style. The fabric doesn't feel expensive so 4 stars, but otherwise it's a cute style and look. [SEP] This is a cute casual blazer with two ‚Äúfake‚Äù buttons that fit as expected. Well, the buttons are real, but there‚Äôs nothing to button them to. This is an attractive blazer that would be good for casual or semi-formal business wear. Very cute in a very nice weight, very light to keep you from working up a sweat at work. Very pleased with this blazer.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

Good glare reduction. [SEP] The glasses broke at the end of the ear piece by the little hole. I loved them and was very disappointed. [SEP] Love them! [SEP] the glasses look good, my only downers are that they are not as dark as other sun glasses and the nose pads that come with it are a big to big. Thankfully they come with a small screwdriver so you can remove the nose pads if you don't like them, but that's it they don't give you or offer other size nose pads. In Overall good glasses. [SEP] They are good enough. Not great but okay [SEP] The fit is just fine and I like the panoramic view. I am impressed that even with a fairly large curved lens there is minimal if any distortion.<br /> For repeated cleaning I would consider something with a liquid like Brilliant to help avoid scratches long term.<br />It is a little tight to easily put the glasses in an out of the drawstring bag without touching the lens.

LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE SHADES!!! [SEP] These are lightweight glasses, but they don't work for me. They are designed to stand away from the face to prevent condensation, but I worry about insects (lots of gnats where I live) getting under the glasses. Also they are not as large as I would like, and don't wrap around as much. When I put them on I was very conscious of the lower rim in my vision field. Overall, not a good fit for me.

The fit is great too it's all the right curves only things is the buttons on the chest. Their so far apart and I'm busty that u can see underneath so I had to pin the openings closed. Buttons are gold but not like a fancy perfect fit but will do. I plan on changing buttons to close openings up better. And there is a zipper on the side so it is easier to put on. The material is thin and stretchy and even after washing and hung to dry it did not shrink. Great to wear dressed up to go out or add a coat for business attire.

I am really sad because the overall look is exactly what I wanted but way to tight in the length that gave a really bad fit overall. [SEP] Great fit. I'm usually a large or XLR and I got the 2X. Love it [SEP] I read the reviews so I ordered one size up, so instead of an XL, I purchased an XXL which was still very small. The bottom portion fit a little ok ( my butt is big so it stretched the waist out, but the belt helps cinch it slightly).  I'm an African-American woman , 5'4 and weigh 190. The buttons were a little stretched at the top. I had on spanx and a waist clincher so I thought it would fit better. I normally wear a size 14,  bra size 38D, so if you're a shapely big girl with hips, thighs, and boobs, I would suggest to go two sizes up. I couldn't wear it to the event because I received this product the same day.

Orchid Row Womens's Fancy Multi Color Casual Cozy Knit Infinity Scarf and Beanie Set Beige/White O/S,[],[],,3.8,20,257,"This is a cute scarf and hat set. The yarn of this hat and scarf set is much softer than I expected. The stitches are not your usual knit stitches. There are a few stitch loops that look like they have been pulled for a lack of the correct terminology and they stick out a bit further than the tighter stitches. I will have to be careful with those because if something catches on them, it may pull the yarn significantly. The edges are finished nicely. The hat runs a little small in sizing and does not fit my large head, however, I don't usually wear hats because they interfere with my bangs. Overall, I like it and expect it to keep me warm this winter! [SEP] I'm just not impressed here. The material is very soft and the neutral tan and white pretty much go with everything. However, the quality is sketchy. It's a very loose weave that is already pilling and coming loose on the scarf after just two uses. The hat is really small and essentially useless for my needs. This isn't terrible, it's just not high quality or durable. [SEP] Super soft, very cozy, very pretty neutral colors. Comfortable to wear & stylish. [SEP] Really soft and a very pretty neutral. I like the design a lot. The scarf is rather long (still plenty loose even when doubled around my neck.<br /><br />The downside is that the beanie fits my 4 year old but it is super tight on me. Even with my hair slicked down and tied at the nape of my neck, it is uncomfortably tight.<br /><br />This was so close to being just right for me, but my little girl likes it, so that‚Äôs something. [SEP] This is an attractive infinity and beanie set.  The lightweight fluffy pom-pom on top of the beanie gives it a whimsical feel.  I cuff the beanie when wearing it and it fits just fine.  In fact, if the beanie is not cuffed, it feels too large.  It's warm and comfortable - I have no complaints.  Both the maroon and tan look equally attractive. [SEP] Love this cream colored set.  It is super cute and does the job of keeping you warm.  Just wore both the scarf and hat in the Vermont snow and it was comfortable and soft.  Most importantly, it kept me warm.

This is such a nice and classy set for those cold winter days!  Appealing looking, warm, and well made, you certainly cannot go wrong with this hat and scarf set.<br /><br />The hat is one size fits all.  The knit stitch is a large pattern and very cool looking.  The pom pom on top has like a feathery look, not your usual knitted pom pom ball.  It's cute.  The bottom cuff is a different knitted pattern than the rest of the hat and adds to the over all good looks.  It is warm.  You may machine wash in cold and line dry.<br /><br />The infinity scarf is just as cool as the hat.  It measures 36""Lx10""W and that gives you plenty of play to wear in any style you prefer.  The knitted pattern matches the hat and is very well made.  The edging is a different pattern that also matches the hat.  I think you could also reverse the scarf and create an entirely other look.  The scarf is 100% acrylic.  You may machine wash cold and line dry.<br /><br />This set is available in beige, burgundy, and green.  The green is so dark that it almost looks black until you inspect it closely and can see the hunter green colors.

Fabric is lightweight and has a nice drape. The cut of the top/bodice portion unfortunately just isn‚Äôt terribly flattering on a small bust (32A)... It‚Äôs very minimizing. Would probably look better on a larger bust. [SEP] I like this dress! The one thing I‚Äôm not crazy about is that it does flare out at the waist but it‚Äôs not at an awkward sport which is good, maybe because of the pocket fabric inside. It‚Äôs very comfortable and light and will be perfect to teach in in spring. Would also look cute with a jacket of some kind. It hits me literally right before my knee, which is good for teaching.  Material is nice, can‚Äôt see through it(yay). Very tropical looking. The pockets are fantastic by the way. Somewhere to put my keys and phone is always a plus! [SEP] I liked this dress WAY more on me than on the hanger. I was prepared to hate it, and then I tried it on, and it was super comfy and quite cute. I washed before wearing, and it's really soft. Love that it has pockets. Great length, just above the knee.<br /><br />It is, however, kind of cheaply made. See the second pic. After washing, one of the sleeves had loose threads at the hem.

My wife thinks she looks like a rectangle when she wears it.  She says it is comfortable and true to size. [SEP] Overall, I'm pleased with this dress. I love the fabric and print, and I love the pockets. You should know that it's pretty short waisted, which can make the fit not quite right, especially because it makes the pockets feel too high.  It's nice and breezy, suitable for summer, and a good warm weather dress if you're self-conscious about your arms.<br /><br />I don't think I'm especially long waisted, but nor am I short-waisted.<br /><br />The imperfect fit on me means it isn't my first choice, but it's close enough that I'm still happy wearing it.<br /><br />The coloring looks great on a fair completion with olive undertones. I'd say the fit is pretty good, maybe just a little smaller than average--but that could be the short waist talking. If you're borderline between sizes, maybe go up. [SEP] Manaixuan summer tunic dress. This tunic dress is cute and I like the bold bright colors. It is see through so you will need a slip. I like the sleeves they are layered and 3/4 length. The dress fits well and ties at the neck in front on the neck chest area and lands above my knee. I am 5'4 111lbs and a 34D and this size medium fit well. Cute tunic dress for work or a casual evening out. The material is thin as I mentioned and it does wrinkle. I fluff dried this dress and the wrinkle mostly disappeared. Cute navy blue floral print summer dress. [SEP] I ordered this in the navy blue with nice bright aqua and green leaf patterns to contrast with the blue it really ""pops"". I've gained a bit of weight recently and so I am self conscious of my arms this is a light weight dress that can be worn in the summer, yet it covers your arms in a light flowy sleeve.  I would say the quality of this dress is something like you would find at Target.  I think this will become one of my ""go-to"" dresses as it is so easy to wear and can be dressed up with some wedge heels or down with flip flops or ballet flats.  I'm giving in 5 stars because it has pockets (yay!) and the price is right! [SEP] This is a good ""generic"" spring time dress. While it's not my favorite pattern, and the fit is just ""ok"", I think once this is dressed up with the right shoes, accessories, hair and makeup, it'll all come together.

They have ALOT of stretch & the 3x measures 19"" across the waist and about 17.5"" long waist to hem. It really depends how you want them to fit. If you want them fitted order true to size, if you want alittle room for movement and extra space in the crotch area, order up.<br />They are made of a Moisture Wicking material that he says is comfortable and cool.<br />I just washed a few pairs and they washed and dried nicely. I always wash blacks in cold water and I dried these on low heat. [SEP] These Awesome 360 Men's 6'' Cotton Stretch Classic Fit Boxer Briefs are nice enough, but I found them too large. [SEP] I have to say I really did like these boxer shorts.  I found the fit to be just perfect with a nice long leg that felt just the right length.  The material is a really nice soft cotton and feels good against the skin.  These are actually replacing my usual brand which have gone downhill.  Great boxers! [SEP] Awsome 360 men's boxer briefs.  5 pack of black cotton and polyester briefs.  The waist band is a good quality elastic  and the briefs are comfortable. The fit is good and accurate.  These dont ride up per my brother and they are soft and dont pinch or cause any irritation. Great quality mens boxer brief that wash well without shrinking. [SEP] The cotton fabric on these boxer briefs are pretty comfortable.  The fit is larger than expected so fits me pretty loose even after a wash as you can see from the pic.

Looks, and feels good my husband said.<br />Janmid did not skimp on the material, its a full size large, and it fit my husband good. He does not like to wear tight shirts.<br />it is roomy he can move his arms around, and he had a tee underneath.<br /> He is 5,9, 157 lbs..just to give you a idea on size.<br /><br />I washed this with other clothes in cold water,front loader, and also put it in , about a 1/3 C of vinegar with the soap, and also in the Rinse cup..Vinegar is suppose to set the color in, and in the rinse cycle makes the clothes softer,<br />although I use a natural type of dryer sheets.<br /><br />The shirt did not fade, or shrink, and the color did not transfer to other clothes.<br />When I took the shirt out of the dryer it looked, and felt thicker. Maybe it brought up the napp on the shirt.<br /><br />No loose threads, buttons are good. I would recommend this shirt. [SEP] This shirt, even though it is 100% cotton, is unbelievably heavy. During cold weather, with a solid t shirt underneath, this is going to be a good jacket type overshirt. The inside of the upper back and the inside collar are corduroy, which is heavy too. It isn't as soft as you would expect, but after a few washings, I know it will get softer. Make sure you follow those washing instructions [SEP] I liked the brushed flannel feel, and the color is ok. However, I had a few issues with this product. First, this was more of a heavy shirt or a light jacket. There was some kind of cordoroy lining around the cuffs and the collar. I would prefer regular flannel material. Second, the size/cut. This was huge. HUGE. I was able to wear a sweatshirt under this shirt, and there was still a lot of room. The sleeves were so long that I was able to roll up the cuffs twice, and the length was still too long. I'm between a Med and a Large, and this was just absolutely too large for a Large.<br />I will wear this during winter, maybe over a sweatshirt. I cannot honestly say whether or not I recommend this shirt. [SEP] This flannel shirt is very well made. True to size. Bob loves the shirt, says it is very warm. Has held up being washed, in laundry mats while he is on the road. Gives him moving room in it. Great shirt. ( Bob is wearing a shirt underneath) I hope this has helped. Thank You [SEP] This shirt is exactly what a flannel shirt should be. Cotton, slightly thick, warm, and buffalo check! The corduroy accents at the collar and cuffs are an added bonus and elevate the style just a bit.<br />The fit is true to size. There were a couple of loose threads on it but nothing that was connected or improperly sewn.<br />It's going to be a great weekend staple piece for the winter and the price is right! [SEP] Janmid men‚Äôs long sleeve flannel shirt appears to be well made with surprisingly great quality & stitching for it‚Äôs price point. A lot of flannels tend to have horrible stitching, loose threads & weak buttons. This flannel was made with attention to detail. The corduroy accents are a nice touch, but the color clashes a bit with the dark black & vivid red. I assumed the color choice was so that this flannel can compliment jeans well, however in today‚Äôs modern times, jeans aren‚Äôt worn as much as they used to be. A neutral black or tan would‚Äôve been a better choice in my opinion. The outside of this flannel is remarkably soft, but the softness isn‚Äôt matched with the insides which is real bummer because the outside is the kind of soft you‚Äôd want on your skin. It‚Äôs almost like a teddy bear softness. My husband wears this with a shirt underneath which makes the slightly rough insides more doable. I presume with a few more washes, it will soften up. With that being said, I would recommend it for it‚Äôs current price of under $20. [SEP] I wasn‚Äôt expecting this to be so thick. But was pleasantly surprised that it was. Perfect for a cool fall day but not so great for warmer days, seriously, this material is very thick and warm [SEP] my husband likes this a lot, he said its just like his other flannels he owns some are old mill brand and some from sam's club. this one fits as should. [SEP] Usually a large fits perfect but this was a tad too big. After putting it through a wash and dry on low heat it did shrink a bit to now the perfect size. No red bleeding which is great! Overall the shirt is very comfortable and well made. Nice thick collar and cuffs. No fraying strings. Nice thick and cozy material for the winter. Highly recommend but may need a shrinking to fit properly. [SEP] I love how soft this shirt is. The colors are very bold and the fit is good. I took off one star because the tag on it says to dry clean it, which no one who buys this shirt is going to do. Other than that, I like the shirt a lot.",3,True

It's also just a bit large for a purse, but too small to be used as anything else. Not my favorite one, but others might say otherwise! [SEP] First off I am in LOVE!! Lets go inside. First you have a small open pocket and a large zippered. Nice material black. Outside. On one side a deep zippered pockets. A long adjustable strap. The leather is pebbled and smells amazing. Now to the original art work on both sides. It is off the CHART!! The colors are so vivid. I am not an art critic, but I love this it makes me happy.

Thank You [SEP] Usually I see a picture of something colorful on a product page which looks immaculate and vibrant only to find that the colors are washed out, drab, or muted.<br /><br />Not so in this case - the colors really do pop on this purse and there's no mistaking this with any other (nor will you lose this sucker in the crowd!).  It's very sturdy and very well-organized - my wife loves it a lot and it's her new favorite purse. [SEP] I love everything about this bag except the strap: I am unable to shorten it to a length that works for me (5'2""). Adjusting to the shortest possible length, the purse still rides well below my hips. I prefer the top of a cross body bag to be around waist height in order to be able to reach into the bag easily.<br /><br />Other than this, the bag is delightful.

It has three zippered pouches on the outside, one zippered pouch on the inside and a cell phone pocket. Very spacious on the inside with a top zipper closure. also an adjustable strap for over your shoulder. [SEP] This is a very bright, colorful bag.  It is a great size for when you need to carry a decent amount of stuff with you. I often like to bring a book with me, and this is a good size for a variety of size books.  You can carry some makeup, your phone, and more.  I love purses that have some separate compartments and zippered sections, and this purse offers that.  It even has a RFID section to keep your person info and debit cards, etc. safe.  This bag feels like good quality and like something that will last a lifetime. [SEP] I really admire hand-painted purses like those made by Anushka. But they are quite expensive. This Louis Pelle purse comes in about a third of the price but it looks just as beautiful. It's a steal considering it's made of real leather. This particular purse has three zippers in the front plus another in the back so organizing contents is a breeze. (I also have found that using cross-body purses are easier on my shoulders and I can avoid putting pressure on the stents that are in my shoulder.)

I think a small would have worked too. I like that there is removable cups that offer just the right amount of padding. [SEP] I ordered what was supposed to be a tank for my very skinny friend. However, she can't fit in this. First of all, this is not a tank top. Tank tops fall below the belly button and this one comes above. Second, it runs on the small side. It includes a padded bra and the fabric is super soft. I do not feel this would be supportive enough for running but for light workouts it would be great. The problem is the short style. I can see this is more for a teenager. I also feel the current price of $29.99 is too expensive for this. [SEP] I'm 5'7"" 125lbs 30FF and ordered the medium. Initially I didn't think this would be supportive at all because this top reminds me a lot more of a cami instead of a sports top. It's soft and comfortable, lightweight. It actually does provide a light amount of support that works fine for weight lifting/stretching/lounging. It's also not too cropped or low cut on me which is great!

If you want to layer it with a raincoat, be sure your coat is big enough as this is not a fitted style and is bulky.<br /><br />Pattern/Color:  The chevron design is attractive.  The white/gray/black color block combination looks sharp.<br /><br />Design/Fit/Sizing:  There a kangaroo pockets on the front.  The hood is not fitted, more for style and keeping a light breeze off your neck.  It is somewhat short for a hoodie, but width is true to size. [SEP] Love everything about this hoodie.<br />The tri color love is the best.<br />It‚Äôs soft and keeps me so warm. [SEP] I normally wear a large so this fit as expected.  It is super comfy and warm.  I wish it was a little longer to come farther down length wise.  It fits just at or slightly below waist level and I like sweatshirts to fit a little lower than my hips.  Neckline doesn't choke you when putting on or putting hoodie up so that is a plus. [SEP] This tri-color hoodie sweatshirt is very pretty. The black-white-gray chevron pattern is very flattering. The fleece inside is soft and very comfortable but not so thick that you notice it. Wore this sweatshirt for about 10 hours running errands one day and was very comfortable. Would definitely buy this sweatshirt in other colors should they be offered. Enjoy! [SEP] The material is thick and soft but its cut very odd.  The sleeves are fine in length but its tight in the arm pits.  The length is VERY short!  Width is fine.  If it were longer and and more room in the armpits, it would be a favorite. [SEP] This hoodie sweatshirt is pretty ugly and is way too large in the shoulders and chest area.  It doesn't fit at all as the pictures indicate as it's actually much broader in the shoulder area.  This sweatshirt is best for a very barrel chested individual as it is proportional length wise, just not width size.  It is quite warm and soft so if you are just looking for a comfort sweatshirt to wear around the house, this would work well.  It didn't shrink much in the wash but it looks like it's pretty poor quality and won't hold up well over the long run. [SEP] I usually wear an XL in sweatshirts.  I got this in a L and it fits great.  So, I would say it runs a little big.  It is a more fitted look than what I normally wear in sweatshirts.  And it's VERY flattering!  I know.  A flattering sweatshirt?  But it is.  The arm holes are a little offset off the shoulders.  That makes it very comfortable and non-restricting.  The chevron stripe goes down the sleeve which makes it more flattering.  Now about the quality of the fleece.  It's thick and very soft.  The front hand pocket is warm and doesn't add a lot of bulk.  The hood is plenty big and draws closed with large, wide ties!  The sleeves are the perfect length for me.  I am 5'8"" tall and this comes down to middle of my hips.  It measures 22"" from shoulder to bottom of the band. It says it's 60% cotton and 40% polyester.  It also says it can be washed and dried in the machine.  I always hang my sweatshirts to dry so that they do not become too short.  This seems like a quality sweatshirt.  It's made in China.",3,True

She has been having some ankle and Arch issues lately and decided to start doing more barefoot workouts as my arches are stronger now than when I was a teenager.  Her big problem is that she is constantly slipping on the carpeted living room where we do most of our workouts.  These socks off a great grip on the carpet with out causing her to stick to the floor in other areas of the house.  They fit perfect and are breathable and comfortable to wear.  She says don't wear them with shoes as they feel strange and are a bit uncomfortable in shoes.  These wash up just fine and no issues with shrinking.  These are great workout socks. [SEP] These turned out to be better than I'd expected. They are comfortable & help keep my feet a little warmer in the winter when I'm doing yoga. They do slip a little during some poses, but not too bad. The absolute worst yoga socks I've ever bought (actually my husband got them for me) were by Gaiam. Those were ultra thin, totally uncomfortable, & moved all over my feet during poses. Other brands I've tried have been unknowns like this brand. I've been happy with most of them, but so far, these are the best. [SEP] These socks are well made, and the material is sturdy and thick. The bottoms have an excellent grip, making these ideal for slippery floors. These hold up well in the washing machine. I let these air dry instead of using the dryer. These socks are stretchy and comfortable to wear. The material is thick enough to keep my feet warm on cold floors. This is a good value for a pack of 3 pairs of socks. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:126859cace6c53975c31fb700cd2637d]] I really like these socks.  The material is thick enough so I think they‚Äôll last quite a while, but thin enough that I can wear them with my tennis shoes when I‚Äôm on my way to somewhere else.<br /><br />This is my first experience with yoga socks.  Although I have some hospital socks that have grips on the bottom‚Ä¶these socks *really* grip.  I wear socks around the house a lot because I have cold feet.  But I gotta tell you that the first time I walked onto the tile kitchen floor with these on I almost face planted‚Ä¶because I stopped.  Boom.<br /><br />This is a three pack with 3 different color patterns.  Not very feminine choices in the pack that I received, but hey if they‚Äôre good socks I don‚Äôt care.<br /><br />The size is a good fit for me.  I am a size 8.5 and they‚Äôre not too tight‚Ä¶but they are snug.  Make sure that you don‚Äôt get them too loose or they‚Äôre not going to grip when you need them to.  They say they‚Äôll fit up to a size 9 and I think they probably would.<br /><br />The price also feels like a good value to me for what you get‚Ä¶3 pairs of very nice socks with good grip.  So big yes on these. [SEP] Cute socks with ""grabber"" circle on the bottom. With our wood floors, these have been great for running around the house and not worrying about slipping. Also, one day I forgot I was wearing them and put on sneakers for a 3-mile walk around the neighborhood, and they were just fine. The colors are bright and cheery too. [SEP] The grip on the bottom of these is very effective - I wear them when I lift & have a floor of cushioned mats that regular socks slide on. They're better than shoes, as I can properly feel the weight distribution on my heels.<br /><br />My shoe size is 9.5-10 & the opening at my ankle is just a bit snug at first, but they break in/stretch a bit just fine. I have been washing in cold (in a net bag so they don't get lost) then air drying.<br />At a little less than $5/pair, they're a good value for some excellent workout socks!<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this review & I hope that it's Helpful!) [SEP] I got these to bring to the hospital with me when I deliver my son and don't find them to be super comfortable. There isn't any extra padding on the inside of the sock, so you can really feel each of the grips pressing into the bottom of your foot. It gets the job done, just not my favorite thing to walk around in. [SEP] I love ‚ù§Ô∏è these, I don‚Äôt slip anymore [SEP] I highly recommend these non-slip socks.  They have multiple purposes in addition to Yoga.  Wearing them prevent slippage on many surfaces.  I wear a size 8 and they fit very well.  I'm not sure they would be large enough for a bigger foot.<br /><br />The colors are great and very noticeable.  It's a well designed sock and reasonably priced.",3,True
5 Pairs Womens Merino Wool Warm Winter Thermal Christmas Crew Socks,[],[],,3.5,33,29,"I absolutely love these socks. Super soft and at a reasonable price, these socks are made of Merino wool and are sure to keep your feet warm during the harshest winter days. The fact that they are Merino wool means they are thinner and more lightweight than traditional wool, but their warming factor is not diminished. This 5 pack of socks were perfect for me and I am able to have almost a week's worth of socks for my use and I wear them whether it is with jeans or even the darker colors with my work wardrobe. Highly recommend. [SEP] I love these wool socks because they are lightweight, comfortable, stay in place, and neither too heavy or thin for the warmer climate in which I live. I have a size seven woman's foot, and they are a perfect fit with no overhang at the toe or heel. I had to check the fiber content because they have a natural fiber feel that reminded me more of cotton than wool, but they are mostly wool and feel very breathable without being too warm.<br />Fiber Content:<br />53% Merino Wool, 24% Cotton, 16% Polyester and 7% Spandex.<br />They mold perfectly to my foot and include several neutral colors to match everything in my wardrobe. I love the look and feel, and they are well made with no loose or hanging threads on the toe seams.

Thank you so much üòä ** [SEP] The woman in our household is a dedicated sportsperson. She hikes and runs in the summer, and hikes and skis cross country in the winter. These socks have already been through quite a workout. They remain, dry, warm, and are very good at not becoming stinky. Highly recommended. [SEP] I didn't find these socks to be warm or cozy and didn't notice any wool.  They also were small on me which made them not cozy, although they were supposed to be my size.  At least they're low priced because they're just average socks. [SEP] These socks are thinner than I was expecting. ""Cozy"" isn't the word I'd use to describe these. Their thickness reminds me of men's dress socks. They are basic wool/spandex/acrylic blend socks. They do fit me well and seem well made. These socks would be great for mild fall and spring weather. They went through the wash and came out good as new! [SEP] These are great quality and fit well (I'm a 9.5). Wash well, too. No complaints here! [SEP] The wool socks are pretty warm for winter outdoor activities, but it feels a bit stabby fabric-wise. It's not as thick which is nice and easy to fit in the shoes but also not as soft and fluffy. My feet are 6.5-7 and this fits nicely. [SEP] I ordered these with some trepidation about them. These wool socks are thinner than most meaning that I can wear them with all my winter boots - a real plus. They are a bit scratchy to the touch, but that may change after they're washed. [SEP] Doesn‚Äôt fit comfortably. Too low and a bit large and loose. Doesn‚Äôt feel like wool despite being wool. Feels artificial. Too thick and clunky to be dress socks but too thin to use as winter socks for warmth. Don‚Äôt like the feel. [SEP] Nice product:)",3,True

It is warm, comfortable, and well-made.  It also looks good. [SEP] This hat is especially welcome since we're having our first stretch of cold weather in quite a while. It's warm. It's comfortable. It's adjustable for snugness, and it's got that old Combloc esthetic. I'm very happy with it, and at $19 it's a very fair price. [SEP] While it is warm, its not very stylish...but that's OK.  The clasp used to keep the hat on is kind of hard to use, but it does work. For the price, this isn't a bad hat. [SEP] I like this hat. its warm comfortable and cozy and looks great. The fit is very good and its very verstaile to wear it in different ways. My son liked it so much he took it from me. [SEP] I liked the QingFang Bomber Hat  very much both for its styling/color and the warmth.  First off its very warm.  The Faux fur does a great job of keeping heat in or cold out.  The brim, held up with a button, can be folded down to provide more face protection from wind and cold.  I have a size large head and the hat fits great and is also adjustable with a locking strap  (see picture).  There ear flaps to provide added coverage over the ears and can be buttoned up.  The only thing under the flap is a small brass inlet to air hearing (see picture).  It has a chin strap to hold the hat securely.  The strap uses a friction clasp and not a snap latch (see picture).  I put the shell under the faucet and it did repel water so it is water resistant.  There are graphics on how to care and clean but I don't understand what they mean however the webpage states that washing is only by hand with mild soap and line dry. [SEP] Super soft and really keeps the wind out.  I am not sure if it is because I am getting older or its just getting colder but I find myself more sensitive to the cold and really needed a better Hat to walk the dog in.  I was already told that I needed to get one for my husband since he liked the look and feel of it as well.  It's great that you can adjust it in the back and you can wear the flaps up or down.  Stylish and functional, love it. [SEP] This is an adjustable bomber hat with hanging ear flaps. The material is 100% nylon, including the outer water resistant shell, the inner soft terry lining, and the fake fur. It has a drawstring adjustment band with a pinch clip around the rim, which allows you to adjust the size from quite small to quite large. On the sides are short ear flaps which can be button up or buttoned down according to your fashion sense. The long ear flaps can also be worn hanging down, clipped under the chin, or clipped on top of the head. The hat was made in China.<br /><br />I find this hat very warm and comfortable. At first I though it was too large for my 22‚Äù head, but then I tightened up the drawstring and it fits perfectly. My husband, who has a larger head, is also able to wear the hat comfortably by loosening the drawstring. The only issue that I have had is that the clip on the ends of the long flaps is not that easy to use. The first time I clipped it under my chin, I couldn‚Äôt get it loose and I was stuck for a while. So practice with the clip before you use it. I think I‚Äôll probably replace the clip with an easier one to open. But overall, this is a very warm hat and should fit just about anyone.",3,True

[SEP] Nice, sturdy, colorful umbrella that I expect to last me quite some time. Takes up little space and opens/closes easy. Very happy with my order. [SEP] We had a full week of rain that immediately came to an end when I got this umbrella. I was finally able to test it out this week and so far I'm really liking it.<br /><br />I've been through a lot of umbrellas. My favorite one was one I just found, sad and abandoned. When that one broke, I tried at least three different umbrellas that all disappointed me, pretty much from the start.<br /><br />This one folds up easily and compact, which is exactly what I need. I had one I liked, but wouldn't fold down, making getting in and out of the car a pain. This one actually folds the canopy at the touch of the button, so no more fiddling with a sliding mechanism while getting rained on. Then I just shake it a couple times and push it against the floor of the car to collapse the handle. And, so far, I haven't had issues with the handle not collapsing and staying.<br /><br />The canopy size is enough for one person, which is all I want in my umbrella. I prefer a smaller one that fits in my work bag over one that can house a group of people. I'm just one person, and that's all I need to cover. And it does keep me dry, or at least most of me--you can't do much when the rain is coming at you sideways.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to test it in much wind, but so far it hasn't turned inside out or broken in the little bit of wind we've had.<br /><br />Overall, I love this umbrella. I love the color, I love that it's compact, I love that it has a little slipcover. I forsee a long and happy relationship with my new umbrella. [SEP] A button extends the umbrella, and indicates that it retracts the umbrella, but it doesn't seem to pull it in. I have to do it by hand. On the upside, it doesn't pinch me every time like some other umbrellas do. I am not sure about how windproof it is, though. Steady breezes haven't really pushed it much, but I am waiting for a real stiff blast that turns someone else's umbrella inside out to be sure. If I see that, I will come back to update. [SEP] This might be the umbrella that keeps me from killing multiple umbrellas every year. It is ever so slightly larger than other compact umbrellas, but not enough to be bothersome. In exchange though, you get an umbrella that seems to be far more durable and wind resistant than any other compact umbrella and even some golf umbrellas I've used in the past. It opens and closes with a convenient button. I would probably not recommend this umbrella for a smaller kid just because the mechanism is pretty powerful and a finger or face in the wrong spot could be catastrophic, but for an adult it is great. The day it came it was pouring and windy and the umbrella stood up to the job well without bending or flipping. The handle is also pretty comfortable. I am hopeful it will last a long time. [SEP] I don't believe it's possible to have too many umbrellas, especially in these days of unexpected showers accompanied by high winds.  The extra ribs on this small umbrella provide security, and the push button mechanism is easier and smoother than most.  Very happy to have this tucked in the car where it comes in handiest when experiencing a sudden storm. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:78bdbda770bd59530f4fb70204261969]] we all know what it's like to press a button and have your umbrella open, but not many have tried to press a button and have your umbrella close. It really works and works well and it's small enough to fit in your glove box, bag or trunk. It can be hidden in your golf bag or it's even small enough to go everywhere you go without being obtrusive!  I opened it a bunch of times and it works every time. I don't use the cover because I find it cumbersome and flimsy. [SEP] This is a wonderfully sturdy umbrella especially for windy areas. This will negate the necessity of replacing an umbrella after it‚Äôs turned inside-out a few times. It‚Äôs nice looking, has really strong reinforced ribs with springs to help keep them taut, has double-cloth layers on the canopy, and is just all around a really quality umbrella. The one downside to this extra sturdiness is that this umbrella weights much more than our compact umbrellas that we keep in our briefcases. I don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôll want to add that extra weight to our briefcases, but we‚Äôll definitely be stocking our automobiles with these extra-sturdy umbrellas. [SEP] Used primarily as a sun shade for one season's worth of soccer practices/games.  The automatic open/close is nice, but maybe a little too forceful:  the ribs began to detach from the canopy very quickly.  It still works, but has gotten a little finicky when folding up.  I don't think it's going to last through a second season... [SEP] The OMYSTYLE UV-ray blocking umbrella is a fine product that may make rainy days a bit more bearable. It is sturdily made, has a forty-two-inch span, and opens and closes partially at the touch of a button.  One drawback is that you need sufficient arm strength to retract it fully. This umbrella comes in variety of colors, folds up compactly, and has a snap closure.  The handle is easy to grip, and the fabric carry strap is superior to those scratchy plastic ones. I have not yet wind-tested it, but anticipate that the ten ribs will be strong enough to hold up in nasty weather. As always, allow the umbrella to dry thoroughly and fold it properly before storing.",3,True

It started ""ticking"" immediately once I picked it up. I shook it a little to ""charge"" the automatic watch engine, and set the time. That takes me to commentary on the bracelet.<br /><br />The bracelet on the watch is different that bracelets I've had on my other watches. It's not complicated, but being new it quite stiff. The first few times I took it off took some effort, but it's much better now. That's my only beef with this remarkable little watch so far, the bracelet, and I think the bracelet is going to be great once it's broken in.<br /><br />As for timekeeping, I set it to my ""atomic clock"" at home and it's consistently stayed within 1 minute of the time on that clock since I first set it. I found it has a reliable Seiko engine, and I've found it to be very accurate, especially for a bargain automatic watch.<br /><br />Overall I'd rate this a 4+ star watch, but for the money it's better than 4 stars. Maybe I got lucky, but this watch is superb so far and I'm actually enjoying it a great deal. [SEP] Looks great - feels great - seems quality - the Skeleton back is a bnice touch. I really like the coin bezel - keep good time when  it IS running. I loved it all except one flaw. The automatic  movement is designed for an active user ONLY!  Mine would constantly stop some time during the night even though i usually do not sleep more than 8 hours.  I really like the idea of not having to depend on batteries for power - but in this case  it was unusable for me - probably because i now lead a more sedentary life at my age. The undependability to hold enough energy to go through my average 24 hour day made it unsatisfactory.  If it were NOT for this issue - i would have given it 5 stars. An excellent quality watch - just not right for my current lifestyle. If you lead an  average active life - GO FOR IT. A very cool watch.. [SEP] The is a spot on copy of my Gold Rolex Submariner for a sliver of the price.  It keeps almost as good time as my real Rolex. [SEP] This is the tenth watch I have purchased from Invicta and the only one not to hold time. It will start losing time after about four hours of wearing and will lose four-six hours if worn 24 hours. Disappointed.  Also, it seems the watch bands on some models are not the same, so make sure you check it out, purchased two within months of each other from the same source, a five-link difference between the same model watch.",3,True

It would be good for a birthday or Mother's Day. I would recommend it. [SEP] I find this Ruana to be just beautiful and am so glad to have it.  It 's very soft and flowing, with little pearls attached which give it such classy flare.  I can wear this with dresses or jeans and it instantly upgrades my outfit a lot.  There is nothing negative I can find to say about it.  It's just lovely! [SEP] I was skeptical of the pearls on this. I was sure they would make it look cheap, but it's a very elegant looking poncho/shawl. There's lots of room here even for plus sizes-- the smallest sizes may find it a bit too generous. Everyone who wears it will appreciate the softness and warmth, and the color will compliment many outfits both day and night. Great for casual and formal outfits, and all ages. [SEP] One size fits all and it really does.  I am a big woman and I think this looks great on me.  There is no fit at all to be concerned about.<br />This is one classy wrap.

NCCB House Slippers for Women Memory Foam Breathable Slippers Light Grey Size 9,['Foam sole'],[],,3.5,30,3719,"Love the memory foam in the slippers. They're so cozy and soft, they'll be my new slippers when the weather gets cold. The nonskid soles are good for wearing on all surfaces too. Very well made and great quality. [SEP] I am a heavy slipper wearer in the cooler months.  As soon as I put these on I could tell they won't last the season.  The footbed looks very thick and comfy until you step on it. Then you hit bottom.  No support.  The sole itself looks like a decent enough weather rubber.  Im sceptical they will wear well. [SEP] Review for: NCCB Womens Slippers Memory Foam Warm Slip On House Slippers Nonslip Family Indoor Slippers<br /><br />I really like these slippers. They are super easy to put on or take off because I can just slide my foot in or out of them. There is definitely some type of foam in them because of the amount of cush that I feel when wearing them. The bottom of the sole has a bit of traction so they aren‚Äôt slippery. The sole is also quite flexible.<br /><br />I found the sizing to be perfect for me. I normally wear a size 8.5 and I ordered a 9. They are just a bit sloppy but no more than expected for this type and size of slipper. [SEP] I got these non-skid memory foam house shoes for my mom. She is disabled and needs a good shoe that fits good, to wear around the house. We used to get her house shoes, like this at a local big box store, but they haven't been stocking them lately, so when I saw these on Amazon, I rushed to get them. Although these are a bit tight, they are still wearable, and as she has worn them, they have relaxed to fit her fit better. I give these shoes 4 stars only because of the tight fit from the beginning. [SEP] I wear a size 9 shoe and unfortunately these size 9 slippers run a bit small. Because of that the slippers aren't very comfortable for me to wear. I would recommend going up a size when ordering. Width wise they feel fine, although when you are wearing the slippers they do make your feet look wide but that is extremely common with with most slippers. The look of the slippers is slightly unique with the plaid flannel lining near the opening and the rest of the slipper on top is primarily grey with flecks of white and black all throughout. The slippers don't look high end and luxurious but they look decent enough to wear around the house. Compared to other slippers I own, I do think there is a decent cushion so they are easy to walk around in and I do like the non slip bottom as I don't feel like I will slide around when walking. [SEP] As cooler weather approaches, so does house slipper season. These are super cute, very comfortable, and best of all, not slick on the bottoms. Highly recommended! [SEP] NCCB memory foam warm indoor women's slippers are comfortable to wear. Warm, cozy and breathable. Flexible non slip rubber sole padded with high density memory foam. Will not slip on wet tile or leave marks on wooden floor.<br />Suitable for indoor use at cool weather. Order one size up is recommended for easy slip into the slippers when wearing thick socks. [SEP] Very great for casual wear! I wouldn‚Äôt wear them outside, probably best for indoor use. Size fits as expected. The grey color is slightly darker than what is pictured. The pink in the plaid is very muted and subtle. I like them, they‚Äôve really held up well after weeks of constant use and washing! I machine wash wrapped in a towel and let mine air dry with no problems! [SEP] The NCCB Womens Slippers Memory Foam Slippers are extremely comfortable.  I am usually a size 8 in shoes and I like my slippers to be slightly big so I ordered a size 9 in the slippers.  They are perfect.  They are just a little big which I like.  They slip on easily and the foam on the bottom make them comfortable to wear.  I like the gray color and the plaid border.  They match with almost all of my pajamas.  The bottom of each slipper is a thick rubber which does not slip, even on hardwood flooring.  Overall, I really like these slippers. [SEP] These are so soft and comfortable that my feet feel like they're inside pillows! I wore them all day long forgetting that they were on my feet. The foam inside is thick and cushiony providing good feet support and the quality is good. I usually wear an 8.5 and size 9 US fit me just perfectly so I would suggest sizing up.",3,True
Due East Apparel Wome‚Äôs Solid Color Yoga Capris/Full Length Tummy Control 4 Way Stretch Workout Leggings Navy Blue,[],[],,3.5,7,6966,"They are comfortable, but the material is more like athletic wear than softer cottony feel yoga wear. However, even with all its athletic feel it's not at all compressive and very thin. They are nice to wear around the house or out with a long shirt, but they are not flattering and show every line and bump. [SEP] These are a lovey navy capri legging that is so soft, I'm amazed!  This fabric is silky!  It washed well, and dried well in the dryer, without issues.  I would suggest line drying them to make the quality last longer.  They do have a nice tummy control panel and elastic that is thicker than some of my yoga leggings.  These do not have any pockets, that is a down side for me, but not worthy of losing a star.  I don't like that they sewed in a tag on the left thigh, it really bugged me so much I had to cut that out!  I am 5'4"" and these capris go to 4 inches above my ankle.  Lastly, the big draw for me is the fabric, It could possibly have me coming back for another pair in the future. [SEP] These yoga capris length pants provide a snug yet comfortable fit.  I'm 5'3"" and about 118 pounds and the medium fits well.  These look nice on provided I wear a top that goes over my stomach but that's because of how I'm built and not the fault of the pants.  There are no pockets and I looked extensively for the one that's stated to be on the inner waist band and had no luck.  Still these are a good value and are great exercise pants. [SEP] These yoga pants are really nice.  The material is thick and stretchy.  The length on me is ankle length as I'm only 5'0 tall.  There was no weird smell when I opened them, which is always appreciated.  They are ok with tummy control but not too tight and I like that.",3,True
Udalyn 56 Pairs Stainless Steel Stud Earrings for Women Men Assorted Multiple Stud Earrings Pearl Moon Heart Ear Studs Geometric Cute Stud Earrings Set Silver Gold Rose Gold,[],[],,3.7,44,5015,"This set is huge.

They are decent quality and work for every day use. It‚Äôs a good value if you want daily studs to wear that you don‚Äôt mind if you happen to lose one. [SEP] These are okay earrings. I feel they are cheaply made and not for anyone with sensitive skin but there are a lot of options from 90s wear to holidays to simple. [SEP] I love this amazing collection of earrings for pierced ears! Includes 56 high quality metal designs in silver & gold tone. The posts are stainless steel so they don‚Äôt irritate my skin at all! The end caps slide on easily and stay on snugly. Among my favorites are the knots, moons, snowflakes, bows, skull & crossbones, elephants and Christmas trees with a tiny cubic zirconia at their tops! There are also some very cool triangles! And stars! These also include plenty of bling with 4 fairly big, round cubic zirconia, 8 medium, & 4 small. Other designs include small cubic zirconia in them. And I adore the many pearls that are included, from large natural looking pearls to gold & silver tones (smooth) and textured. The packaging is great with separate cellophane bags and one large velvety bag that holds all 56 pairs. A different pair of earrings for every week of the year, plus four more. Awesome collection! Would make a stunning gift. [SEP] This is 56 pairs of earrings, each pair are different and they come in different metals. They are comfortable and really lightweight. Some of my favorites are the bows and diamonds. Really great set. [SEP] I have to be completely honest.  When I saw this large amount of earrings, I expected junk.  I have been very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />1. There are so many earrings in this set.  I can see the photos, but I was still shocked when I started going through them.  There are a ton of different earrings and most of them are things I will wear.<br />2. I have fairly sensitive ears and have been burned before on earrings that claim to be stainless steel, but immediately cause my ears pain and to turn green.  I have had the same two pairs in for about two weeks now and have had zero pain or irritation.<br />3. The two pairs I have had in for two weeks also still look just like they did two weeks ago.  I haven't noticed any discoloration, peeling, etc. that you see in cheaper earrings.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this set and would recommend them.  Just be sure you have a place to store a huge amount of earrings! [SEP] This one has a ton of nice looking earrings, none of them seem overly cheap but don't expect real diamonds or anyting craazy like that...<br /><br />All in all I think if you like the price point and you like the styles this one has you will be happy with this set...<br /><br />Just my thoughts,<br /><br />AK [SEP] I like how this comes in 3 different smaller packages that are easier to store. This seems like a good deal for how many styles it covered from the selection. The metal feels sturdy, doesn't look too cheap. It will make a good gift between friends. [SEP] I was looking for some every day stud earrings and ordered this product. There are 56 pairs with an assortment of  silver earrings, gold earrings, and rose gold earrings. Mix and match for every day and also for dress up. Love the assortment. There was also a bonus included, a lovely velveteen pouch to store them in. This is a great buy and would make a great gift. [SEP] It's nice having so many different pairs of earrings,  especially since I have two little girls. Some of them are great, and some of them, not so much. Some look pretty cheap. I keep a few pair in the car and in different hand bags, so if I am ever out and don't have any on, they will do the trick. [SEP] Some of us cannot keep track of our pairs of earrings, as they pull off in the course of doing work around the house, pulling shirts over our head, tossing toys for the dogs etc. This is the solution right away -- an affordable collection of 56! pairs of stud earrings. Hopefully I can hang on to these long enough to still have matched pairs for a good while :-)<br /><br />Most of the earrings are on the tiny side, which is completely fine at this price point.

They cover a lot of your face so they'd be great to wear on sunny days with a nice sun hat to match. Theyre great for running errands when you don't want to put makeup on, because no one will be able to tell! You can kind of tell my eyebrows aren't on in the picture but only if you're looking very hard haha<br /><br />The quality is definitely what you would expect from a $12 pair. The lenses look nice, but the arms look a little cheap and fragile (mainly the gold bits).<br /><br />If you like the style and want a pair of glasses you don't have to worry about losing, these aren't a bad choice though! [SEP] These glasses have metal frames and plastic lenses. They are not polarized, but they do have a grey color to them. They do have a more than adequate amount of sun protection. The lenses are HD for a better view through them. The best part, is that if someone runs off with them or loses them, it wasn't too expensive. [SEP] These sunglasses by SKYWAY rock!! Very lightweight but durable. The style is just right! I love the shape of the lenses. They cover the eyes completely. I have no need to squint or shade my eyes when wearing these. The nose pads fit comfortably and the sunglasses do not slip down on my nose. They come with a nice case so your sunglasses stay in good shape. I would expect to pay more for these sunglasses than what they cost. Great for both men and women. 5 stars hands down! [SEP] What do you need to hide today?  Long hard day running the kids around?  Didn‚Äôt have time to put on your makeup?  Long night out? These oversized Mirror lenses will cover all that.  Or they just look cool.  Where them with a big floppy hat and keep out of the sun.

These are fashionable, versatile, inexpensive, and works great for all of my outfits. I also don't like investing in very expensive sunglasses because I am so harsh with them...

I would describe this as equivalent to the thickness of a medium grade ankle sock. My foot is a size 6 US women‚Äôs so...I really can‚Äôt picture them stretching to accomodate a foot larger than a 7 without feeling a tad uncomfortable. Again, comfort level is relative. One person may find tighter to be comfortable.These are good, but i honestly have a different brand that is more comfortable so 4 stars is all I can go. [SEP] These Giotto yoga socks run small. But they do feel good on. When ordering from the drop-down box, it states size ""5-1/2 to 9 shoe"" which I selected because I wear a size 8 woman's shoe. However, the heel was between my heel and the center of my foot. Can you imagine how disappointed we size 8 or 9 customers are with ill fitting yoga socks? Very disappointing. Socks definitely need to be made longer for this size range. Since the Shelter-in-Place has taken over our lives, I've been doing yoga and workouts from the internet instead of driving to the gym. So we've started putting together a home gym (still working on it) which is in the basement on concrete floors. Cold...brrrr....need socks! I have Raynauld's Syndrome so very sensitive to cold. So I need more and more socks that fit, by golly! [SEP] My daughter loves these non slip socks.  She does yoga and dance and has used them while doing both of these activities.  The socks fit perfect.  There are 3 different pairs in different colors.  She loves this color set that I got.  The grip is just right for her.  Good socks and worth the money. [SEP] These are good nonslip socks for exercise and/or safety when walking on slippery hard flooring. I received a 3-pack in a nice color assortment of pink, purple and khaki. These look good on with a decorative stripe that crosses the top and surrounds the heel, and the nonslip bottoms are particularly grippy with better than usual coverage with silicone features. These have diamonds and the Giotto name underfoot and an attractive tulip in nonslip silicone under on each heel. The breathable stretch cotton blend is absorbent and comfortable.<br /><br />The stated size range is a woman‚Äôs shoe size 5.5-9. I wear a shoe size 10 to 10.5, so I fall outside the range. Still, the foot gives me enough room and these are a comfortable fit. These appear to be more low cut on me and come up just under the ankle, likely because my feet are bigger than the stated range. But the fit is secure and the back at the heel doesn‚Äôt slip down. The quality is good with minimal stray threads and nicely finished edges and seams. I‚Äôve machine washed and dried my socks a few times so far, and they still look like new. These are good nonslip socks. Recommended. 4.5 stars. [SEP] they slip proof socks are great. I do not use them for yoga but with some laminate floors in my house slipper socks are a huge help to not slide around. These socks fit very nicely and tight. Not so tight that I feel like my circulation is compromised. I'm not a fan of loose slipper socks and these are exactly what I was looking for. They have a lot of slip resistant spots on the bottom of the socks. Unlike  some you buy at the local store that are loose fitting with few spots. I like these and would recommend them. [SEP] What great socks! They grip well and are perfect for yoga or barre work! The colors are cute, too. These wash well and, best of all, are comfortable. They don't go too high on the ankle or low, which is such a frustrating problem with other brands. Generally, socks are large on my tiny feet, but with these, the heel was just right. They may run small, because of that. I think these socks are worth it, especially if you're looking for socks with a strong grip to the floor when working out. [SEP] These are great socks.  I‚Äôve worn them doing yoga and other exercise as well as just wearing them around the house as slippers.  The grip is great on my hard floors.  I like the different prints and colors as well. They are pretty comfy so I find myself choosing these socks often during this stay at home covid time. [SEP] These socks are great and they're comfortable! The gripping on the bottom is perfect for tile floors and other slick surfaces. It's almost as good as the hospital slippers, but they are thin enough to wear in any shoe. There was 3 in the pack and they were different colors. [SEP] These socks are really nice!  I wear a women's size 10 wide shoe, so I took a chance on them even though my feet are a little bigger than the specified size - they fit great!  They are comfortable to wear and don't slip down at all, which is my biggest pet peeve about short socks.  The grips on the bottom of the socks work really well, but don't hinder your ability to wear shoes.  No complaints here - 5 stars! [SEP] Sticky bottoms like they should be. Nice colors.

And that's before washing!<br /><br />Also, the cut is really odd.  As a woman, I obviously have much thinner shoulder widths than most men. These actually seem to be cut too narrow in the neckline/armhole region.  In other words, if you have ever seen the back shoulder area of a &#34;racerback&#34; tank top, that's kinda how these are cut both in the front AND back.  So, since they are cut narrow there but then jut out and are cut straight in the stomach area, they look really frumpy.<br /><br />I know I'm a female buying a male's item, but this isn't my first time trying on unisex clothing, so...yeah. The fit is weird.  Given the narrow cut of the shoulder width and the small size of the items overall, I think these were definitely made in Asian sizes--which are often 3-4 sizes smaller than US size.<br /><br />The good:<br />The material is great.  Not at all flimsy or light, has a great &#34;hand&#34; to it (in other words, very soft...before washing, as i can't yet say how they'll feel once they shrink and the sizing is removed).  It's quality knit fabric--something I do actually know a bit about since I've been sewing apparel for thirty five years. [SEP] Very happy [SEP] Loved the atyle, loved the material quality. HATE the sizing. 2XL should be size med. Returning product for refund. [SEP] Made for smaller men. [SEP] Se shirts are good quality. I bought them for myself but after opening the package I realized that were tiny. No way I was going to wear them looking like the shirt was about to burst. So if you buy, make sure your honest with yourself about your size and order at least one to two times bigger. [SEP] Yep 6 shirts.... however they fit short and are really itchy. [SEP] For the price these are really nice tank tops. The quality is better then the Fruit of the Lome one's I already own. The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is the non USA sizing. Unless you look at the photos you will not realize these are Chinese sizes not USA sizes. [SEP] I ordered these tank-style t-shirts for my husband, who is a large man. He usually wears a 3X; but these only come in XXL, so we did expect them to be a snug fit. However (in a wife's opinion), these look AWESOME on him, and show off his build, and make his back and shoulders look like a bodybuilder !<br />They are made to fit snugly, and they do; but I tried one on myself, and they are also super comfortable.<br />He was impressed at the double stitching around the arms and neck, and the nice quality of the material. The colors are deep and rich, and just everything about these tops is first-rate quality.<br /> I am sure he will be ordering this brand again when he wants more tank tops.<br />We received these tank tops at a discount offer in return for an honest opinion of the product; but I would have written the same review if we had paid full price for these shirts. [SEP] Returned with a following comment: &#34;If this is XXL product, I must be 5XL and I am only XL&#34;... [SEP] Made of good quality but it was too short.",3,True

Looks fabulous with a top and casual pants - you really can't go wrong with this color combination, I've worn it with white and black - feels great. You can wear it to work or going out to a restaurant or a party. [SEP] I really love the style of this shirt but so disappointed in the cheap quality of It. I'm honestly afraid to wash this piece on delicate cycle. If they made this shirt with better material I'd give this 5 stars but all I can do is give it 3 stars and that's being generous.

As long as you‚Äôre good with the length you will love this shawl. It‚Äôs soft and has a nice smooth feel. It requires hand washing, and I‚Äôd be very surprised if it didn‚Äôt. The beads don‚Äôt look tacky and give it a bit of personality. Overall it‚Äôs very nice. [SEP] Covered in pearls which I didn‚Äôt notice in photo, but I love the weight of the wool.  I‚Äôve worn it over a suit, just with a turtleneck and trousers,  and a dress.  Arrived on time in perfect condition. [SEP] Item returned because of thinness and poor quality.. Being very sheer also not what I expected [SEP] My wife just gasped when she tried this on. Very well designed and drapes nicely.  The peals just make this look great.

It comes in a blue velveteen pouch that makes it perfect for gifting.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] This is a gorgeous tassel necklace that could be worn as a belt. If you love boho - you would even accessorize your hair with this. It is truly beautiful - you have a braided cord, beaded cord, faux suede cord artfully braided together. 2 large tassels at the ends held by a large glossy wood beads. This necklace only costs $12.99 at the time of my review - and I think it‚Äôs a steal.<br />If you are looking for gift giving - this will be so perfect and beautiful - and it‚Äôs packaged nicely into a royal blue velvet bag - ready for gifting.

I've also wrapped it around to use as a headband.<br />It has a very unique look that works with a lot of different outfits.<br />It comes in a very nice velvet bag which is great for storage or gifting.

It is a very attractive accessory. [SEP] I like that this can be used in your hair, around your neck, around your waist, on a handbag, or even in the household as a decor accessory. It's large, considering some other necklace styles are thinner.  It is long enough to play with. [SEP] Received through Vine for an honest review.  This Bohemian inspired tassel necklace is beautiful.  Much nicer than I expected.  Approximately 50 inches long including the tassels.  Small gold beaded thread braided throughout, wooden beat at base on each end and then knotted with pretty tassels accented with gold.

Anxious to wear it with an outfit.  Very pretty and recommended! Would also make a nice gift :) [SEP] So cute! I wear it with a knot at the bottom but it can be worn many different ways. It is fairly thick so keep that in mind when ordering. It looks great with my black and white boho shirt and it doesn't pinch the skin when worn. [SEP] I'm worried that the beadwork in this braided Ldurian Boho Long Fringe Tassel Necklaces for Women Femme Beaded Long Sweater Necklace Multi-Purpose Bohemian Jewelry Collar may not stand up to the rigors of the weight of swaying tassels.<br />I'm not sure the workmanship, especially in the beads, will contribute to making this a durable and long-lasting accessory.",3,True

They‚Äôre lightweight and let the breezes blow through - and make outside reading a pleasure.  Great for the beach!  The style is good, too - I get compliments! [SEP] Finally I don‚Äôt have to pull out reading glasses when outside! I like that the bifocal part of these glasses is not very visible when wearing these glasses. The regular part of the lens is large enough that the bifocals do not get in the way of normal vision. The frames are neutral for men or women and are lightweight. The glasses come with a nice case and a cleaning cloth. [SEP] Sunglasses with reader lenses built in sounds like a fantastic idea, especially if you're middle aged or so and trying to read the back of a label while outside. I generally get a big pair of decent lensed sunglasses to wear over my prescription glasses.<br /><br />These would be so much easier, but the placement of the reader lenses is too low for my face. Unless I hold them up off my nose, I can't read with them. So close. I've never had issues with glasses fitting, but the placement may work better for you. [SEP] Love these glasses! I just fairly recently discovered bifocal readers, which changed everything. No more having to find readers every time, losing them, and never having any nearby when you need them. The bifocal sunglasses came next. No more driving in sunglasses but being unable to read anything close. Read outside on the deck!<br /><br />These are a great shape and seem very well made. My strength is 3.00 which isn‚Äôt easy to get on here sometimes in readers of any kind. These are perfect, the lens is crisp and not wavy or flawed, and the bifocal area is the right height and is right size. The hard cloth covered zipper case that comes with them is really great too! [SEP] These are super comfortable on w/the lightweight construct.  Not a deep dark gray but still blocks sun adequately and the bottom bifocal part is just what I need since I've not been able to order RX sunglasses.  The only thing I would change is to extend the lower bifocal part just a wee bit up on the lenses.  Nice & strong at 3.0 mag and look cool on too! [SEP] My husband is farsighted and his eyes are sensitive. He wears prescription glasses with bifocals, and had to wear bulky sunglasses that fit over his regular glasses, because Doc said they could not tint bifocals. He has prescription sunglasses, but without the bifocals, which makes it difficult if he has to use his GPS, or read a Google map while driving. He can actually drive without his glasses now, wearing these sunglasses with the addition of the bifocals for close up reading.<br /><br />He also wears them indoors when he's using his tablet. The screen is bright enough to cause him to squint, but if he dims it and wears his regular glasses, it is difficult to read. These sunglasses allow him to keep the brightness and read without squinting.<br /><br />They fit snug on his face. The arms are nice and tight even though they are not spring loaded. If he turns his head quickly or looks straight down, they stay in place. They are comfortable and lightweight and he highly recommends them for people in his situation. [SEP] I was excited to try these. The whole concept of reading glasses and sunglasses sounds intriguing and as I'm getting older, my eyes are getting worse.<br /><br />First of all, I want to mention what I love about these. They are really lightweight and comfortable. The sunglass part works well in the sun and for driving. The case is also lightweight.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the readers feel like the placement is off and they're really hard to get used to. I also get a headache when wearing these too long. I was hoping to use them for reading outside and though I can for a little bit, I can't for prolonged periods. Overall, these are a great idea but need a few tweaks. [SEP] These are your go-to vacation glasses, so you can read by the poolside and still see your book without straining your vision. They're comfortable, true to prescription, and great at blocking the sun. [SEP] These are made very well.  There is one thing that bothers me a lot.  That is the fact that these are bi-focal reading/sunglasses.  For some reason it is very odd to be looking through bi-focals and sunglasses at the same time.  I'm sure that I will get used to that.  Meanwhile very nice glasses. [SEP] These serve a purpose.  I am having a bit of trouble warming up to the idea, but I think I would enjoy them very much if I were reading out in the bright sunshine.",3,True

They aren't incredibly thick and have that crackled color variation in them. Lastly there is a braided leather band that is real pretty. Worn all together this braided piece really pulls it all together and it can look really nice. It's a nice casual look.

So far, the efficacy has been 0%.  The bracelet is copper (I checked underneath the leather wrapping the bracelet).  Actually, I am not sure if the leather is real or not.  There are two round magnets at the ends of the bracelet.  The bracelet looks very nice and is adjustable by bending the bracelet.  I try to make sure the magnet is touching my skin.  I guess I‚Äôll just keep wearing it and see what develops.  If anything, it‚Äôs a nice looking bracelet. [SEP] The concept of these bracelets is great. I wear a lot of neutral colors and liked how these all went together without having to shop for them separately. However the two leather bracelets (the ones I was really looking forward to receiving) are so poorly made. The leather is all twisted on the braided one that often the wrong side is facing out. And the double strap one just looks like they used the pieces to death before making them into the bracelet.

I would not call this true leather but dont let that discourage you- really leather probably wouldn't wear as well.  We all wash our hands- or we better?!- so jurys still out.  But Ive worn it 4 times and it functions well and there's no damage to the bank or weird water marks.

It's like 2 Stars just a basic braid that isn't that great.<br /><br />The leather is pretty thin and the color is a bit drab.  I have other costume jewelry by Sunsoul and it‚Äôs great for its price-point.  This one isn‚Äôt my favorite.  It does however, look much better when it  is paired with more items.  Easy to pull on, I didn‚Äôt adjust the size so they may be more difficult.  Overall, this isn‚Äôt fantastic or total blah.<br /><br />Second item up is the Black leather open cuff bracelet.  This is actually more like a 4 star bracelet.  It isn't overly thick (you can see it in the photos ) with copper end caps.  Bracelet or Cuff is open enough that most people should be able to easily get it onto their wrists with out making any adjustments.  If you do need to adjust this, it is simple, a small amount of pressure when pulling at the opening will spread this cuff, then reapply pressure to close comfortably on your wrist.  For me this is a bit more masculine in look when worn by itself.  But I like the materials and make of this more then the previous one.<br /><br />There you have it 2 for 1 special on reviews.

Orchid Row Women's Chic Classic Wide Brim Hat with Hand-Made Hibiscus Design Embroidery UV Hat Tan,[],[],,4.3,22,8800,"I really like the whole look of this floppy straw hat. The fringed edge and embroidered flower make it fun and unique. The wide brim is flattering and protects your face from the sun. It fit me comfortably and stayed securely on my head, so the hat is both fun and functional. [SEP] This hat is a substantial hat in that it has some weight, texture and quality.  It's floppy, but will keep the sun off your face and the back of your neck.  It flops just the right amount of flop.  The embroidered floral design is attractive but a tad on the gaudy side but still nice enough.  This is one of the few hats that actually fit my head rather nicely.  This hat will look really good this summer with a sun dress or while relaxing by the side of the pool. [SEP] This is a cute and sweet hat. It has fit me well and is comfortable to wear. While it doesn't have the widest brim ever, it's a nice(average) size and does provide some protection from the sun. If you need a great deal of protection(like umbrella protection), you'll want a wider brim. It looks well made and I like the character the flower adds to it. There is also fringe around the edge of the brim, which adds a bit more. [SEP] Well made, sturdy and feminine. Practical for sun protection. Does not fit xl head. Looks best on a smaller head. [SEP] I do a lot of gardening, so I'm always looking for a hat with a wide brim so that my face will get some protection from the sun. This hat looked like it would work well, and it had a cute design, so I ordered it.<br /><br />First of all, the hat does look well-made, and I like the fringe effect around the brim. However, the reason I docked it two stars is because it's way too big for my small head. It's so big that it comes down to the top of my eyebrows. I've tried getting things that stick to the inside of the brim to make a hat fit better, but they never stay in place.<br /><br />So, I recommend this hat if you have a medium to big head, but those of you with small heads should pass on this. I just wish people who make this kind of hat could come up with a way to make it adjustable so that those of us with small heads could make them work for us. There are more than a handful of us out here, you know. [SEP] LOVE this hat. It goes with beach wear, tiki, pinup, traveling... You can fold up it up in your suitcase, pull it out, put it back into shape. The stitched flower design is very Hawaiian, tropical. It's just a lovely hat. It's a little large, IMO, but that isn't going to prevent me from wearing it on my tropical vacation. [SEP] We gave this hat to our 6 year old daughter and she absolutely loves to play dress up with it. The hat was too bulky for me (the wife) to use and obstructed my view too much while wearing it, but the embroidery is beautifully done and tightly attached, and the straw (at least I think it's straw) is tightly woven with no loose pieces that can be pulled out. Even though I can't really use it I still gave it five stars because it's a beautiful hat that's well made and our daughter absolutely loves to wear it when playing dress up, or just going outside at home in the bright sun. The brim is wide enough that no sun gets in her eyes, or mine, when worn. [SEP] I asked my wife what she thought of the Orchid Row Women‚Äôs Floppy Hat. Without hesitation she said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great! I love the hat. It has green leaves and a cute pink flower. It‚Äôs very fashionable. Let‚Äôs give it a five star review.‚Äù<br /><br />There is nothing else that I can add to her review.",3,True

Stocking Fox Ballet Dance Tights Convertible for Women Girls 2-Pack White Adult Small/Medium,['Tumble Dry'],[],,3.5,23,9482,"These are very durable, and stretchy stocking dance tights for women and girls.  I am not an expert on dance tights, but just looking at them, feeling them and testing them out I think they will last a long time.  There is nothing negative I can find to say about them.  They seem to be very well made out of good material. [SEP] These are nice, thick tights; not totally opaque but close. They are fairly snag resistant, which is important with a house full of cats. They go through a warm wash (delicate cycle)/ cold rinse and normal dryer setting without snags or pulling out of shape. The medium is actually long enough for an adult- I am 5'6"" and they are just fine that way. Sadly, they are very, very small around for a medium size. I fall right into the middle of the 'medium' size on the chart and they are so uncomfortable I cannot wear them other than for testing them for review. Anyone heavier than I am wouldn't be able to get into them at all. [SEP] They are OK, but I prefer a fully closed foot and a color that does not show wear with the first wash. I would not order them, because of that preference and because the white starts getting grayish when washed.<br /><br />Price:  At ~$15 for a 2-pack the price is reasonable (not a bargain).<br /><br />Color: The white is a true white out of the wrapping, but has started to get slightly off-color with washing.  This is a risk with white tights. The dark color from my black dance shoes does not come out either.<br /><br />Sizing: The XL (or womens S/M) is a snug fit for someone 5'4"" and 110lbs.  They look tiny, but but expand tremendously.  So ... don't be concerned if when you open them you think you were sent the wrong size.  They are sufficient in length and snugness to stay put well.<br /><br />Style: I prefer a full sock on the feet vs the open pad, but it is as shown on the website. [SEP] I think the sizing is a bit tricky because it says it's for both women and girls. It's probably better if it's for women OR girls. As a woman in my 40s, with not very long legs (I have long torso), around 5 foot 4 and 125 pounds, with a 36 inch hip, this fits extremely snug... no room for more expansion. Any more stretching would probably tear this. Therefore, so far so good, it fits, barely, and I fear for its durability on someone like me. Maybe I am a much larger woman than most who will be wearing this.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's very comfortable and soft. The convertible foot hole is very nice and useful. I would highly recommend anyone smaller than I am to get this. [SEP] I knew I was taking a risk when I ordered this, as the size chart only went to 5'8 and I am 5'9. But I was well with the weight range (145), so I thought I would give it a chance.<br />And yes, they are a little short on me. The gusset does not sit flush against my body. Were I thinner around the hips and thighs, I think I might have gotten it to fit, but at my weight and height it was just a tad too small. However, these are convertible, and if I wear them footless, they fit perfectly.<br />That said, the stretch was incredible. I had doubts when I opened the package and the unstretched waistband was about 4inches across. It took some careful wiggling, and there were some moments I felt it catch around a nail or a callus that I was worried it would run, but I got it on nicely. Though I'm still concerned that the material feels like they will run easily. [SEP] So my first impression was a bit of disappointment because the size guide on the packaging is not identical to the one available here on Amazon. The S/M is for people just a bit shorter or lighter than I am based on the guide on the packaging vs my being within the sizing guide available online. The first pair I put on and was actually able to wear as tights, but considering how much I had to stretch them, opted to wear as leggings to preserve their life. They are quite comfortable and thick enough that I am afraid of getting runs just by looking at them wrong. The second pair though I didn't even bother trying to wear as tights (so they were not overly stretched) and yet by lunch time they were already developing holes at the seams, so there might be a mild quality control issue with this brand. Aside from that, these are a lot nicer than the cheap tights I've used in the past, but are maybe just a bit lower quality than the $50 tights I used to wear. I really like the convertible feature - besides allowing me to wear them despite buying the wrong size, it is also really nice to have some grips on slippery floors. The opening did sit in just the right spot on my foot so it would not be noticeable even with the most minimalist shoes yet is large enough to be useful when barefoot. The toes section easily becomes legging cuffs. [SEP] The order of the tights came with two pairs. The material is thick, very soft and flexible. The size runs small but it fits well to your form. The bottom of the stocking has an opening with seam around which keeps the tights in better shape. Also works well as transition tights to pull the tights up around the calves. [SEP] The sizing on this was very confusing.  On the package it says XL but the amazon label says s/m.  Its a child's XL or Women's S/M!  I think they're intended to fit older teens/young women.<br /><br />It would be helpful if that was cleared up.<br /><br />The tights are  good if not great quality.  They're certainly adequate for practices and school recitals. [SEP] I ordered these dance tights for my 14 year old granddaughter. She is rather petite, so these actually are a little large on her (they do stretch tremendously). She is actually just wearing them as normal, everyday tights. I can't comment on their use a dance tights, however, they are a good value for casual wear, especially because you get a two pack. I would prefer a closed toe on the tights, but, I knew they were open toe when I ordered them, so I am not using that to affect my rating. The material is not super thick, and they do tend to run easily. Because of that, I took them down one star. [SEP] Opaque white tights that are feet free. Not see-through, but is form-fittingly snug! On the tighter side. Made well and smooths over legs for great support. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and have a butt, so it‚Äôs really tight around the rump, but fits well every where else.",3,True

I'm a plus size 1XL, so I ordered a 2XL for fear that it would fit smaller. Since the percentage for the size was lower. The quality is a little iffy, I haven't actually worn it anywhere yet, but we'll see what happens after my first wash.

Anti Blue Light Blocking Glasses Women Men Eyewear Frame Transparent Lens,[],[],,4.1,14,38200,"I love Blue Light blocking glasses. I have noticed such a difference upon using these. My eyes no longer burn or feel strained. In addition, I have noticed a reduction of headaches in using. The added bonus is when I'm in bed reading when I decide to go to sleep I do not seem to have such difficulty. The blue light would keep me up past the time I wanted to and with these glasses the moment I turn the phone off I go to sleep. [SEP] The hinges on these glasses are stiff and clunky (and they aren‚Äôt premium enough to rate springs) so I can‚Äôt really give too good a review. Once in place, they look OK.<br /><br />Comes with a tiny UV/violet light to show that something gets blocked. [SEP] These are cute they seem to help with my eye strain. They came packaged niceMy in a leather like case that came inside a soft baggy case. They came with a cleaning cloth as well as a test strip and blue light for testing. [SEP] These specs are really cute, and I usually hate how I look in glasses.  As for function, while they definitely make my screens look less harsh, it will probably take me a few weeks to see if blocking blue light helps with my eye strain and insomnia.  In any case, I figure these are a fashionable way to see if this new blue light glasses trend i've been reading about actually works. Will post an update next month. [SEP] The frames I received didn‚Äôt match the picture.  The lenses are not crystal clear, they are decent but not great.  They have a lot of occlusion and blurry spots.  However they are effective I. Blocking the blue light which helps me sleep better at night. [SEP] Maybe i have a small head but these were huge for me. The quality was nice and they are really cute, you can't beat the price but they were big for a woman. [SEP] They are a little large...if they were round, I'd feel like I'd just stepped out of the 80s. They're comfortable though, not too heavy, and they prevent my eyes from getting tired from staring at blue light of the computer all night long. Comes in a soft but sturdy case with a little light to prove that they are indeed, blue light blocking. Good deal for the value.

NCCB Womens Clog Slippers Size 7 Memory Foam Warm Slip On House Slippers Nonslip Family Indoor Outdoor Slippers Black,['Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate lining'],[],,4.5,31,7388,"The fit is slightly smaller than expected but does offer a soft cushiony feel. Myself, open backed slip ons are a challenge for me to not walk out if them. With that said, I believe the slightly smaller fit has actually helped with keeping them on my feet without doing the shuffle walk. A really well made pair, these would makes good holiday bonus gifts. [SEP] These memory foam house slippers are cute but are a little narrow at the front.  I ordered my usual size 7, and it seems to be too crowded for my toes at the front area when I walk.  The widest width at the front is 3.5 inches.  For me, I could not wear socks while wearing these slippers.  The available length for the foot is 9 inches.  I say ‚Äúavailable‚Äù, because there is a 1/2 inch raised lip around the heel.  As far as comfort, it is soft when I walk on it, but the narrow front offsets that comfort.  I didn‚Äôt really get any arch support that is being stated in the description.  The tread is not substantial.  I wouldn‚Äôt walk on a wet surface with these slippers.  The upper is made of 100% polyester.  I didn‚Äôt feel sweaty wearing them, though.  In summary, I would order one size up, especially if you like wearing socks in the winter with slippers.  I gave these 3 stars, because of the narrow front and the lack of good bottom tread. [SEP] First of all these are very comfortable to walk around in. Love how soothing the memory foam feels. I feel like these can be  unisex and got them hoping my son would like them too. He felt they are comfortable, but  did not care for the low heel, he prefers full heel coverage. I look forward to continue wearing them through the winter. [SEP] I wear a size 7 ladies, purchased a 7 and they fit very well.  These are very comfortable slippers.  The clog style makes them slide on easily and they stay on when I walk.  I thought they might not be warm since the back around the heel is open, but they are nicely warm.  The soles of my feet are very sore; these slippers are pretty cushiony to help that, but not perfect.  The memory foam is thick, but not quite dense enough to totally protect my feet from the hard floor.  But they are really nice, are comfortable, fit well, and so for the $18.95 currently advertised price, I do recommend them.  The soles are a quality rubber and so they are durable.  I took a photo of that for you to see.  The soles are durable enough that you could wear these outside (like to get the mail or something), but I don‚Äôt.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope that my review helped you! [SEP] I purchased these slippers through the Amazon vine program. I‚Äôm a slipper junkie‚Ä¶ I have so many different pairs of slippers from cheap Walmart ones to my Ugg ones and everything in between. I‚Äôm hard on my slippers because I wear them outside. I love slippers with an actual tread and these have it. I‚Äôm a size 8 1/2 and always buy slippers in an 8. After they loosen up and have broke in‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre always way too big. I purchased these in a 7 and they fit PERFECT ‚Ä¶ even after they‚Äôve broke in. They‚Äôre comfortable and stay on your feet. They‚Äôre a velour type material but thick. There‚Äôs a nice band of red plaid to break up all the black. I think they‚Äôll wear out gracefully. [SEP] Great slippers to have on hand in the home especially when getting home from a long day at work or getting out of the shower they are really comfy with the memory foam bottoms [SEP] Solid foundation. Cozy and warm. Great for indoor and outdoor use. Not sure if I'd call these non slip esp on hardwood floors. [SEP] These are exactly as you see in the picture and are very comfortable. The memory foam makes them really nice for walking around the house (although I can already tell that it will be the sort that quickly stops being so spongy - but you almost can avoid that I find with shoes). These were a size 7 which is what I normally wear and the fit was great. The back is a little lower than I would like although once the foam settles it will probably stay on better. [SEP] These slippers are of good quality, well made and elegant. They are soft and comfortable and feels good, perfect for winter indoors. [SEP] NCCB slippers are really comfortable.

I pulled it out and instantly uttered ""What in the world?!!"". This is not a trench coat, it's not a coat, it's nothing I would want to be caught out in public in.

It is light and good for summer and it looks elegant [SEP] I love the color of this jacket but it's not exactly like the picture it showed. The texture is strange feeling, and when you have it on and tie the belt around you it won't stay in place, it keeps slipping down and then the coat bags down. I think it needs a button or hook and eye on the inside to keep it together. It also is not lined so I'm not sure you can call it a trench coat. I'm not thrilled with it but my granddaughter wanted it so I've given it to her. It looks very stylish but not exactly as pictured. [SEP] This is by far the worst thing I have received from Amazon.  The description says it is a ""trench coat"" and I assumed it would be a coat.  An actual coat.  It is more of a bathrobe.  It is thin and contrary to the description, very much UNlined.

The pompom on top is quite scraggly (lots of loose ends, and it arrived rather crushed from shipping).<br /><br />Overall, there's nothing special about this knit cap.  It's not particularly soft, it doesn't feel great on my head (too snug for me -- caps like this should be much fluffier), and the weave is definitely too thin.

Huawei Watch 18mm Replacement Band - MOTONG 18mm Itlay Leather Repalcement Band For Huawei Watch Band And Huawei Fit,['Buckle closure'],[],,4.7,17,238584,"Everything was as promised, very satisfied. [SEP] Got brown leather strap and fits the Huawei watch perfectly. Does not come with the quick release pins but does come with a little tool to remove the pins.

Fits nicely. Only thing is, putting it on the first time was difficult. Still 5 stars [SEP] This band fits perfectly and looks very nice. I bought it to replace the metal bracelet that came on my watch. This band is also more  comfortable. [SEP] A little stiff to start with, but it starts to break in.  I had to replace one of the pins as it broke a few weeks after use. [SEP] Beautiful band and extremely well made. Mine didn't come with the quick release pins, but who cares. It took me all of 2 minutes with the provided tool to put it on. Buy this with confidence. [SEP] I purchased this band for my Seiko 5 and I am happy to report it fits perfectly has quick release springs. I think the buckle is a bit too big and bold and I replaced it with one I had from an old watch. So far so good! [SEP] Let me clear something up for anyone wondering: the &#34;Italy genuine leather Light brown&#34; strap is NOT quick release. I was really disappointed when I received this strap and it wasn't QR after specifically reading through the questions and seeing the seller say that it was. Otherwise, the strap is nice, but I was really only interested in a QR strap. [SEP] Extremely happy with the quality and appearance of this band. I picked the light brown Italian leather strap. It doesn't have the quick release pins but that wasn't important to me. The color looks great with my watch. I really like the fact that the band is 22mm wide but it's notched off at the ends to fit between the 18mm lugs of the Huawei. This was a must for me because, as a guy, an 18mm band is just too narrow. I've washed my hands several times while wearing it and even though it's gotten wet, it doesn't show any spots or any problems from getting wet. Very pleased, I'm considering the black Italian band next.",3,True

The material is soft and fairly lightweight. The only issue I found was that they are cut a bit smaller than my usual socks. While a snug fit, they do not constrict or bind. I've only been washing them in cold water and drying in low heat to avoid any further shrinkage. [SEP] I love this set of socks. You get a lot and great colors for every day use. I like the variety of no show, regular and short socks. The bands around the ankles are wide and soft, but they are not slipping down. These socks are soft - I been wearing them a lot - washing in washer without any shrinking or stretching. I use these for exercising and every day around the house - these are fantastic, inexpensive socks. Great value, 5 stars. [SEP] These are thin but comfortable. Can't really wear them when it's cold out unless you plan on doubling up or wear those fluffy fuzzy socks over them. I like having a variety of socks so I don't mind them- not the best, not the worst. [SEP] These socks are exactly as expected. It's just like your usual ankle, shin and no show socks. You get 1 pair of each color and style. They're thin so they won't keep your feet warm without having well insulated boots on. Other than that they seem durable. [SEP] I love these socks. I never thought I would like the low cut or no show socks but these are perfect to wear around my house on my hardwood floors.  The bottom of the sock has a nice cushion and are very soft.  The no show sock fit better than I thought they would.  Really nice socks. [SEP] Very comfortable",3,True

That's high praise from a VERY picky fashionista. Highly recommended. [SEP] I've always been afraid of hoop earrings because I have an irrational fear of getting the hoop caught on something and tearing through my ear lobe. So while I'm normally more of a stud earring kinda gal, I'm using quarantine as a reason to branch out in my accessories game, and try something new ( if only to spice up my daily work-related Zoom calls). So I jumped at the chance to try on and review these earrings*** and I'm really glad I did.<br /><br />I gave these earrings 5-stars because they check off my baseline criteria for earrings:<br />- Chic<br />- Lightweight<br />- Uncomplicated<br />- Compliments my aesthetic<br />- Affordable / good value<br /><br />Overall, I really liked them because the hoops weren't too large and there was minimal earring movement when turning my head (which I find distracting when wearing 'dangly' earrings). I felt that the faux tortoiseshell pattern to be very chic in a classic sense, and paired well with many of my tops.  This is not a overtly trendy piece, and can last through an indefinite amount of seasons.

The metal post is strong, not the least bit flimsy and think it will last for a long time. They look great on from the front as well and are same level of stylishness I'd find in other earrings at name brand stores. [SEP] Love these earrings!

The actual hat it‚Äôs self is made quite nice which is also disappointing because, I‚Äôm looking for this exact tighter fitted KNIT style hat. A lot on the market seem to be Knitted- only end up loose fitting and bulky. Or, one can find a fitted knit hat but, it totally misses the mark as it resembles the look of a burglar or else, It‚Äôs made of fleece! Exactly what I‚Äôm trying to avoid and why my interest in this particular hat - This hat has a soft texture and seems like quality material and crafting- no loose threads, straight seams and really nice attention to detail. The best of all, it fits your head without the extra 1‚Äù of nothing left at the top.. or, the 3‚Äù roll of the outer brim- just to size it right. So, for anyone in need of a sparkly hat- this is a great choice!<br />One last thing to add.. the hat to me seems very seasonal or festive! Which could be nice as we are coming right into the holiday season... it‚Äôs definitely made for a female audience with a Christmas/new year‚Äôs vibe for sure! Not sure how but, I missed women‚Äôs in the description.. So be aware, not all hats are created equal!! I tend to think of a beanie hat as unisex... nope! [SEP] This beanie type hat is soft and well made. I ordered it to go along with a fluffy white scarf in hopes that it would match okay. The hat is threaded with a sparkly gray material so it gave the pale fabric a bit of a grayer look overall. I do like the sparkle and the hat is nice and thick for warmth. This is definitely a winter staple! [SEP] There seems to be a thing with ""thinner"" and ""lighter"" fabrice claiming to be ultra warm, but honestly, nothing is as warm as a good thick woolen cap.  However, they don't tend to be as stylish.  Here's where the Under Zero hat comes in.  It's a halfway between stylish and warm.  As a result you have a moderately stylish looking beanie hat but it could stand to be a little warmer (especially if you have short hair).  You'll look good, you'll look great in fact, however you won't want to wear it to the arctic.  The fit is great, the look is great, if that's what's important however. [SEP] Comfortable and soft.

When clasped they stay secure.  If you bend the post however, they will not close correctly and you could have it come loose.  My wife does have skin sensitivity to certain metals, but these do not bother her at all.  No soreness or any skin reaction even when wearing them for a full day.

The band is nice and when it‚Äôs set the time stays true (at least for the few days I‚Äôve owned it). My only quality concern is when I was setting the time I had to constantly pull the on the mechanical knob or else it would adjust, perhaps that‚Äôs just the design. The band is easily adjustable. Over all a very nice low cost dress watch. [SEP] This watch was very attractive. It had a very smooth and sleek look. It looks very nice on the wrist.<br /><br />It is very flattering. It fits well on. It is very comfortable to wear. It goes on and off easily.<br /><br />It worked without a problem. It kept good time.<br /><br />The quality is very good. This would make a very good gift for someone.<br /><br />The price is reasonable. I would recommend it. [SEP] It's lightweight and non cumbersome to wear. It keeps time well. My husband likes to wear it when he is playing golf actually. For the price I'd say this watch is spot on! [SEP] This is overpriced at twenty-five bucks. It looks and feels like something that would be at home being sold on a blanket in Times Square or Central Park. The band is flimsy, the clasp is hard to work, and the band is almost impossible to resize. The watch itself is not even remotely accurate....I think the hands are loose, because I was constantly having to reset the time. Way more hassle than it is worth. I wouldn't even give this to my ten-year-old son as a starter watch. [SEP] Wow these picture's or any other pics do not give this watch the justice it deserves. The fit and feel is great and does not feel cheap at all. [SEP] For the price, the watch looks nice for a couple of wears or a night out. It fogs up very easily and once it does it‚Äôs impossible to de-fog. I had planned on giving it 2 stars but my husband really liked the band material. [SEP] The nicest thing about this watch is the box it comes in. The face looks cheap, the band looks cheap, and overall it just isn't a great product.<br /><br />Would not recommend. [SEP] Black quartz watch with stainless steel band.  This mens watch is very nice. It is a stainless steel metal band that has a clasp to adjust the band.  The dial is quartz movement and has silver hands. The face is white and the glass is very clear. The watch feels good on the wrist and is not too heavy. It did not pull arm hairs which is a big plus.  It looks nice with dress clothes and with casual outfits. Very nice mens watch. [SEP] UPDATE: with continued use, the latch became much easier to use. Almost like it needed to be loosened a bit. It is now one of my husband‚Äôs favorites. It is lightweight and doesn‚Äôt leave him sweaty.<br />Very thin and lightweight watch. The band and face are fine and most importantly the watch keeps accurate time.<br />It lost stars because the latch was extremely difficult to use. We had to use a screwdriver to have leverage to lift the bar and adjust it. Then, once my husband put it on and wore it for a few hours it took both of us working on it to get it unhooked.<br />It would be a four or five star watch with a better mechanism here. I have a watch with a similar lever, and I‚Äôve never had such a difficult time with it.<br /><br />As of now, there is not a price listed but the vine page said $24. That seems accurate for the quality. It‚Äôs not going to be perfect at that price, but looks nice and professional when it‚Äôs on.",3,True

[SEP] Very cute top, it is of great material, flows great, perfect length and the design is very pretty for Summer time. overall great Summer Sleeveless Spaghetti Strap tank top. [SEP] This top is very cute, speaks summer time for sure! The quality of it is ok, nothing special about it. Fits little snugged over the chest area and hits right by your hips so is not actually long or flowing like it looks on the pictures. The straps could go a little more longer to have a more loosen top, but just with what it provides is not very comfortable. I would recommend this blouse for someone medium average body type with not much chest as with the bra it feels snugged. [SEP] I gave this to friend recently and at first I got one of those looks women give you that says, really? I think because the lady likes to wear tighter clothing is why she  seemed less than happy. After she put it on and I said how nice it looked and that it looked comfortable she smiled and said, yes. I think it is very cool for summer to be worn with jeans or yoga pants to dress up a casual appearance. It is far from elegant but in California it is good for most outings to the movies, store, dinner or just out and about. I think it is a nice garment that is super casual and comfy plus very nice looking. A great everyday top for most occasions. [SEP] Straps are adjustable and it‚Äôs got a great cut to it!

[SEP] Very warm and stylish. I had thought the touch screen compatability would just be a gimmick, but it really works! I get a lot of compliments on these too [SEP] Warning, while these feel really soft inside which we very much liked, these gloves must be for women not men or tiny skinny men!  First tried medium for my 5' 9&#34; guy (130 pounds) and those were too small.  Then ordered large since the medium size was too small.  But alas, those don't fit either. The reason is when I compared the medium and the large, the only difference is that the fingers are a bit longer.  The whole problem is they don't make the gloves wider.  My 5' 9&#34; guy is a skinny guy with small hands and even the large don't even fit him.  So I've given up as I doubt the extra-large will even fit.  The material is really nice but even though others warned that the gloves are sized small, I can attest that they just are way too small!!!  How sad.",3,True

This one just looks goofy when she tried it on. We also tried it on my teenaged daughter as well as some of my younger daughters and it honestly just doesn't look good on anyone in my household!<br />Is it functional? It sure is! It fits well, folds well, and is comfortable to wear and will block the sun and protect your skin. But it won't look stylish when you do it... or at least it didn't for us. I could imagine others liking it, but honestly no one in my house wants to go outside wearing it. [SEP] I'll admit, I got this mainly to work in the garden - my other hat doesn't provide enough shade for my face/back of the neck. This one does since it has a large brim both front and back. It comes in a nice, breathable bag for packing/travel, and it does fold/collapse if you want to pack it for a trip. It's not the most elegant thing, I'll admit, but it does the job of keeping the sun off your face, it's comfortable and it fits my head well. [SEP] This is adorable and provides plenty of sun protection. It appears to be made of medium weight cotton duck outside and lined with the same fabric under the brim. Inside it's lined with a light, white gauzy fabric (probably cotton. The crown inside has a wide ribbon and a thin ribbon for adjusting the size. Materials and construction are of the highest quality. They've inserted a couple of holes on each side for air and that's where the outside ribbon and bow are attached. Completely foldable and crushable. I love this incredibly well made hat! [SEP] This is the kind of hat you wear for practicality not for looking nice, so of course, the design cleverly allows for maximum portability and easy adjustment. Is it flattering? No. But it will protect you from the sun, take up very little space, and do exactly what it supposed to do. The bow in the back can be tightened if you need it to be smaller loosened if you need it to be bigger, and it is very well constructed, so you know will last a long time and not fall apart. [SEP] My wife and I recently moved to Phoenix.  In this area, you really need a hat if you are going to be in the sun for any length of time.  We picked up this hat to see if it could fit the bill.<br /><br />FIT<br />This fits my wife well and you can adjust it if needed.  There is a draw string on the side that you can use to tighten it up.<br /><br />LOOKS<br />It's okay.  It's lightweight, so it wrinkles easily.  You can iron it if you want, but that's only going to last so long if you make use of the included storage bag.<br /><br />FUNCTION<br />It works.  It will protect your head, ears, and neck from the sun.  The only drawback here is that this hat is not well ventilated.  Your head will heat up. [SEP] This hat is very feminine and will keep the sun off your face.  Inside the hat is a very fine ribbon drawstring that you can adjust (simply tie a knot or bow) to make the hat tighter or looser.  This ribbon doesn't really tuck securely inside the hat so I find that I have to readjust if often.  The hat collapses and folds nicely and I like that they included a small dust jacket bag to store the hat in while not in use - it helps to keep it clean.  This color is called Apricot however I think a better color description would be canvas.  My hat looks more floppy as opposed to the model in the Amazon image - I like the floppier more casual appearance better.  It is airy and keeps my head cool.  I haven't had a need to wash my sunhat yet however I believe that if washed on gentle cycle and air dried that it would launder up just fine. [SEP] I used this all summer for walks and activities outdoors. I liked the packability and the light color and the wide brim. I felt protected. [SEP] I would describe this hat as just ""okay"",  The hat itself is made of a lightweight, soft material.  It actually fits good on my head itself.  The problem is that the brim in the front of the hat hangs down so low over my forehead that it blocks my vision.  If I am looking straightforward...the brim actually goes lower than my eyes.....so in order to see, I have to lift my entire face upwards.  The brim itself is a soft material.... so I can't just fold it up and get it to stay in a higher  position.  I tried putting the hat on with the bow in the front and the back and it hangs too low and blocks my eyes in both positions.  Considering I can't see with my head in a normal forward position.....the hat itself would not work for me.  I did try pushing the hat back real far on my head so I could see better....but then it looks sort of like a bonnet, which is not attractive.  The low hanging brim in the front might not be a problem for those with a longer facial structure....however the brim from all angles was just to long and floppy.  It is a cute hat with the bow....but a hat won't do me much good if I can't see while wearing it. [SEP] This item was an Amazon Vine item, received without cost for the purpose of testing and review.

shoeslocker Women's Soft Round Toe Ballet Flats Navy Blue Size 9,[],[],,4.0,9,2759,"These flats are lovely and my wife just loves them. The denim blue matches perfectly with a pair of blue skinny jeans. The bow by the toes are adorable. She loves that the soles are well cushioned for extra comfort and they fit true to size. The bottom of the shoes have great traction as well to prevent slipping (you rarely see this in flats). All in all, great quality shoes! [SEP] As of this review I don't know how much these ballet flats cost, but I think they are very cute and well made.  The inside has a nice padding making them feel almost like house shoes.  The bottom is rubbery and doesn't skid.  They look a lot like they're made out of very stiff dark blue denim and have a lovely bow-like design on them.  They really look as pictured on the product page and are very comfortable. [SEP] This is a cute ballet flat. The color is called navy, but I would call it navy denim as the outer fabric is dark blue denim. These shoes have a little inside padding which is nice. The width of these shoes is wider than average which is great for me, as I sometimes buy a wide shoe. I wear a size 9 to 9.5. In these in need a 9.5 for my toes to have enough room to be comfortable. [SEP] I had such high hopes for these shoes when I ordered them. I received a ladies size 9 which is normally ok because I go between an 8.5-9 in dress shoes. These are similar to ones I already owned that were narrow and rubbed the base of my biggest toe (have a small bunion forming).  These shoes however are wide and slide off my foot; to not have this happen I needed to put on a pair of thin dress socks which defeats the look I wanted as these are a dark denim.<br />The other problem I had (and it hopefully was just a flaw in the pair I received) was that the left shoe insole was not glued in correctly. It is off by about a fingertip which doesn‚Äôt sound like much but it now rubs on the underside of my big toe. I am going to try to reglue these myself so I can wear these shoes.<br />I think if I would have known these ran wide I would have ordered smaller and been happier. But since it didn‚Äôt say that in the description and the fact I have to repair the left insole that is why I brought these down to 3 stars. My experience will hopefully help others as these would make great dressy but casual shoes. [SEP] The Ballet flats are quite cute and very comfortable.  They will go with just about anything in my closet from dressy to jeans.  They do have some cushioning inside which helps with the comfort.<br />If you are looking for a nice pair of all around flats you should like these. I do recommend them.",3,True

Overall the dress is well sown. I am a size 14 usually, wear an XL. I am 5'7"" and about 200lbs. I bought this in a size XL and it fits, however at my hiny, I had a weird gathering of material just about my rear. It was really unflattering and weird. Other than that it looked and fitted well, but obviously I can't really run around with some weird bunched up material in that area.<br /><br />I am also not sure about tieing that bow tie right at my neck. The green is a nice forest green.<br /><br />Sadly because of the bunching in the back, I can't say I am am a fan since I really can't wear it as it is at this point. [SEP] Very attractive, ladylike dress for any day of the week.  Easy to care for and comfortable to wear.<br />Nicely made.  Fabric bleeds a little at first washing so be aware of that when laundering.<br />Flattering to most everyone. [SEP] This dress is very pretty and has a cute bow detail tie around the neck and a flared Hemline. It came to me in an extra large so it‚Äôs hard to talk about sizing because I normally wear a medium. Probably runs a little small because the extra large isn‚Äôt that huge on me I probably would‚Äôve ordered a large and I usually wear a medium. Falls right above my knee. It is not lined and the material is a little cheap feeling. The color green is very pretty though! I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù tall 145 pounds 34 B chest. [SEP] This is a really pretty dress.  I have it in the Emerald Green / Dark Green color in an XL.  I am 5'9"" 180lbs 36/38B with an athletic build.  The XL fits me exactly like I want it to.  I can put this dress on without undoing the zipper, so if you like very form fitting then by your normal size, for me that is a L.  The tie at the neck wasn't annoying and didn't come undone over an 11 hour work day.  The hem length is just below my knees and the sleeves are just above mid arm.  Material is comfortable against the skin.  Received several complements for both men and women when wearing. [SEP] I loved everything about this dress...super flattering cut and the color is amazing. It did run a bit small tho. [SEP] The color is gorgeous and the fit is flawless. The quality of the fabric and the construction is great.

I ordered the small, and it fits pretty well. The thin cups that come with the bralette make it a little too roomy for me, so I take them out to wear it.<br /><br />It's very cute. I ordered it to wear specifically with a crop top I ordered off of Amazon, and it's a cute match. I also like to wear it with button downs, provided I'm dressed casually.<br /><br />I've had no issues with it so far. The stitching is holding up and there are no frays that I can see. I know some people have had issues with sizing, but I haven't. Bralettes don't offer a lot of support and if you have a larger cup size, you can't expect it to hold very well, even if you order up a size. I'd recommend this bra to a C cup or lower, but you'll probably need something more supportive if you have a larger cup size. [SEP] It kind of smooshed your boobs... wasn't really designed to support or shape, but I will often pull the support cups out and wear a better bra underneath. This is definitely made like a swimming suit and not an actual bra, but it looks pretty dope under scoop neck tees and tank tops. [SEP] Not sure what I was expecting. The straps near the armpits are wonky. It's basically a bandeau thing with decorative front. Back is a loop hook.<br />I'm 5', 108 lb and am a 34B. [SEP] excellent [SEP] Looks great but doesn't fit well. I wear a 34 C and it's way too small! [SEP] I wore it once and the straps came stitched while in the washer.

The little metal ring in the top center, and the metal loop in the back are clearly cheap, old, and make this top look like it's been sitting in a warehouse for years. Construction is poor; if you could see this item in person and a foggy photograph wasn't hiding the poor stitching jobs wherever straps intersect, you wouldn't pay more than $3 for it. [SEP] No adjustable strap. [SEP] Like many products on amazon, this is fair for it's price.

GLADDON MODA Shoulder Bags for women Black,['Zipper closure'],[],,3.5,13,6984,"Okay, I‚Äôm not gonna lie, there‚Äôs sort of a ‚Äúfakeness‚Äù about it that I can‚Äôt put my finger on. Maybe it‚Äôs the mixture of too many materials: gold chain, suede, and patent leather. Yet I still find myself drawn to it and I like it for a change every now and then. There‚Äôs plenty of space, one big open compartment and several pockets. Plus the top zips to keep your goodies in place. Final verdict: not bad at all. [SEP] Suade on the outside, then an putter large pocket made of PU Leather closes with a gold snap. The purse I got was black. The look together I'm not quite sure if I like it together like that. Large on the inside. Zipper to close it. So I'm giving it 4 stars because overall it seems sturdy [SEP] I did not like many things about this shoulder bag for women. First of, the bag is not spacious and does not expand much, so the space is limited and very tight. Then there is the quality of the material; there were two different types of material and one of them seemed poor quality, clearly fake leather. The zip is very rough. [SEP] I like this a bit and I don't more.  The fake (they call it ""PU Leather"") suede leather of the main black bag is nice looking. Then, attached is a shiny ""PU"" patent leather small purse bag.  Not removable, as I thought it may be when I first looked at it. But attached. So it contrasts very much and the smaller shiny section really doesn't help the look to me.  Though it is a smart idea, and is handy.  The main purse section is one large opening when you zip it open.  That's good. There is also a zippered separate compartment inside halfway down on the purse for stashing, although it does slightly show through the bag if you put in anything bumpy, like keys.  The strap is also a mix of fake leather and sort of cheap feeling chain. I like the look of that, but the chain itself feels like it has a plastic coating or something. The shoulder bag also has a bottom that is soft and not necessarily stable on a table.  It also comes with a bonus large ""grocery"" size bag, a nice extra. That is thick plastic with the logo on it.  I don't like the fact that they now call fake leather ""PU"" with no explanation.  I also think the bag design is not very well thought out for functionality. It can't figure out what it wants to be. [SEP] At first I wasn‚Äôt to impressed when I got this. But as time as gone on I‚Äôve let get it‚Äôs own shape and the new out of it, it‚Äôs actually quite pretty. It holds a good amount. It has a nice little front pocket.  It‚Äôs a decent quality purse. I‚Äôve had it a while now and i haven‚Äôt had any quality issues. I am glad I held off on my review. I always try to hold off giving reviews for a little bit to really give something a good try first. And this is why. This has grown on me for sure. [SEP] This is definitely my new go to purse! It's made of leather and suede. It looks compact but it can hold a lot. Inside, I have my bulky wallet, crossword puzzle book, small notebook, two tablets, a comb, a compact mirror, lent roller, breast pads and pad pouch but there's still room to fit things on top. There's an inner zipper pocket which has my headphones, extra scrunchies, hair pins and a miniature sowing kit. The two inner pouches are filled with sanitizer, lotion, lip gloss, cotton swab travel pack and a mini notepad. It also comes with a front pouch which holds my vitamin pack, gum, more scrunchies, pens and hair pins. I say all this to show just how much the bag can fit. I'll see how well the straps can hold all of this over time. I do find the zipper to be a bit difficult to close (even before I packed the purse with my items) because the zipper descends like a roller coaster, but I greased it up zipped and unzipped it a few times and it seems to get easier each time. The strap of the bag is adjustable so you can shorten it to make it a hand bag or lengthen it to make it a shoulder bag. With everything that I packed the bag with the strap dug into my shoulder due to how heavy it was. I recommend packing less items if you're going to use it as a shoulder bag. Overall, it's a simple yet stylish bag. I find the bag to be versatile. You can wear it to work, a meeting, cocktail party and church. It's an everyday and everywhere type of bag. This is definitely good for the ladies who like to be prepared.<br />You even get a free clear drawstring backpack. [SEP] This was alright for me. The body is suede and the gold chain is of better quality then the rest. The outer pocket is very convenient to have because I always lose my phone in the bag.  A little shiny in my opinion though.<br />However I do not think ts very practical especially for moms who need the extra space! I believe this is more suited towards younger girls who are starting to carry larger bags.<br />It came with a little plastic string bag which is always good to have! [SEP] I have the black bag with a shiny outer pocket, with a band at the top.<br /><br />I like the main outer material it is a matted sturdy suede look.  I like the idea of outer pocket and the big inside. I like the inside zippered pocket into the lining and the two side pockets in the lining.<br /><br />Here‚Äôs what doesn‚Äôt work for me:<br />‚Ä¢ The outer pocket is a shiny cheap looking vinyl<br />‚Ä¢ The snap for the outer pocket is a weak magnet and it doesn‚Äôt line up properly, so it‚Äôs not easy to close<br />‚Ä¢ The main compartment zipper is sewn too far down, so there a 90 degree turn, it's difficult to zip<br />‚Ä¢ The zipper placement limits the size of what you can put in the purse.<br />‚Ä¢ The outer bottom seams on the front pocket are sewn in a messy way.<br /><br />It came with a nice heavy-duty sturdy plastic bag with drawstrings for storage.  However, the pocketbook must be folded over to fit inside and even then, the drawstrings can‚Äôt be pulled together. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt meant to be a storage for the bag?  It‚Äôs transparent with the exception of the bag‚Äôs logo 7x4 logo onit.  There was no small removable pouch that came with it. [SEP] Look ok, will not fake to be a high end, but looks nice and is good size",3,True

I'm constantly losing them, scratching them, sitting on them, etc.  I'm incredibly accident prone and that, unfortunately, means I'm never going to be someone who can keep a $150+ pair of sunglasses in my purse.  These are perfect for me.  They look great (the red/orange lenses are pretty cool) and the quality is great for the low price you pay.  They are constructed well and if slightly bent, which happens to us all at some point, they are easy to get back into shape without weakening the overall frame.  The hinges are tight, which means they don't get loose on you after awhile.  The size of the lenses is really nice for keeping the sun out of your eyes all the way around.  They are going to be a bit loose if you have a smaller than average head.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend you give these a try. [SEP] Decent quality, moderately effective against the sun.  I‚Äôm not a big fan of sunglasses of this color but they do fit great, and they seem to be made of good quality materials.

The color may not be for everyone, but the sure do get the job done, they are glare free, UV protection, and stylish. [SEP] I love the mirror effect it has but it's too wide (for me personally). It seems durable and it comes with nice case. If you don't have an issue with it being extra wide, you will most certainly enjoy these guys. [SEP] The quality of these glasses are excellent. No flimsiness where the screws are like some glasses. The one thing I recommend before purchasing these glasses is to make sure that these are your style. My husband was not a fan of all the stars going down the side of the frames. Overall, these are very well made glasses that would be perfect for the flashy type of person. [SEP] The lack of any curve to the lenses causes the reflective metal frame to allow more light then I care for behind and into my eyes when wearing these.  It also took a bit for me to get the frame to fit straight on my head so the interior lens surface didn't reflect back like a mirror.  They felt alright while wearing them and I could probably get used to the frame reflection over time.  The surface is actually multi colored from different angles which is very cool. [SEP] These have nice styling and look great.  The protective bag is a nice touch and is a squeeze type spring loaded opening like that of change purses.  Very happy with the quality of these and the clarity of the lenses is excellent. [SEP] I received these sunglasses and was slightly dismayed at their size. If you have an abnormally large head, these would work perfectly. However, on some occasions when I really want to wear snazzy sunglasses, I wouldn't mind being seen in public with these on.<br /><br />The color looks exactly like it does in the picture and was packaged very nicely. No scratches or scuffing. Seems high quality! [SEP] I got the red chrome lenses with the gold frames and I think it works really well for this style. The glasses are large and look good on either a man or woman, but they are definitely oversized on most woman's faces. The style is a bit outrageous and I think it works. A bold choice of colors with a unique design. The arms have these + symbols all over them and add to the flamboyant design.<br /><br />Quality is ok. Not the best but definitely not the worst I've seen. These are low cost sunglasses and the lenses are polarized which is unusual at this price point. The arms are a bit fragile but with proper care they should last a while. The glasses come with a soft vinyl case that has a hard spring opener at the top, and protect the lenses fairly well.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with these sunglasses. I've been looking for something a little different and these definitely fit that description. I feel like a trendsetter when wearing these, although I'm sure not everyone is a fan of the shiny red/orange lenses and the gold frames. Not everyone can be a free thinker though.",3,True

DJDLPARTY Sweety Princess Dress Pink,[],[],,3.2,25,7356,"The dress that came was not what we expected to get, but it is rather cute. It fits the age bracket of 4-6 year old. It's soft where it touches the skin. The colors are bright and it's comfortable and easy to run in, does not confine movements. It bunches some in the back but it's hardly noticeable especially when my girl is on the move. All in all, nice dress for a party or just any day. [SEP] This is a cute costume dress for sizes 4 to 6 years. It has an underskirt hoop skirt beneath the shiny one so that it hangs out away from the child's legs. The hoop is made of plastic and is 21 inches across at the widest point. The hoop underskirt is made out of a pink gauze fabric. The outer dress has one side with a purple satin under layer with an iridescent over layer. The other side is a pink satin with silver glitter designs on the front. The back is fairly plain. There is a Velcro closure at the neck. There is some elastic around the waistline and the back of the torso area is made of a stretchy fabric, so the dress will expand some to fit. The dress is made from 100% polyester. It does fit my 3.5 year old niece, but it's clearly meant for a child that's a little bigger than her. She loves the look of the dress, but she prefers dresses that don't have a hop because it's a little difficult to sit in chairs or even on the ground and play with toys when you're in a hop skirt.<br /><br />Care instructions: hand wash cold with like colors. Turn inside out. Do not bleach. Do not wring or twist. Lie flat to dry. Do not iron. [SEP] Like others, I received a different dress than I ordered. I got the pink and rainbow tutu skirt version. It‚Äôs not my daughters favorite , but it‚Äôs cute and well made and well priced. The materials seem comfortable for a play dress, the straps don‚Äôt seem to irritate her and I don‚Äôt notice any red marks when she changes. Ours has seen only light use but appears to hold up well. Seams and stitching are good. For a princess costume or wardrobe this is a good pick, assuming you know the taste preferences of the wearer. I would buy again from this maker. My nearly 3, average sized daughter could wear this. The straps were a tad long but still ok without alteration. [SEP] This dress is really pretty and a great value for its current price!  I love that it has a variety of fabrics including glitter embellishments on the bodice and skirt, velour on the bodice, and silkier translucent and pink on the skirt.  There are also cute little pink bows on the arms and an oval jewel sewn on the front.  The best part about the dress is the plastic hoop at the bottom of the skirt.  It makes for a great full looking skirt and it's also foldable so you can still fold up the dress!  I tried this first on my average sized 17 month old and it was a little big, but it didn't look horrible on her.  I also had my 5 year old son try it on for size and to me it looked a little small.  I would probably recommend this dress for 2-3 year olds as opposed to 4-6.  The only concern I have is comfort for the child.  This is not a super well-made dress (hence its price) and my son said the stitching was uncomfortable on the inside.  He also said the silver ribbon embellishment on the top was scratchy.  Overall I would recommend this dress as it is such a great value.  It would be perfect for Halloween or dress up play. [SEP] This review is hard to do. The dress sent to us was completely different. The dress pictured here, looks like a true princess dress. The dress we received, looks like a fairy costume. It has a laced up bodice and a rainbow tulle skirt. The dress we received is soft, colorful, and comfortable. I am almost more pleased with the dress we received than what was pictured. It fits a 4 year old perfectly, and will probably fit next year as well. [SEP] Such an adorable dress! The one I received was different than the style I thought I was getting, but it was so cute! It fit my daughter pretty good and shes a 3t. The front is a little low, but she will grow into it. The materials are nice quality and don't feel cheap. There is a mixture of materials like tulle, a velvety blend, and some stretchy metallic fabric. My toddler couldn't wait to put it on. I want more of these for her now!! [SEP] The dress I received was not the dress pictured, but it is still a great fantasy dress for a little girl.  The bodice and peplum are a sparkly pink on pink pattern with faux lacing.  The elastic sleeves have little tulle wings.  The underskirt is a solid pink taffeta with an overskirt in rainbow colored tulle that will swirl when the little princess twirls.  The waist, like the straps, is elastic which should allow for some growth.  The dress is hand washable and laid flat to dry.  It would make a great princess or fairy Halloween costume or just for fantasy play. [SEP] My six year old has fun with this dress.  She says its very pretty and colorful.<br /><br />She uses it for dress up and imaginative play.<br /><br />It has a lacey bottom section full ove rainbow colors.  The top of the dress is a soft fabric.<br /><br />I would not recommend this for everyday wear.  It is more of a costume, than real clothing. [SEP] The granddaughter loves it, and never wants to take it off. Runs around the house pretending to be a princess.<br /><br />It's very cute, and a great addition to play time/story time/dressup time. Lots of fun! [SEP] This is an absolutely adorable princess dress. It has a laced bodice, filmy shoulder caps and filmy strips of cloth in various colors that swirl over the underskirt. This will be a hit with any princess-wanna-be. There are two caveats: 1) this dress sheds glitter, which some people abhor, the underside of the straps are wrapped with the glittered cloth making them rough and scratchy, so if you have a kiddo with sensory issues, they‚Äôre going to need to wear a t-shirt or other clothing under this dress. Other than that, this is a surprisingly well-detailed and cute outfit that fit as expected. Very pleased with outfit.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

It keeps leg swelling down and also helps keep your legs more comfortable. I will need to wait to wear them though. It is too freaking hot in Florida right now and you don't want to warm socks. You want to wear as little as possible right now. But, when it gets cooler, I will be sporting these guys. By the way, they need to be hand washed and air dried. You will like that these are anti microbial, anti-odor and breathable [SEP] Compression AKA support socks are available in the following levels of support:<br /><br />Mild (8-15 mmHg)<br />Medium (15-20 mmHg)<br />Firm (20-30 mmHg)<br />X-Firm (30-40 mmHg)<br /><br />The  particular socks I received from Vine are Firm (20-30 mmHg).<br /><br />I received the set called, ‚ÄúMulticoloured3.‚Äù I have attached a picture of one of the most quirky of these patterns. The designs are all quite cute.<br /><br />This is the fifth brand of compression socks I‚Äôve recently had the opportunity to test through Vine. This is one of my favorite brands of compression socks, so far, as to both appearance and functionality.<br /><br />The product description does not say what kind of fabric is used in these socks, but if they are like most compression socks, it is some combination of nylon or polyester plus spandex. The fabric in these socks has a smooth, soft texture which is very comfortable against my skin.<br /><br />The Firm level of compression of these socks works very well for providing excellent support to my feet and calves. I had previously, for many years, used calf braces and high quality, well padded athletic socks to prevent shin splints, charley horse, and foot pain from standing and walking 10 to 12 hours per day. I was getting decent results with the expensive athletic socks and the calf braces, but I was thrilled to discover that compression socks are one-stop shopping to achieve all of that just as well, and in some ways even better. Compression socks impart a subtle, pleasant, tingling sensation as if I'm receiving a gentle massage of my feet and legs.<br /><br />I always hand wash my compression socks, and I was impressed to note that the manufacturer of these particular socks is the first one that I‚Äôve encountered to wisely recommend that level of care to its customers. Hand-washing insures that compression socks will last for years. I fill my bathroom sink with warm water, squeeze in a few dollops of mild soap, swish the socks around in it, rinse them well, gently squeeze out excess water, and hang them up to dry. Given that these socks are multicolored, I place an old towel beneath them to catch the several, inevitable drips of dye so that they won't stain my tub. It takes these socks about 24 hours to fully dry.<br /><br />For people with painful, arthritic hands, Firm (20-30 mmHg) or X-Firm (30-40 mmHg) compression socks might not be the best choice, since it may hurt your hands trying to put them on. The higher the compression number, the more difficult on the hands it is pulling on the socks. Instead, I would highly recommend:<br /><br />GOGO by Therafirm Mild Support Travel Socks, 15-20 mmHg, mild-compression socks.<br /><br />The fabric in the GOGO socks, which is polyester plus spandex, is very soft and, unlike this brand of compression socks, it is stretchy enough to make it much easier to put on the GOGO socks than any other brand of compression socks I have tried. But even so, the GOGO socks are not so stretchy that it compromises the support they offer. [SEP] These made-in-China compression socks are very colorful (a bit too crazy for this household).  The socks provide moderate compression but two minor issues - the length is almost above the knee for a 5'11"", shoe size 11  person (the L/XL) version  and the heel compression is barely noticeable.  But the socks are easy to put on and take off, does relieve swelling and overall very comfortable.  Most designs seem more suitable for a slightly yonger crowd, but the quality of these socks are good. [SEP] These socks are not your grandmas compression socks. The design on each pair is fun, which is great for when your wearing them with shorts. The socks are very comfortable and provide a good amount of compression to help with leg fatigue and assist with varicose veins too. I work about twelve hours a day on my feet so these help keep the swelling in my legs down, the first time I wore them I immediately noticed a difference on how my legs felt/looked at the end of the day, I had considerably less tiredness and my legs were not as restless once I sat down/slept for the evening. I enjoy these socks they are easy on/off following the usually compression sock method. The price for four pairs is a great value I have paid more than this for a single compression sleeve!! So if you like fun socks, and less pain in your legs I would recommend these. [SEP] These compression socks fit fantastic. They are not difficult to get on, which is something I usually struggle with, they have a little more 'give' in the stretch department.<br />The prints are woven in and look as good as the picture.<br />They are comfortable and I like the variegated compression, my legs and foot don't feel like they were held too tight by the end of the day, they feel really good.<br />Comfortable and compressed without feeling squashed. I will be seeking out more from this brand/company! [SEP] My SO tried these: XL/L. He wears a size 12 shoe and has health conditions that dictate the need for compression socks. He found these easier to get on than his regular brand, so was happy about that. He liked the patterns too. For him, they were tighter around the calf but looser around the ankle. So that didn't work for his needs. The biggest problem he had was all the loose threads inside the socks from the different coloured threads. He found these to be annoying. Says he won't switch brands. [SEP] I like to wear these to bed when I feel a little swollen, it feels comfortable to have my legs in the tight fabric. The only issue I have with these is that I have long legs, 33/34 inseam, and the tops of these hit right at the bend of my knee so I have to push them down or they'll roll uncomfortably. On shorter legs, they would be comfortably above the knee. [SEP] I am on my feet for many hours during the day. These socks are soft, thick, and comfortable to wear. These keep my feet warm and dry. My feet tend to sweat a lot, but these do an excellent job of wicking away the sweat and moisture from my feet. The compression, from these socks, helps to prevent fatigue in my feet and legs.

I have washed them a few times and they still are nice and tight.<br />I guess the only thing I would say is that they are thinner than my usual choice of socks. They are thicker than dress socks, but thinner that athletic or wool socks, so I don't know how they are when the weather gets cold if you get cold feet ( like me!) .<br />Besides that, I really love them, and the colors and patterns are cool :)",3,True

GLADDON MODA Women's Crossbody Bag Red,[],[],,3.5,10,1976,"Love the color. I like that it can be a wristlet or a cross body bag. The tassels are kinda goofy for my taste, but some might like it. Other than the pretty color, none of this is enough to make me want to use it, not even for temporary use due to the reasons I will mention next.  (I have another bag from this company and it is worlds apart in looks, quality, and functionality-- so maybe this is just a dud, for me.)<br /><br />Now as for the aspect of it that makes me refrain from using it further is of real concern. See, the main  area which is the spot for cash, credit cards, ID, etc is really not secure. That area is open on three sides! There is a snap closure- that's it. Gravity may help keep things in place, but that doesn't make me comfortable using it. The other storage area is one that could be used for anything, but I assume most people would want to use for their phone so I will refer to it as such. I do not benefit from using the this pocket since my Google Pixel 3XL doesn't come anywhere close to fitting it. Even if it did, the snap closure doesn't feel too secure. You have to really press on it for it to snap. I wouldn't want to put that much pressure against my phone screen. The third and final storage spot is useful but almost too small. Maybe ok for a few bills or coins. Not much beyond that.<br /><br />So because I pretty much can't actually use it, I deem this is a pass for me [SEP] This is a cute little cross body bag, although personally I am not big into tassles, but that is just me. It has an inside area for credit cards and money that is very convenient and when you get it in that area is where the straps are also packed into. When you remove them though, this is when you notice the little design flaw, the bag now doesn't really close all the way and you have this gap. I guess it would maybe fit one of the smaller cell phones?<br /><br />Underneath the tassel is another compartment where you can add various things like some lipstick or whatever you like to carry around. Overall this is a fairly small bag so measure before you order. On the back of it is another zipper pocket which is where I would personally keep the credit cards and ID and maybe on the inside have reward cards and the like that are not as critical.<br /><br />It has a nice long strap that allows you to have it across your body. The material is a nice bright red matched with a tan, probably some pleather like material, nothing fancy but this should also not cost you $100+.<br /><br />So besides that design flaw with that gap, it is actually not a bad bag for around the town for a few small items you need. Just not sure why that gap is so severe, maybe if you put it between some heavy weights for a few days it will go away? [SEP] This is a wallet with a shoulder strap. I personally don't use a purse very often, especially if I am just going to run errands. This really is just a wallet with a shoulder strap. It's great for when you seriously need your hands free..say from hauling groceries up flights of stairs. This would be the perfect gift for college students. It fits the bus pass, ID's and all the essentials for a night out, without the bulkiness and inconvenience of a bag.front pocket will fit an iPhone just fine. There is even a coin holder section. Definitely made of faux leather. [SEP] I really like this little bag. Sometimes you don't want to carry your whole purse with you and you just want to take the minimum with you. This is perfect for that. You can fit your phone (possibly but if not perhaps you have other things you can fit in the phone spot to take with you? Though that may defeat the purpose just a bit). This is the perfect bag for the cross body design. It's nice and light and you can keep it close to you at all times.<br />The drawback to this is that there is quite the gap where your cards would go. Even though the card holder slots are very tight, the bag has that gap so that is something to consider. Otherwise it's very nice and super cute. [SEP] I ordered this because there are times that I don't have pockets, but I still want quick access to my phone. The pouch holds my iphone X easily.  I will still keep this in my car/bigger bag for this purpose, but I don't think I'd use it as a primary wallet because the gap where it closes there is so large. I'm afraid I might lose cash or cards.<br /><br />The red color is nice and the tassels are cute. [SEP] I was really looking forward to a phone case that I could also use as a wallet and better yet a cross body wallet. But this one is not the one. The card slots doesn't close all the way and there is a big gap which I really wish it didn't have. There is no way I am storing my credit cards or money in that. It can also be hard to store your phone in the slot if you have already have a chunkier phone case. Overall I wouldn't recommend this cross body.",3,True

I and they, did not think they had to be so ripped! [SEP] The product page says these jeans are comprised on 1% elastane, but I can't detect any stretch at all.  The material is durable jean material but non-stretchy.  I love the color and the distress is well done.  I normally wear 32 x 32 but I could barely squeeze into these.  My other 32 x 32  jeans are much looser.  These are much more like skinny than slim and if you normally wear a 32 think about upsizing unless your are really skinny.  I washed them in the normal cycle and they seemed to come out of the dryer o.k. but I wouldn't be able to tell if they shrank or not since I can't hardly get them on anyway. [SEP] With a nice style and shredded details for casual hanging out and having fun with friends. These fit my son well and he is really happy with them! The lighter shade of the denim makes it easy to pair with any color shirt and will be perfect for the spring wardrobe! [SEP] I don't understand why there is no length on the product page for these jeans.  Vertical is important too!  The pair I got . 32 waist, was marked on the garment as 34 length.  The jeans are quite sturdy and seem well-made.  The fabric is heavy.  I like the light color.  Unlike some ""distressed"" jeans, these have patches, ones that look like the iron-on patches you can buy in fabric stores, under each distress hole in the jeans.  I imagine these will make the jeans last longer, and do keep skin from showing through, if that is the look you want, but they also feel a bit rough and heavy compared to the jeans where the patches aren't.  Still, a nice pair of jeans. [SEP] These are great jeans. I love the look and style of them.  I also love the color.  They fit well and are made well.  slim fit is nice and stylish and these are just the right amount of slimness.  They are comfortable and very casual. [SEP] I usually wear a 32-36"" waist just depending and a 32-36"" inseam as well. I couldn't even get these jeans on. They are too tight in the thighs and waist. The length is more like capris for me. However the silver lining is I gave them to my wife and she wears them as 'boyfriend' jeans.<br /><br />Other than the sizing they look great. Nice evenly faded light looks. Multiple tears done in a way where they won't keep ripping and get worse. The cut is a guys cut but can look good on women if you wear them as 'boyfriend' jeans. Zip fly. The quality is reasonable, nice fabric that should last a bit. [SEP] Weirdly, I've gotten a lot of compliments on these. They're the polar opposite of my style but I wanted something kind of unexpected and different to mix things up. I wound up really liking these except... they're really short! I wear a 32"" inseam regularly and these are about 2 inches above my ankles. To keep them from looking ridiculous I've been cuffing them.<br /><br />They're definitely a fashion pant in spite of the suggestion of ""outdoors and adventure"" so I would advise against any activity involving dirt because they'll stain quickly. [SEP] I'm a fit, athletic built middle aged guy so these are not the jean style I grew up with. However, they are crazy comfortable and I can still wear it so I do...but mostly around the house and working in the yard. Bend and move with ease, wash well and doesn't matter if they get beat up because it adds to the style. Great fit - sized right.",3,True

[SEP] I am looking forward to wearing these socks this Fall and Winter.  I think they are very well knitted out of durable material.  I already washed them in the regular cycle and they came out of dryer just fine with no noticeable shrinking or fading.  I really like the colors and how they are arranged  -  these make for great hiking socks or just good to wear when the weather is cool.  I'm hesitant to give them a full 5 stars right now because though I tried them on and wore them for a while, I didn't wear them all day and I don't know if the tops are going to become tight feeling or not.  I'm real sensitive about sock tops and have actually cut them off before when they felt like they were getting tight feeling.  I like them loose so they don't impede blood flow and make my feet cold.  I'm skinny and very athletic but just can't tolerate tight tops. [SEP] Forcool makes great socks for active people. Somehow they are able to put special wicking in their socks that pulls moisture away from your feet so they stay dry. These active wear hiking socks even offer cushioned arched support. They would be great for hiking as the title description states. Forcool has created these colorful crew socks to wear all year round. I think they are cute and regardless the title stating these socks are for men, they are for women too. They are very soft to the touch and feel great on the feet. Also they are easily washed and dried and ready to go again. These are made extremely nice. Forcool socks are always worth the price you pay. One of my favorite brands. [SEP] I cant get enough socks, my feet are still cold in the morning after sleeping all night.<br />These are soft and thick but doubt they can go in the dryer. These are the best [SEP] The title of the ad for these socks says ‚Äúmen‚Äôs hiking socks,‚Äù but it should just say ‚Äúhiking socks‚Äù because these are great for ladies. The sizing description says a medium works for ladies shoe sizes 3-6, but my shoe size is an 8 and the medium fits me perfectly. The socks have elastic around the top to keep them in place, but it‚Äôs not too tight - it is very comfortable. The material is thinner in key places to keep sweat away from your feet during hiking. Cute style and nice fit. The only negative is that the instructions say to air dry, but they are cold-water machine washable (maybe they would shrink if dried in a dryer?) Overall, I really like the look and feel of the socks and look forward to hiking in them! [SEP] These are nice fitted left foot right foot hiking socks in fun colors (I ordered several colors).  They stay up & are very comfortable.  They are perfect for early spring & fall.  They are not thick enough for winter.  For winter, I use Maggie's Functional Organic Wool Killington Hiking Socks (available on amazon) & my husband wears LLBean wool hiking socks (available at LLBean).<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with these socks. [SEP] My wife tried these on and raved about them. First of all, they are very thick and heavy enough to keep your feet warm when it gets cold.<br /><br />These socks have a left and right foot and contour to the feet very well. There is a band in the middle of the foot that holds the sock in place so it will not slide. In fact, the whole sock conforms to the foot extremely well.  This is crucial when walking any distance at all.<br /><br />While these are fantastic socks for walking, they also would be great for sporting events or anything like that. They are uber high quality and will be used for all these occasions. [SEP] I didn't realize the value of hiking socks until I had to walk around San Francisco at length over a period of a week. It quickly became obvious that regular, plain socks just wouldn't cut it. I was pretty excited to see these come up on Vine since I can always use more and the socks are really pretty cute.<br /><br />I wear about a women's size 10. My pair of socks was a medium and fit fairly well. They weren't loose at all, which I liked since I am not really hugely fond of loose socks when it comes to doing a lot of walking.

Stocking Fox Women's Plus Size Opaque Stretch Black Tights X-Large 2-Pack,[],[],,4.5,29,6845,"These are really nice tights. They are perfect in size and are high waisted with good stretch in them. They seem to be very well made and look great on. They would pair well with any type of attire and I think most shoes would look good and fit well. These are not super thick but thick enough that they will keep your legs a little warmer when there is a slight chill in the air. I really like them a lot! [SEP] These are nice, durable tights. I can‚Äôt believe how stretchy they are. They fit well, are comfortable, and don‚Äôt overheat me too badly like some tights do. I also like that they come in a two pack! [SEP] These tights were thicker than I was expecting and very comfortable. I ordered my size according to the size chart. It fit as expected through the legs and crotch, but the waist was either generous sizing or very stretchy, because I tried to see if I could pull them up over my arms like the stock photo and I could. The waistband didn‚Äôt roll, which is amazing. They are mostly opaque, but I have some moles on my thigh that I could see through the tights when I was sitting. Better than the opaque tights that I‚Äôve bought at box stores, not as high quality as the tights I‚Äôve purchased at specialty plus sized stores. Very happy with the product.<br /><br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù, ~215 lbs, and usually wear size 16/18 pants depending on brand. The XL was a perfect size for me. [SEP] Nice fit and good knit.  On me they‚Äôre not too opaque at all.  Very comfortable.  Recommended. [SEP] This is an Amazon house brand and another good quality item. I fit into the medium to extra-large in the regular stocking Fox and I fit into this XXL whatever pair of tights as well. I'm 5 foot 8 180 lbs. These have washed well in the washing machine and then air-dried.  I haven't experienced any pulling of threads when wearing them [SEP] I love these tights!! I would normally wear an XXL according to their chart, but I could wear the XL size comfortably. These opaque tights cover well and look great--no bagging at the ankles. Love these. Order your size, but if you are on the line and don't expect to gain weight, order the next size down. [SEP] These fit well, are easy enough to get on and seem to run true to size for me. I like that they come up high enough and give me a bit of support. We will see how they hold up over time! [SEP] For reference, I'm 5'6"" and weigh 160 lbs. Not technically a plus size woman but I was looking for something with a looser feel.<br />I received these stockings in a size XL and they're amazing! They fit great throughout the leg and the greatest thing is the waistband doesn't feel like it's squeezing the life out of my belly!<br />These are perfect if you have love handles like I do. They are a very high rise and compress your tummy a bit so that your love handles don't look like big rolls on your sides.<br />The material is high quality, thicker than expected and very smooth. These feel great on my legs.<br />They come in a pack of two which is a terrific value. They are my absolute favorite, go to stockings! [SEP] Great stockings! For better than expected and best of all, they don‚Äôt run! They‚Äôre more opaque than sheer which I really liked! [SEP] These have to be the best tights I have every worn!! They are soft yet strong. I didn't feel ""squeezed"" into the tights. I love that they come up over my waist and stayed in place.  I wore them to church and I sing in the choir.

"Genuine Assembly Men's Denim Jeans, Skinny Fit, Work wear, Every Day Staple Collection for Work 34 Mid Blue",[],[],,3.8,12,6910,"I usually wear between a 30-32 depending on the brand and style of jeans. I have some American Eagle 33‚Äù skinny jeans, for example. So I went up to a 34‚Äù on these Genuine Assembly jeans because of the skinny fit and not knowing how the brand would fit me overall.<br /><br />My experiment was a bit too zealous. I don‚Äôt know if Genuine Assembly offers a 33‚Äù, but fortunately a belt is enough to keep the jeans up. I‚Äôd say these aren‚Äôt that skinny of a fit. At the same time, the jeans aren‚Äôt stretchy. At all.<br /><br />The tag says made in Bangladesh, from 98% cotton and 2% spandex.<br /><br />I don‚Äôt love the denim. It‚Äôs not that soft and has a smell even after washing. It‚Äôs not a bad smell, but it‚Äôs something I noticed when folding them. They‚Äôre just okay. [SEP] Overall, these are nice jeans. They are a slim fit, but do to the bit of give in the fabric, they don't feel constraining or difficult to put on. The build quality is good, and the material is soft and comfortable even with just a few washes.  The size (34 waist, 34 length) is true.<br /><br />The cons are that the rise is a bit short so they ride rather low (at least for my preference). The zipper, while of good quality, is very short as well which can be a bit cumbersome.  The cons drop my rating to 4 stars, but these remain a decent pair of skinny jeans that are not constraining while maintaining a slim profile and fit. [SEP] Good quality and fit well, skinny fit but with enough stretch to make them comfortable. [SEP] The appearance has some the currently trendy ""distressed"" look; i.e. the appear used though they are brand new.<br /><br />Oddly they fit fine when I'm  standing, but when sitting they tend to slide a little down. The label states to wash with similar colors (i.e. concern about color leaking). My experience was the water turned a little blue, but not as much as another pair I got from Amazon with a similar warning. I intentionally washed them with a couple light colored items for this review; there was no discoloration.<br /><br />My star rating would be impacted by the price, at the time of writing no price is listed.<br />These are ok; I will wear them. They are definitely not Levi's, though! [SEP] These fit my husband great. The sizing is perfect. His only complaint is the waist rests a bit lower than he prefers. The legs are tapered to actually be skinny without being tight. Workmanship looks good and I expect they will last a good while. Overall I am very pleased with these jeans and their current style. Definitely not dad jeans! [SEP] Good length but a bit too skinny. I don't mind tapered jeans but don't like having to struggle to get my foot into a leg...that is the case with these. Once over the feet, these are okay since there is some stretch but not my favorite pair. In fact, these are annoying skinny. Good denim and true to size at waist and length. [SEP] In all fairness, my husband doesn't generally like skinny fit jeans.  We thought with the word ""stretch"" in the description they would fit better.  No.  He wears between a 32-34 waist and is very slender in the legs.  These almost looked like tights on him.  Way to snug.  The waist was fine.  The color and workmanship was good.  The price is reasonable.  They are just uncomfortable for him and they look it.  Maybe for a much younger man they would be perfect. [SEP] These are advertised as Men's ""Skinny"" jeans, but they are not really that skinny in the fit. So, I would say they are somewhere between a boot cut and a traditional skinny jean. The workmanship is good. The denim is slightly distressed (on purpose) for styling. They are good jeans if you are happy with the fit. Despite the 2% spandex/elastane, they really don't have any noticeable stretch, which means they will bag after wearing for awhile. Depending on the price (which is not present at this time), these could be a decent buy for everyday and/or work jeans.",3,True

Of course, they won't last forever, given the type of fabric, but they are up there with the nicer quality ones that I have tried, pretty much in line with all of the others I am testing right now. These are very good for the price and I give them five stars for accurate sizing, accurate listing photos and overall appearance and quality. Good luck finding what will work for your needs. [SEP] I love the material these tights are made of. It is very nice and thick in a way that says quality and well-made. These tights are probably the standard ballet thickness, but they are very sturdy and feel wonderful. I love the way the ankles are done, very smooth and not bulky. The material stretches but also holds its shape very well. My new favorite pairs of tights. Highly recommended. [SEP] These are sized very well.  I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù 180lbs and the Larges fits me with enough room to breath easily.  Good coloring on them you don‚Äôt look like someone with an odd spray tan.  These are the footless type and are somewhat light weight, may not be perfect for serious winter days.  these don‚Äôt snag or tear easily.  Comfortable even during long days.

ArtGully Spiral Earrings for Women,[],[],,3.5,26,1147,"I cannot stress enough how much I LOVE these gorgeous ArtGully earrings! The detail in both pair is just beautiful. Absolutely beautiful! I wore the drop earrings (not sure what to call each pair, so I'll refer to them as 'drop' and 'spiral') to church on Christmas Eve and received quite a few compliments on them.  I wore the spiral on Christmas Day and had numerous family members compliment them as well!  They are, as promised, lightweight. In fact, one of my earring holes ripped/stretched years ago when a baby grabbed at an earring. Because of the stretched hole, I cannot wear heavy earrings.  Both of these were fine to wear.  You CAN bend the earrings to adjust to your comfort/appearance as to how you want them to hang.  (be gentle..but they ARE made to be bent!) Both come with clear backings that are pretty much impossible for anyone to see.  I have sensitive skin and there are some earrings that cause the backs of my ears to become cracked and peel...I did NOT have any issues with these earrings!  Care instructions for the earrings are on the Amazon page and I HIGHLY recommend reading them!  (Nothing hard/complicated, just tells you how to store/clean them) Its obvious these earrings are handmade. I love that the description on the Amazon page says, "" This Earrings Are Handcrafted And May Have Slight Irregularities Which Is A Natural Outcome Of Human Involvement In The Process And Often These Imperfections Adds To The Handmade Appeal Of These Beautiful & Unique Pieces. ""  Just goes to show the care and work that are put into making these gorgeous earrings by the gifted artists who craft them! They're gorgeous and so very detailed.  Its clear the artist who made them loved doing so.  So much time and energy put into making such lovely jewelry!  Both pair come in small, plastic bags inside a plastic storage container, along with a small fabric pouch to keep the earrings in.  (Again, I recommend reading the care instructions for storage and cleaning info)<br /><br />I love them.  I was so sure the spiral pair was my favorite but then I put the drop pair on and changed my mind! lol. When I wore the spiral the next day, I was back to thinking that pair was my favorite! lol.  They're both just gorgeous.  I love them.  They look wonderful if you're dressed up but also look just as wonderful when wearing jeans and a sweatshirt.  I cannot recommend these earrings enough.  Absolutely stunning!  I think its going to be quite some time before I wear any other earrings in my collection!<br />photo#1 is the 'drop' earring, photos #2 the 'spiral', photo#3 is both pairs, plastic storage case and pouch [SEP] The spirals and hook earrings are absolutely gorgeous, though I have to admit I‚Äôm not quite sure how to wear the spiral one. They have an elaborate, interesting design, and seem pretty well crafted, with the wire portion soldered on to the more solid part. These arrived beautifully packaged and well protected in a plastic box inside a natural fiber bag. See photo [SEP] These are very unique earrings, I really like the spiral pair. The other pair seemed to have a sharp edge on the end, so it hurt when I put them on. And apparently I am a bit allergic to whatever they are made of. [SEP] These earrings look really nice and are lightweight. My complaint is that the posts are a little thick and give trouble going into my piercings. With a bit of work can force them but that makes them a little too much work if you are short on time.<br />Once in they fit fine and don't pull down one's ears if worn all day.<br />I was provided with this product via Amazon's Vine Program with no expectations but that I provide my honest opinion all thoughts expressed are my own. [SEP] The designs of each of these 2 pair of ArtGully Gold spiral earrings are distinctly different, making them a suitable gift, though possibly not a widely versatile one. Additionally, each earring has a protective rubber back to serve the purpose of securing the earring to the ear. Those, I believe, are the positive points.  A disadvantage, however, is that I didn‚Äôt find either of these designs simple to attach, meaning that they would not be ones you could plan to put on if you were in a hurry. Also, in the circular design, the part of the wire attaching to the ear is somewhat fragile. Having to repeatedly adjust that curve would eventually affect the integrity of the design. In summary, these earrings are adequate costume jewelry for the right situation. [SEP] I would give these ArtGully Handmade 2 Pair Light Weight Gold Spiral Earrings for Women HandCrafted By Indian Artisans three stars. They are not heavy and do not pull my ear lobes down. I have to be careful when putting these in my ears as one side of the earring has obvious discolorations and black marks. Real gold does not tarnish. The earring did not cause me any sensitivity. See my pictures. [SEP] These are prettier in person.  I was worried they would be a plastic and cheap feel, but they are not.  They are a little heavier, but not heavy like a heavy metal.  I really love the designs and I am wearing a pair tonight for New Years.  They are great! [SEP] I have several different pairs of this brand of earrings. They are something I would imagine seeing in Morocco, India or Egypt. I just love the designs. They come cleverly packaged in a little plastic case and with a nice little cotton bag. The wires are a bit thick for my liking, but they are still manageable. They are a bit heavier than the earrings I usually wear. I wish they were hollow. Maybe they are, but the metal is pretty thick. they don't pull my ears down or anything. I just think I'm used to small earrings. Overall, if you're used to somewhat heavier earrings, these might work for you. They are definitely gorgeous. [SEP] The longer, narrow pair of earrings is very nice. Kind of bo-ho looking and also look handmade. The second pair, the round earrings, just aren't made right to fit and hang (at least not in my ears) without making my earlobes sore. Still, the 2 pairs are a bargain for the price, and the one pair is worth the money. [SEP] These are pretty jewelry and very lightweight. The circle ones are pretty easy to put in , but the others have a bend on the end that is pretty pointy and makes it hard to just slide them right in your ears on the go. Standing in front of a mirror doing it is fine.",3,True

[SEP] This dress is stunning and half the price of what you would pay at a pinup boutique.  I debated in what size to get being that I am quite busy and curvy.  I finally decided on the XL and it fit perfect.  The stretch in the back helps a lot.  I wore it for a wedding and got so many compliments. [SEP] Loive it!

"YEEPSYS Biker Shorts for Women High Waist Workout Yoga Shorts with Pockets Running Shorts Pants Non See-Through 8"" (Smoky Black, XXL)",['Pull On closure'],[],,4.3,21,5013,"These are soft and stretchy exercise shorts. They fit good and allow for ease of movement with the great amount of stretch in them.  I like that they have a pocket to hold your personal items. They hold my phone well as well as my keys or even my water bottle securely.  they are mid to bottom of my thigh length and they do not roll. They are very comfortable and are not see through if you get the correct size and fit. [SEP] These are nice workout shorts, but I got them just to wear around the house, as I don't wear shorts to exercise. They are stitched very well and the fabric is quite substantial. It has a nice stretch to it and bounces back without getting distorted. I love the pockets, even though I probably won't be using them very much other than maybe a tissue.<br />For reference, I ordered a size CAXXXL/USXXL. I'm 4'11"" and have a 39"" hip and 34"" waist, and they fit great. This size fits with a bit of room without sliding down. They hit about 4"" above my knee. They will be nice and comfortable for the summertime. Of course, I will machine wash them in cold water and hang or lay them flat to dry to help keep them looking new. [SEP] What I like most is that these shorts aren't the shiny material that is found in a lot of yoga shorts.<br />The size was perfect.  Leg length is also perfect for what I like.<br />Nice having the pockets.  They're plenty big enough, and tight enough to hold my phone without any fear of it slipping out.<br />The waistband stays up with no rolling down.  The legs, for the most part, don't ride up my thighs.<br />Wish different colors, other than the usual black, blue, gray.<br />Love wearing these with a nice longer top. [SEP] These are very good exercise shorts for women.  I received a XL size for review and they fit me very nicely.  I'm 5'9"" tall, 145 lbs and have hips made for birthing babies.  The shorts are soft, stretchy and have a pocket for whatever - usually a phone.  I washed them in the regular laundry cycle and they came out of the dryer nice and soft.  My only complaint and the reason for docking one star is that the elastic band in the waist is narrow and tends to roll over and needs to be rolled back and flattened before wearing.  A thicker elastic band would have prevented that problem. [SEP] These feel great everywhere except my lower back.  I don't know if they are too small or not, but they feel great everywhere else. [SEP] These pants were a little more snug than I would have liked, but overall I do like them. They have a nice stretch to them, and they look good on. I will be wearing these all summer. These are great to wear under a dress, or on their own. [SEP] These shorts are ok for$10, but you get what you pay for. The fabric is very thin and they ARE see-through. Just holding the fabric away from my leg, I can see straight through it. There is no way I would wear these in a situation where bending over or squatting is going to be likely. The hem is tiny-- maybe 1/4"" -- and because the fabric is so thin, the legs creep up. The waist (on me) is nice and high in the front, but kind of weirdly low in the back. There are pockets, but they are very shallow. My phone mostly fits in one if I'm standing still, but there is no way I would do any sort of exercise with it in that pocket. It would be on the ground in no time. The material is nice and stretchy, although some of the stitching is sketchy: before I put them on, I gave crucial areas a preliminary tug and heard some threads snapping. I got these to wear under short summer dresses and they are very comfortable for that, and they probably should be marketed as an undergarment, because the fabric is more suited to that purpose. They are comfortable enough for that, but I wouldn't recommend them for gym or, as the listing suggests, with a crop top and blazer. They aren't thick or stylish enough for that. [SEP] These bike shorts made my wife happy. They are very comfortable. The material is comfortable. [SEP] Great quality biking / yoga shorts are true to fit for me. I'm a size 14-16 and the XXL fit nice with a little extra room. The length in the legs is perfect and doesn't bunch up between the legs. There's a nice mix of polyester and spandex for a comfortable fit. There's a pocket on each side and holds my iPhone 8 perfectly. The shorts are stitched in all the right places to allow movement without pinching seams. This maker has several different styles and colors of exercise gear to fit your lifestyle. [SEP] When I first opened these, I was excited.  They are a nice soft and thick material.  However; if you have any stretch when wearing biker shorts or leggings, I do not recommend.  I wear between a XL and XXL in all leggings, capri leggings, and biker shorts that I have.  I wear one or the other every single day.  These fit fine as far as getting them on.  They are not as high waisted as I would like, especially in the back (if you have a larger back area).  The issue is that since they are having to be stretched, they were completely see through.  I was shocked since they are so thick, but you can definitely see through them.<br /><br />If they do not stretch to fit you, you may be fine.",3,True

shoeslocker Girls Wedge Sneakers Ankle Platform Mid Heel Double Side Zippers Nonslip Fashion Sneakers for Big Girl Little Girl Black Size 13,['Rubber sole'],[],,4.4,11,61954,"first of all let me start with the positive. These are really cute and stylish shoes, the quality is also really nice. I got these shoes for my daughter because she has trouble putting shoes on and really liked the double zipper aspect of this shoe (Wedges). What I did not realize or properly read was that is was a wedge.  The last image I posted shows the top of the wedge, which I feel is too high for a little girl. The wedge is also narrow and not good for wider feet. My daughter has slim feet and it was narrow for her. If your child is stylish and ok with tall wedges then it will for. I would totally wear this if they came in my size. [SEP] So I didn't read the description for these well enough, and I was surprised when they arrived and I realized that hidden inside these sneakers are significant wedge heels. But my daughter loves them and thinks they are the absolute best shoes ever. They're heavy because of the heels and I thought maybe with the height plus weight of them it would be a little hard for her to walk in them (she's a kid and not used to heels) but she was walking all around, even running a bit, with no trouble at all. She says they're super comfortable. They fit as expected and the little zippers make them easy to put on and take off. So for what they are, they're great shoes. [SEP] These are really cute. My 8 yr old loves them. They are a size bigger and there is room so it runs true to size. She has been wearing them even though I got them for when school starts. She likes them that much. They look good and she really likes them. [SEP] My daughter loves wearing these she calls them her heals. I only let her wear them around the house and backyard. I don‚Äôt think they will be comfortable to wear to school or to a party. Even though she try‚Äôs everyday to take them out. They fit her a little loose maybe when she grows into them I‚Äôll let her wear them out, I notice her little ankle bend sometimes but I think it‚Äôs because they are lose on her. [SEP] These boots have a really tall heel which is super fun. It can be hard for little ones to walk in heels but these do provide a lot of support. The two zippers on each shoe are super cute and these look great with pants or skirts. I love the age appropriate style for my sweet 7 year old!",3,True

The material feels pretty solid and soft. It is not the best but it is definitely not the worst either.  It has plenty of room for a cell phone, makeup and a few other odds and ins. The strap is removable and there are two zipper compartments, one being the main and the other on the front side. There is a little pocket on the inside as well. It also had a cute little gift of nail clippers inside. The picture and description are accurate. It is a simple black bag and it would definitely go with a simple black dress or any other casual outfit you choose to wear.  The price is just right and I would definitely recommend it. [SEP] I love a nice small bag, and love a nice minimalist look.<br />This bag though, is very small and the PU leather is thick and clunky. It's not cute or small looking, but is just a dense black bag. Bulky looking comes to mind, which is weird for how very small the pockets are.<br />It's nice that it came with a nail clipper bonus, (okaaaay)... but not worth purchasing. Pass. [SEP] Adorable one zipper cross body purse.  The design is simple but goes with anything...casual or dressy.  You can fit an iPhone 7 in it as well as some lipstick and a small wallet.  Just enough fits in there to have a nice night out without carrying a normal size purse.  The zipper works flawlessly and the leather looks like real leather.  Very nice bag. [SEP] This is a great idea and will come in handy when im running somewhere and dont need to bring my whole purse.  Its lightweight and large enough to carry a phone, chap stick, cards and cash. I will use this daily on walks to the park or walking our dog and need a spot to place my keys. It doesn't feel like the highest quality but we will see after some use, cant always judge a book by its cover. This will be used regularly, Thanks! [SEP] This purse is absolutely adorable and functional. It‚Äôs a small purse, that is perfect for when I don‚Äôt want to carry a large bag. It fits my iPhone 8 Plus, as well as credit cards and cash, and a lipgloss. It doesn‚Äôt hold my phone and large wallet at the same time, but could hold one or the other. The material is very soft and feels like leather. The black color and plain design make this easy to match almost any outfit. This came with a small nail clipper, with a cover. The nail clipper is handy and convenient for carrying on the go. The nail clipper cover keeps the clippers clean and protected. It also prevents the clippers from scratching the inside of the bag. This set is very cute and functional. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to conveniently carry just the essentials with them. [SEP] Nice small ladies hand bag.  Two zipper pockets.  Main compartment has a credit card pocket inside.<br />Cloth lined.  Shoulder strap with quality hardware.<br />Lightweight and easy to carry [SEP] Love it, I  work retail and is easy to carry my money and phone.

Easily carried, and it has a nice secure strap on it.<br /><br />Made of synthetic leather, the case will hold most 4.5 to 6. 5 inch phones along with an ID and some cash too.

"Orchid Row Women'sFashion Graphic Logo'""'LOVE ME'""' Multi Color Block Knit Set Beanie and Scarf Black/Orange O/S",[],[],,4.6,19,21831,"This is a really cute, youthful set by Orchid Row. It's made well and meant to last more than one winter. The block letters really add color to the set. Scarf is not overly long and the cap fits just right. It's very soft. This ""Love Me"" set would make a wonderful gift or one to keep for yourself. Once again, this set is not made for women only, men can wear them too. This set is unisex. This knitted winter pair is easy to wash and all you have to do is hang dry or even lay a towel under in and flat dry. The flat dry is the easiest way for knitted and crocheted items to keep there shape. This is not an expensive hat and cap pair. The price is just right. [SEP] Aside from the fact that this scarf and beanie set screams ""I'm INSECURE,"" it's kind of cute in its own way.  The colors are very fall, so we might have to wait until next year.  The quality seems good and its pretty soft.  I'd recommend it probably only has a gag gift.  If I saw someone wearing this, I'd probably run the other way. [SEP] These are cute! I'm a fan of the bright orange against dark blue. The scarf is a nice length, of medium thickness. Not going to do much good for anyone in a 30 F and below state, but for mild Florida winters, this will do fine. The hat is pretty fitted - it's not one of those big, comfy, loose beanies. It's snug, but it'll do when I really need something for the cold. I like the quirky message and the bold color contrast. Cool product. [SEP] This set is super soft, & well made.  The scarf is over sized to keep you extra warm!  The cap is thicker (almost as thick as one Grandma would knit) [SEP] Great gifts [SEP] This is a lightweight scarf and hat set that provides more style than warmth. The scarf is long and wide enough to be worn in a variety of ways -- wrapped around the neck a couple of times with enough excess to hang down, doubled up witha looped through knot or wrapped around the head and neck as both head and neck gear. The hat on the other hand has a bit of an odd fit -- its a little snug around its edges so you have to really stretch it when pulling it over your head. Then when you have the hat in place, there's all this extra material so it poofs up and looks a little floppy. It might just be I'm not used to the fit of a beanie (I usually wear hats with pom poms) and it's an acquired preference. The scarf will probably get more use than the hat, but at $15 for the set, thats not a bad deal. [SEP] The set looks exactly like the picture.<br />This hat is comfortable, good quality, light and soft material and the fabric stretch very well. Fits a little big.<br />The scarf is very nice and stylish, quality is good, the material soft and lightweight and It keeps warm.¬†I can wrap it twice and still have room to fluff it up, doesn't scratch or irritate my skin.",3,True

YADOCA 9 Pieces Vintage Punk Rings Octopus Dragon Snake Adjustable Ring for Men Women Silver Black Claw Skull Gothic Open Retro Cool Jewelry Ring,[],[],,3.9,138,955,"I selected this ring set on a whim. This is the kind of set that is well-suited for someone who is pursuing a Goth lifestyle or for someone who enjoys a bit of flash. This is an interesting set with some really neat designs. However, not all of the rings in this set are adjustable as the listing suggests.<br /><br />There are 9 rings in this set, all of which have been polished to a shine and the crevices filled with black to make them contrast very well. There‚Äôs an interesting assortment of designs ‚Äì a couple of dragons, claws, snakes and tentacles, and even a sugar skull. In spite of the amount of metal, these really aren‚Äôt all that heavy and do not weigh you down even when you wear all of them on one hand. They do have enough shape to them that they can easily catch on clothes but that‚Äôs a different discussion.<br /><br />Of the 9 rings in this set, the two largest ‚Äì a dragon and a sugar skull ‚Äì are made such that they cannot be adjusted. In the case of those two, they have an unbroken loop that prevents bending and stretching them open more, and that‚Äôs a problem if you have larger hands. My ring size is big ‚Äì I wear a 13 ‚Äì so these two rings just will not fit properly, even on my pinky finger.<br /><br />The other rings in this set are all open loops and the metal used is soft enough that these can be gently pried open or pushed closed to fit better. They will not bend without deliberate effort.<br /><br />These look great. Some attention was expended on detail and make these look a bit more expensive than they are.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice set. All of these rings are made well and they look really nice. It is unfortunate that not all of them can be adjusted, though most can with gentle but deliberate effort. [SEP] This is a cool collection of ""punk"" rings. It includes a dragon, skull, octopus tentacles, snake, claws, and other creepy rings. The quality is pretty good - it's not shiny silver but has that blackish cast that suits the goth sensibility. It's not vintage but made to look as if it were. It arrives in a jumble inside a black drawstring bag but that's fine. I think it would be good for Halloween as well. The best thing is that all the rings are adjustable - you can bend them and they will conform to the size of your finger, so it's one size fits all. Overall I'm satisfied with the quality of these rings. [SEP] These rings are so much fun! I absolutely adore the large one that looks like the dragon from Mulan, but they are all great. You get 9 different rings to either wear separately or together in whatever combination you choose depending on your mood. The rings themselves are a little bit large for me, so I can really only wear them on my thumbs or maybe on my pointer fingers. The listing states that they are adjustable, but I find it hard to adjust them (although I am quite small and not very strong). They are really nice quality and do not irritate my fingers or turn them green. [SEP] For $14, you get nine rings or varying theme, which is a pretty great deal. Not all of the ring were ""my style"", but it was incredibly easy to find homes for those, since these are pretty popular themes. Dragons and skulls I see all the time, but I'm loving the octopus rings, especially the tentacles. Considering the price, I was expecting  the kind of rings that you would get from a 50 cent egg toy machine, but these are surprisingly good quality. These don't bend or become misshapen easily. I'm impressed by the detail on some of the rings and I've only gotten compliments on them. As much as I love these, I imagine that these are meant more for teens and I could see these being a great gift for that teen guy that is hard to buy for; every guy likes dragons. [SEP] This is a really funky ring set. There are neat designs and overall just really creative. Most of the rings are fairly large in size not fit. The longest one is a huge dragon. What‚Äôs nice is that each ring is adjustable. They all have a silver color but dark undertones to them which adds depth and interest. The rings are really neat. They‚Äôre fairly sturdy and heavy. The collection can be worn together or separately. I think the quality is quite good. My daughter wears them daily and switches out the funky looking rings. She loves the larger rings as they are more of a statement piece.  Each ring truly has it‚Äôs own intricate detail. I don‚Äôt think the pictures of these rings do them justice. They are edgy, fun and unique. They exceeded my expectations. [SEP] Cool set of gothic vintage rings. The amount of detail on each ring is striking. I really like them. The snake is my favorite. The only issue is I have quite thin fingers and some of the rings fit loosely. [SEP] I love these rings, but the long dragon one arrived broken and the three-tentacle octopus ring snapped a few days later while wearing it. The others still seem okay but those breaking were really disappointing. [SEP] I love these fun rings, it was a awesome transaction [SEP] I love statement and funky piece jewelry items to wear.  These are pretty comfortable rings.  I wear a variety of sizes ranging from a 7 to 10 (standard ring position).  As stated these are adjustable rings and they do lean towards a more masculine look and design.  The bands are wider and thicker.  However, about 1/2 are thin enough to compliment my bone structure and don't feel overly bulky or like I am wearing my ""boyfriends' ring and I need to tape it up.  It was pretty easy to adjust the size (press in or with mild pressure adjust band out)  Most of the rings are in a bright high polish silver which I didn't like as much as the darker rings.  The snake ring oddly enough is by far the coolest ring, fantastic color, great fit and look amazing.  It is the perfect statement ring.  Not a bad price point.  I would put a clear coat on the high silver rings as some did leave tarnish marks on the skin, not all but some. [SEP] These rings are fantastic. A very cool look. Most of them are easily adjustable a few sizes in either direction, too.<br />I definitely like the variety of the styles included in the set. So many possibilities!",3,True

The cut out holes were the perfect size for me.  The sleeves were a tiny bit long but not by much since I buttoned it so it fell on my wrists anyway.  The fabric is chiffon so it's not a stretchy fabric at all.  It's also easily wrinkled but a quick steam fixes it.  The shirt falls below my butt so this can work with leggings or jeans.  However, if you are tall it might not be long enough to cover the butt so just keep that in mind. [SEP] It's very nice, but sheer- needs an undershirt.  I went a size up and it's loose fitting.

DANNE MORA Women's Short Denim Jacket Casual Fashionable Cropped Black Trucker Jacket,['100% Cotton'],[],,4.0,7,4288,"I received the DANNE MORA Women's Short Denim Jacket Casual Fashionable Cropped Black Trucker Jacket in the wrong size so I will do my best to review it fairly. Usually, Amazon gets it right when there are no size options to choose. This time I received a size large. For reference, I typically wear a size small or medium.<br /><br />I have a similar jacket in the correct size in blue denim, and it looks and fits great. Not many woven tops or jackets can accommodate the combination of narrow shoulders and a larger chest and look good. However, this style does.<br /><br />It fit as a size large should. I lost 40 lbs, so I do know. The quality is excellent, and the fabric has a bit of stretch. It falls just at my natural waist. For reference, I am 5'3"" and the length on the arms was just below my wrist bone. The distressed details are not overdone, and It would be a lovely jacket if it were my correct size. [SEP] The large fits better on my than the XL. I'm 5 ft 8, 180 pounds, size 12.<br />I love the look of this jacket. Very 80s without the shoulder pads lol. It does bug me how there are multiple intentional rips. I think it's so silly to buy something that has holes, or even worse paint on it!<br />I've already worn this a few times and while it is heavy it's comfortable. It's top thick of a fabric to wear on a 90 degree day in my opinion.<br />I washed and dried It with no dye transfer or shrinking. [SEP] I love this jacket.  First of all, its got a good amount of stretch without compromising on the strength of the fabric, which allows for easy movement and a more forgiving fit. It is definitely cropped but it hits my waist at the right spot so it looks great. Also, the sleeves are long enough that they don't ride up when i raise my arms but they also aren't so long that I'm constantly pulling them out of the way. This is especially rare for me because I'm 5'10 so I often run into issues with the proportions of women's clothing, but this fit perfectly! There aren't pockets for your hands, but they make up for it with functionally sized breast pockets.  I can fit my phone in one and my cards/keys in the other with plenty of room to spare. Its light enough to keep the chill of a breeze off but it still breathes enough not to get sweaty in it. This is my go to jacket this summer! [SEP] Love the fit and the little rips. [SEP] This is a L size. The lateral size is correct but the jacket is extremely short. The shortness is perhaps the style but it is extreme. I can see that it could work for a certain situation and style. The description should really mention this because it is so outrageously unusual. Weird. Otherwise, the material and tailoring are both quite good.",3,True

I am a big sucker for costume jewelry - especially necklaces - and this takes the cake. I accidentally ordered the black one, instead of the silver, but I think I actually like it better because it is a hematite shinny color and not so black, so it looks more like how a mini fossil might actually look. The chain links are large enough that you can adjust the length, I like to wear mine up high and I am a small person and I did not have a problem with the chain being too long.

This is nice enough for a night out on the town, but comfortable enough for the Fall days coming up.  Perfect! [SEP] This is such a soft, lovely sweater. The relaxed fit goes well with a similar colored tank underneath to show hints of the underlying silhouette. The deliberately loose weave has a nice pattern and great materials, and the overall look is beautiful and versatile. Wear it like the model with pants for a relaxed look suitable for a business casual office, or wear it with a maxi skirt for a more bohemian look. Either way, it's great! [SEP] Guest review from my wife (because it wouldn't fit me well):<br /><br />Soft and comfortable, but lightweight.  Good neutral color, and good value for the money ($30 at time of writing).  Length is good, neck is comfortable, sleeve length good too. [SEP] This sweater is an attractive option for a winter wardrobe.  In terms of sizing, I requested a Large, and at the time of this review I am 5' 4 1/2&#34; tall and weigh about 138 pounds.  The Large fit perfectly.<br /><br />The feature I like best about this sweater is the fabric-- a blend of acrylic, polyester, and wool.  The end result is a material that feels very soft.  It's not scratchy the way pure acrylic sweaters can be, and it holds its shape well (unlike cotton sweaters).  I've put it through the washing machine (cold water) and it didn't shrink or pill at all.  It lays flat to dry, and when it was dry it didn't seem stiff or wrinkly at all, unlike other sweaters I've had.  The cut is nice and long, too, which makes it a good choice to wear with leggings.<br /><br />The style is an attractive pointelle, but that comes with one disadvantage:  The weave is fairly open, and thus transparent:  Unless you don't mind exposing *a lot* of skin, you will want to wear a camisole or some other kind of layer underneath it.  That wasn't immediately obvious from the (small) photos on the website, so I suggest you click on the photos and/or enlarge them to get a better idea of the sweater's texture/styling. The open weave, of course, also means it won't be particularly warm, but that's less of an issue considering that I will be layering it.  I also recommend strongly placing the sweater inside a mesh laundry bag before putting it in the washing machine; I see a huge potential for snags if it's not protected. [SEP] I really like this sweater. It's soft and comfortable. I really like the design. It's a loose knit with large holes making the chevron pattern. I personally chose to layer this with a colored camisole. I think you could wear this without something underneath, but I prefer not to. The fit is good. I waver between a medium and large usually. I went with the large in this and that fit perfectly. It's not too baggy or too tight. I have a short torso so often shirts and sweaters are too long, but this hits me nicely in the hips. Overall, this is just a nice sweater. [SEP] A pointelle weave is a type of knitwear or woolen fabric with small eyelet holes that creates a lacy effect.  The eyelets holes in this sweater are very wide and unless you are okay with showing a lot of skin and having your bra being completely exposed, you'll want to wear something under this sweater.<br /><br />I loved this sweater initially - it is very soft and comfortable.  Initially, it looked fantastic but it didn't wash up well after being laundered several times.  The material tends to pill and it takes on an ""old sweater"" look too prematurely making it best for casual wear.  It still looks nice - it's just has a more rustic look with the pilling. [SEP] I like this sweater; it's very pretty, very soft and comfortable. You have to wear a camisole underneath; beige or pink would be ideal.<br />The only thing that's upsetting to me is that the knit is loose; I snagged the sweater on a door and then twice on the zipper on my purse. That's why I gave it four stars rather than five. [SEP] This sweater is very pretty in person but very heavy and very thick. It‚Äôs not at all as pictured on the model. [SEP] I don't usually like sweaters that are so ""holey"" but I like this oatmeal color a lot - plus, you can wear it for a longer range of months because it requires layering. With a tank underneath, it's fine for summer! With longer sleeves underneath, perfect for fall! And with a tank under and then a larger cardigan over, it works for fall/winter! I am a little scared of something snagging it, but other than that, it's a great and versatile sweater! [SEP] Nicely made sweater. Great price point. I will get great usage from this sweater.

See the first 2 photos.  When trying to review a new necklace this old review pops up and I can add to it so I will.<br /><br />1st post<br />I wanted to like this necklace.  the advertisement photos make is look like a versatile piece.  However, when you get it, it‚Äôs rather dull in appearance.  Mine came in a small jewelry bag and inside the necklace was stuffed into a tiny plastic bag. When I finally got it out, you can see in the photos, it looked like an old tarnished necklace.  It did hang well and had a decent length but was just flat and dull to look at.  Mine actually broke while wearing it the first day.  I only wore it maybe 3 hours so I don‚Äôt know if it would have left tarnish marks.<br /><br />2nd post ‚Äî New item necklace with small coins on it.<br />This necklace is somewhat weird to look at.  The length isn‚Äôt that great and when looking closely at the pendent it appears as one large melted blob with coins hanging off it.  Not one of the better items I have ever worn.  The good points are that it did NOT tarnish my skin when wearing it for the day.  However, I just don‚Äôt care for the overall look and quality for this particular (well both) pieces.  I have several pieces by sunsoul and so far its about 50/50 on quality and design. [SEP] I never know what to expect from this ""Chinese jewelry"", sometimes it's really cheap and flimsy.  This piece is NOT!  It's great! So pretty and ethnic looking, without being bright or overstated.  It's just silver.  It has a nice weight to it, so the strands lay down and don't flop around and get tangled.  It's a perfect length on me--the bottom ""point"" hits me just below the breastbone--above my cleavage so it works with summer tank blouses as well as winter sweaters.<br />Very pleased, it's a new favorite in my wardrobe! [SEP] This is my new go to necklace for so many outfits. I love the length especially since I am a little more heavyset. I can‚Äôt do little 16 inch necklaces. This one hits me mid chest and works well over turtlenecks, cowl necks or even shirts that have an open neckline. The detail on it is also wonderful.  It comes in a cute bag with an enclosed card for a nice presentation.  Great gift idea too! [SEP] THIS IS BEAUTIFUL AND DELICATE.  At first I was confused about how to wear it.

But its actually a very thin sheet of metal<br />- They did not cause any sensitivity or redness when wearing them for extended periods<br />- The good part about its lightweight construction is that you hardly feel that they're there, despite a large design<br /><br />DISLIKES<br />- The post is very thin and its difficult to put the fastener on without bending due to a high amount of resistance in the fastener<br />- The black bead like part which covers the ear lobe is also very thin and can be bent easily<br /><br />Overall these are good looking earrings that have a nice design , however at $12.99 we feel that its a bit overpriced due to its thin materials making it less durable. 3 Stars [SEP] Lovely earrings! Impressed with their looks.<br /><br />My only concern is that they are quite lightweight and a bit flexible because of how thin they are, which makes me think that they could break easily. BUT since they aren't broken yet, I plan to use them as much as I can!<br /><br />Recommended!! [SEP] SO I thought these were going to hold up and be great but boy was I wrong! They are cheaply made and broke like a week after having them. These are NOT worth the money so don't bother with them! [SEP] They are delicate and pretty! ‚ú® I love how they compliment every look! I feel like they would go even with some fancy hoodies  üòÇ<br />Like them!!! [SEP] At first I thought these were intricately woven with string, but they're filigree metal. Very cool. The 3D shaping of the stud portion lends a higher-end look, while the whole thing is very lightweight. If I didn't feel them moving around when I turn my head, I would completely forget I'm wearing them. They'd stay in just fine with a standard metal earring back, but the fact that they have the wide plastic disc version is an extra comfort bonus. [SEP] These are a great concept, the shape is very interesting.  You don't see many earrings that look this good.  But the color black means these will get lost on a persons face.  I'm looking for my gold paint now.  At least help me keep up my crafts skills. [SEP] These are very thin, but the circle is big. So you get the presence without the weight.

"Awesome 360 Men's Classic Tie Necktie 2 Pcs Set, AT190529009",[],[],,4.0,15,1150,"My husband works at home, so aside from having to attend a funeral, wedding or special work event,  he only wears a tie occasionally.  For months now, he's only had one tie to cover all of those events and not long ago, his one and only tie was demolished in the washing machine by the agitator. lol.<br /><br />Recently, he had to appear in court to testify in a trial involving a family member.  We had plenty of advance notice of the trial so when the 2 pack of the Awesome 360 Men's classic tie appeared in my Vine account, the timing was perfect!<br /><br />One of the two ties pictured in the photo above (directly from Awesome 360's Amazon page) was in the box-the pink and silver striped tie.  The solid blue tie in the same photo was not included in his 2 pack. Instead, he received a VERY nice blue/violet checkered tie. Both ties are VERY nice and both match a variety of shirts that he already owns.  On the first day of court, he wore the blue/violet checkered tie and it looked wonderful!  He wasn't happy when he learned he'd have to return for a second day and quite honestly, he was not looking forward to wearing the pink and silver tie. (He refers to it as 'pink', I think its more of a  'magenta' shade)  The silver stripes on this tie shimmer a bit.  At first he said he thought he looked like the ""Gooe Humour ice cream man"" (don't ask...I have NO clue where he got that from! lol) but he actually got some compliments on the tie and he ended up  liking it!  And it looked VERY nice!<br /><br />Both ties are nice and go so well with a variety of colored shirts.  Both wore well and were easy to tie without issue.  These ties are very nice and a good value for the price.  (After losing his other tie to the washing machine agitator, I hand washed both of these and they did very well!) [SEP] The red and white tie has glitter in the white portion. I asked my husband if he would wear it. He didn't know if he would or not. The other tie is blue and looks like most blue ties. They are made of polyester and are machine washable. If he doesn't wear the red and white with sparkles tie, I already am churning around ideas in my head for uses. [SEP] The ties come nicely packaged, and can be a gift as well. They are a bit narrower that I wanted, made out of polyester. One tie is blue, the other is pink stripe with silver threads in between. [SEP] beautiful ties I received the exact ones pictured and they are vibrant and nice. not dull at all. they look expensive and my husband who has many ties definitely was impressed. the pink tie is a true pink and the blue tie is true blue. the patterns on the ties are nice and so elegant he has paired the ties with different colord shirts whoch worked very well. I would definitely purchase more of these. I was nervous after seing other reviews but I guess we got lucky because these were good quality and great length and fit my husband well he is a heavy set dude and had no issues with these ties. great product good purchase. [SEP] My husband wears lots of formal outfits for his work. Thought it would be nice for him to try out. Long story short, the ties are very nice! I like the blue one a lot, not so much about red one. The ties are soft and looks expensive. My husband was very impressed about the quality of the ties. I would recommend if you‚Äôre looking for inexpensive ties for your daily outfits. [SEP] I needed a couple of ties so figured these would get the job done but was far more impressed than expected once they arrived. First, this two pack comes boxed in a divider that works well for gift giving or organizing...either way is nice. Next, I really like the non-slip secure backing, the length (perfection) and the size. These are the Goldilocks of ties. Versatile colors, better than hoped for quality. [SEP] I received two ties that were rolled neatly, the blue tie that is in the pictures, and a red and white tie, which honestly does not resemble the pictures.  The red and white has gold flecked rectangles through the white that give off a sparkly edge as if the tie was dipped in metal glitter.  If it were a plainer tie without the glitter, I could see myself wearing it at work, but as it is, I think I will only reserve it for holiday purposes and not as a general purpose tie.  The blue tie is professionally woven, and can be worn in basically any circumstances with the right shirt and jacket mix.  Both ties are definitely sized for shorter people (under 5' 10"") from both the length and the width, and as I am short, I will definitely wear the blue tie for work.<br /><br />There seem to be more than one version in these boxes, and I hope the manufacturer allows the choice between different colors.  There also was a purple tie that probably would have worked better with paired with the blue.  Interestingly, the invert pattern on the blue tie (a blue and white polka dot pattern) would work fine as well. [SEP] We were surprised by the sparkles. If you are looking for a fun, flashy, bright tie, this might be the pair for you. If you are an older person working in a conservative setting (or you need a tie for a somber occasion like a funeral), maybe not. I can't comment on the price because there isn't one listed. The quality seems like something you'd get in a TJMaxx kind of store---but there you would have the advantage of being able to see them in person.  Recommended with reservations.",3,True

I have to have prescription lenses only, so these are for my husband. These are not as dark as he usually wears, so when he's working with the horses or is out at the ranch, he prefers his old sunglasses.<br /><br />He really likes the added reader lens included as a bifocal on these though and they are great when he's driving. He gets the sun glare protection and can still see a map without removing them. I think they look good on him - a bit modern and fresher than the old Ray-Ban style he's worn for decades. [SEP] After having cataract surgery in both eyes a few years ago, I find that I need readers in a variety of strengths for different activities:  computer work, reading printed books, needlework, etc.  So I tend to purchase a lot of readers and I'm always on the lookout for styles/designs that will work in a variety of settings including outdoors.  So readers combined with sunglasses are a definite plus for me.  Even more attractive are bifocal readers that allow me to look up from reading and still focus on the scenery around me (I do a lot of cruise travel in balcony cabins ... )<br /><br />These are nearly perfect as bifocal sunglass readers go.  I love the shape, the frame, the fit, the case -- everything.  There's one flaw, however:  the bifocal ""line"" -- that actual cut in the lens below which the bifocal ""reading"" lens is placed -- is just a little too low for these to work comfortably ""as is.""  In order to see clearly through the reader lens portion, I have to tilt my head back -- and this is after pushing the nose piece as high as I can.  I can manage that tilt for awhile, but eventually my neck gets tired.<br /><br />This would be so easy to fix -- just raise that bifocal line 1-2 millimeters, and the placement would be perfect.  I can get them to work by attaching adhesive nose piece pads that will raise the level enough so that I can read comfortably, but I really shouldn't have to do that.<br /><br />As is, as much as I'd love to love these, I can only say ""they're OK."" [SEP] While these glasses aren‚Äôt top of the line, they are well made, super lightweight and work great for reading in the sun.<br /><br />The lower third of the lenses have the 1.50X magnification area and slightly less tinting.<br /><br />The nose pads wrap completely around the metal of the bridge piece so they will not come loose and fall off.<br /><br />The arms are screwed into brackets that are riveted through the outer edge of the lenses.  All of the connections are very secure and appear as though they will hold up well.<br /><br />The glasses come with a nice semi-rigid case that will protect the glasses well and a microfiber cleaning cloth.<br /><br />This is a product that I would recommend I‚Äôve found these glasses comfortable to wear while laying by the pool reading.<br /><br />‚≠êÔ∏èAs with all Drew‚Äôs Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.  I believe in creating detailed, complete reviews because, like you, I depend on them when I am shopping.  If you found my review HELPFUL - please click ‚¨áÔ∏è below!‚≠êÔ∏è [SEP] I honestly never expected much from these glasses but they really don‚Äôt look half bad. My boyfriend needs reading glasses so I ordered them for him. He actually likes them and they are great for outdoors. They provide you with the light protection but allow you to see as well. However since they are reading glasses they are not made to be worn at all times. Only as needed. [SEP] These sunglasses were great. Arrived inside a nice zippered case with a cleaning cloth. It was great being able to see the clock and radio stations while driving. But..... They snapped right in half the first time I tried to adjust them to my face. I applied very little pressure.  I wore them once. So be very careful they are not sturdy at the nose piece. [SEP] Though I would probably not give up my name-brand sunglasses for this product, when close work or reading is required while outside in bright sunlight, these sunglasses are just the ticket. The 1.5x magnification is adequate for close work, or basic reading. [SEP] I got these for my mom who has just a slight eyesight problem - nothing too major to where she shouldn't be on the road, but enough for her to not be confident. Obviously, she couldn't wear her sunglasses with her normal glasses, so I needed to find a cheaper option compared to what her eye care doctor could offer.<br /><br />Initial impressions when I first got these: these sunglasses come in a nice black case. It‚Äôs a sophisticated look, but isn‚Äôt too sturdy. It‚Äôs not going to withstand weight if you accidently sit on it, but I do see it taking a drop here and there. Moving on to the sunglasses, as soon as my mom put them on, she could tell that they'd do the job. They look sharp as well - nothing that screams for attention or looks peculiar. They‚Äôre nice and simple.<br /><br />Now, while the glasses and prescription are A-Okay, I can't say the same for the quality of the glasses. It's really flimsy and delicate: one drop is likely to break or shatter the whole thing. I was surprised when I first took them out of the case because the lens is pencil thin plastic. The nose piece is also concerningly thin metal, and I almost doubted that they‚Äôd hold up‚Ä¶. Well, they did, and at $11.99, I can't say that I'm surprised.<br /><br />Therefore, at this price point, keep in mind that you are sacrificing quality for a cheaper prescription. Be extra careful when handling these sunglasses, otherwise I suggest purchasing some prescription lenses for something of more quality. [SEP] The moment i saw these glasses i knew they would be perfect for my mom as she's an avid reader & lives in Florida.  She enjoys reading in her backyard on her lounge chair.<br />The glasses offers a tint & 1.5 lens. While these aren't pure sunglasses that will block enough sun to make reading enjoyable sround any glare. Built quality is not the best at this price point, but adequate for its functions of light reading. It comes with a hard case to store them.  The design is attractive you wouldn't even know they were reading glasses by looking at them until you look more closely. My mom enjoys these glasses during her backyard readings and recommends them. [SEP] So, apparently I didn't read that these were 1.5x, and requested them. I dont need glasses, and as soon as I put them on, it was more obvious. They fit great, immediately darken a room, and overall just have a nice look to them, and if they were 0x I'd be thrilled. Which says enough: I'd buy these if they were [SEP] This is perfect for anyone who might like to sit outside to read, but want to protect their eyes from the sun. Just an FYI - In my opinion, I would not recommend this for driving unless you don't mind tilting your head down to read the speedometer as the magnifier part just made it hard to just glance at to see how fast your are going.<br />I really like the style of the glasses. I would love to have a pair of just regular sunglasses (no magnification) like these for driving. The glasses were comfortable to wear. They fit nice and snug. I also have the 2.5x pair.<br /><br />The case that these glasses came in is pretty flimsy and the zipper broke when I went to unzip it for the first time so I'm no longer able to use it to protect these glasses when not in use.",3,True

They're a perfect fit around my waste with its adjustable size and they're comfortable. I've had issues where the insides of some swimming trunks rub against my skin and give me a rash, and I have not yet had that problem with these. If you're lucky enough to have a swimming pool during this quarantine, then these swimming trunks might be your best bet! [SEP] The print is great! Very tropical blue and orange palm leaves, and birds of paradise on white. These shorts say vacation loud and clear.<br />The lightweight fabric with an elastic band stretch gives that extra room when you need it and the drawstring can cinch in a a little if you need it too. A comfortable versatile fit. I have an XXL. The weight of the swim shorts on my home scale is just over 8 ounces. The waist is 19 1/2"" when not stretched with the elastic but there is some room to stretch further a little with the band as well. The length is 21 1/2"".<br />For the price they are a great pair of swim trunks. [SEP] My husband loves these swim trunks. He says the fit true to size and are very comfortable. He hates tight swimwear and says they‚Äôre not tight like some newer swim trunks seem to be, the waist band has stretch and thigh area is spacious. Great option for taking to the beach or anywhere on vacation because they honestly just look like nice shorts and not just swim trunks so they are very versatile. The quality feels great and very well made. [SEP] Great swim trunks.  Saving the,m for the warmer weather.  Fit as expected.  Great value.  Cute print [SEP] My husband is a big guy, so when these XXL trunks showed up, I ordered them.<br /><br />1. The waist fits him kind of snugly. If you're any bigger than a 50"" waist, you might want to order the XXXL, if they have them.<br />2. These trunks are very lightweight.

"Genuine Assembly Men's Denim Jeans, Skinny Fit, Weekender, Denims for Outdoors and Adventure Activities, Jeans GA-04A 32 Mid Blue",[],[],,4.2,14,9523,"I know these jeans are marketed to men, but if you're a tall, lanky female like me they will probably fit you very well and look awesome at the same time.  I'm 5'9"", 148 pounds and the 32x32 fit nicely.  The waist is a little loose and I have to wear a belt, but the length is perfect.  These are soft, durable, well made, and have that really cool crinkly folded look underneath the front pockets.  I washed and dried them yesterday and they came out of the dryer just fine with no fading or shrinking.  I'm wearing them right now and have had them on all day and they are extremely comfortable.  These, a nice tee-shirt and pair of Converse is my favorite outfit.  Oh yes!  They are also stretchy and just wonderful! [SEP] The denim is a very comfortable stretch, very smooth, not at all abrasive,  and the wash-out look is happily customary.  Somehow the lengthwise stitching is made to look worn, but it's a talent all jeans makers seem to have mastered by now.<br /><br />But here's the odd part: I'm an exact 32"" waist going back many decades, so it was odd to have this pair of jeans promptly slipping down my waist toward a butt-crack, plumber-style stasis. The length (30"") as marked is about right and will be worn with boots.<br /><br />In reassessing the cut and the ""skinny / slim"" claim for these jeans, it seems more to be about halfway between ""regular"" and ""slim"" than to be ""skinny"" or slim. The ""skinny"" cut seems apt at the ankles, but definitely not at the waist.<br /><br />The pockets are sized just right, and there's even a coin pocket (hence the ""five-pocket"" description).<br /><br />I may have missed it, but I couldn't see on the tags where these likely imported items were manufactured or assembled.  Some consumers like to know (e.g., preferring Bangladesh or Pakistan over China).<br /><br />This may be the only pair of jeans in the wardrobe which is unwearable without a belt, except perhaps as part of some cross-gendered version of a belly dance, the audience for which is ever-diminishing. [SEP] These jeans fit true to size and passed the test of a fashion conscious 17yo. The stitching makes them look very high end and the cut is current with trends.  The material is of good weight and has enough give to make the slimmer styling still comfortable. [SEP] Beware the length on these jeans are 30"". To call them capris on me is putting it nicely. If you are very short but size 32"" these might fit you. But the thighs and such are so tight I am not sure they will.<br /><br />Even the 2% elastine is nice but not nearly enough to help. Granted I usually like a 34-36"" inseam length but I thought 30"" is just way too short for people.<br /><br />If they fit you though the style is great. Nice shade of blue, not overly faded, nice button in the front, zip fly. No rips or tears. Just beware of the length. [SEP] I liked these new jeans from Genuine Assembly. The skinny fit is great in the waist but the length for me is too long. These are size 32x34 and I could better wear a 32x32 or a 32x30. However I love the new cloud wash look. I am 5'8"" 165 lbs. [SEP] These might be a bit too skinny especially at the ankles - not very flattering unless you happen to be REALLY and truly super skinny...not merely athletic. These don't fit the calves and are uncomfortable. Good for very thin builds only. Well made. [SEP] Like many people, my leisure time is almost always spent in jeans. So I'm very critical and demanding about how comfortable they are primarily, second how they look, obviously and finally the quality of the stitching and the denim composition. I discovered Joe's Jeans and they instantly became my overwhelming favorite despite an eye watering price, at least in my opinion. I bought multiple pairs of one model of dark blue to assure having them for years to come. These Genuine Assembly Skinny fit jeans arrived and I was immediately struck by the weight of the package. they had heft that might indicate a substantial jean. They have ""skinny"" right in the name so I was prepared to snake into them and pronounce them uncomfortable like compression socks. But I didn't. Though the lower legs are slimmer, I'm not sure I'd call them skinny at all. Maybe slim fit is more accurate. Surprisingly, as other reviewers noted as well. the waist area, even though they are my standard 32 inch waist, were actually a little loose. No wearing these without a belt. But once belted the fit is almost perfect for my form. I love the fact that the pockets don't have some obnoxious stitching that screams No Style Taste, though even expensive jeans can go off the deep end with cheapening details and over design. These have clean lines and an efficient cut and look. The stitching is even and secure. Areas are faded, but in a way that makes it look the most convincing of any pair of jeans I've owned that makes it appear this was caused by genuine wear and washing and not some contrived exaggerated design or acid torture process.  Like many jeans today, the length is a standard 34 inches. I wear 32 length, but the extra length allows you to roll them into a cuff if you like. I coincidentally just bought a pair of sueded Chelsea boots, and these jeans were made to be paired with them, including the extra length. I was asked to review these jeans as a preproduction model so no price was listed on the amazon page. My Joe's Jeans retail for almost $200, so if these are anything under $150, I'd say they are a good value since they should last many years of wear, the material is comfortable with just enough stretch, and the fit, while not exactly skinny as advertised, to me is a more user friendly and comfortable ""slim"". Highly recommended! These are more casual and less dressy, serious looking than my deep blue Joe's, but they will get nearly the same workout in my wear rotation. [SEP] Looks like these aren't being sold at the moment, but just in case ...<br /><br />The size 32 I received is labeled 32x34. The waist measures 34"" inside and stretches out to past 40"". Size 32 usually measures 34"" now (because we're bigger there than we think), so that's about right, with plenty of stretch if needed.<br /><br />The inseams measure 32-3/4"".<br /><br />They ride a little low, not a lot.<br /><br />The legs do get progressively skinnier as they go down. Above the knees they're a couple inches thinner around than my regular-fit denims, what I'd call slim. Below the knees they get several inches thinner. The opening at the end is 12-3/4"" and stretches out to 16"".<br /><br />The fabric stretches quite a bit widthwise and on both diagonals.<br /><br />Lightly pre-distressed, including being roughed up above the knee.<br /><br />Machine wash cold with like colors, gentle cycle, non-chlorine bleach if needed, tumble dry low heat, cool iron.<br /><br />Made in Bangladesh.",3,True

When I go on vacation, I will take them so that I can enjoy reading around the pool. [SEP] I really like these glasses but wish that the tint went all the way down to the reading area. By having that area clear it does two things that I don‚Äôt like. One is, light surfaces (like sand or concrete) seem brighter because my eyes are not protected at the bottom. And two, I would like to be able to have better sun protection while reading outside. On the bright side, the lack of tinting on the bottom makes reading gauges in the car easier with the sunglasses still on. As long as I use them in the car I‚Äôm very happy with them. [SEP] The glasses themselves are well made.  I gave these glasses a moderate rating because the bifocal is what I dislike.  Instead of a progressive lens there is a straight cut off between the strength in the lens.<br />I tried reading and driving with these glasses and it just doesn't work for me.  Driving doesn't feel safe at all because the line is disconcerting.<br />I cannot give these my recommendation. [SEP] Dress up with these SKYWAY Sunglasses. These grey ones go with anything and  they are tinted a Progressive Grey And are Rimless .  They also block The UV Rays. [SEP] First I think these are very stylish. I didn't notice any progressive, I don't know if that was suppose to mean darker or from the reader part. But the reader is like a bifocal. The first time Bob worn them they came apart. I was able to put them back together again did take a bit. So I would check all screws cause that was the problem. So with all that being said they worked exactly as they were suppose too. Bob wasn't having to take his sunglasses off to put his readers on. He loves them. I think maybe some better quality control. I hope this has helped. Thank You [SEP] These glasses are light weight, comfortable, and look great! You can‚Äôt see the bifocal from the front of the glasses, but you can see the line from the back. I don‚Äôt recommend using them for driving if you aren‚Äôt used to it. Typically I just move my eyes to look at my tachometer etc., but the bifocal made that difficult, as I‚Äôd have to move my head down to clearly see it. But they are awesome for reading on the beach, golf, and other recreational activities. [SEP] I seriously hate being in my 40s... My eye doctor as of recent told me its time to get bifocals and I have been hating every minute of it. Finding fashionable sunglasses to wear with my contacts that were also fashionable has been a difficult task. I was happy to find these... they are affordable and look great on... [SEP] I seriously love these glasses! I use them for walking because they are perfect to keep the sun out of my eyes as well as allow me to look down at my phone and see it clearly - no removing glasses to read what's on my phone. Besides that, they're stylish, not too big nad nicely shaped. The case is a protective zippered pouch that keeps the glasses safe in my purse yet easily retrievable. I wish I'd had these long ago! [SEP] Ok, so I got these sunglasses without realizing they were also reading glasses, because I paid more attention to the picture than the words, and also because who's ever heard of such a thing? I'm a lifelong reader, and my inclination to sit in full sunlight and read a book is nil, because the breeze will blow the pages around and bugs will land on the book. So even if I needed reading glasses, which I don't, I wouldn't use these things because I read indoors like most of humanity, and my lamps are not as bright as the sun. These are for someone who reads on the beach, I guess...? [SEP] My readers are 1.75 so these 2.0 readers will take some time getting used to.  I will use these mainly in my car, because I am forever flipping between my readers and sunglasses while in the car.  I like that the small reader lens portion of the glasses is not graduated.  Graduated lenses bother me whereas these are clearly defined, so I am not looking thru something that is somewhere between zero power magnification and the 2.0 magnification.",3,True

Stocking Fox Women's Plus Size Opaque Stretch Black Tights XXX-Large 2-Pack,['Tumble Dry'],[],,3.7,26,3003,"As  a plus-size gal, I hate wearing tights that are supposed to fit, but then end up sliding down from my waist because they are ill fitting up top (too tight) and then too loose on my legs.  These tights have a nice stretch to them, so they fit in both areas.  I don't wear tights often, but I do need them for more formal events or for a couple of dresses I have that fall at the knee.  Otherwise, I don't wear tights, but there are just those few outfits that look better with them.  I like these.  I didn't want spanx, and these don't squeeze too much, but they do smooth your form a bit.  These are perfect for my needs! [SEP] I am tall and overweight. I fit right in the graph for the size. I suppose it is a good thing they run small, otherwise they would have been too big. I will be taking these on vacation to wear with my dresses for dinner. Sometimes, a stocking leg looks much better than a bare leg, depending on how fancy your dress is. [SEP] These tights are So comfortable, finally great tights for for a plus size woman. They are thick, stretchy and strong. The sizing is right on. They are thick and a mostly opaque on me. I have no fear of runs just by putting them on. My new favorite pair of tights. The package saves you money as it comes with two pair. [SEP] I love these! They are soft and stretchy and a nice weight. These are going to be awesome for fall and winter. They fit me but I ordered a much bigger size. I would say size up. [SEP] These are decent, but the fit is totally off. I would typically take a size 1X, and these 3X just fit. However, they feel good and are nicely constructed of quality material, and the waistband is comfortable.  Being opaque, they‚Äôre thicker than your average pair of pantyhose, and they don‚Äôt look like they will run.<br /><br />But, I seriously would love to know what size that model in the photo is wearing and how she got the tights up over her elbows???  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, and I have slimmer legs, and they just barely stretch up to my waist. Maybe she‚Äôs 4‚Äô5‚Äù?????<br /><br />I would recommend going up 2 sizes with these. [SEP] These tights are thicker than regular nylons. You can wear them under a dress or skirt on colder days or you can wear them as leggings. They fit well and are thick enough that they shouldn't get runs in them as easily as regular nylons. I received a package that contained 2 pair of tights. This gives me a backup pair, so I will always have a clean pair when I need it. [SEP] These tights are made of a good quality material that should last without running or tearing.  I found it's usually best to wash tights (or hose) before the first wearing as for some odd reason they last longer.  These run a tad small so you should order one size up.  I wish the toes were reinforced so I wouldn't have to wear a ""footie"" with them.  They are otherwise well constructed and affordable. [SEP] They don't stay up",3,True
UNDER ZERO UO Women‚Äôs Summer Headband Beige Lurex Foil Hair Band,[],[],,3.5,27,4664,"I usually have headbands that won't stay in place because of my super fine hair. This one fits and doesn't move from where I place it and I don't even have to use hair pins to keep it stationary. This is something new for me. It is a beigy color and the area where it crosses is somewhat big, but it works for me. [SEP] I love this headband so much. Great for putting on my make up and also let me add that I've recently been using this as a top for my bathing suit, yep that's right, my bikini top! Thought it would be cute, and it is!  :) [SEP] There's a lot of fabric on the top of your head with the way the fabric in this headband is bunched and twisted. I don't particularly like the look of a knot of fabric bulging 1.5 inches from my head. It does its job as a headband and keeps the hair back. [SEP] The only thing I liked about this headband was the fabric. Its very pretty. But it was too tight and my head is small and when I looked at myself in the mirror wearing it I saw a circa 1950's depiction of a housewife on her knees scrubbing a floor. That's how it looked on me - like part of the costume of a cleaning woman character in a play. [SEP] My elderly mother wears a wig for her very thinning hair.  When she's around the house she doesn't wear it, but she still wants to look presentable. This headband is perfect because it's nice and wide, and the twist gives it a bit of glamorous height.  She can pull her hair to the back in a soft ponytail, and the headband looks rather elegant, almost like ""old Hollywood"" style.  It's cream colored with gold flecks and it is nice and soft.  It says ""hand wash only"" and I will heed this suggestion very carefully.  I've had headbands in the past that tear apart, shrink or look trashy after going through a washing machine. It won't get dirty-dirty so a quick rinse with a dot of soap and hang dry will keep it nice for many years. [SEP] Works good for holding hair back for putting on make up , for taking make up off.  Fancy even to wear out with a bad hair day (picture).  Works for all you could need for getting your hair out of your face and holds it in place I did not have sliding.  I hope this has helped. Thank You [SEP] During the hot, humid summer months I absolutely, positively need something that will keep my hair off my face.  I like that it's broad around the front but just has a thin elastic in the back for comfort.  It's easily hand washed in a basin and should be hung or towel dried.  Whenever I see this style head wrap I always think of Norma Desmond and classic retro beauty queens. [SEP] Under Zero Women's Summer Headband Beige Lurex Foil Hair Band so it's of white with gold flecks.<br />95% polyester, 5% spandex, hand-wash separately only. please do not dry-clean or bleach. do not tumbler dry or iron. hang to dry in shade. Made from durable material, nice texture, soft and breathable.. wide 3.1"", length 9.7"", circumference 15-23"" ; one size fit most, elastic, soft and stretchy<br />great to wear in sport or daily wear. It's more made for people with very thick hair or lots of volume. If I were to wear it with my hair pulled back it's too big, doesn't look right. [SEP] From a throwback perspective, the style of this headband is rather cute. Definitely reminds me of a 50's housewife doing house chores.  It's beige but the fleck specs of gold give it the bling it needs to be cute enough to wear causally as well.  Good quality overall. It's a keeper for a cool retro look. [SEP] I really enjoy the comfort of this headband above any others that I have. It's made from breathable fabric equipped with a stretchy back (huge plus!) Usually when I wear these wrap style headbands, overtime, they stretch out. I haven't experienced that with this one yet because of the scrunchy bottom.<br /><br />The style of this headband is perfect for a casual day. It has little gold sparkles all over which go lovely with smaller stud earrings. It keeps my hair out of my face while keeping my style in check.

The fit is pretty unflattering if you have broad shoulders and a narrow waist - very boxy. I can't see myself ever wearing this [SEP] This is, and looks like, a very cheap jacket. Unlined, serged seams. Very light material that may not be cut or sewn to hang properly, so mine had a tendency to ripple and flip up at the back hem. Actually I was too embarrassed to wear it to work. And for the price (over $40 as of this review) the quality is incredibly poor. A similar jacket at Ross shouldn‚Äôt cost more than $24. Or just buy a better jacket. [SEP] This is a very lightweight blazer (it's almost sheer, the fabric is so thin). This does have buttons on the front, but they're just for show.

You can try to adjust it and open up the buttons as needed which helps a little. The sleeves come down about halfway between my shoulders and elbows. The ruched look is interesting but makes me feel like I constantly need to adjust it to get it to look right and that really doesn‚Äôt matter because it will just change with movement anyway.

I like the layered look of it and it looks nice with a blouse that shows it off. I am especially looking forward to showing it off during warmer weather and have enjoyed the very nice selection from this brand. The quality is decent for the price as well. [SEP] While I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the moon and star charm on this necklace (it was much larger than I expected), the chain is DEFINITELY dainty. I felt like I would break it when I just fumbled a bit putting it on. It's not an expensive piece of jewelry, of course, but for the current price point (about $30), I would have hoped for a somewhat sturdier chain. [SEP] I get so many compliments on this necklace. I absolutely love it. I wish they chain were a little bit longer. [SEP] This is a pretty layered necklace! I like the star and moon design and the small stars on the smaller part of the necklace layer. Would make a nice gift because it comes in a pretty box and drawstring bag. It does look a little cheap and juvenile but it is still pretty. May be nice for a teenager or someone in their 20s. [SEP] This is so pretty - I think it's actually nicer in person than in pictures. I was so pleased that it's not flimsy.  I'm used to wearing silver but I'll make an exception for this necklace. This can be worn double - where it looks like 2 necklaces, or long where it looks like 1 necklace. I prefer the double. can't wait to wear this with a white v-neck tee in the summer. [SEP] I feel like the length is a bit too short with how much is going on with this necklace but it's very pretty and so different from any other styles. Love it!

I get a ton of compliments when wearing it. It‚Äôs major flaw however is that the two chains easily twist together and I find that I am constantly trying to unravel them but end up getting frustrating and leaving it twisted.

The chains both look on the cheaper side and made it feel like costume jewlery. With a nice chain it would have been a diffrent story. The rose gold color was a fake rose gold and it was to shiny and the color was slightly off. Now the necklace is cute and delicate and I would still wear it with casual everyday clothes.

The girl loves these types of necklaces and if they break, it is not great loss. [SEP] I thought that this might be a cute necklace to wear at the beach... and I have tried to love it, but I just don't. the directions on the necklace state ""Please avoid wearing it when sweating a lot, shower or sleep, etc."" I find that this would be difficult. Its a beachy necklace... and its HOT at the beach and normally you sweat. So for me that is even more of a reason to not be satisfied with it. the necklace itself looks cheap and it isn't made well at all. You may get two wears from this necklace before it breaks.

But, I wore in during a tough tennis match this morning and the necklace felt fine, looked great and didn't break.  I wouldn't sleep with it on but otherwise I think it should be fine.  I really love the look it gave me - totally different from the necklaces I usually wear and with a nice, light tan going, my racerback tank and some running shorts, I think I looked pretty good!

This has a single simple cowrie shell pierced though with a loop, and there is about an inch length of chain for slight adjustments around the neck. This isn't fancy jewelry, but it's really pleasant, and I like to wear it. [SEP] My teenage daughter loves this necklace.  It looks very cute on as well.  It is made well and very stylish.  I really like it. [SEP] It's a very cute necklace and perfect summer wear. However, it's very cheaply made and lasted only 5 days on my daughter's neck. The chained clasp portions on the wire completely fell off and could not be fixed. [SEP] I'm not sure what this is going for price wise at the time of this review, but it's a cute, touristy type necklace that fits perfect on the beach and with summer outfits.  The cord has an extender so you're not stuck with a choker type necklace if that's not what you want. The shell is a real shell, cute and inexpensive. I'd pay about $5-$7 for this necklace and wear at the beach. It's cute as long as the price is right and your expectations are set accordingly. [SEP] This is a cute choker, with a black string, which is adjustable for an inch or two. It features a cowrie shell as the pendant. I like the casual design of this jewelry. The cowrie shell has long been associated with the goddess, and is worn by women from Africa to the Pacific Islands to enhance fertility and to bring good luck and also protection. Some cultures believe it also brings wealth and prosperity. This particular necklace is wonderful for women of all ages. You do need to treat the shell with some care (as you would with mother of pearl and other natural products), as oil and some lotions may damage it.

Clasp secure, I wish some of these had bigger clasps though (in general).  One thing to be aware of..Unless you keep it clasped, pieces will slide off the end! [SEP] I think this necklace is overpriced, it was made from cheap materials and it made my skin red and itchy after wearing for a day. [SEP] I think this would be a really attractive necklace if I could fasten it.  The fastener isn't easy enough to use for a single person.  Perhaps this would work better with someone available to fasten it.  I've tried putting a bigger loop on the end, but the fastener piece doesn't open enough to be able to get around that.  Even worst, if this necklace is dropped like I have done, the pieces simply slide off and then have to be reassembled.  Of course, this gives some flexibility on how the pieces are arranged.  I like that this necklace comes in a pretty sheer bag that's tinted red with gold roses and leaves decorations as well as gold around the opening and on the slender drawstrings.  My rating is 2 stars simply because I cannot fasten it.  I've been working with this for a few days and it simply shouldn't be this hard. [SEP] The ISHVAKU Bohemian Beaded Necklace for Women and Girls in Blue Color is a cute boho costume necklace, but I felt it was a bit overpriced for what you get. It definitely has a handmade feel to it, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. Some of the pieces on it kind of seemed like things that were just picked up from around the house. Some of the plastic rings are pretty cheap, but the overall look is cute. This isn‚Äôt a piece that I expect to survive years of use.<br /><br />It can be hard to get on with the small clasp, so if you have trouble with that kind of thing, this might not be the necklace for you. All the pieces can be removed, which can be a plus or a minus. It‚Äôs not great if you drop the necklace with the clasp undone. If you want to remove some of the pieces or rearrange them, then it is great.<br /><br />It comes in a nice drawstring bag, which makes this necklace potentially giftable. The necklace has a nice boho vibe and I would have probably rated it higher if the price had been a bit lower. It didn‚Äôt quite meet my expectations, but I‚Äôm not totally unhappy with it. [SEP] I liked this necklace when I saw it in the picture, but in person, not so much.<br /><br />First, the chains that are hanging down are what first attracted me. However, with my necklace the chains are unevenly placed which makes it look kind of funny.<br /><br />Second, the cord that the beads and chains hang from is a bright blue and...almost yarn like and the yarns snags easily. If you look closely at the pictures on the left, specifically the last one, (up top, next to the item), you can see a snag in it.<br /><br />Lastly, if you accidentally drop it while trying to put it on, good luck, because everything slides off the necklace and all over the floor. There's no knot or anything to prevent that from happening. (However, this makes it easy for me to rearrange the chains that hang down, so that they look more even.)<br /><br />Overall, it's okay and I'll probably wear it, if I can get it on without dropping it. [SEP] This multiple chain dangled boho necklace is gorgeous! Mix of a variety of textures opened circles on a threaded necklace featuring 3 chain dangles. The necklace is soft, but sturdy enough to hold the bulky featured statement piece of the rings. I‚Äôm in love with this boho necklace! I was surprised that it isn‚Äôt awkward to wear. Stays put well and doesn‚Äôt get in my way.",3,True
WiliW Women's Ballet Dance Tights Footed 2 Pairs 40 Denier Black M/L,"['Polyamide', 'Tumble Dry']",[],,3.5,22,9702,"These tights were marked as adult but they're very small.  They seem to be thick and good quality, so if they do fit you it looks like you'd get good use out of them. [SEP] I love these dancing tights. Very great quality and is very thick. When they say 40 denier they mean it! The color is true black and in fact is pitch black. Have not washed it yet so not sure how it'll survive it. The waistband is a little too tight on me. However, it's not so bad. [SEP] I recommend these as long as you are able to get the appropriate size at a favorable price.  At the current price of $14.99, they are a reasonable buy (not a deal).<br /><br />Size: I received the XXL (Adult M/L).  They are much smaller than M/L; the fit is more like XS/S.  I am 5'4"", 110 lbs and they are snug at he waist (so they should stay put well).  I'm glad I didn't get the the next size down.<br /><br />Style:  These do not have a contoured foot as some tight do.  They also have a seam at the end of the toes, so expect to adjust it to avoid having it rub on the end of your toes.  The seam is soft, so this is not a big deal. [SEP] One star removed for sizing. Based on the sizing chart I should be a size XL, but I ordered 2XL because I tend to prefer a less tight fit to my tights. It is a good thing I sized myself up, because the 2XL was quite tight. I don't think anyone any larger than me would be likely to be able to get these on. I am 5'5"" with hips somewhere around 30"" ish. Aside from that, they are labelled as 40 denier, but feel like higher quality than that. The toe seam is a little uncomfortable and slides around a bit because the toe is not shaped at all - just like someone sewed a straight line across the bottom. There is way to identify the front from the back. They don't seem to get runs overly easily, so on that front I am pleased. I would definitely order a couple sizes up, but with the current list price I can definitely recommend these. [SEP] These tights come in a pair. They have a unique thickness that is also flexible. The size seems to run true but feels a litle tight in the waist. These offer very good support. Athough these are described as ballet tights, they work well with any skirts or dress. [SEP] I got these for my wife and she likes them. They fit very well and are comfortable. They are made of a combination of cotton and polyamide making them elastic as well as strong. The wait is pretty high  and elastic, making is easy to wear during ballet practice. [SEP] These run small. (M/L fits my size-0 teenage daughter). They are comfortable and soft, and she really likes how opaque they are. Nice, thick, very-black tights. [SEP] They seem like more like normal heavy duty tights to me. But they are great tights!  Opaque and perfect under dresses and skirts.  Sizing is about as expected. [SEP] These ballet tights have great elasticity and are made from good tight woven fabric, but the waist elastic band is extremely tight. Although I might have gotten A size smaller than my normal, I did was very uncomfortable in these tights after an hour due to how incredibly tight they grip around the stomach with very little give. I did enjoy the quality of the tight itself as they held well and without rip during multiple wears. [SEP] If you are an adult, these will be sized small. I got an XXL, which should have been an adult M/L, and there is no way these will ever fit my daughter, who wears an adult M-L in most clothing. She couldn‚Äôt even get them up her leg. These are really sized for children only. But if you‚Äôre getting these for a child, these are very nice dance tights.

I wear a size 5-5.5 USA Woman‚Äôs ring size and a size 5.5-6 USA Women‚Äôs shoe size. Most of the rings were too big for my fingers and toes. My fingers are slender.

I have some very disappointed Kindergartners!!

While they could have been lovingly hand-wrapped and individually packaged with hand-stripped excelsior within their own bespoke boxes... Nah--they're just foam, so I don't fault the company for smashing them together like subway passengers at 5:15 (a.m. or p.m., your call) into a teenie-weenie box that can fit into my pocket.<br /><br />I yanked these wee smashy wads of nasal mirth out of the box, ran them one-by-one under warm water, then squoze out the excess. You know, like the product information instructs us to. There was minor dye transfer onto the white paper towel that I rolled them in when drying them, but that's no surprise. Because the foam contains dye, right? This leeching was peculiar only because it was more of a pumpkin spice color than red. Is this what happens to pumpkin spice after Halloween is past--it's used to make clown noses? It didn't smell like pumpkin spice, so I'm doubtful. At any rate, now I need to wash my favorite white paper towel.<br /><br />Anyhoo, back to smell. I mention it because that's the sense I used when I plopped a reconstituted clown nose onto my huge schnoz (that's slang for a nose). Stuck my nose right up the giant slash they made for such things and it held on like a champ.<br /><br />I also used feel, which is another sense. It didn't feel good. It felt like foam digging into the sides of my nose. Having trained for years in the sciences, this is the feeling I had expected (dry foam + tender skin = irritation), and I nodded meaningfully as the empirical findings aligned with my extant bias.<br /><br />A final sensory exploration (using sight) revealed that it looked pretty goofy and I sent a selfie to my wife and we had a good laugh.

It's easy to spray it on then wait for it to dry. You may want a few coats for the absolute best protection. I like that this brand is American made. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] I'm really impressed bythis product. I was concerned that it might discolor the materials beingtreated, but have not seen that on anything.<br /><br />I started with some suede hiking boots... I followed the directions and applied in 2 coats, allowing them to dry overnight. When I returned the next day, water beaded up and rolled off the suede... and the suede itself remained soft and pliable.<br />Very nice.<br /><br />I followed that by treating a couple of nubuck and suede casual shoes... same great experience. Definitely recommended. [SEP] I have some hiking boots that need this product. Those boots must be 20 years old and I love them still. They have held up like you wouldn't believe. I am going to spray them well with this so that the suede doesn't get wet. I will also be using on my suede bags. [SEP] I like the fact that this protector has no smell and can be used indoors. Simply spray it on the shoes, let it dry, and it is all ready. It seems to work, too. [SEP] I pretty much liked everything about this suede protector...<br /><br />- Can be used more easily than traditional aerosol treatments because using indoors is an option<br />- Smell is light; fragrance reminds me of window cleaner<br />- Can sprays a fine mist that coats well, so it is easy to apply<br />- Made in the USA<br />- Amount in bottle was generous; coated my tall suede moccasins with lots to spare<br />- Appears effective in initial tests; I spritzed my boots (lightly) with water after treatment and it did bead up<br /><br />As someone who owns a lot of leather boots (they are my vice), I'm interested to see how well this product stands up to time, abuse, and bad weather.<br />No matter what, I'll definitely be finishing off this bottle soon and next time I have boots in need of a conditioner or water repellent, I would probably look for some more of this stuff. [SEP] I bought this since it was better rated on Amazon than the equivalent Kiwi product, which I have used before.  I applied it to a pair of light tan deerskin slippers, and, as expected, it made the slippers several shades darker when applied.  However, unlike the Kiwi product, the color did not return to normal after the product dried.  So now I have a pair of slippers several shades darker than they were originally.  That's not a major problem for me, but others might not like the result. [SEP] Works well. [SEP] I really liked this spray for my suede and Nubuck shoes, as it sprays lightly but evenly, so that you can get good covereage without discoloring the material.  This is very important when spraying any kind of protectant on shoes.  I've had some that sprayed too heavily and left dark spots.  This, does not.  I would repurchase for sure! [SEP] I got this specifically to treat seude handbags (lighter navy and dark brown) to help keep them stain free and looking new. This product did not discolored my bags, although my bags were of a darker color to start with. I did notice a slightly less soft/natural feel to the fine suede after spraying them. The seude bags I sprayed had a very low nap to begin with. The scent if the spray is not too noticeable and hopefully it will continue to dissapate. I have not had the chance to wear/use these because it is summer time, so I cannot attest to water repellent. I expect the product will greatly aid prevention of both stain and wear appearance.",3,True

The idea is that you wet the sponge/brush head of the bottle and then use the combination on the dirty shoe.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS WORK?<br />This can be used on the dirty soles of the shoes as well as leather, or textile shoes.  You slowly use the sponge/brush tip to slowly clean the shoe in a circular motion.  Once the shoe is entirely cleaned, then you wet a sponge and wipe the shoe clean.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This works beautifully on leather shoes (tough ones, not the soft porous leather types), but there was one pair of textile shoes it did not work on as well as I had hoped.  It still worked somewhat though.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />For a versatile shoe cleaner that does clean shoes well- especially leather- this is handy to have on hand.  It won't do tons of shoes though, so if you have a lot, you might want to get several of these.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This worked well on some shoes but not one textile pair I tried it on.  Also, the bottle is quite small, so having more on hand if you have a lot of shoes is important. [SEP] I have some leather work boots that I hate when they get too dirty. I own a landscaping company and so I go and meet with people, so while my shoes need to be capable of going in the dirt, they also need to look tidy enough that I am presentable for all of the meetings I attend.<br /><br />While sometimes my boots get dirty enough that they need more than a quick touch up, when all they need is a little bit of freshening, this shoe cleaner with a built-in brush really helps. It's great that I don't have to get out the whole shebang, and this is just a convenient way of applying a little bit of cleaner and giving things a good scrub. I really like the convenient form factor for people like me who get dirty frequently. My boots look just fine afterwards and ready for business. [SEP] I've been looking for a good shoe cleaner, and this thing is awesome. Used in on my dress Ecco shoes as well as my sneakers, and both it literally ""shined"" on. My sneakers has been pretty dirty due to some dust, and I'd not really worried about it for months on end. The Shoeboy took it off, and made them look like I just got them. I've been really impressed, and they've got a continued customer out of me. [SEP] I‚Äôve been wearing Reebok Princess shoes for decades in both the black and white, and take really good care of them. They are cleaned and polished regularly. The Shoeboy cleaner works great on them. I like that it doesn‚Äôt take much cleaner, so the bottle lasted a long time. The brush is great for cleaning the bottom and sides of the sole.<br /><br />Even though I like the product, it‚Äôs pricey, and there are other household cleaners that work just as well. I‚Äôm still giving it five stars because it does work, but, at that price, I won‚Äôt be buying it. [SEP] My kids have been very impressed by this shoe cleaner.  They are teenagers and are very much into their sneakers/trainers or whatever you want to call them.<br /><br />My daughter stepped into a ""hidden"" mud puddle when exiting the car the other day.  She went straight into the restaurant and rinsed her shoe off before any of the mud had a chance to set.  Then when she came home she tried this shoe cleaner and it cleaned the rest of her shoe right up.<br /><br />She also tried it on her white suede trainers, they had turned kinda grey, but reported that the improvement was minimal.<br /><br />One of the better things about the bottle design is that its easy to wash it without overdoing it.  When washing shoes you want to be minimalist.<br /><br />To make it work, you have to push down on the foam part in the center so that it will release some cleaner.<br /><br />Overall I think its a good product. [SEP] This shoe cleaner worked well restoring the finish on my waterproof slip-ons.<br /><br />The attached brush makes it convenient to use.<br /><br />Appreciate that it's environmentally friendly [SEP] I was about ready to give this product a one-star review, but read some of the other reviews and went back to try it again. I really had trouble getting the liquid out of the bottle into the sponge at the center of the cleaning brush. Once I got the liquid flowing into the sponge, I was able to apply it to the shoes. The directions on how to use this cleaning kit is minimal, and what it accomplishes is vague too, other than some sort of cleaning. You are warned not to use it on ‚Äòanaline leathers‚Äô, which are leathers dyed with water soluble analine dyes. Shoes can have analine dyes, but generally have a coating that helps protect the leather. So use this product carefully if you don‚Äôt know what kind of leather you‚Äôre dealing with. I used it on a pair of brown leather loafers, and could see a slight improvement in the appearance of the treated shoe. It looked cleaner and had a slight sheen (not shine) that the untreated shoe lacked. I did rinse the shoe under water per the instructions, and the water beaded off. I lightly buffed it with a dry cloth and it looked wear-able. However, it still needed some polish to get it looking great. I tried to use this on some leather deck shoes, and saw no improvement, and it didn‚Äôt work well removing scuffs on the sole. [SEP] My son likes to keep his shoes clean....takes after me in that regard.  I really ordered this for him.  It goes on easily, has a great built-in brush to scrub the dirt away, and it has not faded or negatively impacted the cloth area of the shoe.<br /><br />It really does a great job and I (we) do recommend it.  I have uploaded a couple of photos to give you an idea of its effectiveness.  If you like to get rid of dirt stains and improve the appearance of your shoes, this is a great choice.<br /><br />Hope our experience with it helped....thanks for reading!

Ldurian Blue Sky Cloud Resin Necklace Transparent Resin Rould Ball Pendant Necklace for Women,[],[],,3.9,170,2929,"Great gift idea for the graduate - or for holiday gifting.  This looks like real quality - will get a lot of attention and raves because it is so different.  Looks like a fine jewel pendant - should be a good gift for young adults through seniors.

It‚Äôs a clear blue with lots of cloud like shaped inside it. The chain is ok but I upgraded the chain to make it even better looking. It comes with a basic chain. [SEP] While I love the whimsical look of this necklace, it's not really something I'd wear after seeing it in person. It is cool looking, but it doesn't quite work as a necklace(at least for my style). The chain isn't my favorite and it has a cheap look/quality to it. It's not awful, either, though. With the style of the charm, it might look better on a different type of chain/ribbon/etc. I hated for such a cool piece to go to waste, so I've got it hanging from a dragon sculpture I have on my wall(next to a bookshelf). In my mind, I think of him trying the take over the world(the cloud charm), but he fails. I still think I'll keep on the search for something I like better to replace the chain, though. [SEP] This is actually a very pretty necklace that looks like clouds. It might also serve as an Earth necklace in a pinch. It‚Äôs light and pretty and comes with a standard chain, long enough for most necks. I do have to say this necklace does have a ‚Äúside‚Äù to it. One side truly looks like clouds, while the other kinda just looks like a styrofoam explosion. The ball is super light so it may feel cheap to some.

I knew she would live this necklace and she did. [SEP] Very cute little charm. [SEP] Would like if clouds moved around. They dont [SEP] This necklace is ok, but in person the resin looks much more like plastic than glass. And the white parts are fine, but they don't look like clouds. It does seem like an item that would vary with each piece, though.<br />Overall, this necklace is fine, but feels more like a toy than a piece of jewelry for an adult. [SEP] Very unique necklace for which I get a lot of compliments.  It looks like clouds in a water globe.  The chain is just ok.  The only downside is that the clip that holds the pendant to the chain is slightly open, so the pendant has fallen off a few times when I was taking the necklace off.  I don't think this will have a lot of longevity for that reason.  Still, I enjoy it.  Just a small little fun necklace.",3,True

The bracelet is really nice. Slips , or rather rolls, onto your wrist.  This fit over my left hand but not over the right. The color of this beautifully made bracelet is decidedly calmer than electric blue. Even lit by sunlight this blue jade sings a quieter song, yet compelling. Like Nina Simone. I like it and will keep it, and wear it often. [SEP] I absolutely love this bracelet it‚Äôs sturdy the beads are  a nice size.  The jade is not too dark or light or fake looking I love it.  Looks like I paid more for it. I stack them with my other bracelets. [SEP] Most of my other bracelet are glasslike but this one is kind of like plastic both around the same price value. [SEP] A very pretty and well made bracelet; however, it was a bit loose on my wrist.  Unlike other 'macrame' bracelets that I have, this one doesn't adjust to fit. Macrame' knots are very tightly woven so I'm not sure what its purpose is for. [SEP] Bought 2 for my fiance and me, the craftsmanship is excellent, the beads are nicely polished with no obvious flaws, and the strings to tighten or loosen are easy to use. Fits well on the wrist too. The only downside is how much noise the beads at the ends of the string make, but sometimes I actually enjoy the clicking. [SEP] Jesus [SEP] The color is so pretty.

Skull Cycling Cap Helmet Liner with Ear Covers - Winter Windproof Hat Outdoor Sports Running Skiing Bike Cycling Cap Gray,"['Elastic', 'Elastic closure', 'Hand Wash Only']",[],,4.1,34,26408,"It‚Äôs a little too thick. Almost need to have a second, larger, helmet to be comfortable and practical. Does a decent job of helping my head to be warm when riding in cold(er) weather. Seems to be well made. I do like that this design extends lower over my ears as that really makes a difference in the warmth. [SEP] If you are an eBiker, you will enjoy this cap. It keeps you head warm in the winter and also keeps your AirPod secure. I list my few of my AirPod while riding eBike with wearing this cap. The AirPod just fell off. This cap secure them in place and also warm your head, this kill two birds with one stone, you know what I meant. [SEP] This worked well while riding.  It‚Äôs thick enough to keep out the wind.  It covers ears and back of neck.  I was riding in 42¬∞F (6¬∞C) with winds up to 20mph (32kph). [SEP] This is great for inside a bike or ski helmet. Keeps my head nice and warm. It fits quite well, but honestly took me a little while to figure out where to place this on my head. Machine washable and easily fits in a pocket. [SEP] I love zooming around on my electric scooter. Unfortunately, here in Seattle the weather is pretty cold these days, so this under-helmet cap seemed to be the right thing to solve my reasonably hairless noggin getting the chills.<br /><br />The problem is that this is a one-size-fits-all cap. And, as is often the case, that means one size won't always fit *you*. On this occasion, it actually works less well than the last cap I tried, - it doesn't sit low enough to cover my ears fully, and after a little scootering around it will often ride up my head a little, leaving my ears fully exposed. Boo!<br /><br />It's a reasonably warm cap (though certainly not for Midwest climes in the dead of winter), but the ear issues render it a no-go for me. Shame.<br /><br />2.5 out of 5. Not for me. [SEP] I got this for riding on those crisp winter mornings, which in California are in the 45-55 degree range. It works to keep the head from getting too chilly, and it fits under the helmet better than a typical cycling cap. It also extends over the ears which is very nice.<br /><br />If you're riding in the dead of winter in Minnesota, this won't be enough. But for warmer locations or in the autumn and spring, this is a really helpful bit of kit. Oh, and it packs up small for when it warms up. [SEP] For riding in the winter I wanted a skullcap to go under my bike helmet but I just didn't like what I was seeing in the marketplace because they all seemed to be too thick to fit comfortably under my helmet.  Not this.  Perfect!  Very warm and it stays in place!  Bear in mind, it really is warm and it will make you toasty warm! [SEP] This helmet liner is perfect for colder day bike riding. It is thin so it fits nicely inside the helmet with just very minor amusement of the helmet. The material is comfy with a nice snug fit. The area around the ears is super comfortable with two holes so your glasses can fit through. The front hangs down just enough for the helmet to fit over. Very nicely designed and made. Well stitching and tailoring. Should be durable. Quality all the way. [SEP] Great fit",3,True
accsa Women Fedora Straw Bucket Hat Travel Carry Foldable Summer Sunhat Tan,['Machine Wash'],[],,4.0,22,7959,"This is such a great, versatile hat!  First, it is soft and pack-able.  Second, it easily springs back to shape and is actually shape-able - the edge of the rim is wired, so you can adjust the rim to go up, down, or in any direction you like!  The hat is also completely adjustable, with a little ribbon inside to customize the fit to your head.  The open weave design definitely kept my head cooler than other hats I have tried.  Also, it looks really cute!  The hat was perfect on my recent trip to Memphis; I highly recommend it. [SEP] This kind of looks like a hat my grandmother used to wear, but she had good taste in hats and it looked so cute on her.  I like this hat a lot, it feels comfortable on my head and I can bend it to sort of get it into the shape I want.  It looks kind of like it's had a hard life already by it's natural shape, so it looks best with casual wear - jean shorts, sundresses, etc...  I like how air can circulate through it help keep my head from getting hot. [SEP] I put a 2 star review because the hat is very cute but very small. I have a normal sized head and this won't fit....it wouldn't even fit my tweens head. I'd keep looking if I were you [SEP] The hat is uniquely made so that you can fold it up to carry in your purse or backpack and when you need it to unfold it and put it on without messing up its shape. Material is strong is made well. I love the subdued color of a cross between a light brown and dusty rose. The design is stylish and very attractive. A head turner. [SEP] The brim is smaller than I expected but it‚Äôs cute.<br />The color is just as pictured and it is foldable. It doesn‚Äôt get damaged despite being in a backpack for a while [SEP] This hat is super cute! It has a slightly floppy look (in a good way), and the color will make it easy to match with a lot of outfits. I have a lot of hair, and this hat doesn‚Äôt fit me especially well, but works great for my straight-haired daughter. Something to keep in mind if you have curly hair like me. The tie around the band makes the tightness adjustable, but only so much. This will be an excellent summer hat, with good coverage, and built in sun protection. [SEP] The best part of this cute hat is that it is packable. This makes it so easy to take on a trip or to the beach for the day. I live in the sunshine state so sun hats are a necessity here. Even though the hat has UPF protection it also has holes. The sun peeks in the holes so there is not as much protection as desired. The color and style are very attractive but add sunscreen for total protection. [SEP] This was the perfect hat for my cruise. You can fold it up and it will bend back however you want it to. [SEP] I absolutely love this hat!  I live in Florida and so we get sun and humidity so hats are a must. The hat is very lightweight but it doesn't feel cheap at all. It fits nicely on the head and is really cute. A very versatile and easy to pack hat--great for travel and relaxing days at the beach.  5 stars!! [SEP] Very cool feature of this hat is that is has wire on the brim to help keep its shape and reshape it. Also has a string inside to adjust it for smaller heads.

NCCB Womens Slippers Size 9 Memory Foam Warm Slip On House Slippers Nonslip Family Indoor Slippers Black,['Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate lining'],[],,4.6,24,7120,"These comfortable house slippers have a slip resistant bottom with good traction for any home surface, and because they are rubberized, you can always go out and grab the mail with them. The memory foam feels great, cushioning every step, and it‚Äôs thick enough that it should last a reasonable amount of time. See photo! [SEP] These slippers are true to size and super comfortable. The memory foam sole feels delicious on my feet. Truly my only complaint with these is they look very masculine, like I‚Äôm wearing my husbands slippers. Otherwise, I highly recommend these. [SEP] Well, they're not the most attractive slippers I've ever seen, but they're comfortable enough for wearing around the house (I wouldn't take these outside with the dog, though) and they seem like they will be plenty warm in the winter. There is not arch support to speak of, but the padding feels good between my feet and the wooden floor. I'm a size 9 and it took a solid day of wearing for my foot to find its place in the slipper and not slide out the open back. I received these through the Vine program and at the time of writing this review, there is no price associated with these, so I am not comfortable leaving five stars. They're comfortable, though, and if you don't mind the frumpy look they're decent light duty slippers. I wouldn't pay more than $20 on the high end for them, though. [SEP] These are fairly well made, even for a womens 9 they are fairly wide, and the memory foam seems to be nice.  I'm not sure about overall support, they are good, but not for side support (which I would have needed if they fit).  I do think they would not have been as bad as the trial and error sandals I keep trying for.  I have neuropathy, so I have to be careful walking, and I can't wear normal shoes.  To many types, crocs, sandals, etc are too easy for me to step out of, and trip when they hit a seam, rug, or slippery area.  These may have worked if they'd been a mens size.  I'm giving to a female friend who should be able to find someone to wear them.  Recommended, for the right sized person. (Female 9, not male). [SEP] NCCB Womens Slippers Memory Foam Warm Slip On House Slippers Nonslip Family Indoor Slippers<br /><br />Very minor complaints as far as quality control. I did notice on the front of tip on one of the slippers a little bunch up of the material where the stitching could have been better. That's really my only complaint. They are accurate to size, and fairly sturdy material for wearing around the house. Cute design and good grip on the bottom. The biggest thing is comfort and they are very comfortable vs walking around the house barefoot. I recommend it, get a pair. [SEP] nice quality but they do run a bit small I would go up a size from what you normally wear. What I like about them is the bottom sole its thick when I walk I don't feel my foot sliding side to side. The fabric is pretty sturdy and comfortable. [SEP] I ordered these house slippers for my wife. She normally wears an 8.5 wide, so I ordered these in size 9. They fit her perfectly. She says these slippers are very soft and comfortable with their memory foam cushioning. They are very easy to slide on and off, which helps with those sleepy, middle of the night trips to the bathroom that inevitably are a part of life for many ladies of advancing years. The slippers are very warm, which will be nice when temperatures drop outside and our floors inside the house get a bit colder as well. The black color with the black, white, red, and gray trim looks good. The non-slip sole is a nice safety feature. These slippers seem to be very well made, with nice tight seams and soles that are firmly attached. I think they are a good value at the current list price of $18.95, and I would consider them very giftable. [SEP] I wear a size 9 shoe.  I got these in size 9 and they fit perfectly.  My foot measures 10"".  The heels are low and helps hold your foot in when you walk.  It does tend to flop a little when I walk.  But it is because it's a slip on.  You just slip your foot in easily without any effort.  The plaid is a flannel type print.  The main body of the shoe is solid black in similar fabric.  The inside is super soft!  It's padded fleece on the insole.  The sole is a textured rubber for non-slip.  They are cute and warm.",3,True
"Ace Women's Running Socks, Small/Medium","['Nylon', 'Machine Wash']",[],,3.5,28,3598,"These socks were all right for my jogging/biking work out - they helped a bit by giving some compression to my calves (were a bit snug, and I'm a size 7-7.5) and sometimes can ache a bit from the workout. Not quite so comfortable around the feet, and they do take a little effort pulling on and off. Would also like just a plain sock, if possible, so I don't have to worry about what I'm wearing that day (not like I'm dressing up to work out, but if I'm wearing shorts, I don't want to look that odd). Considering that these are small/medium, I wonder if there might be sizing issues for some people - it would be better if there were just two different sizes available. All in all, these were decent but not amazing. [SEP] The Ace running socks are bright and colorful. They make a bold statement for my feet! The first time I wore them, I thought they would be way too tight, but they were actually quite comfortable. They were snug, but did not cut off circulation to my legs as some socks do. The top band is soft and not too elastic-y. They are very warm and cozy. I fear that they are a type of fabric that may snag easily, but so far so good! [SEP] These socks fit excellent on the calves (they end just below the knee).  They do not shift or fall while wearing.  They are nice in the winter, adding extra warmth & help reduce muscle spasms thanks to the compression.  There are a few things I don't like though.  I wear a size 7 sneaker.  The foot part of the sock is a tad too big, so they don't provide any support to my feet, my main desire on the foot is arch support/compression which I see is in the sock, but simply isn't small/tight enough for my feet.  There is cushioning added to the top of the foot/ankle area but the back of the heel needs something more.  I'm not blistering, but it isn't as comfortable as other running socks.  The seam in the toes rubbed on my left foot which became uncomfortable over time.  I have a problem with my left foot & the seam in nearly every pair of socks, so the issue might be the shape of my foot rather than the fault of the sock so I'm not knocking down the rating for it.  Overall I do like the socks.  They are a bit of a struggle to get on & off but the extra support & warmth is worth it.  I just wish they fit my foot as well as they fit my calf. [SEP] The workout comes when you try to take off these socks!  I don't have too much trouble getting them on, but they are not easy to get off, especially with my rough heels.  I had to wear thigh-high compression stockings in the past for a period of time, and I thought those were easier to get on and off.<br /><br />Assuming you are more adept than I, you probably won't have as much trouble.  These really do make my calves feel good.  I don't run very far, but I do walk and hike a lot, and these socks help.  My legs are not as tired after a long walk.<br /><br />Where I live, these are winter socks unless I am having an unusual issue and really need the extra compression.  They are warm enough that they won't be as comfortable in the hot summers.<br /><br />I was impressed with the upper band.  It didn't roll or pinch or move at all, just stayed where I put it, a bit below my knee.  The seam near the toe is a bit bumpy on the end, as with many socks, and I had to adjust them a little to make them comfortable in my running shoes.  Part of the issue might be that these felt just a little big on me.  I usually wear a size 7 women's shoe, and this size is supposed to go to size 7.5.  I think it would be better if small, medium, large, and extra large sizes were offered rather than small/medium and large/extra large.  I'm sure that would be more expensive, and with regular socks the two sizes wouldn't be a problem.  However, with this design, fit is important, and I think the sizes are just too limited.<br /><br />These do just fine with a regular trip through the washer and dryer.  I don't know if bleach is acceptable but I would avoid it because I'm afraid it could hurt the compression capabilities.<br /><br />Now, you aren't going to wear these under short pants unless you are going to an ugly sock party.  While I do like the way they make my legs feel, I can't say they are pretty.  I think the gray and the bright blue are to emphasize the different areas of compression, but they are a bit on the gaudy side.  Yep, definitely winter socks for me. [SEP] Very comfortable.  I enjoy wearing them - they offer just the right amount of pressure.  They are a little difficult to put on because they do offer pressure once on.  They aren't stylish, but I usually wear pants, so that's not a problem for me.  I would buy again. [SEP] These socks really feel good. They went on easily. I love the fact that there's lots of 'wiggle-room' in the toe area. I don't usually have trouble with leg aches, but it seems like these would be really great if you did.  The extra padding is excellent and I like the blue and white design. [SEP] These socks are purely functional anf are exactly as described. I wear a 7.5 women's shoe and the s/m fit perfectly. The socks are knee high on me and the compression is comfortable and warm. By the time I returned from a 35 minute walk in 70 degree heat my feet were very warm. After laundering they held their shape and were ready to wear. I plan to use these under boots since they really are not pretty, a huge ACE logo runs across the top of the foot part of the sock and is visible in non traditional sneakers. If shin splints or cramping are your running problem in cool or cold weather these socks will serve you well. [SEP] I've never tried compression socks before, but thought they might be helpful hiking with a bad ankle. I hurt my ankle pretty bad in college, and it's just never been the same. I am extra careful with it when hiking and exercising. I was very happy with the support it gave my ankle as well as how &#34;less-tired&#34; my feet and legs were after walking all day.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with them and will pick up a few more pairs. They are comfortable, even if they aren't super stylish. [SEP] At first I thought I wasn't going to like these socks. They have that old acrylic feel to them which I think is kind of scratchy and stiff. I think the design is kind of ugly and I am not a fan of the busy colored styling. I am used to wearing compression hose and socks since having spinal fusion surgery and developing severe DVT in my leg after surgery. I wear a &#34;professional&#34; thigh high hose on my right leg and a knee high compression sock on my right lower leg. I typically wear Sockwell brand knee high compression socks on my right lower leg which I bought on Amazon. I LOVE the Sockwell brand and eventually bought 7 pairs. They are the most comfortable socks (the Sockwell brand) that I have ever worn. Once they are on, I totally forget they are compression socks and they feel heavenly all day long. These Ace socks in my opinion run quite large. I wear a women's size 9 and the pair of Ace socks I received to review were sm/md 5.5-7.5 shoe size. They fit fine, even in the foot length. The socks are huge in comparison to my Sockwell socks and these Ace socks did not feel like they would have the same compression fit and feel. Once on, however, I liked them and they have felt good all day long. They don't feel scratchy at all and they are so snug that it is very difficult for me to pinch the sock off my leg, just like my Sockwell socks. The Ace socks are a bit loose and baggy on my foot though. I still think the Ace socks are ugly and I don't like the large &#34;ACE tm&#34; on the top of the foot by the toes. I think they look tacky. I will stick with my Sockwell compression socks. [SEP] Nice athletic socks that seem to be cushy in all the right places.  I was a little surprised to see how wide they are at the top, and how tall they are.  They are contoured to fit over your calf and end just under the knee.  Not exactly sure why they are so tall, but maybe they are for outdoor use?  My wife is 5'7&#34; with size 7.5 shoes and they work just fine.  The bottom of the sock is more cushioned than the top, which is made out of a thinner mesh.  The gray areas seem slightly more elasticized, and the sock does seem to have a few compression areas in the midfoot.  However,  unlike some &#34;running&#34; socks,  they are easy to put on and comfortable .  They have held up pretty well in the wash.<br /><br />Shoe size: S/M: 5.5 - 7.5‚Äé<br />Shoe size: L/XL: 8 - 10.5‚Äé",3,True

The jade is really pretty and it is well cut, so it is good quality. I gave one to my mom so we match. My only complaint is how short the string is, you have to actually take your mirror off to get it on. [SEP] This is a nice set of two pendants.

"Charis Allure Women's Short Sleeve Dress Loose T Shirt Long Dress with Split,Black,M",['Pull On closure'],[],,2.5,10,7167,"A challenge as a designer is going from concept to execution and then editing or changing as needed. Whoever designed this skipped the editing step. I get the concept, and it‚Äôs not bad. The execution was a mess, however, and the weird flap at the side HAS to go. This looks terrible, and all it needed to be fixed was to remove the flap or make it bigger so it looked deliberate, but as it is, this is a visual skin tag in fabric, a weird flap that limply hangs there, looking like an accident or mistake instead of a design choice.<br />Looks like I have a new pajama that will never see the light of day. Yikes. So bad. [SEP] This was all kinds of awful. It not only didn't fit right but was misshapen with one side sticking out in the middle. Gah! It didn't look anything like the picture and was way too roomy in the chest. Stitching was shoddy. It was a hot mess of a dress. I do not recommend it. [SEP] This dress needs something to make it work.  The material is very soft and the black is a nice deep black, but the styling is not what it should be.  The slit in the front should be in the back or side, and the way it hangs is kind of baggy.  I doubt I will be wearing this dress anywhere and it probably will hit the donation bag before too long. [SEP] I'm not sure how I feel about this. It's an odd design. There's like this knotted/bunched area near the waist that you can't really see in the picture. As well as the little slight and uneven hem. However, it's an extremely breathable, stretchy knit fabric. It's weird at first glance, but still a comfy, casual dress. It doesn't seem fair to low-ball the rating just because the design is a bit different. I think paired with some nice sneakers, I could probably pull this off. Not what I expected, but not bad. [SEP] This dress is pretty well made, fabric is good quality, not flimsy, but I don't like the style!<br />Actually in picture looks a lot better than in person, probably because it runs very big.",3,True

It looks fragile, but I feel like it‚Äôs stronger than that since I‚Äôve slept with it on accidentally and it was fine.<br />This necklace is also really great for layering. I wore it once with another longer rose gold necklace and it made for a stylish look. This would be a really good gift for girlfriend, wife, sister, mother anyone you‚Äôre struggling to know what to get for them.<br />Another plus is how adjustable it is. I like to wear it shorter, closer to my neck with longer one under it so I love how short I can make this one.<br />Great little necklace! [SEP] I really like this necklace. The thing that I like most about it is the beautiful charms of the heart and the key. I've found that many necklaces with a key charm are very minimalist, to the point that I don't think there's even a point to wear them since the charm, and even the chain itself, would be lost on the skin unless someone was one foot away and looking for it. This necklace has just enough presence for someone to be aware of it, but doesn't draw any undue attention to itself.<br /><br />The chain is decent It's not boxy looking, and it doesn't look cheap. It also seems relatively sturdy for a chain that's so dainty (though I wouldn't want to pull or put any stress on it).<br /><br />All in all, I consider this a lovely necklace for daily wear. It's well made and very sweet. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:420cdc59d2cb1802558ab0ebb5e89b6c]] This Rose Gold Heart & Key Necklace sure is Pretty! I love the Stone in the Key!

The charm is perfect for Valentine's Day of a small just because gift. I did feel the chain that came with the necklace was a bit on the thin side. I have long hair that sometimes tangles in the chain, and I worry it may break. I will be swapping out the chain for something more durable. As far as presentation, the gift box was nice and this would be well received. [SEP] The necklace is very cute with heart and key shape. The little fake Dimond in the key is shining. The only cons is if you purchase this as a gift, you may need to prepare a separate gift box since the package is very simple. Overall, the necklace fits the product description and I'm happy with this experience. [SEP] Purchased this for my daughter.  She absolutely loved it.  Nothing very fancy but she loves necklaces and for the price, this was perfect. [SEP] This is cute, dainty, but had enough presence that it is worth wearing.

Perfect for yoga, or ballet barre, minus any moves that require less traction, of course. [SEP] These are really good quality Yoga socks with grips on the bottom.  They're soft and durable and really stick to the floor when walking in them.  I washed them in the regular laundry cycle and they came out of the dryer looking brand new with no noticeable shrinking or fading. [SEP] I'm not going to lie, I typically exercise bare footed.  But when it's chilly I wear socks....and then I wrestle through not sliding on planks or wall squats, etc for way longer than I should before ripping them off and tossing them away to go bare (and cold) footed.  These seemed perfect BUT would they be, I am slightly picky about socks.<br /><br />These are perfect.  They are thick enough to be sturdy yet still very flexible so they don't feel restrictive.  The toe seem isn't prominent so doesn't bother me when doing plank work.  The non skid bottom is full coverage so works great to keep you from sliding.  It is smooth though so doesn't dig in or cause any pressure points.  It is thick enough to be sturdy (I may have even run to the mailbox in them).  The fit is on par as well.  I have solved my cold toe problem. [SEP] These Giotto non-slip socks have the best grip of any socks I‚Äôve ever owned!  Fabulous!  These are great for yoga and also great for anyone who is trying to maintain balance on a slippery surface. This is also excellent for elderly patients to keep them from falling. I highly recommend this sucks! See my pictures for additional information. [SEP] These socks are perfect! I like to practice yoga inside of my wood floors and these give me a great grip on the floor and to my mat. 3 pairs come in each pack. I typically wear a women‚Äôs size 9 and 1/2 in sneakers and these socks fit me true to size. What I love the most is the fun colors. I will definitely be buying more in the future. [SEP] First, let me start off by letting you know that I am part of the Amazon Vine Program so Amazon did send this product out to me for review. The Giotto Women's no slip yoga sock are great. They come in great colors, they are super comfy. The socks slide on very easy, they kinda feel like they just wrap around your foot. After putting them on they feel like you have on a pair slippers, they are not tight around the ankles but not too loose. The Grip on the bottom is super grippy even running your hand of the bottom it grips to your hand so, on the floor it really sticks. They feel super lite weighted when wearing them but your feet feels really protected, I even wear these with my tennis shoes and they still feel great. Overall, I love these Yoga sock.

[SEP] The grips are good so you don't slip and fall in the kitchen or bathroom, or if you have hardwood floors. It is nice to get three pairs for one price. Easy to wash, but they do shrink a bit and you have to stretch them back out. [SEP] These beat the heck out of those non slip socks given at hospitals. The have excellent rubber on the soles for gripping floors and have a nice, snug fit around the arch. I would caution if you have thick ankles these may be uncomfortable as the opening is pretty tight to prevent them coming off easily. [SEP] These are nice looking socks that have a grip design on the bottom that is good for yoga and other activities where you wish to avoid slipping. The material is comfortable and not overly thin, so it should hold up fairly well. This pack includes a few different colors, and could fit women's sizes or smaller men's sizes.",3,True

It is comfortable, accurate and the timer works well.<br />Not buried with many functions, this is easy to use. [SEP] This is an elegant looking watch. The gold plated frame and digits contrast really well with the obsidian background and black leather band. The classic style accentuates the watch. As a result, this watch can be worn to formal events. Just my personal preference but a metal band would have been better. Many people probably like the black leather band as is.  The watch has a certain heft to it so you definitely know you are wearing a watch. [SEP] The image I saw when ordering this made it appear more silver than gold. Upon opening it I was pleasantly surprised and frankly wowed. The images do not do it justice. The color is close to rose gold and is a lot nicer in person than a picture can convey. I‚Äôve enclosed a better image which more realistically reflects the wow factor of this watch.<br /><br />It has has great attention to detail with great quality and an overall design that makes it very legible.

The black and rose gold are great together, the hands and dials are very well done and clean.  I like the weight of it as well. Overall the case is great, hard to say of the quality within but for pure aesthetics alone, it matches expensive watches. The crown and pushers work well and aren't hard to use.<br /><br />On to the meh. The band leather came dry and stiff, not very ergonomic (probably faux leather or the like). It also doesn't have a very good size for someone with skinny wrists like me, I have to push it up maybe 2 inches up my arm to be in a secure place.  The band straps to hold the excess aren't very good either, they're too loose and with the strap being short as is, the movable one is almost unnecessary without pulling it to the last hole.<br /><br />I set the watch a minute fast to test it over the last week. It since has lost about a minute of time moving to being nearly on point with my phone and computer so, that shows the precision of the inside workings. In the little pamphlet it comes with there's a segment talking about the time error being anywhere from -20 to +50 seconds which shows the quality of the watch as well. I have to say, this watch ticks really Loung, easily the loudest watch I have. During the day and walking around it‚Äôs no problem but if you are in a dead silent room, sleeping or whatever, you can hear this watch from a significant distance away. To mitigate this I place it either on the little pillow it comes with lol or lay it on something sound absorbing like a jacket. If loud watches bother you, you may want to avoid this.<br /><br />An lastly, the watch arrived with two nicks on it, shown it the pictures. One on the buckle and one on the band close to the lugs.<br /><br />Overall, for price I think it's a good watch, great for someone that would like the look and not be scared to wear it for fear of damaging something expensive. [SEP] This is a very attractive watch, good for everyday wear.  The watch face is very nice, with 3 chronographs in addition to the clock face and the leather band adds some style and durability.<br />My husband loves this watch.

Overall, this is a nice piece that is very reasonably priced! [SEP] This is such a beautiful necklace. The pendant is a little bit larger than I was expecting, which is actually a good thing because I feel like you can actually tell what the design is supposed to be when wearing it. It‚Äôs sparkly and adds a nice touch to any outfit, especially around Christmas time. The length is fairly short, which I like, but you can easily swap out the chain for a longer one if you prefer.

I would recommend this, especially to women who love animals or who love the outdoors! It Would make a very unique gift! [SEP] I really liked the design of the necklace when I saw it, but was unsure how it would look in person. I was honestly worrying that it would look cheap and be ungiftable. However, I was very surprised by the quality. It looks great and there aren't any imperfections that would belie what you see in the description images.<br /><br />I will however say that I was surprised by how big the middle stone was, despite having seen all of the images presented in the description. It's not a bad thing though, it still looks good. It's a bit too big for my style, but I'm sure other people would be fine with it.<br /><br />The only thing I was not happy with was the box for the necklace. It's cardboard/paper, which was fine. However, a sticker was stuck to it and it was impossible to take off without ruining it. So, if you wanted to give this as a gift, you'd have to be okay with the ugly sticker or you'd have to have a back up box or bag for it. [SEP] This is cute.  The chain is short but not choker short and has a crab claw style clasp.  I didn't get tarnish marks from wearing.  The pendent portion is good size and very eye catching.  Overall, its cute and for me a fun/whimsical nod to the holiday's / winter. [SEP] This Glitziest Deer Horn Zircon Necklace is a cute, dainty necklace with a very shiny glitter, due to the zircon and the design. Altogether just a really nice costume jewelry piece that is a classy touch to an outfit. Very pleased.<br /><br />As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart.

The four pack includes a pretty purple and an amusing white with pink fingertips. The purple ones have a light cotton lining while the white ones are unlined. All for pairs fit well and have textured palms and fingers. They are versatile and durable. [SEP] think these latex-free gloves are every bit as good as name brand latex gloves. They are also prettier with the lace imprint going around the bottom of the gloves. I have worn regular latex gloves a lot, especially when making my hand made soaps but I will be wearing these from now on. I don't think I'm allergic to latex but I used to get some horrible zits after going to the dentist so maybe I am. These latex-free gloves feel flexible yet seem durable to last a good while. [SEP] These are really comfortable gloves. They keep hands nice and dry, the are sturdy and last. And they are super easy to get on and off. They keep my fingers and palms from getting dry and irritated. [SEP] Comfortable, durable, pretty set. They keep my hand dry and clean while cleaning and I want at an apartment complex cleaning out some extremely dirty aparments. These worked perfectly for me and are just what I needed. [SEP] I‚Äôve reviewed a few of these packs of gloves. They are all pretty much the same and I don‚Äôt have much new to add to my review exceptto say that if you are going to order these, you might as well order the 4 pack. It‚Äôs a better value.<br /><br />These are nice gloves! They run small. They kept me dry while washing dishes, and protected my skin when cleaning with chemicals.<br /><br />My only complaint is that when I needed to take the plain gloves off quickly to do something with my hand (for example putting clean dishes away) they were pretty well suctioned to my hand and difficult to remove. Otherwise a great value. [SEP] Love these soft lined gloves that provide your hands with great protection.  The nice colors also provide some flair while wearing these gloves.  The interior feels really nice on the hands and the rubber is well made and of good quality. [SEP] These Pacific PPE 2 Pack Household Gloves are comfortable and fit well.  One pair of gloves is purple, the other is white with pink fingertips.  They are lightly lined so they slip on easily.  They are thick enough to be comfortable while doing household tasks but thin enough to feel control with whatever utensils I'm using. Enjoy! [SEP] These can just in time üò≠<br /><br />I had a plumbing emergency and these gloves saved me from having to get my hands dirty. Literally. I like to get large because they will go up higher on my arms and fit looser in general. Anyway. Great pair of rubber gloves. [SEP] My wife loves the look of the gloves.  She uses them whenever she cleans in chemicals. To add more moisture to her hands, she applies lotion to her hands before putting them on. These gloves are comfortable and sturdy for housekeeping. For gardening, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them. They will tear although they are thick however, not think enough for the garden. They also will make your hands sweat. As I stated these are great for housekeeping duties.  When my wife is finished using them, she keeps them on, washes them as if she is washing her hands as normal and just drapes them over the faucet to quickly dry.",3,True

The length of the scarves is perfect length I'm not on to wear everyday when I do I like them not to be too short. Only thing I didn't realize was one scarf was Skelton heads and those are not my preference. So other than that I enjoyed them so far.

Largest section is suede, front pocket plain pleather and the cream band is crosshatched. Seems like a lot, but the coloring pulls them together. I definitely like the shape of it and it‚Äôs stitched extremely well. If not for the gold accents I would like this better. The gold chain, zipper and front plate just bring down the quality and style.<br /><br />It does come with a garment bag, but it‚Äôs a bit smelly. [SEP] This is a great bag! It‚Äôs a nice suede, beige color and I love the gold chain detail on the shoulder strap. I usually rock a large tote bag, because I carry my whole life in my purse. This is on the smaller side for me but it‚Äôs roomy enough to fit most of my stuff. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the front pocket detailing, because I can throw my keys, work badge, charger etc. in it without doing the great purse dive. Overall, a really nice bag made with quality materials. It‚Äôs in a nice, neutral tone, so it goes with pretty much anything. [SEP] Great purse. Beautiful color and materials. Roomy with a zipper closure along the top. Very important to me. Love it. [SEP] This is a great bag, good size to carry all my stuff. Like the design.<br />Good quality bag. [SEP] It‚Äôs an nice fashion bag but not the best quality. It‚Äôs kind of along the lines of what you might expect to buy at an H&M or Forever21. I think it looks better in the seller‚Äôs photo than in person though I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on why or what‚Äôs different. Maybe because in person it‚Äôs just easier to discern that it‚Äôs not a high quality bag. The construction seems sturdy but a bit heavy handed, the hardware is too light and looks/feels cheap. Probably something I‚Äôd quite happily carry in my late teens or early twenties. [SEP] Very soft, suede-like material. Fits very comfortably around shoulder, has much room in the main compartment and zipper pockets as well as open ones on the inside. I got this one for my mother-in-law and she loves it. She did get it dirty on an outing but it brushed right out thankfully. I would recommend using something like scotch guard to protect it since it is so light in color though. Truly a beautiful, stylish and functional bag! Priced just right. I would definitely recommend it.",3,True

It came with protective film on both sides and arrived in perfect condition. I rated 4 stars because I just dont see myself paying almost $12 for a key chain. [SEP] My wife loves Pineapples and already had a canvas with the same saying, So I had to get her this keychain. The keychain is small and not heavy. It was exactly what we expected and also comes in a small box that is perfect to give as a gift. [SEP] You can't put more than 1 or 2 keys on this little key ring.  Putting even those two keys on this keychain is quite the effort.  I had to use something durable like a letter opener to pry it open and add the keys.<br />Shows fingerprints and this immediately detracts from the appeal.<br />Other than that it is well made and should last a long time.

The material is thin, but doesn't look cheap. There's a side zip, but I just put the dress on over my head. There's enough stretch to do so. This dress really enhanced my curves and I'd pretty much buy it in every color just for that reason. The pictures speak for themselves. If you have a similar shape, you need this dress!<br /><br />For fit reference, I'm 5'6"", 153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the large. [SEP] It fits perfectly well, and for me (5'5"") it crosses the knee line. I wore it for a job interview, and I got the job, so I'm going to say it looks perfectly professional. Of course, that might unfairly prejudice me in favor of the dress, but so it is. It's easy to clean. I just throw it in the laundry machine. I'm way too cheap for dry cleaning. I can fold it or hang it and have no problems either way. For the non-fashionista who wants a conservative, professional looking dress, this is great. [SEP] I ordered this in a medium. It fit as I expected it to. The dress is definitely designed for someone with curves and looks pretty good on. The downside is that color isn't nearly as bright as what is shown in the images and appears more faded. Overall, I like the dress. It is comfortable and flattering. [SEP] The color is vibrant and the dress looks nice on. [SEP] Fashion wise it is very good dress. Unfortunately it is too small for my wife to clearly have opinion on how good it sits. Fabric is very good and soft. Has zipper on the side to easy wear.

The heart charm has the word ‚ÄúCousins‚Äù nicely engraved on it. This comes in a velvety drawstring pouch, inside of a gift box. This would make a sweet and sentimental gift for a cousin.

Its light weight [SEP] Beautiful bracelet that your cousin will love! [SEP] I gifted this to my niece. I like that the bracelet is adjustable using the clasp and chain. The heart will then hang more, the tighter it is adjusted. The look of the bracelet is nice and modern. The word ‚ÄúCousins‚Äù is not engraved, it‚Äôs just a sticker, so I‚Äôm unsure how long it will hold up.

It‚Äôs not too delicate but strong. It‚Äôs simple and cute. [SEP] The phrase that ""family is not an important thing, it is everything"" makes a lot of sense.

Orchid Row Women's Fashion and Trendy Mod Style Flower Design Faux Fur Neckwear Scarf Shawl Premium Quality Fur,[],[],,3.6,21,9529,"I really like this faux fur neckwear.  It's dummy proof and that'svery appealing to me. All I have to do is push one end through the slot on the other end and voila! it's perfectly placed around my neck.  And it's very soft and doesn't go far down in that the length when wearing doesn't even come close to my legs as some scarves do.  I love wearing it and look forward to colder days this winter so I can wear it more often.  The black and white colors are lovely. [SEP] I wore this recently for an outdoor evening event and it was perfect.  It has a nice cute style and went perfectly with my black pea coat.  I think it added a nice feminine touch.  It kept my neck warm (the temps were in the high 30s/low 40s) and was soft and comfortable. and looked nice.  It is easy to knot and look great - nothing complicated at all.<br /><br />I had to wash it after getting something on it, so I spot cleaned it.  The instructions said dry clean only, but I took a cloth and a little soap and water to dab it with and it did fine. [SEP] This Orchid Row Women's Fashion Novelty Faux Fur Neckwear has a black side and a white side with black flowers on it. The ends widen out compared to the more slender section that goes around the neck, and the white end threads into an opening in the black side. This can be pulled through a lot (like a choker) or just a bit to be balanced. The fur is like a mid-length pile stuffed animal fur, with very fine hairs, making this extremely soft and lovely to touch. On the other hand, the fur does shed a bit, and I'm hoping that stops, but my daughter doesn't care, and loves it (she's wearing it in the pics). I'd highly recommend. [SEP] Unusual neckware of faux fur for a glamourous vintage look.  100% polyester, dry clean only.  I think it will be perfect for a fashion forward young lady. [SEP] Just like all the Orchid Row products, this is a nice-quality scarf, just as cute as you would hope. The fake fur feels a lot like rabbit... if rabbits came covered in flowers.<br /><br />I haven't seen the tab design before, but it's handy. Otherwise something this silky would slide right off. [SEP] I'm not sure I like this particular faux fur collar.  It's black and white, and it reminds me of that classic cookie.  One half is parti-color, while the other is white.  Maybe it will grow on me, but right now, it seems just...odd.<br /><br />Ignoring the color, it is soft and cozy to wear. [SEP] In Daughter Chickadee's quest to look more Gothic (Think Wednesday Addams but blonde), she snatched this up.  I didn't have the heart to tell her that Wednesday wouldn't wear this but maybe Cruella de Vil might.<br /><br />It's super cute.  It's not really a scarf--more like a scarf shaped neck collar.  Very soft and I like the slit in one end.  Prevents it from falling off on the bus for her.  But it's pricey. [SEP] There are many terms for fashionable neck wraps.  You have scarfs, shawls, wraps and stoles. I‚Äôd call this a muffler.  It‚Äôs short and has a ready-made slot to fit one side through the other so you don‚Äôt have to rely on fancy tying techniques.  It‚Äôs warm and snuggly and fun.  I‚Äôve always loved neck wraps for their versatility ‚Äì you can change a look completely for very little investment.  This Orchard Row faux fur muffler is a fun accessory. [SEP] The fit is kind of weird. It's very short for a scarf but works well with keeping your neck warm if you can tuck it into your jacket. Trying to wear it over my jacket doesn't work well because it's not long enough to hang properly. Being able to tuck one end through to keep it tied is convenient.  The texture is soft but more in a stuffed animal way than in a clothing way. Bottom line, it's something different but not something I would wear often. [SEP] This Orchid Row Women‚Äôs faux fur ‚Äòscarf‚Äô is super cute, however, it looked too young on me. I don‚Äôt mind that it‚Äôs small, for it‚Äôs more of a neck warmer I suppose than a scarf.<br /><br />It‚Äôs fun and playful and super soft and warm on my neck but it looked ridiculous on me but I gave it a try since I thought the photo looked fun. But, I‚Äôm going to send it to my 9 year old granddaughter, who will love it and wear it.<br /><br />The flowers are so cute. One side is white with the black flowers and the other side is black. It‚Äôs soft and ‚Äòfurry‚Äô but of course is synthetic.<br /><br />I think almost $30 (at time of this review) may be too much for this, however, it does look well made.<br /><br />There‚Äôs a slit in the black side to slide the flowered side into so the scarf stays in place, and it does. It comes up a little high on the neck in the back so it looked a little odd.<br /><br />I think my granddaughter will have fun with it.<br /><br />It doesn‚Äôt have to be just for kids‚ÄîA woman could wear this as a fun accessory, but on me it just did not look right.",3,True

I also think the price point is more than double than what it should be. [SEP] When I requested this from Vine, I was super excited! At the $40.00 price point, I knew I wasn't exactly getting the best of the best, but it does look nice in the picture. The reality is different.<br /><br />First, the necklace is so darn small, I felt like I was choking. I couldn't put it on myself, due to how tight it was and also due to arthritis in my fingers.

I think for this price, you could do just as well if not WAYYYY better at the Walmart jewelry counter. [SEP] This is very pretty. The stone is a nice shade of purple.

I have a round face and really like how they look on me. The lense is decent at blocking out sun. Not top quality, but not dollar store quality. They are absolutely flat glasses. There is no curve to them at all. That seems to be the trend these days. They came with a white soft sided case and cleaning cloth too. I would totally order these again. [SEP] This is a neat pair of sunglasses.  The green lenses add a great twist to the classic aviator style.  They fit well, although they are easily bent out of their original shape.  The slightest bump and the metal hinges twist out of joint.  The metal itself has a high shine and smooth feel, but it's not quite as strong as I'd prefer, hence, the issue with the glasses losing their shape.  The quality is exactly what you'd expect for the price you pay.  If you're hard on sunglasses like I am, this is a good way to go. [SEP] I like these sunglasses more than my wife.  She feels they're too big for her in appearance, and she doesn't like the nose pads.  I really like the wafer size of the lens, thin arms, light weight.  The case is nifty.  Definitely store them there.  I could see how it would be easy to break these. I'm notorious with breaking sunglasses, but trying to be more careful. So far so good.  I barely know I'm wearing them. [SEP] Good material glasses just not the best look for ME. [SEP] Thee glasses are not bad. They are light weight and effective sun blockers. They hold up a fairly well, but they are inexpensive glasses, and you can tell they aren't a top-of-the-line pair of shades.  If this is your price point or you just want a pair of glasses you don't have to worry about, these will work fine. [SEP] These are really cute, semi  aviator style sunglasses that I love. They are dark and protect my eyes from the sun beautifully. They are also really delicate. They almost seem like they are gonna break. The ear pieces are very slim, but they are stronger than they look. I have sat on them a few times and they're still going strong.  The only thing I dont like is that sometimes if I wear them too long I get little imprints of the nose piece on my nose. [SEP] These sunglasses are absolute thin cheap plastic.  They literally broke 5 minutes after I opened the package.  The packaging is deceiving, they come in a white plastic case that is nicer than you get with most $12 sunglasses, but the product itself was very flimsy and brittle.  I immediately noticed that the ends of the parts that go over your ear were sharp and not covered like they are in higher end sunglasses.  The sunglasses are obviously made of a cheap plastic, which you can feel immediately.  They are very flat, and do not curve with your face at all- so that when you put them on there is a large gap in the peripheral vision area where bright sun can get in, depending on the angle, and obscure your vision.  The lenses themselves are thin and easy to scratch, they turn everything a greenish/yellow which isn't bad in itself.  When I was putting the glasses on and tried to slightly adjust them to fit my nose and face better the nose piece just snapped. (I was wearing contact lenses, but this is something I do with regular prescription glasses normally without a problem, so NO, I did not use excessive pressure)  The connection where it broke from is a thin plastic that is not reinforced.  I always like to wear sunglasses with my contact lenses, and have bought many pairs of $12-15 glasses at the gas station that held up 1000 times better than these.  Instead of including the case, they instead should have put the money into making a better product.  Do NOT recommend.  Zero stars.  Save your money! [SEP] I got to try SKYWAY's sunglasses/reading glasses and loved them.  They were comfortable.  These sunglasses, not so much.  I found the tips of the glasses (the end part that goes over your ears) to be extremely sharp and a little concerning to wear for that reason (however, I may keep it in my purse for protection...ha!), Even the nose pieces felt a little sharp a couple of times that I put the glasses on.  Unfortunately, I will pass on these glasses.  I tried to take a picture to show the sharpness of the tip, but it's not the best.  If they could round the tip, these glasses would be better. [SEP] Very stylish aviator glasses<br /><br />Material used are very cheap. Thin lenses and frames.<br /><br />Non polarized, minimal UV protection<br /><br />Great for those who like style without the cost, tend to lose their sunglasses often and/or just want disposable sunglasses for a trip/summer season [SEP] These are actually really cute! I give them 4 stars because the frames are a little bit too wide for my face, but other than that I‚Äôm pleased. They fit comfortably and have an adjustable nose piece. The ones I got have a bright gold frame and almost dark green lenses, although you can‚Äôt really tell they‚Äôre green. At first I was not sure about the gold frame but I decided I like it!

AMEXI semi-rimless rimless polarized sunglasses ladies and men retro brand sunglasses(dark blue),"['Mirror Coating coating', 'Bridge: 15 millimeters']",[],,4.3,27,83639,"I thought this would be like my other 'mens / women's' glasses Ive gotten but these just seem a touch too small, maybe because these are rimless, maybe they're not aviators, not sure, but I feel silly wearing them. Ill give them to my wife. [SEP] This pair of sunglasses are the prove that you don't need to invest too much to get a quality pair of sunglasses. As shown in the pics, the box comes with the sunglasses, a piece of fabric to clean them, a small screw driver to adjust the screws, two small pamphlets with some extra info on the product, and a small bag to safe guard the glasses. I personally did not like much how the glasses fit me, but there is nothing with them and since is for women as well I gave to my girlfriend and they look perfect on her. As for the sunglasses itself, the quality is all over it. The glass are polarized, the frame is strong and the temples are strong and flexible. I don't see this pair of sunglasses breaking anytime soon. I will mostly recommend this product because you pay a super cheap price for a good quality and beautiful product. [SEP] The polarization on the lenses is good and the light filtering is good for outdoors in the bright snowy days. So no complaints on function. It also came with the microfiber cleaning bag to store the glasses in and a mini multi screwdriver that I really like (I've gotten them from other glasses and like having them around for glasses and laptops).<br /><br />The only complaints are the plastic construction in the frame is over the ears and there isn't much you can do to bend or shape them outside of heating them up with a heat gun to mold them in a different shape so most may not find them comfortable and won't do anything about it. The style is also more librarian than I though looking at the stock photos. But they are described as retro and they hit that note to a t. So these will be added to the driving lineup.<br /><br />I don't have a price point to judge these on for the review so if I were to guess a good price point for them I'd say the supermarket/gas station $10-15 price point is where these would fall for just the glasses alone, but with the accessories I could see a $20 price point being quite fair. But beyond that I would maybe consider options if we're looking at $30 or more as I have purchased a few full metal framed polarized sunglasses with the same accessories for the $30 point. [SEP] These semi rimless glasses actually turned out to be much cuter in person than I was anticipating. It says they can be for men or women, however they tend to look a bit more feminine in my opinion. They are very well made, sleek and stylish looking. They fit my face well, have comfortable nose pieces, and even came with a tool to adjust the fit if need be. The box also included a little wipe for finger prints and a cloth bag to place them into when not in use. Overall, recommended! [SEP] At first blush, these are pretty and chic. They fit well to my face with a cool retro flare. The lens giving everything a reddish tint when I put them on. While at first appearing to be reflective, you can still see the person's eyes wearing them.<br />My only problem was with the uv sticker on the inside of the lens. It did not want to come off at all, and I ended up scratching the lens. Why do manufacturer's insist on putting it on the lens? Isn't the ear piece better? [SEP] I wasn‚Äôt sure how I was going to feel about these glasses but glad I gave them a try. They are certainly unique and don‚Äôt look anything like the other glasses or styles i wear. I think that is what I love about them most, the unique style. They fit really well and are comfortable to wear. I feel I have a pretty normal size head so they seem well sized. The lens color is just beautiful and is a bright eye catching blue. They Have enough reflect in them but don‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm walking around with mirrors on my face. Love them! [SEP] Tengo que decir que me encantaron, estas gafas de sol son de lente azul polarizad y adem√°s la calidad es excelente, es un estilo cl√°sico y el toque color platinado las hacer ver delicadas y muy lindas. Me gustan porqu√© son delicadas y livianas y adem√°s muy comodas. En lo personal considero que estas gafas de sol son unisex, ya que el estilo de la gafa es plano, sencillo as√≠ que le van bien tanto a hombres c√≥mo a mujeres. [SEP] The sunglasses are lightweight and feel inexpensive because it‚Äôs plastic.  They are very comfortable to wear since the glasses are not heavy on the bridge of my nose. Other than that, I love the size of the lenses since they fit my face perfectly. I love the color of the lenses. I like the shape of the glasses which aren't huge and they don't swamp my face.  The packaging is very nice. I went for the polarized option and glad that I did, the lenses are so clear and great when driving. I'm really pleased with these and hope they will last me for years. [SEP] Decent shades...Passable for quality sunglass, aesthetically speaking...You can feel that they are cheap when handling them though. The glass has a light blue mirror tint with a fair amount of transparency. They block light well but give off a blue/green tint to the world. Included microfiber bag, cloth and screwdriver are all nice.<br /><br />Ovearll, not bad if you come in with realistic expectations for a pair of cheapies. [SEP] They‚Äôre definitely one of the better quality sunglasses out there for a fraction of the price,  but don‚Äôt be fooled by its price.

I am 5' 5'' and 130 pounds (muscular, athletic build I'd definitely still say I'm skinny lol) and usually I get a size small top and medium bottom (big booty judy over hur) and after reading the reviews I decided to order a LARGE because other people commented about it being too small. I am so happy I did, the suit looks amazing! the top is super adjustable so I think if you're usually a small or smaller medium in the chest the large top will fit well and the bottoms fit great (definitely cheeky but that's what I wanted). I only gave this suit 4 stars because I haven't worn it in the water yet and idk how functional it is but just off of appearance and fit this is 4 stars easily!!!! SO CHEAP TOO!!! [SEP] top is way too small for a 32DD.... [SEP] The top is AMAZING! I could wear it everyday and it is adjustable for all sizes. It is extremely flattering. The bottoms are really cute and flattering as well, but the fit more like a thong than just 'cheeky'. But as a whole it's super cute and sexy if that's what you're going for. [SEP] WAY too small... I‚Äôm a 36D and I have a larger waist, 135 lbs, and I normally fit into a medium. I ordered a medium and it would fit a 7 year old... not to mention the material is thin. Definitely not worth your time or money! [SEP] This would fit a child! [SEP] LOVE the top. Hate the bottoms. They're good for angled &#34;before and after&#34; workout shots but not very flattering for running around on the beach unless you're a size 00. [SEP] Love this bikini!

Very good quality material as well. Very happy with my purchase! [SEP] I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5 and weigh 125-130 depending on the day. I normally wear a small or a 2-4. I ordered this suit in a large because everyone else advised to size way up. (Not enough people put their height and weight and the size they bought in reviews and that makes them pretty useless. Do better. Thanks.)I bought this bathing suit strictly for the top, and thankfully that fit well. The bottoms were really awkward fitting and loose. They somehow fit but are too baggy...yet still show too much skin. But the top is really cute! I‚Äôve had two kids so my boobs aren‚Äôt what they used to be but this top holds them up well and creates the appearance of cleavage where it no longer exists. 32dd in bras btw and the large top fits great. The total cost of the suit is much cheaper than any similar styles of this top so it‚Äôs still worth it even if you won‚Äôt be able to wear the bottoms. So! 3 stars because the top is cute but the bottoms are awful. [SEP] This product runs small so order one or two sizes up. I normally wear a small in tops and medium in bottoms so I ordered a large and the bottoms are still snug but not too bad.

It looks so sleek and professional. If my keys were exposed to everyone, I'm sure they'd ask if they came with my car.

Wire exists around the brim of the hat which allows for molding the hat to a desired shape. It was shipped folded into quarters and creases remain that the brim wire has no effect on.

I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier. [SEP] My husband despises tight clothing especially underwear so when I was offered to try out an XXXL size of Awesome 360 briefs, I was definitely in over my head thinking they will be just the right amount of baggy for him to feel more like boxer shorts. Boy was I wrong, they're just way too big for his size 36 waist. We love the Awesome 360 brand as most of their clothing items are of great quality. These just didn't seem on par with the usual quality of this brand. Perhaps maybe it was just the sizing that is making them look this way but they appear way too loose for the style they are. I was expecting more tightness and support so that when you size up it's just larger but has some tightness. These will fall off of you if they're not sized correctly.

"Konikit Carbon Fiber Money Clip Wallet,Aluminum RFID Blocking Wallet,Minimalist style wallets for men",['Zipper closure'],[],,3.3,26,6977,"Sleek and modern, but not a lot of wiggle room. Definitely a minimalist option. Would make an interesting gift. [SEP] My husband loves these wallets for when we do car trips. He puts in a few credit cards and his id and uses this as a travel wallet. The wallet has a nice carbon fiber finish, and a money clip on the outside for your bills. The small cutout allows you to access the cards in the RFID protection wallet for quick access when needed. The extra security of the RFID blocker provides a comfort factor when traveling to keep your information safe from scanners out there. [SEP] Idea is nice however implementation is not the best.  While it is thin, the material feels cheap and is rather sharp around the edges.<br /><br />The biggest drawback to me is the gigantic money clip attached.  That totally takes away from the minimalist concept to have that clip on the outside sliding up and down your pocket.<br /><br />If you carry that much cash, or use it to hold a lot of cards, you‚Äôve defeated why you want a minimalist wallet to begin with.<br /><br />I too think the straps that hold the sides closed will stretch and loosen, inevitably failing after time. [SEP] This is an easy review and I will begin with the conclusion: don't buy it or you'll probably be sorry.<br />The 'device' consists of 2 probably metallic plates held together on the sides by 3 elastic bands. You are supposed to squeeze your 'cards' in between the 2 plates and, because of the elastic bands, the plates will keep them pressed against each other. If you have, let's say 6 cards held that way (good luck with that) and want to use one of them, then you take out the stack and find the one that you need. You hold the remaining 5 in one hand while you use the other hand to manipulate the 6th. Then, you stack them together again and try to squeeze the stack again between the 2 plates.<br />Oh, and if you want to carry some cash, there is an outside clip to hold it so that everyone around can see that you do carry cash because... why not?<br />If you are really, really planning to be this responsible with your cards and cash, probably the next level would be to simply hold them together with a couple of rubber bands. It would be cheaper and probably more convenient. [SEP] I like the looks of this wallet.  The shiny carbon fiber sides give it a modern look.  The heavy clip can hold a few bills or a small stack of bills.  I have always wanted to try this style of wallet which is basically a cardholder with a money clip on the side.  It seems like most new wallets these days are designed to block RFID so that is pretty standard.  This one has that feature as well.<br /><br />When you put your cards in this wallet, you pull the two sides apart.  They are held together by 3 elastic bands on three sides of the wallet.  Eventually, these might stretch out but they are tight when new.  (wallets all wear out over time, this is where I think this one may wear out eventually)<br /><br />Overall, it does what it is designed to do.  I decided to give it four stars because I have a bit of trouble getting the cards out without only removing the top or bottom one.  I have to take out the stack and put it back in as a nice and neat stack.  Also, I may not be as big of a fan of the money clip as I thought I was.  I use a minimalist wallet and I already don't like that to get my smallest bill out, I have to pull all of my bills out.  With a clip, all of your bills are out all of the time.  It isn't a big deal actually but I may prefer the minimalist wallet by a small margin. [SEP] This wallet feels slightly cheap. The material is somewhat flimsy and the elastic bands dont seem to last long.<br /><br />Taking a card out is really difficult.<br /><br />An object that is taken out of a pocket, put back in a pocket, and sat on throughout the day needs to be made well. This doesn't seem to cut it.<br /><br />All in all, it's nice looking, but functions poorly. [SEP] I have a friend who has a wallet like this one and he likes it a lot, so I wanted to get one for my husband.  I think it's perfect for the guy who carries 10 or less cards and some cash.  It does have some ""weight"" to it when it is empty, but so do regular tri-fold wallets.  It's a little stiff initially when placing cards in, but once you have a few in there, it's easy to use the little finger notch on the side to push the cards out a little to find the one you want.  It securely held my small wad of 8 bucks, so it will really hold well if you have more money to place in the clip.  I'm super excited to give this to my husband (I'm going to save it for a stocking stuffer).  I know he will really like it and it will encourage him to place his wallet in his front pocket instead his back pocket.  Nice wallet! [SEP] The Konikit Carbon Fiber Money Clip Wallet most probably does a find job of blocking the devices that the bad guys use to steal your credit card information right out of your back pocket. I don't doubt that for a minute - but how would we know it's working anyway? That's pretty much a matter of faith on the part of the consumer.<br /><br />But I do have a problem with the construction of this aluminum wallet: the weak point is definitely the black ""elastic bands"" on both sides that is designed to hold the wallet tightly closed. The bands do that right now, and they stretch nicely as more cards are inserted into the wallet. But how long are they going to do the job before the stretch out of shape or break- losing their ability to keep the wallet tightly closed (that's all that's keeping your cards in place)?<br /><br />And then there's the rigid clip outside the wallet by which it can be clipped to your belt - not something i want to do in a large crowd. If I'm worried about someone stealing my data with a reader, I'm more worried about someone stealing the whole wallet right off my belt and running away with the actual cards in hand. This is the kind of wallet that should be slipped into a man's side pocket because it's small enough to do that - but with that clip, that's not going to happen. (And, yes, I do realize this is intended to be a ""money clip,"" but it is still too uncomfortable to fit inside a pocket this way...I tried it.)<br /><br />Time will tell how long this holds up, so I'm giving it three stars (minus one star for the elastic and one for the uncomfortable/dangerous clip). [SEP] The Konikit Carbon Fiber money clip wallet looks really modern & attractive in person, but it‚Äôs functionality is not what one would use as a daily wallet. This wallet is very small, has the minimalist concept down well but is hard plated so wouldn‚Äôt feel good in back of a pants pocket. It would be good as an extra wallet when one plans to head out on an e-scooter, bike, take a jog, go hiking, sightseeing or anywhere you‚Äôd want to lessen your load. However for everyday use such as work, meetings, functions, or errands, this wouldn‚Äôt be our first choice. Wallet appears durable on the outside, the carbon fiber is sharp and sleek looking, the money clip is solid metal, however the elastic bands are cloth. The description states they can last for up to 100,000 openings, that‚Äôs quite a lot of opening and closing before needing a new one, so that makes it worth it for a backup wallet as it could last you a lifetime. I like the thumb curved area to pull your cards out, it‚Äôs a neat feature. I‚Äôm not sure why the description mentions a zipper, I don‚Äôt see one. Overall, for the price point, it‚Äôs reasonable but there are just many other better choices out there. The only great thing about this wallet is the aesthetics really. I would recommend it for backup use mainly, not as a daily wallet. [SEP] This is definitely quite minimalist, thin and small.<br />But it's pretty much a money clip with a compartment put together with a elastic band for credit cards.<br />It's a bit awkward to use and quickly take cards out. If you don't have too many credit cards and like a money clip with something extra, this might be for you.",3,True

I like that the tassel is smaller for each stack, which gives you 4 different colors instead of a solid or a double or triple color. These are your hand made fish hooks that are costume jewelry. They should be removed as soon as you have gotten back to your place and never spray them with cologne or perfume or deodorant. Don't bathe or shower in them either. Wipe the metal with a soft cloth afterwards. [SEP] For this price these earrings are a steal! They are colorful, lightweight and will brighten any outfit. In fact they can be worn every day and will make you stand out. I love that they almost reach the neck but do not tug on ear lobes at all. When I turn my head they swish lightly and draw attention to my neck. I like that effect. While the colors are not loud, they still make a statement. Beautiful stylish earrings! [SEP] I can see a supermodel wearing these layered tassel earrings as she walks down a runway. They are well-made but the style is loud and not suitable for everyday wear. They swing nicely from your earlobes and because they are made of yarn and beads, lightweight despite their size. They do not strike me as ""expensive"" earrings, however, because the tag that comes with them simply says ""Fashion Earrings"" - the same kind of generic tag you see attached to $1 earrings.  They're OK for what they are but I wouldn't pay too much for them. [SEP] My neck isn‚Äôt that elongated so these aren‚Äôt working that well on me. They brush against my shoulders so they don‚Äôt really dangle like they should unless my head is tilted down. They are very light weight but also a little fibrous. They irritated my eyes when I first put them on. These are all me problems, but there is nothing inherently wrong with the construction and they are cute. [SEP] I had to look up what ""Bohemian"" means, but after doing so, these earrings certainly seem to qualify. I think they have a very artsy look to them, as I'm sure you'll agree from the photo. Despite their size and length, my daughter assures me that they are not heavy at all, don't pull on her ears and are very comfortable to wear.<br /><br />CAVEATS<br /><br />1. They catch easily on fuzzy/furry clothing. One of the earrings caught on the furry lining of the hood of her winter coat, and at some point, when she turned her head, the hood pushed the earring up and she did not feel the hook slide out of her ear piercing. Thankfully, the earring stayed lodged in the lining, and she found it later.<br /><br />2. The seller does not claim that these earrings are hypo-allergenic, so if you tend to react to earrings, you may want to pass on these. [SEP] They are of course a very very large dangly earring, so those of you with cats may not want to wear this around them.  It would have been nicer if it was possible to separate the individual pieces but this wasn't so.  Also, rather than a holiday feeling they evoke of the feeling of having your head going through a car wash (or at least 1 person told me that's what these look like).  So meh... they were just ok for me. [SEP] Love love love them! The are soft and the weight is just perfect! I love the colors are so bright! They gives my looks a cute touch and so sophisticate. Looks the same as the picture! A lot of people just asked me where did I get them! [SEP] These are really cute earrings.  They are heavier and longer than I thought they would be and from what I normally wear but I really loved them.  I wear them at work and just when I am out and about and have gotten a lot of compliments. [SEP] I love the different colors and I think this is great for any solid colored shirt to bring some life to your outfit.  They were not heavy and did not pull my ear down.  I really like them. [SEP] These earrings are lightweight, large and super adorable. They definitely make a statement and get a lot of attention. I had few of my friends asking me where I got them. They don‚Äôt need to be dressed up, I feel this style can be worn very casually. They‚Äôre made out of fabric so that makes them casual in my book. I first saw earrings like these a while back and I actually thought this bohemian style is getting old but at my surprise it‚Äôs still very trendy. I thought I completely missed this trend. I am currently in burp cloth/bib phase of life AKA pretty clueless when it comes about fashion LOL<br /><br />Anyways, I am glad I decided to try these out and I am definitely looking forward rocking these cool earrings!<br /><br />Browsing through Amazon I see many similar style earrings for a lot cheaper  price, some sell 4-6 in set. I still think these are cool but value for $ is one of the things I always take into consideration when rating a product. Due to that only, I am rating this a 4 instead 5 stars.",3,True
Louis Pelle Leather Men Minimalist Wallet RFID Blocking Slim Wallet,['Bifold closure'],[],,4.0,23,4281,"First let me say, I am a fan of the Louis Pelle line of leather wallets and have several of their credit card cases and coin purses. Their leather goods are deeply dyed, thick, soft, and the construction has been flawless in every wallet I received. This Louis Pelle Genuine Leather Slim Minimalist Front Pocket RFID Blocking Wallet is no exception. The slots hold my credit cards and ID securely, and I like that it is a bifold style with ample space to hold my cash securely.  It can be used for business cards as well. It's small enough to fit into my tiny purse and or the pocket of my jeans. The fact that it offers RFID protection is a bonus! I am sure I will get many years of enjoyment from this wallet, and I highly recommend it. [SEP] I love these slim wallets and this one is really good quality.  The leather is soft yet very durable.  It will hold a few credit cards, a picture ID and some cash.  It fits easily in a front pocket and has RFID protection so your credit card numbers are safe from being scanned and stolen. [SEP] My teen likes this wallet as it is minimalist & fit well into his back pocket. It allows his to put in up to 6 cards & some bills. The leather feels like nubuck. I would have wanted a small zipper pocket to keep his coins. [SEP] My family owns several of Louis Pelle wallets as we all enjoy their minimalistis designs. This little wallet did not disappoint. All of LP's wallets come with the lovely genuine leather scent along with RFID protection capabilities.  You can always breathe easy knowing LP's wallets protect your information.  This wallet is small, sleek & compact.  It's functional in the total minimalist fashion.  The front cover of this wallet has the traditional LP lion logo adorned to it,  while they choose to leave the back of the wallet bare.  They usually opt for the back of their wallets to bear their logo name,  however for this wallet they chose to bear it on the inside of the wallet.  Opposite the inside pocket showcases the traditional imprint of a lock to symbolize it's RFID protection.  There's 3 card slots on the left inside, 1 side slot, there's 2 side slots on the right.  The side slots can be used for additional cards or bills & receipts.  Due to its small size & slimness it has no problem fitting in most pockets or bags.  It's aesthetically pleasing, appears durable & is  modern & stylish. I recommend it. [SEP] The leather on this wallet is very soft and flexible. Scratches show up but they mostly add to the casual look of the wallet. You can actually fit a lot into it. Each pocket can hold the equivalent of 3 credit cards, so you can pretty much stuff it with a lot if you want. It's about ¬æ the size of my nicer wallet and I've been using it to hold a few cards and cash when I go to the beach or am wearing shorts or am dressed more casually.<br /><br />The stitching is strong but the lines are more uneven which, in a good way, give the wallet a hand-made look. All of the pockets are lined so that things slip in and out easily.<br /><br />This is a great choice if you want a small wallet that looks casual. [SEP] Louis Pelle Slim  RFID Blocking Wallet is made up of quality leather and it stitched well.This wallet is very sleek and compact in size and it has got 4 card slots and 2 cash compartments. An each card slots we can easily place 2-3 cards.This wallet will effectively blocks RFID Signals, which is great way to protect your credit and debit cards. [SEP] Beautiful wallet, small but enough room<br />My nephew love it. [SEP] This wallet looks nice on the outside.  Inside there are a lot of quality problems which you can see in the photos that I uploaded.  The most noticeable problem would be the strange crusty stain over the card slots.  The stain is part of the leather that was used.  The layers of leather stitched together to create the card slots are misaligned and the stitching is sloppy.  It is very noticeable since they use heave white thread on black leather.  The area of stitching next to the card slots actually has a hole in the leather.  There is frayed thread next to the cash pouch where the seam from the outer layer of leather folds in onto the inside of the wallet.  There is nothing hiding these seams.  It all looks very sloppy.<br /><br />The outside looks nice.  The wallet is sturdy.  There are not any quality issues with the exterior of the wallet.  This is definitely not a woman's wallet. [SEP] I know, I should really tout RFID features of this, but to be fair, how do I KNOW it is RFID?  I trust them at their word because they have no reason to lie to me, but, this thing is so simple, but VERY artfully crafted that I soon forget the value added of RFID because they are just a handsome simple men's wallet.<br /><br />The fact is, it has many great hidden features other than its good looks...  What is amazing, truly astounding to me, is that It is so comfortable in my front pocket, loaded with cards and ID and a little bit of cash that I literally forgot it was there and panicked that I didn't have my stuff with me!!!<br /><br />I feel there is only one downside that I will resolve over time...  Not enough to take away a star, but a downside initially, is that it is a tiny bit difficult to quickly retrieve from my pocket...  The fact is, I think that will improve with use....<br /><br />That downside could be viewed as a benefit as the wallet won't work it's way out of your front pocket...  My son really likes the wallet, so I guess I will have to keep an eye on it...<br /><br />I can just hear it now....  ""Dad, I wasn't stealing your cash and credit cards!  I was re-appropriating your wallet!"" [SEP] This wallet is exactly as shown. The stitching, leather, lining and packaging quality is premium and I'm happy with it. It is certainly gift-able. I have been using this style wallet for years. I love the low bulk design that is slim enough to remove from my purse and carry in a pocket when I don't want to carry my purse around. I just fold cash in the middle and use the slots for cards/ ID. However, the matte black with white stitching is a distinctly masculine look and is not appealing to me as a woman so I find the ""unisex"" description is a little misleading. I would love to see one a little smaller and with smooth semi-gloss black and black stitching.",3,True

PofashWomen's Paper Bag Waist Irregular Wrap Hem Shorts Skirt Skorts with Pockets Dark Blue Small,['Drawstring closure'],[],,3.9,27,4592,"These paper bag waist walking shorts are so cute. I like how the front overlaps to give it a skort look in the front. Because I didn't know what size I would be getting, when they got here, they were too small for anyone in my family so these nice looking shorts will go to the donations box. [SEP] This review is for the POFASH Women‚Äôs Solid Asymmetric Skort in ""Dark Blue.""<br /><br />This is one of the nicest garments I‚Äôve found on Amazon. The fabric is thick, the stitching is good quality, and the skort overall has a very flattering shape and silhouette. It‚Äôs really cute! It‚Äôs Asian sizing, though, so order 1-2 sizes up from what you normally wear. I‚Äôm a size 0-2/XS in women‚Äôs clothes at most stores (Gap, etc.), size XXS at Athleta and Lilly Pulitzer, and the size Small in this skort is *almost * too small on me... like, if I gain a single pound, it will instantly be too tight in the waist. As it stands, it‚Äôs too short in the crotch, so I have to wear it a little below my waist. Sizing issues aside, it‚Äôs still really cute and surprisingly good quality. The color is exactly as it appears in the product photos, a medium chambray.<br /><br />** Update, a week later, after washing **<br /><br />Alas, this skort does not wash up well, IMO. It comes out terribly wrinkly, and after just one wash, it has started to develop dark and light ‚Äúwash/wear lines‚Äù from where the fabric was crumpled and some of the dye rubbed off during the wash cycle, just like with jeans (you know the ‚Äúwhiskering‚Äù on some jeans? same idea, except it happened in weird and unflattering places on this skort). Because this skort was already slightly too short in the crotch and now will need ironing to not look sloppy, it‚Äôs a no-go for me. Downgraded to 3 stars. [SEP] The small fit my daughter as expected (she normally wears a size 2 or 4) and she's worn them a couple of times already. They are high waisted, and she didn't have a problem with the front flap covering the look of the shorts. They fit pretty much as the Amazon photo showed, just a bit snugger on her backside. If you wanted a looser look on the back, I'd say size up one size. For some reason we both thought they would be denim, but the fabric is actually a lighter weight, medium blue chambray. [SEP] I really like the design of these. The material feels like good quality and I like the lighter blue wash of the denim. But they run small. They're not uncomfortable but you lose that paper bag aesthetic to the fit so I would suggest sizing up. [SEP] Cute with a little stretch. Material like a thin denim, but still feels durable. Buy a size larger for a more modest look. My sister pictured, weighs 140lbs and is 5‚Äô5‚Äù wearing a size small. [SEP] So unlike most short denim shorts, these give you the option of a roll up leg thanks to their slightly baggy design.  Also the waist seems quite big and stretchy but thankfully the tie design allows you to have a good fit while looking relaxed and casual.  These are a bit thin but it means they just feel light and airy as a result allowing you good movement and no restrictive feeling.  I have to say, they take a bit of getting used to, but they were very fun to wear and they made me look good.  Love these! [SEP] This is so cute!  The fit is perfect.  Not too tight, not too roomy.  The quality is great.  These shorts are super cute and can go with a lot of tops.  Also the length is good for me. [SEP] The shorts is quite comfortable and the design is quite interesting. I like the asymmetric edge and it's a very comfortable shorts. I think it works with or without the belt. It's not too short, perfect for summer time. [SEP] Cute asymmetric shorts.<br />Good quality fabric.<br />Fit as expected. [SEP] Pofash skirt with belt.  This runs a little small in the waist but it is elastic so it stretches.  I recieved a size small and I am 5'4 and 111lbs. The skort is cute and it is a denim color.  Comfortable and easy to put on and take off. The belt has loops it goes through around the waist it is not actually attached to the shorts.  Material is stretchy and the skirt is short it landed above mid thigh on me. Overall it is cute.",3,True

I am 5‚Äô2 150lbs the length is great without shoes very flowery and flowy so love it [SEP] I really wanted to love this dress!  The print (I got the bubblegum pink floral) was GORGEOUS,  it fit perfectly and was SO flattering. However, it was very thin and see-through (I do not have the patience to wear a slip in the summer heat), and arrived a total wrinkled mess.  I ordered it specifically for a vacation trip, and do not want to deal with ironing the entire dress before each wear, so unfortunately I am returning it. If it were a different fabric I would buy it again in a heartbeat, as it really had some great qualities, but the sheerness and wrinkly fabric are just total deal-breakers for me. [SEP] It appears that I received a dress someone had returned.  Dress appears to have been worn before and arrived  with 2 safety pins attached.  If the dress had arrived new, I am pretty sure I would have loved it. The color is great. The fabric is thin, but it would have been great for a beach photo session.  As I am leaving town for the event I bought it for tomorrow, I am returning. Very disappointed. [SEP] I will definitely be back to purchase more from this company.  I am extremely satisfied!  Great fit and very pretty! [SEP] This dress far exceeded my expectations! It is absolutely divine and I've gotten more compliments in that any of my $100 + dresses from high end stores or boutiques.

I had to dock 1 star for the packaging because it says AWESOME! on the front and it looks kind of tacky and makes the ties look cheap. It would have been PERFECT if it came in a wonderful, higher quality box/packaging. The ties themselves are nice quality and has a good feel to the fabric. [SEP] This is a very well constructed tie out of very nice material.  It looks very professional and hubs likes it very much.  It comes in a nice box for gifting. [SEP] 360 brings us more of their Awesome 360 collection. Awesome is definitely the correct word to describe these beautiful 100% silk ties. They're so soft to the touch. The designs will go with a ton of different styles of clothes. The colors are on the bright side, not too bright, just right. They're easy to maintain, just follow the instructions. I always love 360's tie presentation. It's always classy. It is the best descriptive word I can think of to describe 360. Take care of them and these ties will be around for many many years. They really are beautiful ties. [SEP] I got these ties for my husband to wear. They came in a very nice gift box. One is slightly narrower than the other as you can see in the one photo I‚Äôve added. I really like these prints as they have softer tones, but aren‚Äôt too feminine.  The ties themselves do not feel as nice and silky as other more expensive ties that my husband has, but they look just as nice on. I would recommend these for yourself or for a perfect gift ready to wrap. [SEP] These classic neckties by Awesome 360 are great gift set for the men in your life. The set I got comes with two in the shades of purple (checkered) and pink (flower). The material is great and fabric is made out of polyester. It's not silk, however, pollsters are sturdy, last long and come through the wash alright. The colors would go nicely with any shirt/suit combination specially white shirt and a nice fitted black suit. The cut of the ties is classic, meaning not too wide or too narrow. [SEP] My dad liked his ties. The quality wasn‚Äôt the best but it wasn‚Äôt the worse either. They are decent. [SEP] ties fit very well and look really good. I like the colors, very vibrant colors. I love that the ties are slimmer than normal. I really like the feel of these ties and how easy they tie. The quality for the pricing are amazing. [SEP] These are department store look-alike 100% polyester ties. The quality is about the same as what you would find in a mid-priced clothing store.  The purple tie is the one that stands out of the two ties.  It is about 2-¬æ‚Äù wide at the bottom and long enough for the average height guy to tie most knots.  It has a tight gingham check type of pattern when you look at the weave closely.<br /><br />The lighter purple tie has a nice medallion pattern and is a full 3-1/2‚Äù at the base of the tie.  Both ties have a light blue in them and they would look very nice with a medium blue shirt.<br /><br />Overall, these are average quality ties with decent pattern. They should work well for everyday ties and I will feel good about wearing either of them.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

Awesome! [SEP] Ordered two of these 2 piece tie sets and the results are mixed.  First, I got the pink striped and black with white dots tie set, and it's okay.  They're quite skinny and not quite as long as I like my ties - being on the tall side, I don't get enough of a tail end on these to tuck into the loop on the back.  If you're of average height that shouldn't be an issue.  The black tie is basic and handsome, but the pink tie has sparkly accents that are a little much for me.  Both ties have a nice weight and hold their shape well.  Not a thing wrong with these ties, but nothing particularly special about them either.<br />The 2nd set has one tie with a pink floral design and one with a purple checked theme.  These two share the same nice thick material with the other set, and look even better.  I love both designs and the colors are rich and handsome.  Oddly, the purple one is fairly skinny but the pink one is quite a bit wider and a little longer, which I like.  Between the two sets, this is definitely my favorite. [SEP] Both of these ties came as advertised in a nice presentation box for gift giving. They are easy to tie, lay flat, and the right length. They don‚Äôt wrinkle or need ironing like some of my ties, so that‚Äôs a plus too. No complaints!",3,True

"BAYINBULAK 2019 New Beanie Hat for Women Cold Weather Headgear Warm, PP Cotton - One Size - Amazon Vine",[],[],,3.0,25,1972,"Unique looking hat. It is indeed warm. It quite stretchy and it has no trouble fitting my giant head with thick long hair. It feels super secure- that band is thick and has firm stretch. The rest of it is super shiny black baffle box design.<br /><br />The hat is kinda humorous to me, and the uniqueness of it compels me to wear it. Likely not for day to day, but for sure when I am standing outside in the freezing cold with with my two big dogs who needs lots of supervised outside time.. this might be just the hat to use. I imagine snow falling, wind whipping, and me not feeling a thing.<br /><br />So yeh.. take a look at all my pics- tried to get a few angles depicting how it looks on me. Know that you will have a unique looking hat that is likely to keep your head warm on the coldest of days.<br /><br />BTW, my head doesn't fill up the entire hat. I set it where is seemed to fit, and there is lots of left over space. [SEP] This hat is made of a really great thermal fabric that keeps you very warm on the inside without adding weight or too much bulk. Best of all, if it‚Äôs snowing, it‚Äôs not going to melt through as easily as with a wall or fabric cap. The edge made of a soft knit makes this more comfortable to wear. Great! [SEP] It's shiny black, reminding me of the seventies when there was a weird trend of using what looked like galoshes rubber in coats...bright yellow and neon pink plus shiny.  Didn't like them then and sure don't like the crinkley texture of this plastic material.  My thought about the material was, well, it won't get soaked (in rain or wet snow), but the knit band would...and the next thing that came to mind was, sure wouldn't breathe well either, meaning your head is going to get hot in this thing.  Not sure why it was packaged with socks and a face muff as they didn't go with this beanie at all.  I mean, if you are offering extras, with this hat, a pair of gloves (adult size - not child size) or a medium weight scarf to keep the neck warm...I doubt I will ever wear this beanie.  It's just a bit too odd. [SEP] This is a really warm, nice hat.  It‚Äôs perfect for when you‚Äôre going to be outdoors for an extended period of time.  I will be using it for cool evenings watching high school football.  It‚Äôs also a fabric that is waterproof so in the event it snows or rains your head will stay dry.  Recommended. [SEP] 14/Oct/19<br /><br />PROS<br />+ It comes with a bunch of 'complimentary' items. I received 3 pair of socks and earmuffs. Not sure why they give this away, but you get freebies which is nice.<br />+ You get exactly what you expect from the beanie.<br />+ Design is 'plasticky', so it makes it different for a trendy option.<br /><br />CONS<br />- If you are not a big fan if this kind of fabric, this is not for you (My wife did not like the look of it, though I liked it).<br /><br />* I will update this review if something changes as I keep using the product.<br />* If you found this review helpful, please click below! This will help other users like you to make informed decisions before spending their money! [SEP] This hat certainly looks unique and stylish. The material is not very high quality. The shiny part sort of has the feel and texture of a plastic trash bag, only less durable. I like the silver threading around the front. [SEP] Important note: The only part that is cotton, is the striped rim.  The rest is this cheap, thin plastic, similar to the type used for puffy jackets.  I did pull on the plastic quite a bit on the inside and on the top, and it does seem to be sturdy, it did not tear or change shape.  It does smell like plastic, it seemed to disappear after airing it out for a week.<br />So this is completely lined with black plastic and there's plastic on the top so this would probably be pretty good if you've got extremely wet weather and you wanted to keep your hair dry. I did find it strange that you can't wash it except hand washing it, you can't dry it  in nthe clothes dryer and you can't bleach it.  So I'm guessing the only way to clean it is by taking a wet cloth and wiping it down if you needed to or hand washing it and letting it dry for a week, hung up. I was able to wear my hair up in a big bun and still put this on comfortably. I think it looks cute on, depending on how you put the cotton rim.  This came with a face mask, that is super cute, maybe for a child or a teen girl when they are sick but need to get to the store?  I know that in China, face masks are a BIG deal, with pollution issues, so maybe this is a pollution mask?  I think it is cute.  The socks they sent as a gift as well, they are on the small size, will fit someone that wears shoe size 6 would be perfect.  All in all, I like the look if I had a black puffer jacket to wear with this hat, the shiny plastic look might be great.  I'm only giving this 4 stars, because it is WARM, and will keep the head DRY.  Great for wearing in powdery SNOW. [SEP] The upside to this hat is that it keeps the head warm and dry. My wife enjoyed it recently while in the mountains during an early, wet snow/rain mix. It fits her well but I must admit there is not a lot of stretch in the head band part. The reason for deducting one star was because it is hard to wear the hat without a seam in the front. It's a bit odd. [SEP] This is a one size beanie hat.  It's brim is a cotton fabric but the rest of it is a plastic material.  It's not very pretty and it makes noise when you touch it because it's plastic.  It fits my head but it's just a strange looking hat.  It needed more cotton and less plastic.  The plastic could have been on the inside areas of the hat.  It keeps your head warm but it's really not attractive.  It looks like a grocery bag on my head!  I don't like it. [SEP] This hat is mostly a black plastic vinyl material with some insulation material between the layers and fit my head fine. Some soft, elastic material around the bottom to hold it on. It is a nice hat for times when it is a wintery mix or raining and keeps cold liquid rain off your head. This hat would probably make your head sweat if you were active or in the sun with it on, since it doesn't have any ventilation in it. It doesn't have any decorations on top, so it could easily be worn under a hooded shirt or coat hood.",3,True

"CHINFAI Magic Dishwashing Gloves with Silicone Scrubber, Reusable Household Cleaning Glvoes for Washing Dish Kitchen Car Bathroom (Blue)","['Pull On closure', 'Hand Wash']",[],,3.5,42,4648,"For good reason too. He prefers the dishes be hand washed. I prefer to use the dishwasher because I like my dishes clean. He doesn't seem to mind if his handwashed dishes are clean. So, if he uses these gloves, I have a better chance of getting a clean dish. [SEP] I was quite excited about these gloves, but it turns out they are really more of a gimmick than a solution to dish washing problems.  The gloves look great- they are large, and should easily fit most hands.  Each glove is covered with silicone scrubbies that will scrub the gunk off your dishes.  So far, so good.  Upon using them, however, I discovered the problems.  First, you end up using much more dish soap with these gloves than with a sponge.  The gloves do not retain soap the way a sponge does, so I found myself constantly having to add more soap.  Second, once the gloves are wet and covered in soap, things get quite slippery.  It is difficult to scrub dishes, hold on to them, and rinse them when your gloves are slick.  While the description says these are heat resistant, I found it uncomfortable when using the very hot water I like to use to wash dishes.  I think the issue is that when the gloves are also your sponge, your hands are more covered in water than when you are scrubbing with a separate sponge.  All in all, these were kind of fun to try, but I'm going back to a traditional sponge for dishwashing. [SEP] This is an unusual dishwashing glove. It has silicone bristles on each palm so you can use the gloves themselves to scrub the floor, pots and pans and whatever needs scrubbing. It feels a little awkward at first as you're using your hands directly to scrub, but it does help out if your scrubber is getting dull and you need some reinforcement.  The gloves are thick enough to provide a buffer between my hand and the bristles. I'm still getting used to the feel but this is certainly an innovative product. [SEP] This is an interesting concept, and I'd like it if I did dishes by hand, but because I don't do many dishes by hand, it doesn't get all that much use.  It is sort of a quick and easy solution for something like a dutch oven that shouldn't go in the dishwasher, but just getting the gloves on sort of uses up some time relative to how long it takes to actually wash said dish.  And that dutch oven is usually oily enough that I want more of a stiff scrubber.  A dish is so small and quick that I'd just use my hand and then wash my hand.<br /><br />But...maybe it would get more use should I relegate it to bathroom cleaning.  However, if I do that, there's no going back...<br /><br />Nice product, but I have not yet realized its full potential. [SEP] These silicone gloves look really big but when I put them on they seem to fit pretty well and feel comfortable.  The little prong scrubbers are flexible and are actually kind of soft feeling, but help to get gunk off of dishes.  I use these for pre-washing dishes before loading them into the dishwasher.  They can be worn on either hand depending on what textured side of the gloves you want to use.  They are thicker than they look and also durable so I expect these to last a long time. [SEP] If you have big hands, you will love these gloves as they will fit.<br /><br />I found them a little large for my hands, so the company may want to make these in two sizes.<br /><br />Because they are large for me, I have to work harder to grab things.<br /><br />They don't make my hands sweat like rubber gloves sometimes do.<br /><br />You can feel little bumps on the inside, but that didn't bother me.<br /><br />They protect your hands from burns.<br /><br />I used them to clean the kitchen: sink, counters, doors of cabinets so dipped them in hot water with cleanser.  I was satisfied.<br /><br />My husband might like these more than I do as they will fit his hands better.  He has large hands.<br /><br />These will get a lot of use in our house. [SEP] I really like these.  They‚Äôre just what they claim to be.  Silicone gloves with silicone scrubbers built in.  Great for dishes, but would also be useful for other things like massaging treatments into your hair.  They are comparable to a l/xl gloves so could be awkward for people with really small hands. [SEP] I just had to try these. The concept is brilliant!  But these gloves are gigantic and heavy. I used them to wash some dishes and for them to work, for me, the gloves would have to fit tighter and offer some sort of grippiness, they are very slippery when wet and soapy.  The insides do have a non slip texture to keep them from sliding off your hands but the outsides lack traction.  They may be good for larger scale washing, like an automobile. Dunk gloved hands into a bucket of soapy water and rub down the car.update - these work pretty well for capturing long cat hair on furniture and even from the cat himself. [SEP] This is a nice product to make household cleaning chores a little easier. Essentially it combines gloves with a scrubbing cloth. The gloves are made of thick silicone that insulates your hands somewhat from hot water and have ridges on the outside that let you scrub your dishes, floor, or car, etc. The surface works well on things like cereal bowls with dried oatmeal but are not strong enough for items like my broiler pan where I still have to use a Dobie pad.<br />The gloves have loops to hang them up, which is a good way to let them dry, but they are too big and utilitarian-looking to leave them visible in the kitchen all the time.<br />The main reservation I have about the gloves is that they are big, too big for me to wear comfortably. They fit my husband‚Äôs hands very well.  It would be nice if they came in more than one size.  On the other hand, maybe they are a subtle way to encourage men to do more of the cleaning. If so, I hope they sell millions! [SEP] The gloves were actually larger than what i expected. Since the silicon is little sticky, extra size helps to wear it easily. This is my first cleaning gloves. The magic gloves really helps remove the grease and dirt that the normal gloves or dish washing brush can not remove. The gloves are lengthy so the soap or water doesn't fall on hand. Overall this is a good product and i strongly recommend this.",3,True
"Plusfeel Women Bandeau Bra Strapless Padded Tube Bra, Purple, X-Large",[],[],,4.0,11,575,"I tried this in a large to extra, extra, extra large and all the sizes in-between and these bras fit me perfectly in any of those sizes without much difference in feel or tightness. I got these to help reduce swelling after surgery and this is working perfectly for me. I also love the lilac color.<br /><br />Note that they also wash well in a lingerie bag. I lay them flat to dry but have tumble dried them on low for a few minutes without any issue. [SEP] It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve tried one of these on so it was quite a feat slipping these over my shoulders then adjusting everything to cover correctly. The pair I received is just ever so slightly off center in the front but that can be accounted for by my body not being perfectly asymmetric. The pads protect modesty and do not move or shift. The bands were tight enough to keep everything in place with no slippage. Wore these while doing household chores and never had to readjust all day. Very comfortable. [SEP] Based on the my measurements, this should have fit better. It's really too tight which makes it not as comfortable as I like. I guess it's wearable in a pinch, but it's not going to be my favorite. The tightness leads to the creation of an extra boob on my back which isn't very flattering. My husband said of the extra boob, ""well, at least it doesn't have its own cleavage"". Thanks! I'm going to try for the next size up. [SEP] I'm not one for wearing strapless anything because I find strapless bras to be so uncomfortable. This tube bra has changed the game. It's comfortable with nice padding. I'm super sensitive to anything on my skin, but the bra fits perfectly. There's no issue with elastic, though it does roll a little bit underneath. I would have given 5 stars, but I received the purple/lilac bra which apparently doesn't come in a 2-pack. It's actually very deceptive as the item description says 2-pack, but the photos underneath clearly show the purple by itself. [SEP] The PlusFeel woman's wireless, strap free tube bra is actually not too bad to wear. It's comfortable, fabric is stretchy, not too difficult to put on & also stays put when worn. Materials are made of 97% Nylon & 3% Spandex & the quality is there, doesn't feel cheaply made at all. However the only flaw is that this may not be the best option for small busted woman due to the pads which appear way too big & round giving you a bit of an exaggerated chest. When I first put it on, I found myself constantly gripping my chest in awe of how it felt to have a bigger chest than I actually had. While it was fun for a few moments, when reality set in, it just didn't feel natural. However after washing it a few times & letting it get a bit used more, the larger bust became more tolerable. I love the lavender color as it's aesthetic & pretty looking. The description states this is a two pack but I only recieved 1 strapless bra. If you have a bigger cup size this would be the bra for you. I would recommend it. [SEP] This Extra Large size was too snug for me so I gave this one to a neighbor who is very pleased with it.<br />She wears a size 16 top and says this XL is just perfect.",3,True

[SEP] Good for the price. [SEP] Amazing necklace for the price! [SEP] I had high hopes for this necklace, despite it's price.  It is attractive, though the way it was put together some of the &#34;hardware&#34; behind the scenes shows.  On the necklace we received, on the right side, the layers are not as close in the picture and you can see the rings that hold it together through the gap.  That being said, the necklace is still attractive and my wife likes it.  For the price I am not terribly surprised, but it would be five stars without the visual appearance resulting from poor construction.<br /><br />One note, the &#34;leaves&#34; are not all individual, but are connected in rows.  It doesn't move as though they were all separate pieces, if that's something you're looking for. [SEP] Simply beautiful! [SEP] Came broken in three places.

Not the best and definitely more on the costumes side. For the quality I think you could find earrings such as these for less elsewhere. But if you're in a pinch, the different shapes offer nice variety and if anything they make good backups. [SEP] Nine pairs of awesome bling in a variety of styles. I love the large cubic zirconia and I was surprised by how easily I was able to insert the post and how comfortable this was in my earlobe. These come in a lovely, black velveteen bag. I think the quality of the materials and construction is excellent! They will make a stunning gift! [SEP] This selection of stud earrings is great!  I love wearing studs and like that none of them are very big.  I play a lot of tennis and want to wear earrings, but they have to be small and these work out very well.  The stones are lovely and the diamond ones are very sparkly.  The black ones have a very unique and beautiful look.  The backing is a regular butterfly backing and it holds the earrings in place very well.  They never feel like they are coming loose and I haven't had one fall out yet.  I'm really surprised at how nice these earrings are and so inexpensive which is extra good since I lose earrings all the time. [SEP] I got these earrings for myself and my wife to share. I am a male and have one piercing on my ear and she uses 2 earrings. In both cases they fit well and looked nice, a good size for both of us.<br /><br />Quality: These are made of solid metal and nice looking stones in them. They have nice strong backings and do not slip off at all. They did not leave any marking or coloring on my skin after I took them off. I feel they are a nice, high quality set<br /><br />This is a nice varied set with black, silver and gold metal and different colored stones such as black or ""diamond"" looking stones as well. I recommend them to anybody looking for a nice value set with many different styles to wear. [SEP] I love the size of all the earrings in the collection. It came housed in a little black bag and separated by small plastic bags (I appreciate the sanitary extra steps). I love the size of the earrings they are more discreet and aren't too in your face when you're wearing them. The variety of earrings that come in this set is perfect for anyone who likes to switch around and have choices. With a combination of rounded and square style earrings. Each of the earrings come with the earring itself and a back that holds them in place. [SEP] I received nine pairs of stainless steel earrings. I attached a pic of my favorite ones - they're the most minimalistic of the lot, showing very little stainless steel. Some have a gold backing, some silver, and some all black. The latter will take some getting used to, but I'll wear them in the winter. They look a little glass-like. These are earrings you can wear daily. Only thing is - they're hard to take off! [SEP] My wife really likes this studs set as they are well made, offer a good variety of choices in terms of colors and size that should go with most everyday wear<br /><br />- Comes with 2 pairs each of black, sliver and gold plated studs with round and square imitation diamond inserts and then three pairs of black, silver and gold plated studs with a slightly larger round stone insert<br />- They are well made and easy to put on and take off<br />- The stoppers have a notch in them that provides some resistance while removing it, this prevent accidental opening while wearing them<br />- Very lightweight<br />- My wife reported no skin irritations or reactions while using them all day long<br />- Comes wrapped in individual plastic wrappers and a velvet drawstring pouch for easy storage<br />- Stoppers are inter-compatible with each other,  so even if you loose one , you can use the ones from others<br />- The imitation diamond quality is good and they do sparkly nicely under proper lighting<br /><br />Overall this is a very decent set that goes with almost all daily wear styles and it is inexpensive as well as you get a lot of different studs/styles for the money . My wife definitely recommends them [SEP] I got these for my wife and she really likes them. They are different colors and shapes. Perfect to wear when going out casually and its very easy to find something to match. White, yellow or black! [SEP] Great value set of earrings, the quality of every one of them feels great.

[SEP] These are such pretty earrings! They look much better in person, very sparkly and fancy looking. They would be great for formal wear or to dress up an outfit. Even the box they come in is pretty, making them perfect for gift giving. I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised and pleased with these earrings. I highly recommend these! [SEP] These are really pretty!  They are great earrings for a special occasion and will add a glamorous touch to any outfit.  They are surprisingly lightweight and do not pull at my piercings and earlobes as some heavier earrings tend to do.  The gold metal is more champagne than yellow.  Not brassy at all.  The miniature stones grab just the right amount of light to keep things looking classy and not gaudy.  The leaf design is gorgeous and interesting to look at, and the teardrop is flexible and hangs via a hinge on the underside of the leaf.  It gives the earrings a bit of give which makes them comfortable to wear.  The price is a bit high for the quality of the pair but they can definitely be worth it if they're meant for a special event. [SEP] My wife reviewed this item: These earrings are definitely eye-catching - they are large, dazzling, and have ""wow"" factor.  They are perfect to pair up with a plain black cocktail dress to add a little pizzazz.  We could not capture in a photograph just how sparkly these earrings are - they catch the light as you walk across the room.  Deducted a point from the rating because they are a little heavy (I would not wear longer than an evening at a party) and make a slight clinking noise near my ear. [SEP] I was really impressed with the quality and sparkle of these earrings. They have a really regal design that looks great with a high necked dress that you can't wear a necklace with. These aren't overly heavy or uncomfortable to wear for an evening out and they don't make my ears itch (I'm allergic to nickel). They are a beautiful set of statement earrings to have in your arsenal for special occasions! [SEP] As an Amazon Reviewer, I‚Äôm sorry to say that I can‚Äôt Review the Crystal Teardrop Earrings because, I received a little Bronze colored Wing Bracelet instead. All I can say about the Crystal Earrings is, I wish I Had received them to Review because, I think they‚Äôre quite pretty from the pictures. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt help anymore than that.<br />  I can say that I have received a different set of Earrings that Umamebet made, the makers of this product and they are Very beautiful. Enjoy! [SEP] Let's be real, these aren't earrings you'll wear to work or just daily, hanging out, but they're a lot of fun when you want to get dressed up. They're nicely oversized and have tons and tons of glitter and shine. I have long hair and earrings don't always show when I wear my hair down but these definitely stood out. They're easy to wear, not heavy at all; the bottom can swing independently of the top part so they don't feel clunky when you move.<br /><br />These would be great with a holiday outfit or for special occasions like weddings, etc. [SEP] My wife tells me that she really likes the Umamebet Elegant Leaf Dangle Earrings for Women Gold Plated Crystal Teardrop Earrings. She finds them to be classy and elegant. They are just the right size‚Äînot overly large and not too small. She feels that they are dressy and would go well for a formal or semi-formal occasion or even for dinner out with your husband (ahem!)

The mesh band is so sparkly shiny it looks like pave diamonds in sunlight..  Does not look cheap at all.  That being said, I am worried about the tarnishing some of the reviews mention, due to it most likely being a thin silver-plate.  So I purchase a silver polish &#34;anti-tarnish&#34; product to coat them and hopefully lengthen the silver finish on them. I get it, they are so cheaply affordable, what do you expect.  You could buy a couple of these and rotate wearing them if you love them so much.  Would like to find the exact thing in sterling at an affordable price as these truly are beautiful.

If you are looking for something to wear a few times, maybe to a Luau or something like that it would be fine. Definitely not made for every day wear. It is comfortable so that is a plus. It is adjustable so it will fit any arm. It‚Äôs a cute little bracelet but it looks cheap with little tiny fake diamonds in the gold shell on the front. This one is a toss up. [SEP] This shell bracelet is even prettier than I expected. It's got a good range of adjustability, it fits both myself and my daughter. It looks like it can be worn for both casual and dressy occasions. I love it.<br /><br />1 star - awful! want my money back!<br />2 stars - bad but not horrendous<br />3 stars - decent/good<br />4 stars - really good!<br />5 stars - excellent! definitely recommend! [SEP] It's great for a kid or teenager - it looks cheesy, the roping has a sheen that I don't like. It's cute but fragile. [SEP] This handmade bracelet is kind of cute. I can't really imagine what an adult would wear it with, but it's an okay piece of costume jewelry for teens and preteens. It's just very simple and slightly ornamental.<br /><br />No price currently listed on it, so I'm not sure whether it's a good value or not. Might be good party favors if your younger one is having a Little Mermaid or Moana party. [SEP] I received 2 of these cute little bracelets. One with 4 shells and 1 with 6. The 4 shell bracelet won‚Äôt go over my hand even though it says it extends to 13‚Äù. It has the same specs as the 6 shell on the sales page, but in real life it‚Äôs much smaller. It‚Äôs a cheap little item and doesn‚Äôt look like it would last long, but I bet a 12 year old would Love it. It comes in a pretty velvet pouch and would make a perfect stocking stuffer. [SEP] This bracelet is a cute, dainty summer bracelet. It is adjustable so it is easy to put on and off.  The shells lay flat on your wrist and are lightweight. The shells are real and natural except for the middle shell which is goldstone which is a nice accent. The bracelet comes in a nice light pink gift bag which makes it great for gift giving. It's a great summer look! [SEP] The Hugitout Women's Natural Cowrie Shell Bracelet is a rather cute bracelet that I think you will either like for casual wear or just plain hate. I gave it to my girlfriend to try out and she did not like it one bit.  It does come in a nice pink flannel bag. The bag will make for a nice gift package, but that all will end rather quickly if the bracelet is not liked.<br /><br />I think the bracelet would appeal more to a teen than most adult women.  I think I am generous in giving it 3 Stars. There is no price listed at the present; so I can not say whether it is a good deal or not. Also as I said, I think this is basically cute costume jewelry, designed more with a teenager in mind.<br />Thanks! [SEP] I really like the knots for adjusting the bracelet, the gold shell and the natural ones. It's pretty and dressy, yet a bit casual. Jeans or a dress - works for me! Makes a nice gift. [SEP] Beautiful, simple, cowrie shell bracelet made with an intricately braided wax cord. Natural cowrie shells are attached to the cord throughout the bracelet. Very soft pink colored enameled shells.<br /><br />The bracelet length is adjustable from 6.7‚Äù to 13.4‚Äù. All you need to do is adjust the slip knot to adjust the length.<br /><br />It is recommended to clean by hand with a soft cloth. Best to store in flannel to avoid damage. Be sure to keep it dry.<br /><br />The package includes:<br />(1) 1 shell bracelet<br />(2) 1 pink velvet drawstring<br /><br />100% Money Back Guarantee [SEP] Despite the model, this won't improve your cleavage. With that in mind, it's really fun for teens. Looks great with a tee and shorts for beach outings or summer-themed parties.  Definitely not an expensive piece (not sure what they plan to charge), so you won't have to worry about breaking or losing it.  This would probably be $5 from a beach stall; hopefully they'll price it accordingly.",3,True
Primesons Sparkling Colors Flowerets Vine Swiss Cubic Zirconia 18K Rose Gold Plated Hoop Earrings For Women,[],[],,3.9,19,2118,"Very pretty, looks exactly like the picture you see online. [SEP] Thee are very pretty PrimeSons cubic zirconia 18Kt rose gold plated lever-back earrings. The pronged cubic zirconia stones look like (but are not, garnet, pink tormaline, green peridot, yellow sapphire). The rose gold plating is nice. And I especially love the lever-back because sometimes you're not able to find the backing. Just put them on, push the lever closed, and you're on your way. No more looking on the floor for lost metal or plastic stoppers. More dressy but could also wear with casual clothing and no worry of losing an actual gemstone. This is a good thing. [SEP] I like this pair of earrings very much, but am not sure if maybe others have had the same problem - the post section of these earrings seems incredibly thick or big around compared to any of the post earrings and even the more dangly ones I have that use a post with a clip in the back.  I had more trouble getting these posts to go all the way through the holes in my ears!  Mind you, I am in my 60s and had those holes pierced back when I was 14 years old so it's not like they are new!  I do know that over the years the holes in my earlobes are not technically healed, per se.  I can push an earring post in the front hole and poke all around inside my earlobe before finding the hole in the backside of the earlobe.  I mention this because I literally spent 20 minutes sitting on my bed trying to get these ""fatty"" posts to go all the way through to the back hole.  After a while it starts to hurt when I'm poking and poking and poking to find the back hole...and that's what happened with these.  I felt it was due more to the size of the post than my ""floating"" hole in the back.  With a thinner earring post, even if I poke, I usually am able to find that back hole within a couple of minutes.  All I can say is that after I got them in, they looked nice and were relatively lightweight on my ears.  Just think a thinner post size would have made these easier for me to wear. [SEP] (Reviewed by my wife): Unfortunately the posts on these earrings are way too thick for me to even get in my earring holes, rendering them totally unwearable for me.  Otherwise, I find these earrings absolutely beautiful.  The multi-colored stones against the rose gold background is lovely. [SEP] These earrings are sturdy and strong and as pictured. They have held up thus far and I receive complements whenever I wear them. They are comfortable and well-made. I like to wear them even with dressed down/casual clothing but it can definitely be worn with more formal wear. [SEP] I enjoy these earrings. Personally I might have liked them a bit more made with yellow gold than rose gold but the rose gold is eye catching with the various colored crystals.<br /><br />I saw a couple of reviews that said the post was too big to fit through their piercing hole in their ears but they fit fine in mine and mine are not stretched at all.<br /><br />These earrings have a little weight to them but did not feel over heavy to me when I wore them for a few hours.<br /><br />I don't consider these to be a real dress-up pair of earrings but more of a ""let's go out dancing and have loads of fun"" pair of earrings. [SEP] These looked way better online than they do in person. They ended up being way too gawdy and chunky and they were definitely more on the ‚Äúdated‚Äù looking side as well.<br />My initial thought when I first saw them was how fake they looked. The metal had that ‚Äúoverly shiny‚Äù fake look to it and they just weren‚Äôt what I had hoped for.<br />They were very lightweight though and did not weigh my ears down.",3,True
accsa Women Fedora Straw Bucket Hat Travel Carry Foldable Summer Sunhat Brown,['Machine Wash'],[],,4.0,22,44248,"I have adjusted my rating of this hat after a long day in full sun. The weave is too open to actually keep the sun off my face. I got color despite wearing the hat all day. This brings it from being a versatile sun hat, to being just a fashion accessory. This can no longer be my go-to hat. My original review (unchanged) is below.<br />‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî<br />I was disappointed when I first took this hat out of the package. Crumbled up, without a head inside to give it shape, it really looked pretty bad. Then I tried it on. What a difference! It‚Äôs actually a REALLY CUTE hat! And it‚Äôs incredibly versatile! It has a flexible wire around the brim. This lent to it looking bad right out of the package, but it means that you can fold it into any shape you want - and it stays that way! I had skin cancer on my nose, and need to wear sunscreen plus a wide-brimmed hat at all times while outdoors. Therefore I have amassed a bit of a collection of hats, and this is the only one that I can fold up however I like without having to constantly readjust it. This will be my go-to hat.<br /><br />This hat is also a loose weave - lots of air holes woven throughout, so it shouldn‚Äôt get too hot. The fabric feels soft and nice quality. The brown color is more of a rust (the last two photos show the color best. I included two different photos of me wearing it so you can see how much you can bend it into whatever shape you like. I guess if I had to say anything at all negative about it, it‚Äôs that the brim is not as wide as I‚Äôd like it. Depending on the sun angle, it may not protect my entire face. Other than that, I love it. [SEP] This hat is cute, lightweight, and can be folded to fit into a tote even a large handbag. I wish it were just a tad bigger because I have a big head, but I will still wear this all the same. [SEP] Have you ever tried to pack a straw hat in a suitcase to bring with you on vacation; I made this mistake once as I didn't feel like wearing it on the plane. And although I took good care to pack it nicely, I arrived at my destination only to open my suitcase and find my hat crushed. Well this adorable foldable hat by accsa is the ideal solution to always having a hat to protect you from the sun wherever you go. Whether it's an overnight bag, a beach bag, or even your handbag, you'll never be without some shade and style when you want it! Personally I think the style is one that would suit a woman of any age with it's open weave and medium brim. My Grandma used to crochet doilies and dip them in a sugar mixture to stiffen them and this hat reminds me of them with it's lace like delicacy. As far as size, I have a large head, or at least I've been told I do, and this hat fits me comfortably. It has a ribbon sewn in the inside brim should you need to adjust it to a tighter fit. As far as the sun protection claim the manufacturer makes ,I trust that it will do it's job in keeping me cooler and more comfortable. I use sunscreen so I will not be solely relying on this hat for total protection. The only thing I suggest is choosing a color that suits you best. Mine is a lovely carmel shade and I like it very much. I've posted some photos to give you an idea of how flat this hat folds and how it easily returns to a structure shape by adjusting the hidden wire in the brim. I hope I helped you a bit in your decision. It's a very cute hat. [SEP] cute, easy to pack.  There is some sort of wiring within the hat so you can shape it however you like.  I got it for the beach and I haven't gone yet to give it a try, so more information is coming in the near future. [SEP] This is a great travel hat as it folds up and can be unfolded to get back to whatever shape you want. Not sure it would prevent burning on your head due to the mesh-like fabric, but to block some sun it would be cute. Just not on me. I guess I am just not a hat girl. I wanted it to look good. [SEP] This review is for a crushable summer straw hat.  The kind you can roll up and put in your suitcase and be able to take out and have it look like new when you take it out.  It is a straw color, maybe a tad bit darker than that.  It fits you if you don't have a tiny head.  It also has a strap that you can attach to the hat to hold it on your head in case of wind.  It fits me fine.  You can adjust the brim, nice little summer hat. [SEP] The accsa Women Summer Straw Bucket Hat Sun is a nice foldable hat to wear when working in the yard or lazing around on a summer's day. The hat has a nice brim that extends outward with a wire around the edge. This makes it easy to shape it just the way you want it to look. This is also a nice feature for those days when you are not sure you need a hat or not. The accsa hat can be flattened and thrown in your day pack, then pulled out if needed.<br /><br /> It is made of 50% cotton and 50% linen with an open weave that allows your head to breathe. A nice feature for those hot summer days with one exception; it doesn't really provide protection from the sun's rays on your face. You will still need sun screen on your face and nose when you wear this hat.<br /><br />This is a fairly affordable foldable summer hat that comes in an assortment of colors and really looks cute. At the current price of $16.99 I think it is a fair deal. I am not sure I would call it a bargain, but that is for you to decide. I knocked off 1 star for the pricing and 1 star for the lack of UV protection. You may disagree with me here, but that is my assessment. As always, I hope this review will help others with their shopping decision. [SEP] The hat is nice and lightweight for summer. The brim is smaller which is my preference. I had hoped to use it while driving in the convertible which, unfortunately, didn‚Äôt stay put, but otherwise it‚Äôs a nice summer hat. [SEP] Having a small head, I've found it very difficult to find any kind of hat that didn't end up almost covering my eyes. Therefore, when I read that this was adjustable, I had to give it a try, and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It actually fits my head, and that's a minor miracle. Even without adjusting it, it fits pretty well so, if you have a large head, this might be a bit small.<br />2. It's made of cotton and linen, which should keep my head from sweating.<br />3. It's nice and lightweight, and folds nicely for packing.<br />4. The brim has something that stiffens it all the way around, which makes it adjustable there, too.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The ribbon that is used to size the head band is kind of flimsy, and I wish they had used something a bit more substantial. However, I didn't think that was enough to dock it a star.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this hat, and am confident I'll get a lot of wear out of it this summer. If you have a small head and have been as frustrated as I've been regarding finding sun hats that fit, you should give this a try. [SEP] Note that this was designed in the UK.  What do they have there? Clouds and rain.  The holes in this hat means it's fine for keeping your hair out of your face on a windy day (and it's snug enough to stay on your head in that weather), but it's not good for sun protection. It's really cute and it does fold and pack up well.  I'm keeping it as a spare in my car for windy days, but I won't be counting on it as a sun blocker.

The neck line is also very strangely made. Can be a bit uncomfortable at times, construction is just so weird. The stitching is just decent loose threads here and there but not the worst job. The fabric feels like that fabric that would snag and catch on everything.

They're thicker and on the warm side.  I especially loved the cute, vibrant colors though.  They look and feel great! [SEP] These are thicker socks that have arch support. They have just right amount of stretch and they feel like they will not stretch out after a few wears. The heel and the foot part is fitted for better comfort and support. Fabric feels ok to the skin but it doesn‚Äôt feel like the traditional cotton socks. The colors are quite wild for me, but it makes them easy to find in my drawers. I wear size 10 shoes and these socks are size small - they fit my feet really well.<br />Thicker material will keep these socks last longer - so these are great for the money. [SEP] These socks are so nice and well made. They are thick and keep your feet super warm. I personally can't even wear them yet because my feet get hot quickly, but we are going on a trip to the mountains around Christmas where it will be freezing and snowing, so I know these thick, warm socks will come in handy then. I really love the color scheme as well with the dark gray, blue, and pink. [SEP] Bright, vibrant colors, nice design and detailing to these socks. They are a really thick material and something you'd trust wearing as you're hiking, biking, snowboarding, anything outdoors, or, even indoors where you want to stay cozy and warm. If you have thicker calves, these could be snug, I'd recommend sizing up. They do have a little gripper on the bottom of the sock that adds a nice texture to the sock and protection. The wash nice is cooler water, no issues in the dryer with shrinkage. [SEP] These were too small for my granddaughter (size 8) so we gave them to the daughter of a friend who was going to a Juniors camp in the mountains where it gets very cold at night.<br />She returned after two weeks and had nothing but praise for these socks. They worked perfectly with both her hiking boots and her sneakers, stayed up and did not bunch up in the shoes, were easy to wash by hand, dried quickly and kept her feet warm at night.<br />She said she wore these more than any of her other socks, washing them immediately after wearing them so they would be dry enough to wear to bed.<br />She said while wearing these socks she had absolutely no blisters and her feet felt more comfortable and dryer than with her other socks.<br />Her mom is also impressed with them and has ordered ""several additional pairs"" at her daughter's insistence in every color and pattern. [SEP] These socks not only look good, they feel good too. They're very soft and they're seamless at the toe.  They stretch well and should fit most feet - wide or narrow - nicely.<br /><br />The socks are made for your left and right feet, like a pair of shoes and it's easy to tell them. apart.  I like wearing these for long walks or hikes. The padding keeps my feet comfortable for hours and they're very good at wicking away moisture.<br /><br />They're a bit snug around the ankle, but that's my only (minor) complaint. [SEP] I have these in the pink tie dye print and love the design.  They are very cushiony and comfortable and the thinner arch support band is nice.  The think I love the most about the fit is that there is plenty of room in the toe area for toes to spread comfortably without being so much fabric that they bunch up inside of shoes.  They are also seamless at the toes.  I did not notice that the size chart lists the small size as lower than my size 8 foot.  These fit me really well in the foot but I could use some more width in the ankle area.  I'll wear these a lot anyway but if I order another pattern, I""ll get the medium. [SEP] Excellent, sturdy socks. First, I love the colors offered. So 80s and cool. Second, I like the moisture wicking and feel it works well. Third, while I wasn't worried about debris, I found the top to be just snug enough that the socks don't fall down yet they also aren't so tight that they leave band marks on my leg.  I can't say I felt any arch support, but the sock is plush, comfy, and I really like it. Will wear them often.",3,True

As for the ""arch support"" I don't notice anything special about it. The middle part of the sock with the ridges does feel a smidgen tighter than the rest of the sock but it's not uncomfortable and definitely not strong enough to provide any sort of arch support.

The seam on the toe doesn't bother me as it's very low profile.. I can't feel it rub against my toes at all.

In his direct quote "" These socks are soft not to thick and pleasing to wear, they didn't make my feet hot or wet. My shoe's weren't wet or stinky inside. There  was mild dampness but nothing compared to what regular socks do when he wears them. I have worn both boots and tennis shoes and canvas shoes. The band didn't cut into my calf . Which he was worried about because so other's have after long hours. I hope this has helped. Thank You [SEP] As far as aesthetics are concerned, these socks are like any other sock, or rather more like dress socks in their weight and in the way that they feel-- They're thin, lightweight, and soft.  They fall somewhere in the middle of the ankle, so maybe slightly higher than most socks do.  I would recommend a gentle wash for these, nothing too rough. As for performance,  I have tested these socks on two sets of notoriously stinky feet.  I haven't been brave enough to stick them up to my nose, but I can say that I didn't notice the usual funk when they took their shoes off (Yeah, they're really that bad) They also felt that their feet were less stinky as well, and drier then when they had worn their regular socks. [SEP] I've worn these socks to church and I've worn them while mowing the lawn.  These socks stay snugly fit even after wearing them all day. They don't bind on my foot or ankle. They don't pull back on my toes nor do the come lose and bunch up around my toes. I'm happy with these socks and would recommend them to anyone that wants a good fitting, quality made sock. [SEP] These are thin-medium thickness ankle socks. They are breathable and do soak up sweat like the description says. These are good to run in and after laundering them they retain the same characteristics. They do not slip off of my feet also so the elastic is good. I will continue to wear these for a long time.

They come packed nicely in a magnetic closure gift box and would be a great gift for someone who prefers a thinner sock.The missing pair in the photo happens to be on my feet!",3,True

I had to wear this hat about 30 minutes before it loosened up enough to feel comfortable. I always take a size small hat, so I think anyone who has a medium or large head would get a headache at least at the beginning until the band loosened. The tight band is necessary to keep the hat secured, but it did take some getting use to.<br /><br />- Second, the rim is folded over and it takes a lot of effort to have it folded the right way. After 30 minutes, the rim stayed put but then it folded over again during non-use.  The second photo shows the rim folded over the cap lid and the third photo shows it folded correctly. It has to be folded correctly to secure the cap to the head, otherwise there is no elastic to keep it in place.<br /><br />Since I take a size small cap and the rim will eventually stretch and stay put, I love this hat and cannot wait to wear it during the winter (with ear muffs, of course).

The sock part is fine and the pattern looks cool, but I cannot get the rest of the sock on my leg. [SEP] I can‚Äôt get over how nice these two colors go together. The pink is so bright. Both colors make me happy to look at. They‚Äôre my favorite. But they were so hard to get on. And too tight. I felt like my circulation was being cut off. One was smaller than the other. They are thick but not thick like wool or thermal socks. Definitely a winter sock for me. My feet get hot easy. They are soft so that‚Äôs a plus. It‚Äôs all in what you like as for as tightness. [SEP] I'm a size 8.5 and these work pretty well for me.  I can see how some people with smaller shoe sizes might have issues and that's the difficulty with compression socks - they really do need a wide variety of sizes since there is such a thing as ""squeezing too hard"" and unless you have hospital compression socks, it's not quite so readily easily to achieve that in a commercial market.<br /><br />But at 8.5, they work pretty well for me.<br /><br />On the down side, I am worried about the long-term life of the socks as they are exhibiting some wear after several weeks.  If you're looking to use these constantly, you may want consider the choice carefully. [SEP] Got these for myself. Be aware, compression socks always run TIGHT. As a nurse, I learned to stretch them out before trying to put them on patients. Take an end in each hand & pull out as far as possible, repeat several times. To put on, gather them up at the opening & stretch hard, making the opening easier to slide over toes. Once they're on, you'll find they feel REALLY good, decreased ankle swelling when taken off. Easier to put on with repeat wear. [SEP] I do have to mention that I got the wrong size by mistake. I wear a woman‚Äôs size small and mistakenly got the L/XL. While the foot part is noticeably too long for me, I was still able to wear them with a pair of roomy boots. The first thing I noticed was how roomy the toe area is! My toes have more than enough space to wiggle in these socks. Being that I got a to big size, the leg portion needed to be folded down but that‚Äôs ok. The compression on the socks is no joke! I suffer from constant pain and swelling in my lower legs and these socks absolutely prevented my legs from swelling. I did notice, tho..I almost think that for a L/XL , these are very very tight. I had a really difficult time getting these on and my legs are small. I should mention, though, I also have bad arthritis in my hands so that may have added to my difficulties. [SEP] These are tight without feeling like my legs can't breathe. Yes, legs don't breathe. But clothing breathes. These compression socks compress without squeezing. They also look pretty good! [SEP] I‚Äôm plus size and when I saw these out of the package I thought there was no way they would fit.  I put them on and was surprised at how comfortable they were.  They provide a lot of compression and feel good on my tired legs.  The foot part has a lot of cushioning like a great pair of running socks. [SEP] I can‚Äôt get over how nice these two colors go together. The pink is so bright. Both colors make me happy to look at. They‚Äôre my favorite. But they were so hard to get on. And too tight.

They are soft so that‚Äôs a plus. It‚Äôs all in what you like as for as tightness. [SEP] These are nicely made, good quality socks. It is a little hard to put on and it does indeed provide compression to my leg. There is no bad smells from the fabric. The color is a little bit too bright for my taste. These socks are solid and I assume they will last for a while. [SEP] Fabric quality is good. Stitches are solid. Very bright colors. They provide nice compression to both legs. Might be a little too much at the beginning if you are not used to. They are a little too long, but if you don't stretch them a lot from your ankles, they can fit right below the knee, otherwise they can go half way the knee.<br />I did not like that the sides of the toes are way too big/loose, that extra fabric next to the big toe and the little toe which might seem nothing in the pics but it is considerable while wearing shoes.

One really cool thing I noticed is that when you‚Äôre wearing these, and you look at a digital screen (phone, GPS, etc), the white looks like a hologram. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but very cool. Buy some so you can check it out! [SEP] These were labeled as being for men or women, but they‚Äôre BIG. In fact, I double checked to see they if they‚Äôre meant to be worn over regular glasses. They‚Äôre not. Because of the size, I think they‚Äôre best suited for men, but as others have noted, the sides have a delicate, unmanly design on them.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is how flimsy and cheap they feel. Given that sunglasses can take a beating in the summer, I don‚Äôt think these will last long. The soft case really offers protection only against scratches.<br /><br />My husband really dislikes the style so, unless a friend wants them, it looks like they‚Äôll end up in the charity box. [SEP] I‚Äôm used to plastic frames with black lenses so these wire frames with coffee lenses took a bit to get used to. The wire feels less durable at first. After using for a while they are holding up very well, and I have now gotten used to them. The lenses are large, but they are shaped in a way that allows them to look ok on my medium face, and very nice on my wife‚Äôs large face. The polarization does work, and the difference is noticeable; try them in the rain and you see the difference right away. For the price you can‚Äôt go wrong. [SEP] It fits very well, but the finish on this is not good.  Nose area is crooked. The styling is based on your taste.  I think it looks good.  I have the coffee golden tea color.  The lens makes everything brown.  So i could not wear this as it bothers me. [SEP] These are firstly very inexpensive glasses and they feel like it. When you wear them - you cannot tell the quality but holding in hands they do feel cheap. The design is fun with cognac tinted lens and ornate design on the metal frame. My glasses came In brand new with slight tarnishing around the frame - which makes me think that they will not last long. The shape is fairly flattering and I believe it would fit most face shapes. They came in a carrying case to protect glasses when not worn. Overall I think you get what you pay for - this is something great to take on vacation and not worry if they get lost or broken. [SEP] These reminded me of the 70's or early 80's sunglasses. They are big!!! Bob seen them and claimed them he LOVES everything from the 70's and 80's. They fit well and do their job. And are priced very reasonable!!. I hope this has helped. Thank You [SEP] You look like you belong in a 70's or 80's movie with these in a nice car with the top down.  Stylish and compliments are more than welcome with these glasses.  Quality is good and they do not bend easily, sturdy. [SEP] These Skyway Aviator Polarized Oversized Sunglasses are definitely big.  They put the ""over"" in oversized.  I actually appreciate this fact, as they protect a larger area around the eye than standard sunglasses, but I can see where this might be a turn off for some folks.<br /><br />  I'm not an extremely fashionable guy, but these glasses don't give off a very fashionable vibe.  They have a whole ""guy attempting to look wealthier than he really is"" air about them.  I can see these on a dude from the 70's with his shirt open and a hairy chest.<br /><br />These glasses also sit very high on my nose.  This allows light to crawl in from beneath the lenses.  The sides and top are protected well.<br /><br />Overall, these glasses are definitely a bold and/or unusual fashion choice.  I'll wear them while driving, but that's about it. [SEP] These are a Christmas present so I hope he likes them",3,True

These pants, in size small, fit her perfectly in the waist and through the hips and thighs. The only issue with these pants is the length. These are much too long for her, even when she wears heels. Other than being too long, these pants have a palazzo style that looks flattering and fashionable. The pull-on elastic band and loose fitting legs make these comfortable to wear. We will see about getting these hemmed so that she can wear them with flat shoes and sandals. [SEP] These pants are very cute but they are not petite friendly. I'm 5'2 and they are incredibly long. MIGHT be able to pull them off in really tall wedges, otherwise will have to get them altered.<br />They also have an incredibly short inseam! If this weren't the case and I could pull these up high enough, they might not be as long in the legs. Pants like these (paper bag waist) are meant to be high-waisted and that is NOT the case with these! The pictures are extremely misleading!!! They DO NOT go up to your waist. I would go as far as to say that I consider these to be low rise. NOT what you want in this type of pant.<br />Would be great if they didn't have this design flaw.<br />The material is nice and thick, the color is true black and they look very nice and dressy. They just don't fit right. Even for taller women, these just wouldn't work since the ""inseam is so incredibly short. [SEP] I found these flowy high-waisted black pants to be quite adorable.

The leg openings were exactly as pictured and can be worn with heels or paired with flats/sandals to drag the ground.<br />The only negative I have with these pants is the material.  It is listed as a polyester blend and felt really hot to me.  I probably will not wear these in the summer but they are definitely a cute transition piece for spring or fall.  The price is also great, you cannot beat $20 for a wardrobe staple!  Overall, I highly recommend. [SEP] Potash womens highwaisted V cut pants. These are really cut and flare legged.

The length was really long on me so I had to wear high heels underneath so I was not walking on the hem of the pants. I am short so I expected these to be long on me. The legs are a wide leg so allow freedom of movement and the pants are a medium weight material. These are not see through and they are comfortable to wear.  Overall cute pants if a bit long. [SEP] I wanted to love these but the fabric was lacking durability. I will have to say they look super adorable standing straight for a pose but unfortunately would not wear out in public.

The set would be a thoughtful gift as it comes with several pairs of socks in light, medium and dark colors.<br />I dont hand wash as it suggests, but I do wash on the gentle cycle with woolite and they do  hold up excellent this way. They actually get softer when I use Downy.  I wear these alone at home without slippers or out with my boots or even my tennis shoes. I like the thickness of them- they fit fine in my shoes/boots but if your boots are tight, they may make your footwear tight. [SEP] These socks are very soft. I do feel that they run slightly large which may cause them to rub with boots or outdoor activities. They are absolutely perfect for lounging around the house, especially in winter. Very warm and comfy! [SEP] I would definitely recommend these socks. I am allergic to most wools and yet these do not bother my feet. They are the only thing that keeps me warm in the winter. They hold up and wash well. Would definitely recommend them for keeping your feet warm in the winter. [SEP] First thing my wife said after pulling these on was ""oh, wow!"". And her opinion didn't decrease. They're warm, but so light that it doesn't feel like you're wearing anything. They also don't sag--they stay up without feeling tight. [SEP] I received 5 pairs of the style A9 socks. These are cozy socks without being too heavy and bulky, and I like wearing them for the cool mornings and evenings we‚Äôve been having in So Cal. They feel soft enough (though I have softer socks), the color assortment is good and the socks look reasonably well made with few stray threads. The patterns are basic and kind of masculine and could easily be worn by men. These are a crew sock height on me.<br /><br />The A9 socks run really big. The stated range is a women‚Äôs shoe size 5-9.  I wear a women‚Äôs 10 in open toe shoes and 10.5 or 42 Euro in closed toe shoes, yet these border on being too roomy for me. And while they fit okay at first, these stretch out a lot and also slide down. These seem better sized for women in the 9-12 shoe size range (or for men). These are fairly good socks, but they run big and  stretch out bigger. And the directions say to hand wash when these are just basic socks. All things considered, these are just okay. 3 stars. [SEP] These socks were so incredibly soft and great looking that I'm ordering 2 more for gifts. High quality and beautiful colors [SEP] Love them [SEP] Socks are difficult to buy on line since you can see the colors or feel the fabric, but I was quite pleased with these.  They are medium weight (not thin like dress socks but not thick like socks you'd wear hiking either).  They are a nice assortment of colors.<br /><br />They hit a little lower on the calf than I expected, even though I am very short.  The tops stay up for now, but they feel rather loose on my skinny calves so I don't know if they will become looser over time and start to sag.<br /><br />For now they are great and the price was right. [SEP] These socks are exactly what I need during the winter months. Soft, cozy, warm, just the right amount of elastic (not too tight but keeps the sock top in place), they come in neutral gray/white, light gray and black colors.  They look more on the expensive side, I'd say.<br /><br />I wear them with Birkenstock sandals in the winter. Beats any houseshoes I've found for arch support, warmth, and cushion on our hard-wood floors.<br /><br />I wash in cold and line dry, though they'd probably do fine in regular wash and the dryer.

The turtle is such a pretty collection of colors. It looks like its made from a natural stone from the ocean. Although it's only made of alloy, it is well built and strong. I like that the chain is adjustable in length It is a strong chain. [SEP] This is  not fine jewelry, but it is cute and sturdy costume jewelry. I believe the metal is stainless steel. The ""opal"" is a sparkly glittery substance coated with resin. It is not inlayed. My one disappointment with this was that the lobster claw catch seems really cheap and hard to fasten. All of that being said, this is a really cute pendant. It may be intended for children or as a souvenir necklace, I like it and the color is just beautiful, so I hope it lasts. [SEP] I just got this yesterday and am wearing it right now!  The turtle pendant is so cute!  It is silver with brilliant blueish Opal inserts on it's shell back. So beautiful,...and it's very well made.  It's actually smaller than I anticipated, but that's okay...I still love it!  The turtle itself is not quite 1"" tall, and about 3/4"" wide across the top flippers.  Under it's head is a generous opening for a chain, though it comes with a very nice 18"" box chain, and an extra 2"" attached loop chain.  The main chain has a lobster claw clasp, easy to work.  I like the idea of being able to adjust the length. [SEP] Fun piece of casual teen jewelry.  Chain seems fairly good. Turtle is brightly colored, pieces possibly glued in ,would not wear in shower or swimming. [SEP] The stones look like blue opals with a silver encasement that represents a sea-turtle.  The aqua colors from the stone-like gem, combined with the luster of the silver-like sea turtle, is a beautiful combination for the beach going crowd.  Wear it when walking on boardwalks, sunset strolls, or at an ocean side diner - its perfect. [SEP] This necklace is really cute and the quality is good.  Usually it‚Äôs the chain that I expect to change out and I purchase based on the pendant alone.  This chain I will keep on the pendant.  Just make sure the chain is the right size for you.  The necklace is 16-18‚Äùin length.  The chain and the clasp and both good quality with multiple length adjustments.  It doesn‚Äôt tangle.  The turtle is shiny and the stones are very blue with purples and sea green in it also.  Its about the size of a nickel from tip to tip.  The shimmer has a distinct ‚Äúunder the sea‚Äù feeling.  Would look great with casual clothes but very striking with a blue top.  The loop on the pendant has a large opening so any size necklace could be paired with it.  This necklace does not come in a gift box but it would be a very lovely gift for a young girl and for a woman that likes ocean creatures.<br /><br />** review by Mrs. WryGuy2 ** [SEP] It broke the first day. Left my daughter in tears. [SEP] I loved the way this necklace looked in the product image. I did worry, though, that it would be cheaply made in reality, even though it didn‚Äôt look to be in the pictures. I have never found a turtle necklace that I have quite liked the quality of. This necklace, though, it just right.<br /><br />Upon opening, I first noticed the chain. It is thicker than I thought it would be. I do not like chains that are too dainty and this one, while slim, it solid and sturdy feeling. It is also shiny and to me, just the right size. The turtle is colored so beautifully and vibrantly. It is also slightly larger than I though it would be. I was imagining the size of a penny, but this is closer to the size of a nickel, but just slightly larger. The clasp on the chain is easy to use and there are many loop offerings at the end of the other side for multiple length adjustment possibilities.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid necklace and very cute. It has exceeded my expectations in every way and I am very happy with it.<br /><br />Update: the same day I received this and reviewed it, I wore it all day. By the end of the day, the chain hadn't necessarily broken, but there was a gap in the circular connector that allowed the other side to slip away. This an be reattached and tightened, I suppose, but it would be easy to lose due to this issue. The turtle is still beautiful and if the chain does fail beyond repair, I could replace it, but it's just not ideal. [SEP] From any reasonable distance the turtle is very cute and very sparkly, upon closer inspection the ""opal"" is obviously synthetic, more like blue resin with sparkles. On mine the ""gem"" escaped the silver shell lines close to the head which further weakened the opal illusion. And it does not come with a gift box but rather in a resealable bag. Functional, but not a great presentation for gifting. Does this mean I don't like it? Not at all, I like the sea turtle design a lot and the fact that the place on the pendant where the chain attaches is a generous opening it leave a lot of options for replacing the chain for something longer or more robust that the starter chain. This necklace makes a nice ""just because"" gift for a child that can grow with them, or an attractive bit of costume jewelry that can fit a lot of themes (turtles, space, ocean, mermaid, tropical, etc.). [SEP] This is a really cute piece of custom jewelry and the colors are vibrant and its very pleasing to the eye.  My only criticism is that the necklace is a bit metallic for my taste.  I am pretty sure it will stay intact though.  I'm pleased with this and it is a very nice gift for a child but could also be worn by an adult (I'd change the chain probably.)",3,True

[SEP] These are not the best choice for your first hole because they are so small, but they are very lovely all the same.  I like the comfort of the huggie hoops because you can even sleep in them.  These are not exception.  Be sure you know just how small these are before you click the buy now button. They are nice even if so small. [SEP] Make sure you double-check the size before you order - these are super tiny, and probably suited more to a child than an adult.  I wear a lot of tiny huggie earrings, and I have very small ears.  These are almost too small for me.<br /><br />That said, they are beautiful earrings and very comfortable to wear. [SEP] The description of small hoops is no lie.  We are talking smaller than a dime in diameter.  I know the description calls them huggie, sleeper cuffs, meaning they are best worn, I think, as cartilage (upper ear) earrings.  I am fortunate to have fairly slender lobes so these are perfect for me. Dainty earrings that can go with any outfit, dressed up or down.  I was looking for a small pair of hoops to go with a recent turquoise ring purchase: these are perfect!  Very reasonable price, well made and cut as heck!

This shirt fits perfectly in the shoulders, it doesn't hug my waist and it flows nicely over my hips.  There is nothing to dislike about it.  It's blend of cotton and polyester so it shouldn't shrink, or much at all.  It feels loose enough for comfort but isn't baggy looking.  It's light weight so it's good for summer wear.  It's a very pretty shirt. [SEP] Judging by the product photo, this top is supposed to be part of a set of pajamas. That's okay, the top is fine on its own.<br /><br />It fits just a little on the small side. I usually wear a large or medium and the large is a little snug. Because the fabric is thin, it gets a little thinner when it stretches. I still felt comfortable wearing the top in public. It is very cute!<br /><br />I like the embroidered star design. The length is good to wear tucked or not. It is a nice top for warm weather wear. [SEP] I received the black shirt with white stars actually embroidered on them. The fit is as expected. The quality is very nice, been through many washes and still looks as now. The stitches in the embroidery are holding up well as well. Again this is for the specific t-shirt I received. I am not sure of other printed shirts. [SEP] I ordered a size large and I think this black shirt with white outlined stars fits pretty well. I do have a larger size chest (38DD) and there is a tiny bit of stretching in terms of being able to see thru the black shirt a bit near the top but not enough where I wouldn't be able to wear it outside the house. The rest of the shirt is solid black and doesn't look stretched at all. Given the current seller photo the shirt looks more like loungewear (the picture for the black colored shirt is slightly misleading as the shirt does not come with matching shorts) and to me it works just as well as a casual shirt to wear out. I am 5'6"" with a slightly long torso and the shirt comes down to about midway on my rear end.  It is a form fitting shirt and normally I have issues with that as I have a large stomach but I think the black color looks nice and flattering.<br /><br />I washed the shirt according to directions (cold water on the delicate cycle and tumble dry low) and had no issues. [SEP] The t-shirt looked soooo cute in the picture, but I was very disappointed with what I received.<br /><br />I ordered a size large (my usual for a relaxed fit) and it‚Äôs very tight.  It‚Äôs only wearable because the material is so thin and stretchy.  The manufacturer says to refer to the size chart, but no size chart was provided.<br /><br />Speaking of material‚Ä¶the material is very thin.  The shirt is only wearable because it‚Äôs black.  If it was a light color, it would be see-through.  At this price, I wouldn‚Äôt buy this. [SEP] Would of given a 5 star but this just seemed to be on the thin side. I know sometimes that is the style but this one was just a bit odd. The stars were actual thread sewn into the shirt which was a cute touch but I would have preferred the material itself to be a bit thicker. It fit as expected and had a cute stretch to it, just recommend wearing an under shirt with this top. [SEP] The page for this item shows a shirt and shorts combo. I ordered this and expected to get both but instead it was just the shirt. The description says T-SHIRT, however. So my complaint is the pictures or page should be more clear that you're ONLY getting the shirt. It doesn't look as great without the matching shorts to go with it.<br /><br />However the shirt is great otherwise and if you get the shorts that match it's a great combo. The material feels soft and it fits as expected. [SEP] Esstive black women's shirt with stars.  This shirt is cute and comftorable.  It is on the larger size.  I recieved a size medium and I am 5'4 and a 34D and is was a looser fit not fitted at all. The stars are cute and medium sized and the shirt seems to be of decent quality.  The shirt did not shrink from being washed or dried in the dryer.  The black materiel is not see through and the material is of a medium weight. Overall cute shirt for wearing around the house or working out in. [SEP] Comfortable t-shirt, nice materials, perfect for lounging, do errands,casual pair with shorts or jeans. [SEP] This shirt material and fit reminds me of one of my favorite tees. It is so comfortable! The length is perfect - nice and long, but not too long.<br /><br />I am an 8-10 medium/large size. I got a large in this and it is a great fit. Exactly as expected.<br /><br />The star design is really cute. The stars are stitched on, which is, not only, very pretty, but that means the design won't wash off when it's laundered. I think this is shirt that will endure many washings.<br /><br />I'll be wearing this often.",3,True
"Hissox Men's Women's Knee High Patterned Basketball Socks, 1 Pair Red Feather",[],[],,3.7,29,6299,"These socks come up to about the knee on my stepson, and he loves them because bright and colorful socks are the thing to wear with shorts. I like them because they have a bright and stylish pattern that goes with most of his clothes, and they help cut back on ticks and sunburns when he wears them outside.<br /><br />The design hasn't faded in the wash, and they stay up on his legs. [SEP] Well, when I put the left sock on I liked it quite a bit. It went on well and fit nicely. When I went to put the other one on it felt crinkly at the top which I thought was weird but I went ahead and scrunched the sock as one does to pull it on the foot. All was going well until I got to the top of the sock. When I was pulling the top up it started to stretch and pull apart (with little pull, just the tug you would use to pull the top of the sock up). My fingers were starting to go through the fabric where the crinkling was. It was up at top between the first and third lines on the sock, to be more specific.<br />Anyway, for that reason I can't really give these socks a good recommendation. It does seem like most others had better luck with their socks so hopefully this was just a one off sort of thing. I liked the first sock a lot though! [SEP] For reference, I am a female and wear a size 7 wide in shoes, and these socks were too large on my feet BUT fit my calves perfectly and even stayed up nicely throughout the day which I did not expect. (People with thin legs might report differently).<br /><br /> They look so cute with workout shorts or softball pants and with shoes on, so personally the extra roominess in the foot area doesn't bother me. Design is unique and looks just like the picture. Just be aware that with any ""one size fits all"" product (especially unisex ones), that you're probably not going to get the most custom fit, so people with sensory sensitivities might want to find something more custom. [SEP] These athletic socks are super fun. The colors are vibrant. The quality is excellent. The toe and heel is lightly cushioned. They are also labeled ‚Äúleft‚Äù and ‚Äúright‚Äù which always cracks me up so I purposely wear them on the wrong feet. These socks may be super cool, but they aren‚Äôt the boss of me! [SEP] These socks look great and offer great compression.  I do like that it contains cotton as the main ingredient, which is not always the case for compression socks.  It claims that these will fit a men's shoe size 6-11.  I felt like I had plenty of room and I am about 10 1/2.  I can't even imagine anyone with a size 6 wearing these without having a lot of extra material to maneuver through. [SEP] These are a pair of fun socks, especially if you're a sock person. They look exactly as pictured and fit as expected. I wear a 9.5 shoe and they fit nicely. Being that they are unisex, I had my brother try them out at as well (he's bigfoot, size 13!) and they fit him comfortably also. They come all the way up to the knee almost and fit snugly around the leg, but not too tight like compression socks. If you are a little hairy in legs, especially as a man, the socks might pull the hairs a little. They are comfortable and didnt roll down constantly. If you're looking for any type of moisture wicking feature, these are not. All in all, if you're looking for a funky pattern pair of knee high socks then you've chosen the right pair. [SEP] I had better expectations for these socks. I am 5‚Äô11‚Äù and weigh 190 lbs with average sized calves. Shoe size 11. These say they fit between 10-13. They fit well in the toe and foot area. The part that goes up the calf is a bit snug, borderline compression sock, for me anyway. Some areas of the fabric are thick and durable and between the horizontal stripes and the heel portion they are much thinner.  There was a very tiny hole on one sock near the very top that was worsened the first time I put them on. I‚Äôm afraid the hole will continue to worsen at this point. Based on that I‚Äôm skeptical how long the rest of the elasticity will last before the start sliding down my leg. Only time will tell with that one though. I will continue to wear them and see how well they hold up. [SEP] These socks are great for basketball fans. They have a nice, slender fit that is mostly comfy. They are really long, but we all enjoy long socks in our household so they worked fine. They are as pictured and actually look quite ""sporty"" on. [SEP] Everyone wants to create the next evolution of whatever. Hissox is trying to do it with a cool mesh top to these socks. I think that part works, helping my feet stay cool even as they sweat up a storm.<br /><br />The only downside is maybe a little too much plastic and a little more cotton in the bulk of the sock... and maybe one size does not fit all. Nice crazy vibrant colors. [SEP] The little brother tried to steal them, but since the heels came halfway up his calves, he had to leave them for the big basketball player. The print is bright, but the kids like them. They don't fall down, and they do offer some foot support.",3,True
Orchid Row Women's Fall Winter Cold Weather Fashion and Trendy Color Block Knit Pom Pom Beanie and Knit Scarf Set Violet/Black O/S,[],[],,4.6,15,7065,"The scarf is kind of huge, not big enough to be a blanket scarf or wrap for an adult, but too big to be a scarf. The knit is soft and comfortable, not luxurious, but just a nice, solid, knitted basic. Not scratchy, is flexible, and when washed, did not fade or warp. My daughter stole it to snuggle in when she's in her carseat. We both love purple!<br /><br />The hat is my fave. It is a smaller fit but is fine on my (small) head, and the pompom - oh, that pompom... It is super fun and garners compliments at the store or gym. Again, no itchies. I have not tried washing the hat, but given that the scarf did OK, I have high hopes. I have had to wash a similar pompom hat from this brand that my son wears, and it came out still looking new.<br /><br />Good, stylish basics. [SEP] If you live in an area with cold winters, you need winter wear.  The Orchid Row beanie and scarf have you covered.  They are well made, warm, comfy and colorful.  They've got you covered even on the coldest days.  Recommended. [SEP] I like the scarf better than the hat. The hat seems a little too tall especially, when you add the pom pom. It just sort of caves in but not in a sexy way. It's pretty cold, and dry here so it definitely gives my hair the static. So, unless I plan on wearing the hat all day, I usually just skip it. I like the scary well enough. It's  a little wide but also a little short and bulky to wrap around your neck. I sort of just spread it out over my shoulders and left it hang. It keeps be pretty warm. Especially, in my cold office.<br /><br />I love the purple color. It's really pretty. I have a thing for scarves. I just love them. [SEP] The hat is really cute but a bit small for my head or my thick hair.  The scarf is wonderful.  It's wide and fairly thick.  Very nice looking set.",3,True

[SEP] This is a perfect dress. This is more of a size for up to a small size 4. It should fit ages 2-3 really good. This dress is made about as well as a well known Kingdom. It has a hoop slip under the skirting that you have to unfold to make the skirt pouf. When storing, you can fold in a figure 8 twist and it will be flat again. The outside skirt is lots of tulle and the top is made of stretch material with a Velcro closure. Adorable. Just get your little one this cute princess dress. [SEP] This is a cute costume dress for sizes 4 to 6 years, though it looks on the smaller side (like it could fit my 3-year-old niece). There is some elastic around the waistline and the back of the torso area is made of a stretchy fabric, so the dress will expand some to fit several sizes. There is also elastic in the shoulder straps, which also have some colorful gauzy material over the shoulder. The dress has a pink satin underdress with colorful, gauzy panels that gather and are attached at the waist. There's a pink, velvet material for much of the torso, and it has a subtle pink decoration in the velvet. The front panel is purple satin with pink crossing ribbons. The dress is made from 100% polyester.<br /><br />Care instructions: hand wash cold with like colors. Turn inside out. Do not bleach. Do not wring or twist. Lie flat to dry. Do not iron. [SEP] I did not receive the dress pictured, I received an entirely different dress. The dress that I received was still cute, but doesn't seem all that well made. Also, glitter is everywhere. [SEP] A little on the cheap-looking side but my little one still loves it and if they're happy I'm happy! [SEP] I didn't receive a Rainbow Fairy Dress as ordered.  However, I did receive a very pretty pink playtime dress for little girls.  There is no size tag in the dress, but I think is is probably size 4-6.  Actually, I'm glad I received this dress rather than the rainbow dress.  It is so Pretty!<br /><br />The pink dress I received has a close-fitting bodice with short, puffy, shimmery, lavender, inset sleeves.  The bodice front has pink velvet panels at the sides with a ruched panel down the center.  This panel is edged in silvery pink trim that sparkles.  At the center top of the bodice is a 1"" pink gem that is stitched in place.  The sleeves are elasticized at the end to form a ruffle, and a light pink satin ribbon is tacked at the elastic seam.  The sleeves are made from a lavender iridescent polyester fabric.<br /><br />The skirt base is made from satin -- mostly pink with some lavender under the ruffle area.  The under skirt is made from tulle with a plastic hoop sewn into the end to make the skirt spread outward.  The pink front of the skirt has a silver glitter print on it.  The lavender skirt area has three tiers of shimmery iridescent lavender ruffles sewn to it.  This fabric matches the sleeves.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION:<br />ALL of the seams are surged with four threads that will serve to protect the fabrics from shredding.  It also serves to provide two straight, sewn seams -- basically giving you a back-up seam in addition to the regular seam.  This is QUALITY SEAMING/CONSTRUCTION.  It doesn't get better than this.  You have 4 separate threads protecting this seam!  It also basically means that the manufacturer wants you/your daughter to get every last bit of wear from this garment that is possible!<br /><br />CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS:<br />This dress is very easy care.  Simply machine wash in cold water with like colors.  Do not bleach.  Turn inside out (to protect the glittery fabric, silvery trims and jewel) and lay flat to dry.  You could also hang it on a hanger to dry.  I suggest smoothing out the fabric with your hands before air drying because the tags say not to iron.  The dress itself is made from 100% Polyester.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />This is a well-designed, well-made garment with so much glitter and sparkle and pink that any little girl will fall in love with it.  This is a pretty princess dress to the Nth Degree!!!  Considering all the fabrics, trims, jewel, etc. used in this dress, as well as the terrific sewing, THIS DRESS IS A WONDERFUL VALUE!  You might want to get a crown or tiara to go with it.  Your daughter will love you for that! [SEP] If you have one of those kids that likes to put on fashion shows for you, then you should add this to her collection.<br /><br />It is of middling quality--all synthetic and I would definitely want to wash it on a gentle cycle because I doubt it would stand up to heavy duty.  Probably want to air dry it as well.<br /><br />One important caution:  It violates Daddy's fundamental rule on glitter--not allowed in the house because it ends up everywhere. [SEP] You can't go wrong with this dress up fairy dress.  Multi colored tulle hangs from a 'velvet' bodice complete with silky ribbons.  Item looks exactly as pictured.  Very cute and fun for our 3 year old granddaughter to dress up in.  The tulle flares out nicely when twirling!  At $13, it's a steal - hours of playtime.

The material is soft and the holds up really well in the wash. My kiddo loves it. [SEP] This is one of the most adorable things I‚Äôve seen! The quality is amazing for such a low price.

Thanks to the bit of silicone at the heel, I found that they stayed in place and were non-slip.  However, they are NOT no-show with most shoes!  The item description says that they are ""suitable to most types of shoes like sneakers, boat shoes, loafers, canvas shoes""--they are definitely not no-show with loafers or canvas shoes, depending on the cut.  I included a photo of me wearing the socks with two different styles of Sketches, a ballet flat and a loafer-style flat, and the socks clearly show with both.  With my Sketcher sneakers, the socks are more hidden.  I recommend these for comfort, but be aware that they may not be ""no show"" depending on how you plan to wear them. [SEP] These socks have built-in silicon strips on the heel end so they will stay in place on the foot. They wash very well and came out of the dryer with everything intact. I like them for wearing with my sneakers and other casual shoes.  They are soft, the color assortment very practical and most of all, they are comfortable. [SEP] These are nice little short socks for my gym shoes.  You can hardly tell I have them on. It is more comfortable to wear socks with your shoes than not so these are almost invisible.  If you just walk around on a floor, gym floor type, with just the socks on, they are slippery, more on the nylon side for fabric.  I do like the little grippers inside the sock on the back.  It holds the sock in the shoe. [SEP] These socks are comfortable and stay in place perfectly.  They are thin and fit well in shoes. I am a size 10 shoe.  I wish I could find some that stay in place like these but are lower on the top of my foot. With little loafers and ballet flats these aren't usable for me. I like the variety of colors in the pack, though, and they are a great everyday option when I wear a more full coverage shoe. [SEP] These socks are a little thinner than Bombas, but they fit well. I like the color assortment and the price is excellent. [SEP] I love these thin socks that stay in place and keep my feet cool.

[SEP] My Favorite Socks are Under Armour Phenom No Show but, they can make my toes a little warm in the summer months. These socks are a nice summer substitute. They fit perfectly, incredibly comfortable and no slippage. The colors are basic, so they match everything.<br /><br />Side Note: Depending on the shoe worn with these, they may show some. I have a few pairs of summer tennis shoes with open areas in the bridge area - and these definitely show. [SEP] These are comfortable no-show socks.  In most of my shoes and sneakers they seem to not show, although I did notice some of the top peeking through in one pair.  All in all, these are great when you do want the feeling of wearing socks, but don't want them showing. [SEP] These lightweight socks are cut low and ideal if you want a sock liner without your socks being visible. Whether you want your ankles cool in the hot summer or just want to show off your whole leg, this might be the type of sock you are looking for. The primarily cotton fabric is soft and comfortable, though not thick enough if you need socks for extra cushioning with athletics. If you just need casual socks these would be fine.

I would say medium size.<br />They are ok to have like plan B sunglasses. [SEP] These square sunglasses are great.  I gave them to my daughter, so that she would have a pair of polarized sunglasses that are cute and look nicer than the  ones from the Residence Fair at UGA.  Now she has a pair of sunglasses that does not advertise an apartment complex she does not live in! [SEP] These sunglasses will have you feeling like a movie star. They have a fabulous glossy edge and the frames are slightly tinted. They definitely block the sun and also serve as a stylish summer accessory. Very nice purchase and I am so happy with them. I rarely leave the house without them! [SEP] These sun glasses are a classy and glamorous look to any summer day. My wife looks gorgeous with these sunglasses. The retro look is back. My wife wears the sunglasses over her own glasses and you cannot even tell. [SEP] These sunglasses are nice but they cost $26.00 plus $10.00 shipping. The quality isn't that great to warrant such a hefty price tag. These are $15.00 sunglasses at best. Cute cat eye shape but there are much better choices online and in stores. Shop around for better quality, name brand. I would have given five stars if they were better priced. [SEP] These sunglasses are awesome! They fit my small face so the measurements are pretty accurate. The quality is very nice and I can see these lasting more than a festival weekend! [SEP] Pros:<br />Nice style and design.<br />Comfortable, snug fit.<br />Won't slip off of my face when bending/looking down.<br />A good shade of black, lenses are not too dark nor too light.<br /><br />Cons:<br />No case<br />Price, in my opinion, is a bit high to come with a case or thick sleeve. [SEP] These are too big for my wife's face, but she's petite. If you're a tall woman with a big head, they'll probably work for you. They are well made and the lenses do a good job of blocking the sun. They are similar to the Foster Grants you find at drug stores.",3,True

"Aurelio Jewelry Diamond Ring Sterling Silver 0.031 Carat Round-Cut (I-J Color, I2-I3 Clarity) Natural Diamond Heart Ring for Women",[],[],,4.0,9,56219,"This ring is absolutely adorable. I'm not a fan of large jewelry. The smaller the better, much to my husbands frustration. He claims, ""You cannot even see what it is."" regarding most of my pendant necklaces, LOL! Unlike my cute pendants, you can see what this ring is, a dainty little solid 925 sterling silver heart surround by conflict free diamond chips. It sits pretty flat on my finger which is great as it is much less likely to snag.<br /><br />I love dainty jewelry because jewelry in general is not realistic for my way of life. I am a full time organic farmer. Jewelry is usually more of a pain than anything else. It gets caught in stuff, it gets damaged, the animals are attracted to it. However, I can usually get away with sweet nothings like this ring.<br /><br />For anyone considering this as a gift, it's perfect for anyone who love petite jewelry (my niece is totally going to want to steal this). It comes in a powder blue ring box with gold accenting on the top.<br /><br />Overall, I am more than pleased. [SEP] I adore this ring! It looks beautiful in its included ring box, and on my finger. The design is sophisticated and cheerful. The tiny diamonds sparkle brilliantly in the light. The silver is polished and shiny. It‚Äôs very comfortable to wear. This would be a sweet gift for oneself or someone special. It is gorgeous in person. I feel like the pictures don‚Äôt do it justice because it‚Äôs hard to capture the sparkle on camera. [SEP] This ring does NOT look as advertised.  The pictures make it look like a cute little ring that a grown-up could wear and it is advertised as being excellent quality and workmanship.  This literally looks just like the ring I got in 4th grade from the boy who proposed to me with a ring he got from Claire's.  I did not expect it to be dripping in diamonds as .031 carat is not much, but it looks like they spread some glue around the heart part and hoped the diamonds would stick on.  I think my expectations were a little higher because the company took the time to list the clarity, color and size of diamonds as well as to brag about conflict free diamonds.  I expected this little ring to look as cute as it does in the picture.  I imagine my 9 year old niece would really like this ring, but it is highly doubtful an adult will find this ""perfect for Daily Wear, Anniversaries, Weddings, Engagements, Parties"" etc.  I do not recommend this item and I do recommend the company ditch the barely there diamonds and step up the quality of their craftsmanship.  This could have been a cute ring. [SEP] This is a very pretty friendship ring for an understated look or for stacking. I do not care for big and flaunty jewelry, but I like jewelry. And this ring suits my style and look to a T. However, it is too small for a ring finger and too big for a pinky. It would have been nice if a size choice were available in the selection. I put some tape around it to wear on my little finger and did get compliments on it.",3,True
HIKA Women's Summer Sleeveless Maxi Dress Strappy Cami Dress Beach Dress Sundress Tank Top Dress(Medium Black),['Tie closure'],[],,3.7,74,26794,"I am 5'4"" and weigh 137. Ordered a size M. It's a little longer than I would like, but ok with flats.  As long as I wear Spanx the waist area and hips look flat. Can't gain weight.  Very satisfied.  Wearing with jean jacket. Very cute look. [SEP] I got a medium and I am 5'3&#34; and 147lbs.  This looks very good in but it shows every buldge so if you have a slight belly it is going to be seen.  Dress it up with a jean jacket too [SEP] Nice material and color but runs small.  I ordered up a size and it was still snug.  Unless you have an hourglass figure with no bumps or rolls it may not fit you like the picture.  I had to send it back. [SEP] Nice tank dress- isn't see-through either! Looks super cute with ankle booties and a chunky cardigan! Nice, soft material as well. [SEP] Material is way to thin. Was looking more for a thicker material but this shows every bump. [SEP] this is comfortable and light, could be worn out somewhere nice but i even just wear it around the house.  great for hot days.  holds its color through washing.  easy to wash. [SEP] nice material but too long [SEP] Love this dress!  I purchased the Black in a Medium.  I have been searching for years for a nice-looking maxi sundress with a perfect fit.  This fit the bill on all accounts 5 Stars +++<br /><br />I am a size 6, 5'2&#34; (115 lbs); however, I am large busted and narrow across the shoulders and a small waist.  In addition, I have small legs and always on the look out for a sundress which is straight-lined (versus flaring out in an A Line).  I am a senior so do not want it tight, but flattering. Also, most are way too long and drag the ground.  Not this one.  It was the perfect length.  Rare to find this.<br /><br />I ordered a Medium instead of a Small since I was unsure how form fitting it would be.<br /><br />Perfection!  The length was perfect.  Hits me right above the shoe, so able to wear with flat sandals or heels.<br /><br />A nice rounded neck without being too low.  Perfect with or without jewelry.<br /><br />Also, the bustline was great, and not too tight in the stomach area like some, and best of all a flattering chic look in the hips, waist, and straight lines!  No &#34;A Line&#34;.<br /><br />The fabric is so comfortable, not see through yet lightweight for the year- round South Florida weather.  So comfortable, it moves with you.<br /><br />I can belt it with a nice wide contour belt, pair with a jean jacket, jean sleeveless vest, (white or blue), and even dress it up with chunky jewelry, a wrap, or a dressy zip jacket.  Perfect to walk to the store, cool, and stylish.  Winter, summer, fall, or spring.  Any season.<br /><br />The perfect dress for any occasion and ideal for travel!  You just roll it up and takes little room in your suitcase.  You are set for any event (day or night), casual or dressy.<br /><br />I most likely could have worn a size Small since a little large in the shoulders.  I decided to keep the Medium and ordered an additional black one in a small.  I also ordered another white one in a medium.  Waiting on these two to arrive.<br /><br />After determining which one works better, will definitely be ordering more colors.<br /><br />A perfect classic style,  all the way around, from quality, price, and comfort.  Highly Recommend! [SEP] Great traveling dress [SEP] Nice material that doesn't pill and has stayed nice and black.  Fabric is super stretchy and forgiving...doesn't cling and show every bump and lump.  I wear with a cardigan or jean jacket and have even worn to a wedding.  It will last.  Very happy!",3,True
Glitziest Layered Bracelet Set Silver Gold Bracelets for Women Girls Adjustable Charm Bracelet,[],[],,3.5,11,22200,"This 3-piece silvery bracelet set is so classy, it'll add elegance to any outfit for the perfect night on the town! Each bracelet is a thin piece of metal with a slight opening to fit your wrist through. I have very small hands and wrists, and it's a bit of a tight fit for me to squeeze into. I can tell that if you stretch the metal out a bit, it'll make a bigger opening, but I didn't want to do that because I didn't want to put stress on the bracelet.<br />Once on, they're lightweight and shiny. The one with the little balls on each end is my favorite, but the one with the leaves is also very cute. [SEP] These are cute but pretty basic open cuff bracelets.  There are three but each is ultra thin.  The design is cute and I had no tarnish marks while wearing.  You can easily compress these to close more firmly on your wrists.  Light weight , I don't know if you would notice if these came off while wearing them.  Overall, just basic. [SEP] The tiny ball ends are not attached well. One popped off while slipping this on my wrist. Also,  these don't have any leaf shapes with them. Just balls at the ends and two plain bracelets and one twisted one. False advertisement.

I would recommend getting a thick carpet needle to help thread the masks through. otherwise use a regular needle and make a loop out of thread to pull it through.<br /><br />Great to get a mix of black and white. They worked perfectly for shortening the length and holding in place. [SEP] I have been assigned to continue mask making efforts at work.  These silicone toggles are so easy to thread elastic cord through making the mask adjustable for different size faces and heads.  Also relieves behind the ear burn. [SEP] So nice to use these and not have to worry ""are my ear loops to big?""  I use these for my face masks and they work great.  That being said I use 1/8th inch elastic, it says you can use 1/4 inch but it would be a tight fit for sure.  I love that they come in both black and white.  I felt the price was reasonable. [SEP] These little buggers did the trick for all my face masks.  Now they stay in place and fit my face correctly.  These were easy to attach to my masks and I have even ran them through the washing machine with ni trouble. [SEP] Pay attention to the description. After browsing so many listings, I chose this one because they arrived sooner and in the main photo they are all black. BUT in reality they are a mix of black and white. [SEP] I used it on face masks and they work great!  I only gave it 4 stars because the pack comes in white and black - there is no choice. I only use the white so now I have half a bag of unused black cord locks. [SEP] Oh, they work, but some instructions and a tool to pull them through sure would've been appreciated.<br />But they DO work after going to their Amazon web page to figure out how they work. How much more would it hve cost to include a slip of paper with ANY instructions? [SEP] Adjustable buttons.  The buttons were easy to assemble just use a wire to get elastic through. [SEP] Good [SEP] I‚Äôve been making masks since April, and a few times it‚Äôs been hard to get the length of the ear loops right. I‚Äôve been looking for solutions, but those little push button sliders are kinda expensive. I ordered some of these and am finishing up a batch of masks for cousins who work in health care. The hole on one side is larger than the other, so I got a piece of thread and made a loop, put it through the small hole and then dragged my elastic back through the slider. It worked like a charm! It doesn‚Äôt slip around at all, but if you squeeze the slider and pull the elastic, you can adjust it. It will definitely stay put and keep your mask straps where you want them. Good buy!",3,True
"Hugitout Women's 14K Gold Plated Layered Pendant Necklace,Cubic Zirconia Double Chain Choker Necklace,Multilayer Necklace Dainty Personalized Jewelry with Gift Box and Greeting Cards",[],[],,3.5,19,3223,"The Hugitout (14kt gold plated) layered necklace is cuter than I expected. The color is pretty, rose gold. It‚Äôs very dainty. You have two strands that create a really cute choker. The lower strand is interspersed with tiny letters, D‚Äôs and C (which works out since those are my sons‚Äô initials). The upper strand has a few cubic zirconia clusters, which accent the entire design. The chain is about 16in with the built-in extender. This necklace looks lovely with tops or sweaters that have round necklines. It will appeal to all ages (from teens to adults) and will complement most outfits. I have sensitive skin and liked the fact that even though this is costume jewelry it did not irritate my skin (nickel free & lead free). And finally, if you want to give this as a gift, it is perfect because it comes with a cute box, a cleaning cloth, drawstring bag and thank you card (from the company).<br /><br />**Note: After wearing this cute necklace twice, it broke. Unfortunately, I couldn't determine how to contact the seller to see about a replacement. Therefore, I reduced the stars from 4 to 2. If it were more durable, it would definitely get my original 4 stars. [SEP] This is a nice necklace- it is delicate and perfect for someone who wants a unique necklace. It can be worn with a casual outfit or something more dressy. . The chains are thin but well made. [SEP] Great as an every day necklace. Dainty and feminine. Perfect for layering or use by itself.<br />The color is beautiful and the zircones make it shinny.<br />I take it off for shower and sleep, and I try to cleanse it every now and then so I can avoid that ‚Äúmetal‚Äù scent.<br />It comes in a nice box inside a velvety bag.<br />Perfect as a gift or to purchase for yourself.<br />Cute accessory. [SEP] This necklace is lovely and was exactly what I was hoping for. It doesn't look cheap but it doesn't look expensive either. I wore it for about 6 hours and it didn't break my skin out, so that's a good thing. The claps appear to be solid, so it should hold up for some time. It came inside of a beautiful gift box -- as well as a pink velvet bag, it is so adorable. The double-layered necklace sparkles in the sun and is hard to miss. I so adore.<br /><br />Update: I am really disappointed, my beautiful necklace has broken after the 3rd wear. I simply touched my neck to massage it, and the necklace broke during the process. (Because the necklace broke in less than a week, I reduced the stars from four to three). it's a shame because the necklace is so pretty. [SEP] This is a fun gift for any horse person. The design is fun and pretty. The necklace is sturdy but tarnished a bit when worn everyday. [SEP] I would say this is a great necklace, it has a nice rose gold tone to it which makes it look very elegant. I wouldn't recommend it for women, it is quite small so its mostly for younger girls or little girls. Overall I do like the necklace, good design and color. [SEP] This little gold necklace sparkles in the light. It is feminine and lovely. It is short, so it would work well for a girl. It came with an extender and I added another one. It is really a pretty piece and I am very pleased with it. I received this merchandise for an unbiased review. [SEP] I have to say, I've tried some of the Hugitout jewelry before and have been impressed by their designs.  This one though is above and beyond.  It's a really nice looking and the design is amazingly eye catching in a very simple and refined way.  Just looks far more expensive than it is and that's a fantastic thing.  This is just perfect for those formal occasions and important dinners that one attends.  I love this, it's one of my favorites.

"HaloVa Backpack, Mini Shoulders Bag, Cute Purse Daypack with Headphone Jack, Black","['Nylon lining', 'Zipper closure']",[],,3.5,34,659,"I like the concept and size of the bag For a small purse, it‚Äôs especially nice when caring a regular style purse is not conducive to the activity. This has two separate pockets that are easily accessible and the bag fits everything a small purse would. Problem is, the straps on the back are far from workable!! These ‚Äústreamers‚Äù are way too distracting and keep me from loving the bag..<br /><br />What am I talking about or referring too..???<br />Issue: these adjustable Straps obviously have to have excess length to accommodate the different size users- But, these hang beyond too long once you adjust the length to an appropriate and proper shoulder length and I‚Äôm referring to the adjustments to fit an adult- on a small child, this issue would be worse!.. it‚Äôs like two long ‚Äútails‚Äù hanging down off each shoulder! Conundrum: when it arrives- each strap has been nicely sewn and finished so, they won‚Äôt fray or, run. Yet, if you were to cut off the excess strap .. and by excess, after an adult 5‚Äô7‚Äù adjusts the backpack to fit loosely on her shoulders- there are approx. 10‚Äù of excess strap on each side hanging down ... if I cut these, the ends will unravel- most likely causing more of an unsavory look to the bag.<br /><br />The material feels durable and the construction in other places seems quite adequate‚Ä¶ Zipper is easily open/closed- and has small flap to cover keeping it from getting snagged. It just seems very basic no-frills straightforward I‚Äôm not disappointed in the bag itself.. just not really wowed either! And the straps Would deter me from future purchase. [SEP] I ordered this HaloVa Backpack, Mini shoulder bag for my wife.  It is very light weight.  Although this can be a double edge sword because it does not feel sturdy or high quality.  The fabric isn't itchy or scratchy but it feels a little cheaply made.  The ""Jack"" on the back is convenient to thread through headphones, but most are Bluetooth now so I am not sure it is a great added benefit.  It is a good size if you travel light or only need your wallet and a few items.  I am not quite sure about the durability, but will update my review after my wife uses it for a few months.<br /><br />It does sit comfortably on the shoulder.  Because it is smaller you are not tempted to fill it full of lots of stuff, so it maintains a lighter weight on the shoulder.  It is really not a bad bag for the price, it just isn't a great bag for the price. [SEP] Very nice! [SEP] Perfect size when I want to carry more than a pouch would hold but less than a typical small backpack.  There is enough room to slip  it on over a coat if the weather is cold.<br /><br />To give an idea of size: I could put a hat, extra pair of glasses, gloves, lip gloss, small size hand cream, phone, and wallet in there.<br />It‚Äôs the right size for flexible, small items.<br /><br />It would be a tight squeeze if you wanted to put a 5x7 or 6x4 booklet in there unless there were few other items.<br /><br />It is too small to carry bulkier things like 8x11 notebooks or textbooks or a shopping bag of items like you might get at an art fair or somewhere.<br /><br />I like where it sits on my back, with no pulling on shoulders.<br /><br />The canvas is easy to keep clean and you can hang it up by the loop at the top or the grommet at the top.<br /><br />There is one small zip pocket for small things like keys. [SEP] Serves the purpose i get tired of carrying a huge purse now i only take what i need not the kitchen sink! [SEP] I love this simple backpack. I like these things more than carrying purses generally speaking, and when I saw this one it spoke to me, haha. It‚Äôs very simple, just a big and small pocket and simple straps. I love that it will go with everything and carry the things I need on the daily. The zipper works great and is smooth(I appreciate a good zipper). I would recommend it and the price is very fair. Going to the store? It‚Äôs great! Going on a walk with your dog? So convenient! Hands free! [SEP] Too small [SEP] Just broke a little after 2 months and no way to replace.

GLADDON MODA Women's Crossbody Bag Purple,[],[],,3.5,10,22925,"I have been racking my brain trying to figure out this purse.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs an adorable purse.  There are two sections to this purse.  The front part, I believe, is for your phone.  At least, it fits my phone.  Then there‚Äôs a wallet portion in the back which folds up and has a snap.  However, there is a ONE INCH gap when wallet is snapped closed.  There is a great chance your credit cards, bills, ID can fall out.  The coin purse on the back is zippered though.  It comes with a 44 inches non-adjustable strap and a shorter wristlet strap.  Both are detachable.  The tassels in the front are cute.  I think the manufacturer needs to redesign this purse.  For the time being, I think this purse would be good for a young person who carries only a phone. [SEP] Cute little pocketbook! I wouldve used this all the time back in my clubbing days. Perfect size for when im running out and dont need to carry my giant purse around. It can fit some cards, cash, coins, and even my phone when its out of the case. I love the color, soft, and screams spring time! Very cute. No price listed as of now but I will update rating when it is. [SEP] This bag is a really cute color‚Äîyoung and fun.  Since it has both a wrist strap and a shoulder strap, it offers convenient carrying options. The outside phone compartment snaps securely and has decorative tassels. The inside, as shown above, has slots for credit cards/ID and several folder pockets for cash, etc.  However, this is where the design breaks down.  I would not be comfortable using this bag for carrying anything of significance because the foldover part of the cross body bag is completely unsecured except for a snap. (Note the lack of zipper in Photo 1 above.)  Though there is a small zippered compartment on the backside of the bag, it holds very little. It did come with a complementary ‚Äúbackpack,‚Äù a nice bonus (see photo 2 above).  Still, for the lack of security, I could only award the bag‚Äîeven though it‚Äôs stylish‚Äî3 stars. [SEP] There are plenty of pockets. Take note of the ones that aren't sealed at the bottom: I keep things like cough drops in there. The zipper pocket feels more secure for coins. There's plenty of room for cards, cash and so forth. I clip my keys to the same place where the cross-body strap is attached (or can be detached if you want to simply use the wrist loop for carrying). The tassel is a good reminder of which way the purse should hang, so that I can show ID very easily and quickly. Everyone remarks on how chic it looks. [SEP] Great crossbody small bag. First of all, is very stylish and sleek. It has limited space which means carry the essential, but that is actually good. It has a pocket for your cell, cards and cash.

These are moisture wicking to keep your feet dry and cool. The colors are great. They also give you anti-bacterial protection, ventilation and are durable. The best part is the lack of seams, which is where you would normally have issues. [SEP] Outstanding socks! Great fit, super absorbency, comfortable and wears well for hours. Attractive is a plus. [SEP] Very comfortable... this is my 1st pair ever and I must say it does make a difference how comfortable and warm my feet were... soon Fall will start and I will wear them while bike riding in the Poconos [SEP] These are great socks, love the colors and they help keep my feet from sweating and 'stinking' .  They was up nicely and are pretty padded. No complaints. Very comfortable to wear. [SEP] I ordered these socks in a size medium and they fit somewhat snug.  I typically wear an 8-8.5 in Nike and a 7.5 Adidas for reference.  I have relatively small calves and I actually found these to be pretty tight and I actually lowered them down instead of pulling up on them.  Otherwise I think they are great.  I haven't been on an exceptionally long hiking trip with these yet but have worn them to take my dog on a 4-5 mile walk and they were very nice to have on.  They are thick but provide good support and I do find them moisture wicking.  The colors are very nice, somewhat tie dye with pink, green, and blue but a good amount of each color. [SEP] A funky, cool and very practical addition to complete the wardrobe of an active person. Very comfortable. [SEP] I had a size Medium and they were fine for the foot, but the calves they are very tight.  If you light a tight sock then you'd like these. I do like thick socks but these just are too tight for me. I do like the colors and they would make a good conversation piece! [SEP] I have the bright-colored pair featuring a vivid deep-hued pink, medium blue, and bright but lighter green highlights banded in black bands on the leg.  These colorful socks are easy to find in my sock drawer due to their color and bulk.  Although I haven't worn them in actual cold weather yet, they were very comfortable and kept my feet warm, but not overly hot, at an outdoor festival during unseasonably cool temperatures and kept up with the walking I did.  They feel very cushy and because they do have thickness to offer,  their foot support is real.  I'm sure once actual winter weather sets in, I'll be wearing these socks a lot more. [SEP] Comfort-wise, these Forcool padded trekking socks remind me of my old Thorlo socks.  The Forcools are quite comfortable and give excellent support.  The pink/blue pattern is cute. The Forcools dpn't have a toe seam and give the toe box a bit of room; however, for me and the way the sock fits on my wide left foot, I did notice a bit of squeezing discomfort after wearing for about 6 hours.<br /><br />The Forcools are designed specifically for a left or right foot and are marked accordingly with L and R.  Additionally, there are gray squares to show the inside of the foot just in case the L and R aren't noticeable. [SEP] These socks fit comfortably in my hiking boots. They're not too thin or too thick, all while maintaining breathability. They make every hike worth every step.",3,True

I'm already down 2 and I've had these like a month. One the strap came off already. Just fell off. One my thumb went right through as I was pulling it down because the fabric is so thin. And the straps attach too close to the shoulders in the back so the straps fall down all day long. It's a very awkward placement for them. I don't recommend them at all. I'll be looking for a different brand. [SEP] If you want a tank top that can double as a dress, this is the one. I have a longer torso and needed extra length to get ""normal"" coverage. I read that these were the best long tank tops and they sure are. I have never had a tank top that went onto my thighs before in my life - and it's great. The fabric is soft and comfortable, the length is almost too long (a first for me), and the sewing is spot on!<br />Overall an excellent tank top bundle for the price. [SEP] Comfortable and durable [SEP] *Updated Review - January 2018*<br />I ordered a pack of these last summer and loved them so much (see review below) that I ordered another pack to be sure I never ran out of them when they needed replacing. Same size, same color, same number in the pack. It's as if an entirely different company made this pack. I am so disappointed I felt I must take back my original good review from 5 months ago.<br /><br />The straps, no matter how loose or tight I make them, slip off my shoulders. It seems as though they sewed them too close to the armpits on both sides so they just slide right off and I have to adjust all day, but they just never stay put. The material of the new round is totally different.  It's VERY thin, rough texture, and has very little stretch (the first pack was a lovely soft texture, slightly stretchy).  I'm so disappointed.  I thought I found something I could stick with!<br /><br />August 2017 Review - I love these! I always bought a similar tank from Old Navy but they discontinued.  Then I found some sort of comparable at Walmart .  They discontinued. I was so pleased with this find and how they fit. Long enough to tuck into pants or skirt or wear under a dress and not have to keep pulling it down. [SEP] Runs slightly smaller than I would like. Nice and long so it doesn‚Äôt ride up like some cami‚Äôs do. Materials nice. I like that it comes in a 4 pack.<br /><br />I wear any where from a 1x-2x. I bought the 2x but would go one size larger. They were fairly tight but will stretch out. Would but again. [SEP] I wanted these as a cool alternative to summer jammies!  Plus they look really sexy too! [SEP] The length is perfect but overall they are pretty poor quality, I had to sew the straps back onto 2 of the tops. Also the straps are really wide set in the back. [SEP] Great price and they fit perfectly. I have washed multiple times and they hold up nicely and regain tight shape after drying! [SEP] These are my favorites! I've already bought two packs!

On top of being functional, it is also very nice looking with a cute little Pom at the top. Love it! [SEP] The biggest surprise is a black hat with black ear flaps was pictured, but I received a cream colored hat with white ear flaps.  The cream colored yarns are interesting in that there are little flecks of orange and green in the weave and the pom on top, to provide some visual interest.  This is a really warm hat and comfortable to wear.  Not only are there the ear flaps but the inside of the cap has a nice lining.  I would have guessed it's flannel, but the tag says the lining is 100% polyester.  This won't go with my mostly black coats but it's neutral enough that it'll work.  It is a different looking cap with the ear flaps but they're so practical that I like them.  I'm sure my friends will be able to pick me out in a crowd when I wear this cap.

I don't know if they sell the extra hose sections since I used some from my old chugger. I especially like the valve at the skimmer.

I have a $1200 dolphin system which require the power outlets and it's cable is always on the surface which stopped lots of leafs going into the skimmer system. So, I have to take the dolphin robot out of pool everyday after it is done cleaning. This cleaner does not has this problem because the vacuum line is always under the water. Even it takes place of one of skimmer, but the other skimmer in my pool will almost clean all the leafs. In term of cleaning the pool, it performed better than my dolphin robot. The suction power is much stronger because it is using your pump directly. It will increase the pump pressure little bit, but it is still in the safe range of the pump pressure. In term of price, you can not beat this one because other similar products on Amazon is around $100. I will definitely recommend this one. [SEP] Small leaves jam the vacuum head easily.

Luckily I could pop it back in...but still wasn‚Äôt impressed with how easily it popped out. They feel pretty light and cheap as well. I would compare this to the quality of sunglasses you would get at the gas station. [SEP] These glasses are just a little too metro for my taste but overall they are nicely made. They come packaged well with a lovely case and feel super sturdy. [SEP] These sun glasses have extra large lenses that really look kind of stupid on my smaller sized head.  But, I like them anyway.  The blue color is so cool!  Plus, they are very lightweight and come with a case.  I think the frame is sturdy enough to last for a while or until I sit on them.  I haven't tried wearing them on the tennis court yet, but probably will soon and I don't care if the ladies tease me about the size of them.  If you have a big head these might be perfect for you. [SEP] First and foremost, the lenses in these glasses are amazing.  They are polarized and offer a great level of shading (not too dark but even in full direct sun are dark enough).  Love the mirror effect on them and the blue color.  The frames are light weight and comfortable with no sharp edges or rough spots.  The frame color (white) is nice when you leave them in a hot car as they are much cooler to the touch than dark colored frames, but the white does nothing to make the glasses size more reasonable looking.  The size of these glasses are almost comical.  They are huge!  Everyone in our family tried them on and we looked like Elton John  with those grossly oversized glasses.  My wife said she felt like she was wearing a welding mask they are so big.  If you like those oversized huge glasses then these are the sunglasses for you.  If you like a more compact or less radical glass then look elsewhere. [SEP] these are really made for men, not women. they are extremely oversized on me, but look good on men friends. BUT they offer AMAZING eye protection and coverage. love the blue color, but one warning- when left in a car, in sunglass holder they STILL heated up, and could NOT be worn til they cooled down! Fun styling [SEP] There are very fashionable for women and men. I like them. However, they do not come with a nice case. The soft pouch does not provide good protection. So be ready to spend more money to buy additional hard case. [SEP] The lenses are smaller than I expected they would be. They did come with a case that is somewhat sturdy (not the cloth, drawstring bag, but not also an actual case that is structured & flips open...if that makes sense?). I do love the bright blue lenses!<br /><br />The sunglasses are just fun overall! Probably better suited to a man‚Äôs face, but I don‚Äôt personally care. Something us gals could wear to the beach, floating the river, etc. (or all the time if wanted!). [SEP] They are what they are... large bright glasses. Bright blue lenses, white, and silver ""+""s. They are either your style, or aren't.<br />Priced right... not expensive designer, don't have to worry TOO much about damaging them, but they aren't built like tanks either.<br />They are very large... but thats what aviators are supposed to be, right? [SEP] I should have read that these were for men. These glasses are a very feminine color, but they are way too huge for a woman to wear. If you're a man with a narrow face, these aren't for you. If you're a man who doesn't feel comfortable in traditionally feminine colors, these probably aren't for you either. [SEP] These were just okay for me. They were a little large for me but didn't look great on my husband either. They do the trick and are effective but they aren't my first choice pair of sunglasses.

I even gave it the smell test to make sure.<br /><br />She has been using it for at least a month now and it's still holding on. The colors are definitely pastel both the pink and the blue. Very cute and very girly! [SEP] I love furry keychains. This is so cute and feminine. I absolutely love the colors because they are pastel and so delicate. The pink leather goes perfectly with the balls and the fringe is a added little detail. It has one gold colored ring to put keys on. The fur-like materials of the balls are very soft and airy but not so delicate that it comes apart. It is a well made keychain. [SEP] It would be hard to lose your key ring if you keep your keys on this pompom key ring.  It's very cute but big.

They are ugly and they do not sit well on your face at all. They look cheap‚Ä¶ because they are cheap. You would be better off getting a pair of panama jacks from Walmart! [SEP] Good shade in the sun, great oversized lenses that protect in the sun. My teen walks home from school and he‚Äôs very happy with how these fit and work. [SEP] These really make it more comfortable to drive when the sun is bearing down on me. I find that I don't have to squint like I often do when wearing other sunglasses. I wear prescription glasses, untinted and I was happy to find that these sunglasses were actually large enough to wear right over my prescription lenses. Previously, I had a pair of drugstore wraparound sunglasses that didn't really do a great job of blocking the sunlight. And they looked dorky and didn't fit well at all. These do a better job and look great besides! [SEP] A good and comfortable sunglass for the intense Arizona sun.  I wear them every time I go outside.  I know what the sun can do to skin, eyes can be even bigger problem.  I wear them in the pool, everywhere I am exposed.  I gave a point against because of the lens end curve which fustrates my side vision with the slight curve.  They also have a gaudy Las Vegas look, but seem to protect well and have good anti glare. [SEP] The quality of these glasses is very good. They are actually oversized so anyone with a larger noggin will be happy to know that. They are nice and heavy... not flimsy in the least. They are polarized and will help with glare outside in the sun and while driving.<br /><br />My only complaint is these are an little too ""stylish"" and ""trendy"" for my taste. The main reason is both temples have a golden accent. This just isn't my taste but may very well be exactly what someone else is looking for. I will use them in the car to drive or maybe in my kayak, just not for daily wear as they are just not my style.  I like the sporty look, not the ""hip"" in-crowd look.<br /><br />The negative is just a personal preference. If looking for something nice and shiny, these are a good quality product, especially if you need a larger frame like I do. [SEP] Very good looking over sized sunglasses that look great and block the sun's rays.<br />I really like them and wear them often. [SEP] These are great.  Not cheap material and my view  is not obstructed.  I love them. Thank you. [SEP] The proportions of these glasses just aren't right. They looked alright from the picture, but they are very big, which they stated that they are oversized. But they just don't look right. They stick out past the sides of my head, almost like they are gag glasses. Now appearances are one's own opinion, and I am just stating mine.<br /><br />All that aside, the build of these glasses are good, they feel sturdy in the hand, and when taking on and off. The polarization works good(I got a nifty little tester with another set of sunglasses I received). So if you fancy the look these are a solid set of sunglasses.<br /><br />If you found this helpful, feel free to hit the helpful button, it goes a long ways to help us reviewers. Thank you for your time. [SEP] I like the case better than the glasses because it is spring loaded and you just squeeze the end to open and it springs closed.  The glasses are just okay - I like the oversize, but it may be to much for some with smaller heads than I.  Kind of reminds me of the big lenses General Qaddafi used to wear - if you like that look they might be for you.  The top piece that looks metallic in the pictures looks somewhat cheesy metal painted plastic. [SEP] Some people state that these glasses are very large. In my case this is a positive thing. I have a wide face which means these glasses don't look completely ridiculous on me. They seem to provide sufficient UV protection and have a large enough area to do so.<br /><br />They do feel a little cheap, but match the price.",3,True

The color is a little different than in the picture. Hard to describe, maybe just a bit lighter. It fits perfectly and has a flattering cut and detail. I like the length of it which is a bit longer than a normal shirt but shorter than a tunic, so it doesn‚Äôt quite cover your backside if wearing leggings.the material is also nice and comfortable and it looks well made. [SEP] Cute all around top.<br />In the back of the neck there is a small material button loop to go over the little button.<br />Mine loop is so small it is even hard to button before I put this on, so far I can‚Äôt!<br />The sleeves are different, and in the ruffle part is a bit tight on me, and I have thin arms.<br />I was hopping I could wear this with leggings. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, wear a size 10, and this is almost long enough!<br />I think for me a size large would have been a better fit.<br /><br />The color is not as bright as what shows on my screen, and is like a gold, brown.<br />I like the color yellow gold on the model better..<br /><br />Washing instructions;<br />Wash with like colors.<br />Do Not use fabric softeners.<br />Do not allow to lay on itself when wet.<br />100% Viscose.<br />Made in India<br /><br />Makes me wonder if I can put this in the dryer, or just put it on a hanger to dry! [SEP] I was excited to try this shirt as it was not something I typically had in my closet. When I received the shirt in the mail, the color was beautiful! It really is the perfect color for end of summer, transitioning into fall.<br />When I put the shirt on, however, it was not very flattering. To give you an idea, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äô‚Äô and 150 pounds with a mommy tummy. This shirt fit well on the arms and through the chest but was a bit loose in my stomach which gave the appearance of a maternity shirt. [SEP] I love this top! It fits beautifully, I can easily reach behind and button the back comfortably. I like that it has the feel of a tunic, but probably not long enough to wear with leggings. I really like the material it doesn't itch anywhere, frankly, I hadn't heard of Viscose material before. I will be wearing this shirt a lot in Fall.<br /><br />I'll be wearing this for everyday use, semi-formal occasions, and its great for a more formal work environment. [SEP] My daughter loved the bohemian styling and rich gold color of this the moment she saw it. My daughter is 5'6&#34; and about 95lbs, very long and slender, and she usually wears a size XS in Juniors sizing. We received a size Medium and it is obviously large on her, but she's happy with the fit. She wears a B-cup, and with the cut of this top, I think it could easily accommodate someone with a larger bust. She can't wait to wear it to school - it is a perfect Fall wardrobe piece! It looks great with jeans, or black leggings and boots. It has a single button at the neckline in the back to help the top fit tightly. The sleeves have a frilly belled fit, and there is a coordinating flounce ruffle at the hemline. The fabric, being 100% Viscose, does not have any give, but it is very lightweight, so it will be a good transition Autumn piece. It has a great statement design, and feels like a quality clothing piece: it had no loose threads, even stitching, attention to detail. It is machine washable, so we'll be washing cold with like colors. It explicitly states NOT to let it lay on itself while wet, so I recommend line/hang-drying. This is such a pretty, feminine breezy top, and the price is very reasonable! [SEP] This a cute mustard yellow top. Perfect for fall. The fabric is soft and a bit textured, kind of like a rip stop weave. The cut is boxey, so when I raise my arms it hitches up a bit. It‚Äôs a bit restrictive in the bust/armpit area on me. I‚Äôm between a medium and large in tops and have the medium. This fits everywhere but I could probably use the extra room of the large on top. If you‚Äôre busty or have broad shoulders or arms, I‚Äôd size up one size. I love the ruffles and the length of the sleeves. [SEP] I have a longer torso and this barely covered the waist of my midrise pants. It is cut straight so there is no shape at the waist. Very flowy and could be pretty cute I would just prefer it a little longer with a feminine waist shape [SEP] If the internet is to be believed, mustard is the go-to color for the fall of 2018. This is not a problem for me since it is the one shade of yellow that actually works on me. I love this top because it mixes just the right amount of casual with just the right amount of dressy.  I can pair it with some cute leggings to run to the market and I can pair it with some sleek slacks for a day at the office.  Perfect top for bringing a pop of fall color into both sides of your wardrobe. [SEP] The shirt falls at the waste, not hips. I expected it to be longer and it's not.

Given that, these are not cargo shorts at all. These are so ridiculous I had to make a video. The front pockets are interrupted by the seam of the second set of front pockets, making them useless. None of the pockets are deep enough to fit a regular size smart phone, let alone an oversized one. The back pockets aren‚Äôt even real; literally nonexistent‚Äîjust a decorative flap. This product is a joke. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone looking for actual cargo shorts; furthermore, the pockets are even less useful than many regular shorts I have. One star without any doubt.

"Adult Bib,Waterproof PVC Layer and Printing Cotton Cloth Material,Washable Reusable Waterproof Clothing for Men & Women Eating with Adjustable Strap Bibs (11)",[],[],,3.7,8,60743,"As far as waterproof bibs go, I like it. It snaps around your neck and also has snaps that allow you to fold up the bottom like a catch all for dropped food. It is absolutely water proof. I poured some water on it and the large bead of water just rolled around without being absorbed or dampening the material in anyway. It‚Äôs long enough that you can place the end section on top of the table with lots of room to use it as both a bib and a tablemat at the same time. [SEP] This is such a great idea.  My husband is constantly making fun of me for making a mess when we eat out.  I like the designs of these so it is not as embarrassing to pull out if you are out to eat.  This is super long, and I would prefer it to be a little shorter but that is ok.  It is also a little tight around my neck, but works. [SEP] Fast shipping. Good product. [SEP] OK, let's be honest. Nobody is going to admit they want to wear a build, let alone that they need one.  But the reality is that depending on where and when you are eating (and what), there are times when a bib would be welcome.<br /><br />The most important feature is how well it actually functions. The material on this is slick and shiny. That means a lot of spills, etc. will NOT stay on it and fall to the floor or, if you so choose, into the ""pocket"" created when you snap the bottom snaps together, which is how I use it.<br /><br />So, no, it's not super absorbent, but with the end of it snapped together, you'll be able to catch a lot of material.<br /><br />Pros:<br />>Length. This goes from under my chin to the tops of my thighs when sitting. (Goes right to my kneecaps, so it covers a lot of territory.)<br />>Ability to snap bottom together to create a ""pocket"" to catch crumbs, etc.<br />>Nice design, but no, this is not a designer bib and I honestly don't know if I'd wear it out of my home.<br />>Sure, you can tuck a kitchen dish towel under your neck to catch spills and such but it won't provide the amount of space covered.<br />>You can easily wipe off stains (unless you're talking serious oil or grease).<br /><br />Cons:<br />>I wish they had added additional snaps at the neck so you could adjust it as needed. This may or may not fit comfortably around your neck.<br /><br />What I'd like to see is a version of this where the front and back unzips so that you have a more absorbent material on the front, backed by rubber versus whatever the plasticized material is used on the back of this. You could snap them apart for easy washing and greater absorbency.<br /><br />Aside from eating, I use this a lot when I'm in the kitchen and prepping food and cooking. (Often done while in a chair, including a wheelchair.)<br /><br />If you really want to prevent stains, which is a greater motivation than never having anything fall on the floor, this is worth considering. It's for adults and it doesn't look like something from a healthcare supply shop.<br /><br />If you sew, it's obviously something you could duplicate fairly easily in your fabric of choice. For the rest of us, this is a good, everyday use, alternative. [SEP] I couldn't really tell from the picture, but this adult bib has a white background. I hope that doesn't proove to be a problem when it comes to stains.<br />Snaps secure the bib around the neck. There is only one choice of snaps to use, so it is not adjustable at the neck. A pair of snaps form a pocket at the lower end of the bib, handy to catch crumbs of food or whole bites that might get dropped.<br />I recommend this adult bib for caregivers of adults who are unable to feed themselves, or those who can but may not have the motor control to do it perfectly. [SEP] This is such a great idea.  My husband is constantly making fun of me for making a mess when we eat out.

"Genuine Assembly Men's Denim Jeans, Slim Fit, Athleisure, Workout Denim with Extra Comfort, Denim for Athletic Look, Jeans GA-01A 32 Light Blue",[],[],,3.5,22,3243,"These jeans fit true to size.<br />They are fashionable and comfortable.<br />They are a nice color with popular embellishments (holes strategically placed along the upper leg).<br />They fit true to size.<br />They will match most things, sweaters, shirts and hoodies.<br />The wash well.<br />I‚Äôd recommend them. [SEP] My husband is 6'5"" tall, and so we sometimes have issues finding pants that are long enough for him. Even if he is okay with things coming up a little bit higher on his ankles and he would prefer, very frequently pants don't work out on him because of the length. However, in the past we found that brands such as Joe's jeans have a little bit of extra room at the bottom of the leg so that the pants can have a fashionable rumple at the base.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these jeans were just too short for my husband's legs. They came up to the low or midcalf on him, and while they were comfortable, stretchy, cute and super stylish, there was really no way of adjusting the hem or the styling to make them work for his 34 inch inseam.<br /><br />The most similar pair of jeans he owns is by Joe's jeans, which is also supposed to be a super stretchy, and super soft denim. These jeans from genuine assembly are more stiff, less soft, and overall seem more like a regular pair of jeans, but just have that little bit of added stretch and softness like most women's jeans have nowadays. I think that the claims of being good for working out are probably overblown, unless your workouts do not include a lot of big movements or sweat. However, for lounging around the house, these seemed exceptionally comfortable around the waist and in the fit. I also appreciated that they didn't seem like they wanted to fall down on my husband's backside, like so many modern jeans seem styled to do.<br /><br />Overall these are of very good quality and are truly nice pair of slightly stretchy, slightly soft jeans, as long as your inseam is fairly short, I would say these would be best for 30 to 31 inch inseam length. [SEP] These are very nice jeans with good distressed areas.  The material is durable and slightly stretchy and fit really well.  The light blue color is attractive and there is really nothing negative I can find to say about these jeans.  I washed and dried them in the regular cycle and they came out fine with no noticeable shrinking or fading. [SEP] I had stopped wearing jeans for a very long time as I didn‚Äôt find them particularly comfortable. These jeans, along with another pair of Genuine Assembly jeans changed my mind. The blended elastic materials makes these pants the most comfortable that I own and my go to on weekends and some work days (we‚Äôre pretty casual at work especially Fridays).<br /><br />They look good, fit well, and seem well made thus far. Highly recommended. [SEP] I love this clothing line (have several pairs of their stuff) but this one seems mislabled. While there is some skinny tapering towards the bottom, the butt cuts are definitely relaxed fit. So, be aware of that. Distressing works and overall okay jeans. [SEP] Okay so these jeans are awesome. With the fabric mix of coolmax and elastene they fit a wide variety of body types. I can wear a 32-36 waist just depending on brand and these fits very comfortably. There is a lot of stretch. They also fit your thighs and legs in a slim fit manner without being overly constricting.<br /><br />The color is nicely washed out, with an even tone. The rips look way better in person than in the pictures. More realistic and fun.<br /><br />I am 6'8"" and the length works for me. Sure I could use a 36"" length ideally but that is rare and hard to find. This 34"" inseam is very workable in terms of length. I think these will fit a wide variety of body types. [SEP] My husband hates everything about these jeans. He doesn't like the color, the way they look or the way they fit. He says they feel and look cheap. [SEP] The description of this item says its a 32, and I can live with a variety of sizes around that, like 31x32, 30x32, and 32x32.  But the length was only a 30.  I think the manufacturer needs to be more clear about the sizing.<br /><br />The jeans I received have no ""cuts"" on them for style, leaving me to wonder if I even got the correct product.<br /><br />Other than that there were no defects or other problems.  The jeans were reasonably comfortable.  Overall I think the quality was very decent.<br /><br />Hard to really recommend it until they are more clear about the sizing. [SEP] If you like your jeans tight, you might want to get a pair like this. Its 70% cotton, and 28% coolmax. I am not sure exactly what that is, but I am guessing its the material that makes these jeans stretch. The ripped areas are a nice touch and underneath each hole is a patch so its not cold and will also prevent it from ripping further. The size I got was my size and it fits as it should. Overall, I find these a nice pair of jeans that are slightly different than your classical style denim. [SEP] Okay - I'm older and jeans for guys never had any stretch but the wife has been wearing it for years and assured me these would be great. I wasn't sure but ultimately, had to agree. The comfort is mind boggling. Fit is perfect- athletic slim fit, no bulk and yet absolute flexibility.",3,True

I was expecting a matte brown surface. [SEP] The bank was orange not leather brown. It was ORANGE!!! [SEP] I have been wearing my Fitbit Blaze for almost 2 years and the small retainer loop on my OEM band finally broke so I purchased a couple of new bands from Amazon.

This worked for about 5 days as I was driving today the band just tore right at the pin connection point to the frame.  Very weak design at that critical point.  I know it was only $13 but still should have lasted longer.  I would stick to higher quality bands or different material.  The other band I purchased is holding up well. [SEP] It looks cheap. Lasted for a couple months before getting tears. [SEP] A very nice looking well made product. It looks so good my teenager even commented about how nice it looked.

"Awesome 360 Men's Classic Tie Necktie 2 Pcs Set, AT190529022",[],[],,4.0,11,2719,"These come in sets of two- the one I received included one dark tie of average thickness, and one purple-ish thin one. I actually really liked the purple one and want to wear it more, however it is too thin for me. I'm a larger guy that usually wears XL sized clothing, and super thin ties often look comically small on my frame. The other tie seems to look a little better, but unless I'm dressing up as the Men In Black or going to a funeral, I don't often wear such dark colored ties. I wish the purple one was the thicker one and the thin one was the dark one. But either way, this is an interesting combo because chances are you'll find a tie that works for you, either color or size-wise.<br />I just wish they had switched them around, as both are a compromise in one way or another for me personally. [SEP] I got these ties specifically for my son-in-law who is a V.P., with his company, but these ties will work very nicely for my grandson too, who is required to dress formally for both school and social functions.  The ties come in a black box, which is nice for wrapping and gift giving.  The ties themselves are really lovely!  The material is elegant and classy at the same time and is tailored perfectly. [SEP] Let‚Äôs start off with the price. $16 for two ties is an incredible value. BUT know this - you aint gonna get silk ties for that price. A solid good quality silk tie will set you back 50 bucks or more. But if you rarely wear ties (my husband wears them everyday to work) these will suffice. You get 2 polyester ties - a dark teal tie and a purple patterned tie. In my husbands words - I did not realize that these ties are skinnier than my usual business ties. If you are of slim build this will not be an issue. But if you are of larger or a portly build, this will look comical. I weight 190 lbs. and have a 44-inch chest and am 5‚Äô7‚Äù. The purple tie looked like a cartoon pictogram on me. I would have preferred it to be at least 30% wider than it is. It says width is 3.1‚Äù at its WIDEST but it was slightly under 3‚Äù. My typical tie is 3.75‚Äù at the widest point. 3/4‚Äù may not seem much but that balances pulling your ensemble outfit together or looking like a clown. Onto other points like the ease of tying the knots. I use Oriental and the Half Windsor techniques for the knots. It worked well for these ties. The length was satisfactory as is the thickness of these ties. They are not a piece of limp seaweed. There is a slight heft to them.<br />These are a solid 3 star product and they are colorful; but you do get what you pay for. [SEP] This is a set of 2 ties in bright colors. The fabric is 100% polyester in a flat wave with a bit of a shine. The ties are lined through with a textured black polyester fabric. They have a stay loop on the back of the large end. The ties come packaged side by side in a black box board box. The Awesome 360 logo appears on a tag on the back of each tie. The ties were made in China.<br /><br />I have been very pleased with these ties. I got them for our family photograph, since everyone was wearing black and fuchsia. These ties were perfect with the black and fuchsia, and they looked great with our black suitcoats. With their bright colors and slightly shiny sheen, the ties may not be appropriate for every occasion or for the office for some folks. But there were exactly what we needed for our picture.

[SEP] The pattern on these swim trunks are nice.  And they're long enough that you don't feel like you're wearing short shorts.  The drawstring goes all the way around, and has two pockets - one on either leg. There's no metal on these, which is nice because the local water park doesn't allow metal grommets on swim trunks if you're using a slide.  The fabric is a little on the thin side, but that just makes it quicker to dry. [SEP] These board shorts can be worn anytime in my book.  Mostly as gym shorts but they'll work on the beach too.  They fit perfectly and are comfortable..  I don't think they're quite as long as the photo but maybe it's just me.  They're pretty nice.  No complaints.

Their instructions were easy to follow and I love the fact that I won't have to buy another atomic talking watch simply because the battery DIED. I have a SOLAR charger! The watch also lets me know if it needs charging by a simple push of a button. Isn't this what &#34;Going Green&#34; is all about? Great watch! [SEP] So far the one thing I like about this watch is the way it appears it looks nice. The bad thing is it doesn‚Äôt work. I haven‚Äôt been able to get it to talk and speak properly at all. I am now waiting for service from timechant.<br /> I will update my review as the situation warrants [SEP] I bought this watch at the inspiration of a coworker, who happened to have a solar digital watch. After that, I decided to research whether or not talking solar watches were available, and sure enough, I found this one.  I've only had it a week, but so far, I'm very pleased with it. Everything from the black leather band, to the loud, very clear voice, to the chrome steel casing, it just spells quality!  Heft  this watch in your hand, and you know what I mean.  Not only do I like the idea  of a solar talking watch, but I very much like the idea of one that sets itself automatically according to time zone.  This is arguably the most sophisticated talking  Watch I've ever owned.  Just as an example, never before have I seen a watch where when you set the voice, the hands of just automatically.  I just wish that they were available with a female voice.  Other than that, I give this watch a five star rating, add a three-star price, both for quality and sophistication. [SEP] This was the perfect watch for me because I'm not a fan of wearing a smartwatch the fear of radiation on your skin this was perfect for my work because I can hear the time by pressing the button Under My Sleeve plus I love that it's solar powered and automatically updates the time<br /><br />Ok update after a year and 3 months I thought it was dead and broken but it lasted that long on a charge of solar power that I finally just recharged it with the solar charger and now it's working again!! [SEP] The wrist strap is way too small and it sits on my desk. It is not made for American size wrists. [SEP] Watch does everything it says it'll do. I rate it a five.  It operating instructions need a little work though. You need to read them,their are discrepancies with the number positions,and watch the video to get set up  correctly. [SEP] Great watch. Easy for my husband to use [SEP] I bought this watch for my aunt, who has macular degeneration.  She has had it a week and loves it.  The watch has only two push buttons, one giving the talking date and the other the talking time. She can't accidentally unset it by pushing those buttons.  It is supposedly self-setting and solar-powered, so there is nothing she has to do except put it on its charger light and put it on in the morning.  Although the watch is fairly big, it fits  her small wrist and she is able to buckle the leather band easily.  All this is the good news<br />.<br />The bad news.  The charger light (in case you don't get enough sun or other light to keep it charged) does not have a regular plug, but has a USB tip instead.  She doesn't have a computer, etc, so I bought an Amazon Basics surge protector/outlet that included USB ports.  Problem solved, and we were able to surge protect her tv at the same time.  However, you won't know about the plug issue unless you look carefully at the charger photo.  A much bigger problem was setting the phone.  The instructions that come with the phone are such fine print that even a fully sighted person would have difficulty reading them.  They are also complicated enough that it took one sighted person reading and the other sighted person manipulating the watch (mainly pushing two other depressed buttons in various patterns with a ballpoint pen tip) to do an efficient job. The watch does much of its own setting once the right buttons are pushed.  It readily went to Eastern Time Zone as asked, but did not add the daylight savings hour, even when left overnight in a window to pick up a signal, per the instructions, or the other recommended methods.  Finally we resorted to forcing the setting, which is on the back side of the instructions.  It soon became obvious that these instructions were not identifying the various buttons the same way as the front page  instructions do.  Once we figured out the correct labelling of the buttons, the setting went smoothly.  The entire process of setting took two days because of the overnight attempt.  So far the watch has not reset itself to the wrong time, but we are concerned about what happens when we go off daylight savings.<br /><br />Because my aunt loves it, the watch gets five stars.  However, setting it can be a project, even for the fully sighted. [SEP] I am unable to set the time zone.  The watch is very nice but is running 3 hours behind time.  The directions do not seem to allow me to change the time zone.  I am not convinced that it sets itself.",3,True
Feetalk 6 Pack Men‚Äôs Bamboo Dress Socks -Super Soft & Breathable Business Socks,[],[],,3.3,12,91536,"I am in love with these socks. Very dressy and comfortable. The packaging was awesome. It came in a brown envelope with a Velcro front with a cute quote. The socks are extremely classy and in all colors from black brown blue and grey. They are made to last and stay up. [SEP] I wear 11-12 shoe size and my feet are flat and narrow. Finding dress socks that actually stay on my feet has always been a problem. These socks have an elastic band that goes around the arch of my foot that helps keep the sock in place. You can feel it there when you walk, but not in a bad way. It keeps the sock from bunching around the toes. If you have problems with socks because of your long, narrow, flat feet, I highly suggest these.<br /><br />As for style, I think they look professional with some character, which is always nice. You can look at the picture to determine whether they match your preferences. [SEP] So look, these are inexpensive dress socks. So you're not going to get superior durability and construction. Rather, they're pretty well made, with decent stitching and pretty good comfort. I had no problems with getting the toe to line up with my feet or shoes, and they stayed up well. Comfort-wise they are average. My recommendation is to go with whether you like the pattern or not - for the price, these are a fine buy but do not distinguish themselves from the cheap Chinese-made competition. [SEP] Soft, comfortable, patterned but not ostentatious. I find them equally as appropriate for casual or dressier wear. And, you don't have to worry about one of them vanishing in the clothes dryer alternate dimension because one of those inscrutable laundry symbols on the envelope style folder they are shipped in means do not tumble dry, I assume to  maintain whatever antibacterial efficacy the socks may or may not have.<br /><br />For me that's a problem. [SEP] Good range of colors and they fit well on my size 12 feet. I actually thought the tops of these socks were white, from the photo, they are not.  The material is very soft and comfortable. So the socks are a bit thin (- a star) and most of the material is put in the bottom of the socks, which great for added cushion. These are not winter socks!  The material is very soft and comfortable. One other issue, washing (- 2nd star), the bottoms are already clumping and look like they will wear out fast (in the photo).  The label says not to dry, which is a little annoying for socks. [SEP] These are almost pure cotton and the weave is very soft.  There is a bit of elastin in it for fit.  These are comfortable to wear.  Also, when you take them out of the envelope box (which is a cute idea) I thought these are not crew sock but full over the calf socks but for my size 12 feet, they are the perfect crew length.<br />The following are some of the issues I have with these socks:<br />There is not enough elastin so the socks creep down a bit or roll up at the top.<br />With one pair of socks they got a pull in the foot catching on something in the shoe (never had this happen before but suspect the weave being the cause)<br />While the pattern is nice, most of the fun part is on the foot, which is not seen when wearing shoes.  If you like running around in your socks at home this might be a better use of the sock design.<br />Overall, not bad but also not great [SEP] These were a hit with my young adult boys. They are shoe sizes 11 and 12 and these fit both of them comfortably. They go with casual or a bit dressier clothes and are absorbent, which is always appreciated. They seem to stay in place well so far.<br /><br />They've washed easily and are performing as expected. I would buy them again. [SEP] Perfect Dress and not-so-dressy socks for men. These are elegant and professional socks with some fun designs on them. The designs won't distract from your professional self.<br /><br />They are soft and comfortable, even after many uses.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they are a bit higher than I prefer. But, they are the usual dress sock height so it's nothing out of the ordinary.",3,True

[SEP] My wife likes these as good-quality wool socks.  Yes, they're only 53% wool, but that allows them to be a lot easier to clean without shrinkage, and have a little elasticity to them, so she doesn't mind one bit.  They are a little smaller than you might expect, but they have a little stretch to them, and they'll work just as well with sneakers as they will with hiking boots.  And they'll keep you warm. [SEP] Based on that they say one size fits size 5 to size 9, they have no clue what a size 9 is.  Measured from heal to toe they are about 6.5"" or less and so tight at the top I cannot even them over my heal!  I normally ware a size 8 sock.  Looks like people get different socks than what is pictured also, same style, different design. [SEP] These socks have a homemade type look that makes them appear cozy and festive for the holiday season.  They aren't quite as thick as they look like they would be and I haven't found them partiularly warmer than my other socks.  I do like the way these look and feel though.  I don't know how many people are okay with hand washing their socks but it's something to consider.  They look nice and have good variety in the colors.  It's a great pack and they won't be too thick to wear with your casual shoes.  I wear a 9.5 and they fit me and don't squeeze my big legs. [SEP] These socks are thick, soft, and very well made. I can‚Äôt find any flaws in the material or the stitching. I wear these with my boots and my sneakers. The designs and colors look attractive. These keep my feet warm and comfortable. [SEP] Fun, pretty colors. These aren't the softest or coziest socks, but they do keep my feet warm. There are a lot of small strings on the inside. They do seem well made. I was initially concerned the strings indicated they wouldn't hold up after several wearing and washings, but they are a durable quality. [SEP] Nice and warm but almost too snug for my size 9 foot. Short on the leg too, in between a crew and ankle sock. Thinner than I expected. Def hand wash in cold and air dry, cause I can‚Äôt wear them if they shrink any little bit! Pretty patterns and well made.<br /><br />Update, months later, I love them. My son accidentally dried one and I didn‚Äôt see any shrinkage so am very happy about that. Upgraded from 4 to 5 stars.

My son accidentally dried one and I didn‚Äôt see any shrinkage so am very happy about that. Upgraded from 4 to 5 stars. [SEP] My wife loves this pack of five winter socks. Made from a blend of natural and synthetic material (merino wool 53% , cotton 24%, polyester 16%, spandex 7%), they are comfortable, warm and stretchy enough to stay in place.  Medium in thickness, they'll work for most of your shoes, and the range of color patterns is feminine and tasteful. They have a Christmas-look, but not so much as to seem out of place during other months. Priced at under $18 for five pairs, these socks are also a real bargain. [SEP] This is a nice set of 5 pairs of winter socks.  These are a Merino wool blend with a bit over half (53%) being Merino wool.  The rest of the blend is cotton (24%), polyester (16%), and spandex (7%).  These are keeping my feet warm and have a cushiness that regular socks don't have.  These are really attractive with multicolor patterns that vary by color on each pair of socks.  The dominant colors (although the colors may not be on all pairs) are brown, mustard yellow, and maroon with some white and greens.  These socks would look nice worn with slacks in an office.  Today I wore a pair while walking at a local lake on a trip to spot bald eagles so they work well for winter hikes.  They were probably too dressy for what I was doing, but these socks increased my feet's comfort.  I give them 5 stars for looks, comfort, and being a good value.",3,True

I specifically looked for a weighted earring for this purpose and even though the shipping time was long, the price was good and the reviews stated everything I needed to hear. Now that I have them in my ears, the other reviews are valid. They are solid and properly weighted. Maybe not quite high end but the plated coat was well done and seems decently made.",3,True

Aside from all those goodies these socks are specially designed to be suitable for hiking, climbing, running, and any other activity that an excellent sock would come in handy for.<br />I do love socks and can't imagine a day without them. That being said, these rate up there in the top 10 socks of all time, maybe even top 5. They are great socks. [SEP] these socks fit exactly as described. I wasn‚Äôt sure if they would be loose by looking at the picture‚Ä¶ they have the appearance of a dress sock. But I was pleasantly surprised when I put them on. They stay in place as they should without cutting off circulation. I love them. [SEP] The socks fit true to size, are very brightly colored and are very soft. They are not tight at the ankle but are a bit thicker than I expected. But they are very comfortable and breathable. I recommend them. [SEP] Cushiony and comfortable for a whole day's walking. [SEP] Lasted through out the day. Fit very comfortably. Did not slide around and was not to constricting. Feet never got sweaty or uncomfortable. The color however is very vibrant and will show through breathable shoes. [SEP] I wear a size 9.5 in women's shoes. I've worn these socks a few times and while they are quality socks, and a bit more padded than a regular pair of socks, I don't see how they are specifically for hiking.<br /><br />While I do like them and will keep wearing them, but can't say that these will benefit you more than a normal pair of socks while hiking. [SEP] These are complicated socks. A lot more thought went into them then I can fathom in one sitting. For instance, there is a band of yellow quilting mid arch, which the description is for wicking during hiking. In case you sweat a lot on the bottom of your feet? I'm a US Man's 9¬Ω which I would have thought would be a medium, but these are almost uncomfortably tight, so if I were to buy these, I'd get a large; especially if I were to use sock liners.<br /><br />Regardless, they have gone out of their way to make a premium feeling product, so I'll give it 4 stars. [SEP] Great thick socks. Interesting color pattern, but when they are in your shoes, who cares. They keep your feet warm, but not too hot, and comfortable. I use them working outside and they are holding up very well after months of wear in my boots. [SEP] Wicks away once cooled.  Doesnt take long to get use to.  Cushion on the spot where its needed. Less tiring and good for long walks.  Colors can be changed. [SEP] I wore these for a quick hike through my local trail this morning. They stayed up on my calf nicely. I didn‚Äôt have any irritation from my hiking boots, because the socks were tall enough to prevent that. The colors are appealing and the fabric is very soft. These socks felt warm to me, and weren‚Äôt super breathable, but the temperature by the time I was done hiking was 90 degrees and the humidity was crazy high. I‚Äôm looking forward to using these in the fall with cooler weather. I enjoyed the no seam at the toe as well! I usually wear a size 7.5-8 shoe depending and my foot is wide.

Easy to put on and tighten. I cut the ends off some and made new knots so they didn‚Äôt have such long ends. Fun for kids and adults. [SEP] Nice variety and selection of bracelets. Nice for the young. Not the best quality but not bad. Granddaughter loves them so that's what's important. [SEP] I love most of the bracelets in this set. There are various colors and styles as you can see in the pictures. My favorite is the one with the mountains-charm. I'm sure everyone can find their favorites in the set since it has a wide variety of charms. The colors of the strings are fast. I have been wearing black and green for the last couple of days and the colors didn't bleed. I even took a shower wearing them.<br />I would highly recommend this product. It's a great value pack. [SEP] Hmmm ‚Äì maybe not the best thing to have these to be used as both bracelets and anklets as the sizing is so different then.  For bracelets the multi string ones are just too lose for me even as tight as you can pull them ‚Äì if you have very wide wrists they would fit you, though.  They make better anklets because of that.  For the ones that are double string ‚Äì which is most of them ‚Äì they fit either as a bracelet or an anklet as they adjust all the way down to the smallest possible size by pulling the strings completely.<br /><br />The issue with the dual sizing is that you have a LOT of string hanging of the backend of these things if worn as a bracelet and they look super ridiculous and like a mess.  Personally, I am going to trim 3 inches off each double string bracelet (1.5 inches each side) and re-knot so that I can wear them as actual bracelets.  The wide ones are fine as is because I can only wear as an anklet anyway and you need the extra string to fit it over the heel of your foot.<br /><br />They are generally cute and a pretty good value for what you get.  I only do not like the wave one as the metal is too long and MUST lay flat.

With that being said, he will wear them while driving because he needs to, but they're too big to wear out in public. A larger head might look better in them. The sunglasses are light weight and don't feel super cheap, but they definitely don't feel solid and high quality either. The storage case is a nice bonus. [SEP] These polarized sunglasses came well packaged with a nice pinch top case. This aviator style has a very masculine look, and they are, indeed, oversized. If you like large frames, you'll love these. Get yourself a pair of cheap sunglasses. [SEP] These are nicely made aviator style sunglasses.  The frames are attractive and sturdy, and the lenses are comfortably dark.  The glasses come with a well made case, which is a great way to protect the glasses in a purse or beach bag.<br /><br /> Even though the glasses are listed as unisex I felt they were too large for a woman but are excellent for a man.  My husband agreed with me and claimed them for himself. [SEP] I love these glasses. Yes they are large but they fit comfortably over prscritpion lenses. They effectively block the sun.  The frame has an interesting criss-cross pattern on the sides. They come with a leatherette carrying case.  They seem well made and are a good deal for the price. [SEP] These sunglasses look interesting. While wearing these glasses out in public, I've been given a handful of unprompted comments from friends, which leads me to believe that they don't really flatter my face. However, these glasses are functionally very good.<br /><br />The lenses are polarized with UV protection, which is always important to me when picking out a pair of sunglasses. I also like that they are fairly large. When wearing them, they seem to give the outside world a mildly green tint, but it's not something that I noticed after having them on for more than a few minutes. They are also comfortable to wear for long periods of time.<br /><br />However, there's something about these sunglasses that look a bit odd. The glasses are listed as ""aviator"" style, but they aren't exactly the size and shape of every other aviator sunglasses that I've seen or own. There's also something about the shape of the bridge between the lenses that looks strange on my face. The style is just not for me.<br /><br />But if the look of these works for you or if you just want something unique, then by all means, these are a quality pair of sunglasses. [SEP] I already have a pair of glasses, but they are so dark I cant even read my dashboard in my car with it.<br /><br />These glasses have a nice dark tint to them, but not so dark that you'll be bumping in to things if you walk in to the house with them on.<br /><br />I think all the crosses on the side are a bit tacky though.<br /><br />Edit: As of 11/12/2019 the lenses just fell out on their own. It's just cheap crap. Don't pay more than a few bucks for this. [SEP] These glasses remind me so much of Ray-Ban Aviator sunglasses that I wore for years.  Those were expensive, even back then.  These are really nice ""knock-offs"", with a slightly different look. Much lighter, and not as flexible, you can't bend them in closer.  They have plastic and  The sides have a straight section but it still has that basic  big aviator look. The lenses are good. My eyes felt that comfortable feeling when I put them on in bright sun.  The polarization is very good.  They are big, so if your face is not at least a medium size, you will look like a bug. However, if you used to wear those Aviators I mentioned before, you may find these very nice. Well made, so far no screws loose, and comfortable on the nose. [SEP] After I received the Skyway sunglasses for my granddaughter, I decided to order these Skyway Aviator Sunglasses for my husband. Since these sunglasses are oversized, he can wear them over his regular glasses. He tried them on and they looked good. The frames are made out of metal; the lenses are made of composite [plastic]. Since the lenses are polarized, wearers can see clearer and seem to have less eye strain.  Additionally the lenses have a protective coating that blocks harmful UVA and UVB rays. This allows wearers to see clearer [no squinting], helps eliminate reflections and protects against solar flares [see the product page for more information]. These are really nice sunglasses and well worth the Amazon price. [SEP] Since having lasick my eyes are super sensitive to glare. I find wearing these glasses to be a huge help, especially when driving. Extremely happy to have them! [SEP] Everyone in my family told me to never wear them again.  Big and black with little gold rhinestones all over the arms and rim.  None of that would normally deter me from keeping them but the nose pads are literally a quarter inch apart, and these seem to be designed for someone with a nose like a tortilla chip.

Its so small! But when I tried it, OMG its stretch tons and feel comfortable, thick, not see thorough. Its high waisted and flat my tummy. Highly recommended! [SEP] I wear a size 5 pants, ordered a medium, and these fit perfectly. The material is thicker than I thought it'd be and wonderfully supportive.

I'm always searching for socks that I can wear while playing a hard singles tennis match and these did nicely.  They didn't bunch up or slip back down my heels inside my shoes, and they padded my feet just right.  There's really nothing negative I can find to say about them.  I washed them in the regular laundry load and they came out of the dryer fine with no noticeable shrinking and felt just as good as new. [SEP] Although these are the style I like to wear when exercising, the price is high in my opinion for a single pair of socks. These are moisture wicking and have the ribbing at the arch so they don‚Äôt slip. [SEP] Fits nicely and comfy.  Very thick but breatheable. [SEP] These fit my husband's size 9.5 feet better than they fit a woman size 7.5. The cushioning hit him under the toes, an area not really in need of cushioning. The socks are comfortable for walking. They laundered well. [SEP] Very good quality socks. Mine looks just like their web page pictures and well made.<br />Inside thread loose-ends are short, so toe jams are minimized.<br />I would call it a medium thickness, not ""thick"" as listed. Actually it feels thin in some areas, especially where they are meant that way for ventilation which really helps in preventing feet from getting sweaty. Areas that need cushioning, such as fore foot and heel, are padded.<br /><br />This socks seem to be offered in only 2 sizes, L and XL. This was size L and supposed to be for U.S. men 4-8 size. I wear size 7 and it fits fine. It stretches quite a lot and I think it would be too loose for people wearing size 4.<br /><br />Price is good. I like it.",3,True
5 Pairs Merino Womens Wool Socks - Winter Cozy Thermal Christmas Warm Socks for Women (MIX),[],[],,3.9,32,3057,"These are of good quality.  And, what I like is that they have the No slip grip on the inside at the back of the heel.  The stockings fit good,  the material is good quality.  I like the different colors.  These type of footlets are critical for summer, because you don't want to wear full socks.<br /><br />The stockings fit secure for me.  I wear a size 5 and 1/2 shoe size, so these fit good.  They also wash good. [SEP] I gave up trying to wear no show socks.  They would never work and would always slide down.  Then I found these!<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These socks are a great neutral collection of no-show socks.  They have a silicone no slip strip area on the back of the heel to keep them in place,  The socks are soft yet sturdy.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE PERFORM?<br />These work very well with sneakers or Keens.  I have a family member who can not wear Keens without socks due to allergic reaction.  These even stayed on with their Keens!  These stay on all day, and sometimes depending on the amount of walking, they might need to be adjusted once or twice during a long day, but most of the time not.<br /><br />WHAT SIZE?<br />I wear a size 10 women's shoe and these worked fine for me.  I also had the other family member that wears a size 8 men's use these.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />A great collection of neutral no-show socks. These worked well with athletic shoes as well as Keen's.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This style works better than any other no-show socks I have tried.  The no-slip strips on the back really do work and they are not too thick so shoes still fit well. [SEP] I really wanted to like these socks more than I do, but I gave them to one of my daughters.  She likes these types of socks a lot more than I do.  I didn't realize when I selected them for review that they had that rubbery stuff in the heels to keep them from slipping down into shoes, but they never worked for me.  They slip down inside my shoes, though my daughter seems to like them a lot.  I also think they shrunk because they came out of the dryer looking a lot smaller than when I tossed them in the washing machine.  The colors are nice, and the fabric is really soft. [SEP] Comfortable, breathable, and hidden, these socks are great especially in warmer weather. The set has black, white, tan, and a light blue. [SEP] I needed light weight (summer weight) socks to wear with my slip on shoes.  I figured I'd try these.  So far, so good.  They are very comfortable & do not slip off while walking.  There is a bit of silicone or rubber in the heels.  I was concerned this might bother my feet, esp. in the heat, but it hasn't been an issue.  These socks arrive with one pair of socks stretched on a foot/shoe shaped bit of cardboard.  When you take them off they shrink down to this crumpled little mess that looks like it would only fit on a newborns foot.  It's kind of surprising & pretty funny.  I guess that's why they ship them on the cardboard.  It makes for a much nicer presentation.<br />My only concern is that while I'm happy with them now, is that they might stretch out quickly.  Time will tell.  If you are wondering, they like practically everything on amazon (unless you shop amazon handmade) are made in China.  The fabric is 80% cotton, 15% acrylic (spelled wrong on my pkg. of socks), 5% spandex. [SEP] These have a little rubber non-slip feature built in to them so they won't slip down as most no-show socks do. These are more like shoe liners. They are no-show and work well. [SEP] I ordered these for my daughter who likes to wear this type of sock with Vans, tennis shoes, etc. She loves these socks! They are lightweight, breathable, comfy and soft. She especially likes the fact that there is a sort of grippiing tape inside the edge of the sock that prevents it from falling down and allowing the backs of her shoes to rub against her heels. She also likes the variety of colors in this pack. The price is also very reasonable. Highly recommended! [SEP] I hate socks! They are normally my least favorite piece of clothing. But I also commute and wear sneakers to do it. In the summer, regular socks become almost unbearable. Step in these comfortable mini socks to save the day! I wear a size 8 1/2 shoe and these fit perfectly, with some extra stretch if needed. They are definitely socks and too large to say, wear with heels without showing, but they are perfect if you want a super thin sock. They are comfortable, protect my shoes from odor, and are easy to wash. I like the small bits of silicon to prevent them for slipping. [SEP] [Reviewed by Julie] These Panvbo No Show socks are very soft and comfortable. As advertised, they do hide out of the way inside the shoe, and the rubberized strips inside the sock at the back of the heel do a good job of preventing the sock from slipping down off my heel. I took away a star because they are a little large for my foot. I have a small foot (I wear size 5-1/2 shoe), but am generally fine with standard size 9-11 socks. And these socks are fine until I put on a shoe. The extra material (for my small foot) bunches up toward the heel, but the rubberized strips that hold the top of the heel in place prevent the sock from moving up my ankle, so it just bunches up underneath my heel. I can adjust it while putting on my shoe, but it‚Äôs a slight bother that I don‚Äôt have to deal with in other sock styles. For most people, though, I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt a problem, so wear them in good health! [SEP] The lady of the house loved these socks. She found them to be quite comfortable, and said they are thin enough to wear with any shoe, even slip ons, and she liked the color assortment of this pack. They also appear to be fairly durable in that they didn‚Äôt snag, run or get holes like nylons or tights often do. The socks fit well below the ankle and didn‚Äôt slip.<br />Please note these socks were provided at no cost for the purpose of evaluation and an honest review.",3,True

"BAGVIO Compression Packing Cubes Set, Expandable Packing Organizers 2pcs (Black)",['Zipper closure'],[],,4.3,30,2627,"Utilizing compression bags when traveling is a great way to not only stay organized but save on valuable space within your luggage.<br /><br />I started using these types of products several years ago and quickly realized that they are not all made equally.  These are a particularly nice, well designed, high quality set.<br /><br />This set comes with 2 bags - both a large and a medium.  Other than the slight size difference they are the same.<br /><br />The have handles allowing them to easily be carried.  The design includes heavy duty double zippers which both close the cube and allow it to expand in depth.  The mesh on the front of the case allows for ventilation and won‚Äôt trap air inside when you squeeze clothes in tightly if you are trying to maximize space.<br /><br />When packing for a trip I utilize these by placing shirts in one and shorts, bathing suits and the like in the other.  When returning I use them to separate clean and dirty laundry.<br /><br />Besides being very well made and being able to hold a great deal, another wonderful feature is they are machine washable.<br /><br />These are an excellent purchase and make staying organized when traveling much easier.  I definitely recommend this set. [SEP] These are excellent bags. I would not describe them as packing cubes although they would be fine for travel. Sturdy, they have strong zippers. One side is mesh allowing ventilation. They each have a sturdy carry handle. Empty they are lightweight. There are two bags include, one smaller and one larger. Both are well made. Versatile and well made they are a good buy. [SEP] I've had different sets of packing cubes but my other sets would have zipper problems. This set works well.  The second zippers compress the clothes to reduce the volume of the items in the suitcase.  The main zipper holds well and keeps items in the packing cube. This was much sturdier than the regular packing cubes I had. [SEP] There‚Äôs a lot to like about these packing cubes.  There are 2 bags included in each order.  These are soft sided, which allows for easier packability.  The larger cube is 13‚Äù X 12‚Äù, and the smaller cube is 13‚Äù X 9‚Äù.  The cube is expandable via the zipper on the side.  It expands to a maximum of 3.5 inches for the larger one and 3 inches for the smaller one.  I was able to fit 2 large sweaters or 3 ladies‚Äô slacks/jeans in the larger one.  For the smaller one, I was able to fit 3 ladies‚Äô tops or one sweater.  I like that it organizes my clothes in my suitcase.  There is a white mesh on the front.  It‚Äôs not see-through.  This is great, because I can also use this for after swimming to put in our wet swimsuits.<br /><br />The material is durable, and fairly thick. There was no smell.  I machine washed them in cold and hung to dry without any issues.  There is a single handle on one end.  The handle is long enough that I can sling it over my shoulder.  These bags can also be used for carrying stuff while shopping on your travels.  I was able to fold it up to a 5 inch square and store it in a backpack.  I found these packing cubes very useful and durable.  I would recommend them. [SEP] My husband and I typically share a suitcase when traveling. It drives him crazy how much I pack and the way I pack and trying to find his clothes in the suitcase. He was so happy to have these so he can pack his clothes the orderly way he likes and be able to pull his packing cubes out when we are at our traveling location.<br /><br />He was impressed how much these could hold, it is definitely more than it seems! It has a zipper to expand the cube and compress it, making storage so easy! I recommend getting these, especially if you and your spouse have different ""packing styles"" ha! [SEP] The packing cubes have a zipper that goes all the way around to compress the cube once you've filled it.  They are well made though there are 2 points. 1 is that the inside seams are covered with a non woven fabric rather than a nicer ribbon.  The 2nd thing, and the reason I dinged it a star, is that the zipper that you use to get access to the  packing space only goes around the top.  I prefer to have the cube open all the way around so that I can fold and place the clothes in more easily. [SEP] The main material on these packing cubes looks thin and of questionable quality. The front mesh however, does appear to be a nice thick quality fabric. Too bad the entire bag isn‚Äôt made of that mesh. The zippers are lightweight and easy to open. The interior seams are covered with the material they make reusable grocery bags out of and they are not sewn on too well. Overall, I‚Äôm not impressed but they are okay. [SEP] I love these packers, they adjust at the side extending to fit more in so they work well holding a few things or a lot. Robust, square and rectangular shape they hold anything from shirts to underwear, even shoes or pants keeping your suitcase neat and providing more efficiency to your packing. Each bag is sturdy canvas with a mesh top. [SEP] This set includes a large and medium size format compression packing cubes. They have a large mesh surface on one side of the cube, which allows ventilation and adequate visibility to identify the contents. The access to the interior of the cube/bag is via 2 zipper pulls, which is a great design. In fact, the overall design of the packing cubes is well considered and this carries over into the materials and construction of the product.<br />There is also a quality zipper and pull that allow the cube to expand, to accommodate additional packing space. This feature increases the versatility and utility of the cubes.<br />Speaking of increased utility, the cubes have sufficiently sturdy handles. This is why this review sometimes adds 'bag' to this product. You can easily see the added functionality of have a packing cube, with handles that enables it to also serve as an additional bag. With the mesh side, this could easily be used during a weekend trip as a quick hamper, hanging off a door knob. Haha, I just thought of that while writing. Anyway, you get the idea.<br />My initial examination of the set discovered no defects, flaws or errant stitching/construction. Rather, I find the overall manufacture and design to be top notch. Receiving a large and medium set will afford ample storage capacity, especially if used to organize and separate items in luggage.<br />I'm impressed with the quality and possibilities of this set of packing cubes/bags. It matches up with the description and pictures in the product details. I feel it merits a high level recommendation. [SEP] Unfortunately I'm not doing any traveling right now, but when I do, I'll certainly want to take at these packing cubes along.  This is a 2 piece set with the larger bag being about 13 by 14 inches and the smaller being about 10 by 14 inches.  When not in use, they lay flat.  When in use, both of these have a size zipper that when unzipped permits expansion of the cubes although they do not expand to where they are actually cubes.  What I really like about them is each has a side with a white cloth mesh so air can freely reach what's in the bags.  If one has wet or damp clothing items, these can be used without as much chance as mildewing or getting nasty.  If the items are too wet or damp to go into a suitcase, these cubes also have carrying straps for taking along separately.  I plan on doing some backpacking and camping and think the smaller of the cubes could be attached to a backpack with a carabiner and would be great for carrying clothing and items that should they need to dry out.  These are lightweight so they don't add weight by themselves.  My rating is 4 stars because I think they're great even if they do not expand to where they can accurately be described as cubes.  They are more like rectangular well-constructed bags.",3,True

I have spent the past week attempting to get this watch to work and despite my efforts and reading through the directions at least a couple dozen times, this watch just doesn‚Äôt set time. The instructions are simple but the watch doesn‚Äôt act in accordance to them.  After a total of about five hours attempting to set this watch, I finally gave up as it would just never set.  The light works as long as you are pressing the button to do so and the watch is super bulky and well presented.  But no matter how well it‚Äôs presented or seemingly well made, it‚Äôs of no use.<br /><br />I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this watch due to its non performance.

I'm 5'9"" tall, 142 lbs, small chested and have birthing hips.  The first time I put it on I put it on backwards thinking the ties were supposed to go in the back and wondered why it was choking me a little at my neck.  I went back and looked at the picture on the product page and realized that the ties go in front and not the back.  That helped a lot.  I think it runs large because I usually take at least a medium or a large in most dresses.  The material is very soft and hangs well and the burgundy color with the light flowers is very pretty.  I will be wearing it with either skinny jeans or leggings this summer. [SEP] So I ordered this dress unsure if it was going to fit, and it did.<br />So I‚Äôm going to say it fits slightly larger than expected.<br />I normally wear a medium and received a small and I still fit in it ok. Granted I am bottom half heavy, pear shaped maybe.<br />Anyway, the dress is very pretty, fabric is thin and airy, but not cheap thin, just normal.<br />The length is perfect for an office, or a church dress.<br />My picture shows sandals, but I wore it to the office with black heels. Although while taking a pic in sandals I could also see this as a spring summer outdoor party dress.<br />The color was not overwhelming which was great in order to complement the busy pattern. [SEP] Now that the heat is hitting I just have to say that I was very impressed by this dress.  It's got a light flowy summer feel without being billowing or too loose.  The material is quite nice and feels good against my skin.  I did look for any loose threads or stitching mistakes but I just didn't seem to find any.  All in all, this is a perfect cute summer dress and looks great on me! [SEP] I am 5‚Äô4 and 155lbs.  I ordered the S and it fits very well.  In dresses, I usually wear S or M depending on the brand.  The pattern is a busy array of flowers.  The fabric is higher quality than I was expecting and is a good weight (thin but not too thin) and feels breathable.  This has 3/4 sleeves which I like and pockets! This dress would be great for most seasons.  It would be rather thin for Winter though.<br /><br />I live in Florida so I most likely can wear this dress year around without much issue.  For places that have more traditional seasons this would be most suitable for Summer and Spring.  I took a picture of me trying on the dress but I don‚Äôt see an option anymore to upload photosüòï.

FINELOVE Rose Gold Plated 6mm Round White Opal Stud Earrings For Women,[],[],,3.8,47,13791,"These are beautiful earrings. The opal has a decidedly pink tint to it. It also comes with clear plastic backs, if you'd rather use them than the original backs.<br /><br />I didn't realize when I ordered these that they are plated, and I can't wear plated jewelry. The plating wears off in a few hours, and then it makes me itch. [SEP] The Opals are pretty but paired with that color gold makes them look bad. [SEP] These earrings are very pretty but they don't seem as iridescent in real life as they do in the product photos (although this may be due to lighting).  I usually have a mild allergic reaction to most earrings but these did not bother my ears at all, even after wearing them for 48 hours straight.  The earrings come with two backings -- a standard one and a plastic one.  Both securely hold the earrings in place and I did not have any issues with the backs sliding or coming off. [SEP] This is an attractive set of opal earrings in a rose gold setting. The backs on these earrings fit very snug and can be a little tricky to get on and off.  There is a second set of plastic backs that are provided which are slightly easier to get on and off.  The earrings came with a 'gift' of a stretchable black elastic bracelet or hair band, not sure which one but can be used either way. [SEP] I was very happy with the size of these studs when I received them.  They are the size stud that I typically wear, not obnoxiously large and not too small.  The opals are definitely lab-created as they just don't sparkle quite as nicely as real ones, however, this is why they are priced the way they are.  The current price is definitely appropriate for the size stud.  The setting is nickle free which is necessary for me as I am allergic to nickle.  They also give you the regular metal backings and plastic ones so you can choose which ones you prefer.  I was also happy that the box came with a bonus of a hair tie with pearls.  I would recommend these if you are looking for a value pair of opals.  They will go great with almost any outfit (just have to match the rose gold). [SEP] Very pretty. [SEP] Beautiful, dainty little earrings that add a bit of color and interest. The rose gold color is a nice touch, though the opal looks fake if you get close up to them. [SEP] My wife loves these earrings. The rose gold plating looks authentic and has not yet irritated her skin; she is normally very sensitive. The opal-like stone is large enough to be seen and looks as it does in the photo. The only negative is that the workmanship of the metal/design of the earring is a bit messy; lines aren‚Äôt straight, etc. Overall, I‚Äôm  very happy with this purchase.

They are comfortable. Shorter than expected which is a good thing. [SEP] First, let me start off by letting you know that I am part of the Amazon Vine Program so Amazon did send this product out to me for review. The Milacolato are very small, kind of a turn off for me but they are a cute. The chain on the earring are thin which is make feel like you have to be super careful not to break it. The stone don't have a really good shine, maybe it's the cut. I feel like these earrings would be more for a little child instead of an adult. The earrings are very light and comfy to wear. Overall very small but nice for a child. [SEP] This earring is light weight, sleek and looks so so good. I like to pair it with a little black dress. Totally in love. [SEP] These earrings  are so cute and sexy at the same time. They look great on. [SEP] I love the design of these earrings!  I like that the chain keeps the backs attached and I like the little bit of sparkle that the cubic zirconia provides.  They work either with casual clothing or something ab it more dressy.  They do not bother my ears at all so I do think they are nickel free - which is great. [SEP] these are beautiful super comfortable and a great vlue for sterling silver. absolutely love them. [SEP] Very petite. Exactly as pictured. Love them. [SEP] Smaller than I thought but that just makes them more appealing to me.

They are soft and fit just right. I machine washed on cold and air dried without any issues. The pockets on the sides are in the perfect spot. [SEP] I love mid length shorts like these with the handy phone pocket.  This pair is not the best example I've ever owned - they're not bad, but they have a very specific issue, which is the waistband.  The over all fabric isn't as compressing or as elastic as many others out there, and so they had to add a thin strip of elastic at the waist instead of just making the waist fit snugly.  This means that they don't really compress your stomach area, and you can VERY MUCH feel the elastic against your waist.  I suspect that this will impact how they wash and how long they last as well. [SEP] I am 5'-8"" and 125lbs. I normally wear size small or 4 in pants but order a size medium for tights which I did. The biker shorts are high waisted and thigh length. It's very form fitting yet really comfortable. The material is lightweight and breathable so my sweat didn't just pool inside the tights. There are pockets so you can store small items. The only thing is that there are a lot of visible linings/stitching from the cut sections, specifically down the crouch area. I'm not a huge fan of that visually. [SEP] Estos son pantalones cortos bonitos, tienen bolsillos en ambos lados, son agradables y ligeros. La tela es gruesa,  suave y c√≥moda. Las costuras est√°n muy bien hechas. Son ideales para ir al gimnasio, hacer yoga o trotar ya que no se bajan ni se transparenta. En cuanto a la talla siento que se ajustan bastante al size. Yo soy 5'2ft y peso 140lbs y me qued√≥ justo c√≥mo esperaba. [SEP] I'm trying to lose the 15 pounds that I gained during the pandemic. I've acquired a belly bulge which these shorts do nothing to hide. But to their credit, they are not magic shorts. It's advertised as biker shorts, but there is no padding. It's more like workout shorts. I normally wear a small, so I ordered a medium. Looking at the label, it looks like  I received a Chinese Medium but a U.S. Small. Keep that in mind when ordering. It's not too tight around my belly, but it is a little loose on my lower thigh. If it rides up, you risk revealing a camel-toe, so make sure that you wear long shirts. It's a nylon/spandex mixture and feels soft. I do like the pockets to place cell phone and ID if you plan to bike to the gym and don't have a phone holder on your bike. There were a couple loose threads, so time will tell how durable it is. Overall, a solid 4-star item. [SEP] I use these biker shorts for my rebound workouts and for riding my bike. The shorts stay in place during both activities and don't ride up. My S20 Ultra fits in the side pocket and doesn't fall out during bike rides.<br /><br />Overall, these biker shorts are comfortable and they wash/dry in normal cycles. [SEP] These are very nice biking shorts they‚Äôve got pockets on both sides they are nice and light weight they hold my cell phone very nice there is no extra padding underneath or on the bottom like some bike shorts so if you‚Äôre looking for the padded ones you will not like these however I would wear these running or jogging or doing other various activities I really like them and would highly recommend them I feel they are very reasonably priced and would get again I got a size medium I am 130 pounds and 5‚Äô3‚Äù tall and they fit great I could‚Äôve probably even got away with a small [SEP] I like these! So many times these squeeze and I don‚Äôt like that. These were a nice fit and comfortable. Exactly what I have been looking for to wear under my skirts in the summer and for my Pilates.

Washed instantly to see if they would shrink but they held up. The fabric has a scent that is clearly in the fabric. It wasn‚Äôt loud or unpleasant. I know washing them didn‚Äôt remove it. Maybe after a few wash, it might dissipate. I think they represent good value and recommend them for those looking for a good pair at an affordable price.",3,True

And yet, I didn‚Äôt really sense any control top support.  They do stretch out and feel less constricting after an hour or so, but the material being stretched out accentuates the shininess of the fibers. Not really the look I want.

The control top isn't super tight, but still stays put and holds you in a bit.  They give the pantyhose-look without the fragility of standard pantyhose.  They are thick enough to be sturdy and give a little coverage to your legs, but thin enough to appear like pantyhose. [SEP] Weirdly, these were way too small on me and I'm a tiny person. I'm not sure if the product wasn't made correctly or if I just ordered wrong, but these smalls were too constricting on my tiny frame.  They seemed like they'd have made wearing skirts brisk weather so much easier for me. The quality was nice and stretchy with a control top. Don't confuse these with leggings-- they're more like tights-- a happy medium between leggings and pantyhose.

Not what I had hoped for [SEP] These pasties work great.  They are made very well and they stay on very well.  I have size Ds and these actually, when placed right, hold them up and cover the nipple very well.  I like these for when you want to wear a dress that has an open back and not have to wear a bra.  It was nice to be free, and yet supported. these are a great flesh color, so they don't show under your clothes. light colored tops will show an outline of the pastie, so keep that in mind.  I never thought I would use these, because of being too self conscious or the size of my boobs, but, it worked out. [SEP] Although by the sizes recommended, these just do not work at holding up breasts that are not, shall we say, a bit more perky than mine. I won't go into the grizzly details because you may not look at your mom's boobs again in the same light. These will be wonderful as a way to cover up the nips if you are an A, B, or maybe a C cup in the 32 to 36 bra size range. The round part needs to cover almost all the breast for them to work like the pics. No wonder all the models are thin.  Hmmmm.  I am bummed because I was looking for a miracle, I guess, to help with not having to wear a bra all the time and eliminating the under boob sweating. They claim to do that, just not for me.  I'll be sticking to sports bras. They are quite sticky so should work well for those they fit.<br />NIpple covers, yes. An alternative to a bra, nope. [SEP] I got a pair of these to wear under summer tops - I am so tired of fighting bra straps.  I am a 38D so I ordered the size that corresponds to that.  These did stay in place for many hours (4?) and did provide some support - but they were way too small.  If I had been wearing any sort of a form fitting shirt - I cannot imagine how odd I would have looked.  The line of my clothes would have been completely bizarre.

My reasons for 4-stars are that the elastic (on the wrists) was fairly tight and became a bit bothersome after a full day at the office.  The second reason is that I could not wear this without pairing it with a belt which I already had in my closet.  I realize this is meant more as a dress than a shirt, hence the reason to not include the belt, but, for my purposes, it would've been nice to have a belt. [SEP] The fit is kind of strange. I find the top park around the shoulders and chest very tight and then everything else is overly large in an unflattering way. [SEP] Omg, I love this top. It's definitely too short on me to be worn as a dress, but it looks adorable with leggings and has become my go-to outfit when I'm not sure what to wear or just want to be comfortable. I get complimented on this basically every time I wear it! If you're on the fence - just order it!! Fits true to size. [SEP] Love it.  Read the reviews and determined that a medium would probably work for me as a shirt. Wore it with black leggings and suede boots and it was a hit.  I'm 5'4&#34; and normally wear an 8/10 or M/L. It was a teeny bit fitted in the arm shoulder area but I have broad shoulders and thick arms so that explains that.

"accsa Mens Winter Heated Gloves 3 Heating Temperature Heated Motorcycle Gloves for Men & Women Waterproof & Windproof, Touch Screen Warm Work Gloves, Ski Gloves for Outdoor",['Buckle closure'],[],,3.7,25,2708,"I love the idea of heated gloves as my fingers get cold when playing in the snow with my kids. My wife has a heated jacket that has a similar idea- there's a battery pack that gets wired up inside and then an external button that activates and glows different colors to indicate what mode it is in. This is the same thing, but on two hands (so double the battery packs and switches!).<br />The jacket version is vastly superior to this in my opinion. To be clear, it DOES work, but there are some design flaws that make it a little frustrating. For starters, the battery pack uses AA cells and not a USB rechargeable pack like other heated items in this style. That's fine, except that the pack is very bulky and hard to get to when you need to change them. There is a zipper pouch that houses it, and you have to really dig around with your fingers to get it out and in. And there's a good chance you'll have to replace them every couple of times you wear this. There is also a ""master power"" switch on the battery pack, which I guess prevents accidentally pressing the power on when storing the gloves as well as preventing background power drain. If left on, the pack will drain your battery even if the glove's heating function is turned off, so you need to dig it out every time and hit the switch (found this out the hard way).<br />Not only is that annoying, it is bulky and won't contour with your arm since it is a square pack. See the attached picture, on my arm that carries my watch, the pack creates this awkward bulge. And it isn't that the gloves are too small on me, in fact they are a bit big on me in every other way.<br />The LED on the gloves also aren't very visible when outside in the snow. I kept questioning whether or not my gloves were on or if in the wrong mode... a few times one had turned itself off perhaps by either the battery dying or accidentally hitting the button. Using them at night solves this, but what if you're outside in the brightly reflected snow? In contrast, my wife's heated jacket is visible.<br />I was going to give this 4 stars because it's just mildly inconvenient and still functional, but after using it a couple of times and finding the batteries are already dead, I decided against putting even more batteries into it and just using them as normal gloves. For that, you can get much better fitting gloves for the price.<br />So, if you really need heated gloves on the cheap, they're OK. But they really could be so much better. [SEP] I live in the mid-west where winters are brutal and my husband comes inside with freezing hands after scooping out our driveway so I'm excited for him to have these gloves! I was a bit disappointed when they arrived to find that they have a big, clunky battery box in the wrist that takes 3 AA batteries each, so it takes 6 AA batteries to power both of these gloves. I would like them a lot better if they had a built in rechargeable battery pack so I don't go blowing through so many single use batteries. The gloves didn't arrive with instructions, but they appear to have 3 different heat settings. The high heat setting gets nice and warm especially in the palms of your hands, but not so much in the fingers. I love that these are touch screen compatible! Most warm winter gloves I've found in the past haven't been, so that was a nice perk. [SEP] Not sure who wrote the copy for the listing, but there isn't any cotton on these (and you wouldn't want cotton winter gloves anyways, so that's a good thing)  The gloves are quite large which I guess is to be expected since the 3AA battery pack has to package in the gauntlet.  The fit of the gloves on the hand is a touch larger than typical but not unreasonably so.  Heat is definitely noticeable on the back of the hands, less so in the fingers.  The blinking lights on the back of the hands is hard to see in direct daylight and would probably get to be pretty annoying if you were doing something at night.  I would have preferred a more discreet or less noticeable status light, or perhaps something that is inside the cuff.  I wasn't able to tell how long a fresh pair of rechargeable eneloops would last. [SEP] No direction came with these gloves at all ‚Äì just the two gloves in a plastic bag.  That is totally weird.  Luckily, my mom has a pair of heated gloves and I sort of remember how hers worked ‚Äì so maybe it is pretty standard?  I dunno.  Anyway ‚Äì a long press of the button turns them on and then a short press cycles through each temperature setting.  Then a long press turns them off again.  Just remember ‚Äì each glove is independent ‚Äì so you have to press each button on each glove.  Also ‚Äì you have to take the battery pack out of the glove‚Äôs pouch and turn that on each time you use them.  Then you have to take the battery pack out of the pouch and turn them off after your use otherwise it will simply drain your batteries.<br /><br />First on you get a flashing red, press it and you get blue, press again and you get white, press again and you are back to red.  To me, the blue feels like the least heat setting, while the white feels the hottest to me.  Not sure, though as you would think the cycle pattern would match the heat increasing ‚Äì I dunno ‚Äì no instructions.<br /><br />The battery packs are easy enough to figure out and when you turn them ‚Äúon‚Äù the red light will come on ‚Äì and stay on until you turn the battery pack off.  So just turning the gloves on and off will not help your batteries ‚Äì you have to remove from the pouch before and after each and every use.  There are three AA batteries in each glove.  You do feel the weight ‚Äì is it terrible ‚Äì no.  But is it noticeable ‚Äì to me, yes ‚Äì especially if you turn your palms to the side.  My mom‚Äôs gloves are rechargeable ‚Äì no stand-alone batteries.  I guess the good thing about using AA‚Äôs is that you should always have some on hand to use quickly.  Also ‚Äì if needed while out and about in your gloves ‚Äì it is easy to go and buy some too.<br /><br />I could only try these on in my home as the temperature has been getting warmer these days ‚Äì here today it will be an unseasonably 70 degrees outside!  No need for gloves at all ‚Äì especially those that are heated.  Wish I had these a few weeks ago, though.  I guess I will not be able to truly test their effectiveness until it is once again cold out.  The backs of the hands and the backs of the fingers did get warm.  A lot of gloves the fingers do not heat at all ‚Äì so that was really nice.  I didn‚Äôt feel any heat in the palms or the underside of the fingers.  But the entre back of the hand/fingers may be all you need on a cold day.  I am truly looking forward to using them when they are truly needed. : )<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù button.  Thanks! : ) [SEP] I always wondered if all these heated products were a gimmick so I decided to give these Accsa heated gloves a try. Overall I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre a must buy item but they do work okay once you get used to operating them. I see myself using these gloves as normal gloves more than for their heated function.<br />Pros:<br />The glove sizing was perfect for me<br />The gloves are comfortable and soft on the side<br />Each glove has a drawstring at the end to keep snow and wind out<br />The heating function keeps your fingers warm<br />There are 3 temperature settings and you can even set each glove to a different temperature<br />The gloves use batteries so you don‚Äôt have to worry about remembering to charge them<br />Cons:<br />The gloves didn‚Äôt come with any instruction so you‚Äôll have to go back to the product description or just do a trial and error on your own<br />Each glove is controlled independently of each other so you‚Äôll have to do everything twice<br />Heating doesn‚Äôt evenly distribute across the whole glove<br />You‚Äôll need 6 batteries at a time to use the gloves<br />Only 2 of the fingers on each glove are touch screen capable<br />The led light on the battery pack isn‚Äôt visible on the outside so you can‚Äôt easily tell if the power is on [SEP] I got these gloves specifically to use when I'm snow blowing as I thought the heating feature would help my hands stay warm. The gloves were shipped in a plastic zip lock bag without any type of instructions. I unzipped the battery pouches on the gloves only to find two cheap plastic battery holders each requiring 3 AA batteries to power up the gloves rather than normal rechargeable lithium batteries with a charger. I inserted the three AA batteries into the battery packs and then turned the gloves on. While they did manage to power up the gloves the heat they produced  was pretty anemic and I doubt they will last longer than a couple hours before going dead. The gloves themselves are fairly well made but not very insulated so hopefully I can finish snow blowing the driveway before they no longer generate heat. I'm not overly impressed with these gloves and think a better insulated glove with hand warmers tucked inside would be better. These aren't nearly as expensive as other heated gloves but with those you get longer lasting rechargeable lithium batteries and a charger. My feeling is that it would be better to pay more and get a better heated glove. [SEP] These are really thick and nice winter gloves. They do run large and are a little bulky for my small female hands. They fit my husbands hands nicely. They seem and feel heavy duty and good quality. The gloves have a little battery section inside that allow batteries for heated gloves. Even without this function the gloves are nice. They don‚Äôt get super hot, but do give off a little warmth. Keeps the chill out of your bones. It‚Äôs a nice little addition. [SEP] (These show as currently unavailable, so I am not sure what the retail asking price is)<br /><br />As far as just regular, non-heated gloves, these are ok.  They have a cinch around the wrist to keep snow out, which is nice, and they have textured thumb and palm areas for easier gripping.  The size is maybe a little tight. I have large hands and these are large gloves but they juuuust fit.  The small clip to attach the gloves together for storage is a loop and hook; a bit annoying to undo to separate the gloves.  A small buckle works better on all of the other gloves I own.  Three-star, run-of-the-mill gloves with a slight bargain feel to them.<br /><br />The big downside is actually the heating system.  The gloves have a large, bulky battery pack on the back of  the wrist area to power the heating system.  The pack has an on/off switch, no auto-off, so you have to unzip and switch off when you are done, BEYOND pushing a button on the back of the glove for 3 seconds to turn off the heating feature.  They also didn't come with any instructions, so the red/white/blue solid and flashing patterns had me wondering what it was doing.  For reference, there are instructions here in the Amazon description.  The battery pack is so bulky, I wouldn't be surprised if injury could occur from the pack jamming into the back of the wrist during a fall while skiing,etc.  They are advertised as motorcycle gloves, so that collision factor may not have come into the design process, but again, it seem shortsighted that they cannot be recommended for use in snowplay.  The gloves did warm up, but only a bit, even on the high section.  Felt more like I was standing in the sunshine while wearing them, but the heat may be a greater relief while riding a motorbike.<br /><br />The cumbersome battery pack is really the deal-breaker here.  They aren't bad gloves overall at a budget price, but come with too many strings attached. [SEP] These gloves are perfect for working outside in cold temperatures. The fit is true to size.<br /><br />The charge lasts for a few hours but you may need to charge them during your lunch break if you plan to use them all day long. The material is thick and the water resistant outer layer really comes in handy. The adjustable strap at the bottom is perfect for any snow sports to keep the snow out of your sleeves.<br /><br />I prefer to keep my gloves on the highest setting. I honestly couldn't even feel the lowest temperature. Even though the gloves are thick, they aren't too stiff! I would recommend these gloves to any snow lovers!",3,True

They are thick so provide a great bit of pressure as well as cushion to the soles of your feet. There were still breathable though.<br /><br />I wear a size 6 women‚Äôs shoe and ordered the S/M pair. The sock fit my foot well, but the legs were a little long (I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô1‚Äù). They rolled up behind my knees which was uncomfortable. That is why I deducted a star. [SEP] Good pregnancy compression socks. They‚Äôre not too tight compared to other brands. They‚Äôre not too thick nor too thin. Has a fun design and hits right under the knees. Wore these at work for 8 hours and didn‚Äôt have any problems. Easy to wash and dry them. They provide good comfort when I wear them. [SEP] These compression socks have been a great investment for me in terms of keeping my legs happy. They really do compress well, but are not too restrictive to where they are hard to put on. While not very soft, the fabric sits on my feet and legs well so that my legs don‚Äôt feel itchy throughout the day. And when wearing them for long periods of time, I‚Äôve noticed I don‚Äôt have to adjust or pull them up much, something I had to do constantly with my Naturalizer brand compression socks. The socks themselves look as described, and the colors are fun but not blinding neon like other compression socks sometimes are. As of writing this, I‚Äôve worn/washed them probably about 6-7 times and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any loss of compression. The only drawback I need to mention is how the inside of the socks can be ‚Äústringy‚Äù, and sometimes my toes get caught on these threads while I‚Äôm putting them on. This hasn‚Äôt been a huge inconvenience but does make the product feel a bit cheaper. [SEP] I wear a women‚Äôs size 6.5W sneakers and the S/M size fits perfectly. They offer a substantial amount of compression and yet leave a lot of wiggle room in the toes. These socks are a godsend for me. They provide me with relief from pain and swelling from being on my feet all day. No joke. They actually prevent pain for me. And I suffer from chronic pain so this is something I‚Äôm desperate to have.<br />I absolutely 100% recommend these socks. [SEP] After a friend ended up with a DVT after a long airplane flight I always wear compression socks when traveling. Planes, trains or automobiles - if I'm going to be sitting for extended periods I now wear compressions.  These are long enough to fit over my calf.  They give support but are not overly tight or uncomfortable.  I like the fabric pattern - it's jazzy for this old lady. [SEP] These were extremely hard to put on. Yes they are compression stockings but they impossible to put on and take off. My wife had to help me to remove them. I wore them for one day and they started to pill on the back of the sock like crazy. This is pretty typical with polyester. I do not recommend these. [SEP] These are nice compression socks that have provided relief to my legs. Great to have if you have circulation problems or are stand up a lot.<br />They are a little longer than needed, however I found that if I don't stretch them out a lot when starting to pull them up from my ankles, I can fit them just right below my knees.<br />At the beginning I felt a lot of compression because I was not used to, but after a few hours, your body adapts and don't feel any discomfort.

Orchid Row Women's Spring Summer Classic & Vibrant Floppy Straw Spring Summer Sunhat Red,[],[],,4.4,28,1789,"I'm a believer in sun hats when I travel and at home - sun damage is irreversible and Texas summer sun isn't to be trifled with. This one is along the lines of old school, floppy, giant sun hat styling. It has a wide, loose bring that flops a bit and can be tilted down or up, away from the eyes. The head part is deep and could fit over a loose, small bun if you're careful.<br /><br />There's no chin strap, so this hat isn't suitable for the beach or boating at all - it'll blow away in a breeze. Think of it as sunny, still day poolside, window shopping or long walk sort of hat. There's ok ventilation and I haven't noticed excessive heat wearing it outside to do light yard work or walk dogs. This is not a hat you want to roll up and throw in  a suitcase for a long trip, it won't survive much of that type of abuse. I really like the vivid red color - it looks fun and cheerful. [SEP] What a fun hat!  The wide brim allows you to have the sun blocked from your face.<br />It screams to be accessorized.  A pretty scarf tied around the brim would be perfect for this hat.<br />The price is very reasonable.<br />Also great if you are a RED HATTER.  If you don't know what that is, it's a group for older women who get together and dress in red.  But most especially wear red hats. [SEP] Every woman needs a big floppy hat in their wardrobe. It's one-size-fits-most so not everybody will fit into it. No issues with sizing on this for my wife. Works great at providing shade but the large size easily catches the wind so you'll be chasing it in windy situations. The quality is nice but it's not going to last if you crush it or stomp it. [SEP] To small for my hair/head [SEP] I've been looking for a good floppy hat for floating around in at the lake. It seems even with sunglasses, I'm always putting my hand up to block sun in my eyes. I don't consider myself to have a huge head, usually regular one size hats fit me. This one doesn't fit. It's too tight and it didn't really fit the definition of floppy summer hat. Once I squeezed it on my head, it was too rigid and very Carmen Sandiego. It made me laugh. It's probably the stretching onto my head that made it less floppy. This hat was a miss for me. [SEP] This is a nice hat for the price and you can do all kinds of stuff to accessorize it--I've tied on a silk scarf and also pinned flowers to the crown. [SEP] This hat gives a stylish and chic look to one‚Äôs attire. It is great for summers at a beach or for other outdoor activities. Exposing directly in sunlight for longer periods often gives me headache and this hat comes to my rescue.  It has a huge brim and protects face well from sunlight.I like the straw material. [SEP] Nice [SEP] This is a fashionable light weight, straw paper hat that makes a great way to shield the sun. The red color adds vibrancy to one's attire. This is a good deal for a solidly woven straw hat. [SEP] Color no igual a la foto",3,True

[SEP] I know this are a bit pricey for a plain T shirt but I was a little intrigued by the spandex in them.  These turned out to be as amazing as they sound.  That tiny bit of spandex makes a big different.  They feel thinner and lighter without looking thin.  They fit and lay better if you‚Äôre wearing them under another shirt.  The quality is nice and they are tagless at the neck.  There is a tag at the side seam at about waist height though.  It could be cut out I‚Äôm sure.  They have held up to 1 wash and I expect with the spandex that they will keep their shape and length a lot better than all cotton.

These are nicely made and a great weight for warmer days or wearing under sweaters, etc. These wide enough around to fit loosely, which is good unless you have a really skinny kiddo.

I read mainly inside. Seldom do I read outdoors. I had my husband try them on, he wasn't too keen on them. Oh well. [SEP] I am nearsighted. Recently I lost my glasses that have transitions lenses. My back up pair does not have those lenses so I thought this product would help bridge the gap. Essentially they are are a pair of frames with clear (non-prescription lenses) and clip tinted sunglass lenses. I found the sunglass portion acceptable and actually quite helpful when driving. I wore them over my regular prescription glasses and they were fine. They are supposedly designed for nearsighted people but on their own, they really made no difference whatsoever.  Still, they served the purpose in my time of need. [SEP] I was hoping these would work well for my husband, his glasses are similar in shape. But these proved to be pretty useless for him.

Not really.  The shape of the lenses doesn't work great for my glasses, which I can't really blame on the product since that was obvious from the picture.  The way these go on is they hook magnetically to the arms of the glasses, which is nice in that it doesn't leave marks on the lenses like the other more traditional ones I have.  But it also means you can't just flip them up like the other ones if you want to run into a store for a couple of minutes without actually taking the sunglasses off.  Instead, you would have to take them off and put them in your pocket and then put them back on.  That's easier if you aren't putting them on prescription glasses.<br /><br />The other big drawback is these seem pretty thin.  They don't really dim the light a whole lot.  So it probably depends on just how much sunlight you want protection from. [SEP] These do not attach onto my prescription glasses. The clip-on comes with a pair of flimsy clear glasses that it does attach to. I keep the set in my car as backup sunglasses. [SEP] For some reason I thought these would be more universal for different shapes of glasses, but they are pretty specific for the shape and size of the clip on part. If your glasses aren't the exact size and shape they won't work. [SEP] These are not clip on sunglasses. They are a pair of clear lenses with magnetic polarized lenses. I don't really know what to do with them. You can wear them as sunglasses, but the clear lenses??? They don't truly have any immediately evident purpose. I wear prescription glasses and I was hoping to use them in conjunction with them. Unfortunately they don't work with my glasses. [SEP] I was surprised by how well the magnets hold the shade lenses in place. I've bumped them all over the place riding public transportation and they've stayed put.  The clear lenses can be traded for your prescription if you want - that would be more convenient than always trading off but, for now, I'm satisfied with these sunglasses as is.<br /><br />I think they look cool.  They're not aviator or military style but lean towards that look.  I like them. [SEP] I've worn eyeglasses pretty much since I came out of the womb. I'm also very light sensitive and live in a sunny climate, so some kind of shades are pretty much necessary.<br /><br />I've been using clip-ons, and I like them. However, they require a bit more time putting them on and taking them off. I also worry that the clips might scratch or otherwise harm the plastic lenses on my eyeglasses.<br /><br />This product is much easier to put on and take off. I also think they look more stylish, and I don't have to worry about them harming my lenses.<br /><br />The biggest issue I have with them is that they are so dark that I have trouble seeing my dashboard.

SATINATO Women Basic Camisole Tanks Long Tank Top Elastic Spaghetti Strap for Women M,[],[],,3.0,24,492,"This Camisole was advertised with a little type of light bra inside! Really!!!<br />There is not any type of of bra, or something to hold you up a bit.<br /><br />The fit is tighter then what I expected, holds you in a bit,  the material is thick, which is nice, and this comes down long.<br />There is not any adjustment on the spaghetti straps, which I do not need one for now.

[SEP] I like tank tops with a little support/spandex in them when I go to sleep at night, and was interested in this one since the description said that it has a 'shelf bra for great support and coverage'. Uhm... as far as I can tell, no (shelf bra to me is either cups or separate fabric to help support the breasts, and there's nothing like that here). It's a basic tank top (with a slight v in the front) with spandex so it does provide the support, not cut too low, straps don't adjust but it does stay in place. We're not talking natural fabric here, but it's fine for sleeping in since it 'hugs' and, as stated, does provide some support because of the spandex holding things in place without being too constrictive. So I'm happy with it even if it could be a little softer.<br /><br />It's not something I'd wear without a bra beneath it (it doesn't provide THAT much support, but then I'm 34DD), but it's fine for how I'm using it. [SEP] It's  okay as a basic layering cami with a reversible neckline. I like that part, otherwise it offers no support. If you are expecting a shelf bra or a light support shape wear garment, this isn't it. At least not the one I received. The fabric is soft and stretchy. Not see through unless really stretched, but the medium did not stretch out much on me. I have a slender build. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting based upon the product description so I am a little bummed about that. Plan on wearing it tucked into to something because it rolls up pretty bad. [SEP] This is a junior size or made for petite women. I do not like this top and would not purchase it again. [SEP] This basic tank has a nice athletic fabric and is a dark black color that probably won‚Äôt fade because of the fiber content. Ones with too much cotton tend to get gray very early on. Also, the neckline is reversible, and there‚Äôs no ‚Äúfront‚Äù to the top, so you can have a slight V or a scoop. Nice! [SEP] This is a very nice, basic cami that can be worn either as a v neck or a scoop neck. It does not have a built-in bra and the fabric is matte. It does run small, so order at least 1 size up. Overall, this is a nice layering piece. [SEP] Initially dubious because of the internationalized size. Tested on a 5‚Äô1 112 lb frame.  Fit fine!<br /><br />* Good layering piece<br />* Thick, stretchy (sp) material<br />* Reversible from front to back / one is V neck<br />* Black as tested<br /><br />Not washed yet - stay tuned. [SEP] This runs really small... if you have a short torso and happen to be on the petite side, this may work for your. There is also no built in shelf bra. Also, it does ride up... It is soft though. Needless to say, I had to give this to my best friend's 10 year old daughter where it fit her perfectly. [SEP] My wife dislikes this. The material is uncomfortable and stretchy. It rides up over her belly when she wears it. She got a M but it fits like a small, which might be the cause of the riding up problem. [SEP] There's zero bust support - it's just a stretchy, short undershirt. The fabric isn't soft, it's actually a little bit itchy and carries static. The bottom rides up to just under my bust... this happens with no other shirt I own (not even stretchy undershirts). It's just super uncomfortable.",3,True

"100% Organic Cotton Washable, Reusable Kids Face Masks with Adjustable Ear Loops for Children 6-12 yrs. Two Layers of Soft, Protective Cloth for Boys and Girls. Variety 6 Pk.",['Ear Loop closure'],[],,4.0,54,3993,"My grandkids will love these cute masks, and I like that they are organic cotton. Everyone will need to be wearing face coverings for many more months due to the pandemic and it is good that more types of masks are becoming available. The designs on these are definitely cute and they are soft and stretchy. [SEP] what i like about this product:<br />- good quality and made of organic cotton<br />- comfortable<br />- easy to adjust ear loops<br />- fits well on my 7 year old<br />- reusable (reduces waste and easy to clean)<br />- slot to insert filter<br />- lots of cute and fun designs to choose from!<br /><br />The only thing about these is that there is no metal to adjust to nose. [SEP] I have a small face and these mask fit me perfectly. The print is really nice and these look like good quality and not cheap. The ear loops have adjustable sliders to change the length.<br />It's two layers of fabric, as recommend for Covid protection. Each mask has a pocket for a filter if you want that added protection. I use these for exercising outdoors in my neighborhood and when I go hiking. I can breathe pretty well with them on while running but I only wear it when passing people.<br />The outer fabric is like a cotton tee. These will shrink a tiny bit so I recommend hang drying them unless you want them to fit smaller.<br />I like these mask because they are like a smile on the outside. [SEP] Really cute and we love the stretchy and adjustable ear loops. My almost eight year old grandson is back in school and masks are required so these are a welcome addition to what we already had. [SEP] The masks themselves are an average thickness (I've seen thicker, but that seems like overkill to me, but they aren't too thin, either) and fairly stiff so it doesn't suck into your mouth or anything like that as you use it.  And I love the prints.  Having these on my kids is hilarious and they are much happier wearing something that is more fun.  The age recommendation (size-wise) seems to be about right.<br /><br />They smelled a bit funny when they arrived, so we washed before using. They seem to do fine in the wash. [SEP] I bought these for my 4 and 6 year olds and they actually fit both of them just fine. The wire helps keep it on their noses and the adjustable ear loops make it comfortable and useful all day long. [SEP] These masks can grow with a child because the face part stretches from 5 inches to 7 inches wide. Another way to look at it is that any-sized sibling can take turns wearing them after washing because the shape and stretch should conform nicely. The animal faces are on the fabric well enough that they shouldn't fade. The masks are made with an organic cotton, and they are thick enough to feel that you are protecting your young ones well.<br /><br />FILTER POCKETS: Inside of this mask you will find a pocket opening on the left side where you can slide a filter inside. MANY reusable masks out there do not have a filter pocket, but these do! I was pleasantly surprised when I saw them.<br /><br />EAR STRAPS: They are soft and stretchy. There are two silicone rubber beads on each end so you can adjust them as necessary. A leash or mask extender will clip onto the ends nicely.<br /><br />NOSE BRACKET: None. They are not necessary unless the mask doesn't conform to the face well enough to breathe through the mask. TIP: I have a favorite adult mask that I modified. I took a metal nose piece out of a disposable mask (actually two of them for thickness) and I inserted them into my reusable mask.<br /><br />WASHABLE: These masks are machine washable! [SEP] These two-layer cotton masks are soft, comfortable, and fit well.  The cute designs will make your little ones want to wear their masks and help them to remember to wear them.  Having six in the set allows a different mask for each school day of the week.  The masks can be machine washed. [SEP] If your kids are somewhere below teenagers, they will like these fun masks, too. Sure they're mostly fun and don't have a nose clip to prevent glasses from fogging up, nor are there replaceable filters (or any filters for that matter). So this is mostly for general protection.<br /><br />(This type of mask is mostly to capture droplets from the wearer. It does not prevent aerosols from escaping, which in closed rooms can build up to render basic masks like this ineffective.) [SEP] The kids are wearing masks everyday at school now.  They go through them quickly and with the wear and tear they put on them, I needed some more.  These are so cute.  Interestingly, my granddaughter chose the one with the mustache.  Grandson likes the one with the shark.  Great to have extra masks on hand that will fit smaller faces.",3,True
Udalyn 4Pcs Long Pendant Necklace Set Lock Sweater Y Shape Knot Tassel Leaf Circle Chain Choker Necklace for Women Sliver,[],[],,3.9,12,7997,"The photos look better than the real thing. This set of four long necklaces offer a nice variety of designs but the quality is poor. The ""silver"" is that type of spray painted silver you see in costume jewelry sold at 99 cent stores- a shallow metallic coating that you know will tarnish or rub off in time. The chains vary in thickness but are made of the same cheap metal. Nevertheless, this is a fun lot - jewelry you can wear just for fun with no fear of any great loss if you happen to lose it. Each one comes in a plastic baggie the way you'd get it at a wholesaler, with a single drawstring velvet bag holding them all. [SEP] The last necklace isn't worth anything to me. I would give it to a child for dress up playtime. It's thin and cheap. The other three are easy to wear and hang nicely. They are thicker and higher quality. [SEP] This review is of: Udalyn 4 Pendant Necklace Tassel Necklace Electroplating Platinum Clavicle Necklace Female Jewelry.<br /><br />Four necklaces arrived, all silver-so far, so good. Two of them are on silver cord, not chains. That's fine, I guess, but the cord looks cheap. The left-most necklace in my picture above,  has a tassel on the bottom made of several small chains. As soon as I put it on, a chain fell down my shirt. I wore it to work and when I got into my car later that day to go home, I found two more of the small chains on the floor of my car.<br /><br />I absolutely love the one that has a silver knot shape with the tassels hanging down. That one seems to have stayed intact, though I've worn it many times so far.<br /><br />The one with the three flat circles is just okay. It's nice to wear for day to day use, but it's not going to knock anyone's socks off.<br /><br />I love silver jewelry, but I don't like spending a lot of money all the time, so these do make for good day to day wear. Other than the one that seems to be losing chains by the second, the rest are of decent quality.<br /><br />Since I'm not sure what the pricing is on these right now, I cannot tell you if they're a good value or not. I can only share with you my experience, which I have done. [SEP] These necklaces are nice looking and large sized. They're very noticeable on an outfit, and really help to dress up any look.

[SEP] I'm behind on fashion and just discovered how great scarves are :-)<br /><br />In my limited experience, I've found that I prefer a lightweight, but full-looking scarf to layer over sweaters and long sleeves.  It's actually hard to find a scarf that it not too thick where it looks like a traditional scarf for skiing, and one that is so thin it looks limp.<br /><br />In the package, this scarf looked like it would be of the limp variety.  However, once removed from the package, it was revealed to be a scarf of generous size.  The fabric is slightly sheer but can be fluffed nicely.  The edge is not sewn but is rolled, which actually helps it keep its shape.  The color was off-white--a color I associate with fall but could be used anytime.  It has enough length so you can tie it in many ways.  It can be looped twice around the neck easily.  You can also roll the scarf and make a tie in the front--very nice!<br /><br />I'm actually really happy with this scarf and can't wait to add it to my work and weekend wear this fall/winter.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!

It has adjustable straps, I just wish they were thick - maybe thick black straps for a contrast. There's no underwire, which I miss. The bra shelf has really thin removable pads. Considering that there's no underwire, I would think firm cups would be ideal, because for me, it sort of flattens my chest. And I'm small-chested as is, so I don't need that. But, I have to give it credit for the fact that it comes up high under my arms - other are too short & this creates that ugly under-arm fat.

Orchid Row Kimono Printed Chiffon Open Front Ruana Wraps for Women Black/Pink,[],[],,4.2,7,725,"This kimono fits well. It has a tie at the front that I thought I wouldn‚Äôt like, but it is actually nice. It doesn‚Äôt make the kimono tight at all, but it does keep it from falling off. The sleeves are really large on this. The kimono itself is a little on the short side. I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and it came right to my hips. I love the colors. [SEP] I like this but the arms are way way way too big.  Even as a kimono style, it seems a bit excessive.  And I‚Äôm a big girl (Generally a 1X but in some styles / brands I can wear a L and in others a 2x).  That‚Äôs just a lot of arm hole.<br /><br />Looks really nice when work open or tied at the waist.  I don‚Äôt like it when tied with the tie as you lose all shape then.  Tying it at the waist worked out much better, giving me a waist.  Being chiffon it‚Äôs very lightweight and great for layering.  Especially in summer if you aren‚Äôt comfy showing off your arms but want to wear a tank because it‚Äôs hot out.  that‚Äôs the only advantage to the oversized arms.  If your arms are on the bigger side, no one will notice. [SEP] The fabric is fine. The color is fine. It's a good value. But the cut is too short and boxy. Granted, I'm far from rail thin and carry more weight in my hips and thighs. I'll still wear this at home as a bedroom coverup but it's not flattering for me to wear with jeans and a t-shirt. [SEP] This pretty kimono is very lightweight and well-made and looks great over a simple t-shirt or tank. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find this too short at all. I am short-5'2""-and it find me great. [SEP] The print on this mini kimono is really cute. It hit me just below the waist. The front tie is convenient for keeping it closed. The sleeve holes are quite generous. I typically wear a L/XL and this provided me with plenty of room. It was both cute and comfortable. It is a looser fitting top, so it's not incredibly flattering on me, but it's a great option as a coverup or to wear layered over a tank top.",3,True

In fact a week before it arrived, I got chased out of the woods by horse flies, so I was super excited to head back out armed with this hat.  And it did prove to work for the most part.  Aided with long sleeves and long pants I could wade through the swarms and look for mushrooms, but the screen ended up being a hinderance in being able to see mushrooms on the forest floor so I ended up pulling it up a lot.  In the end, the search was still a failure, but a far more comfortable failure.<br /><br />We also took it on a weekend trip to the bourndary waters and it served well enough during the twilight hours.  It is lightweight, reasonably one size fits all and interestingly designed.  I like that the net tucks into the zippered pouch on the top of the head and, while I would not want my high school crush to see me wearing it, it looks ok.  It definitely feels rugged enough to last us for the rest of our mosquito needs.  All in all, we like it, but it is still annoying enough that we can't love it.  Although when you have a huge swarm of mosquitos around your head, you are pretty fond of it. [SEP] I really liked most aspects of this.  It was comfortable and fit well.  The net was lightweight enough that it didn't effect your vision too badly but thick enough to protect you.  The spacing was perfect for the mesh webbing which really surprised me.  I normally don't like anything interfering with my FOV and wouldn't wear this is certain situations but camping or hiking in a wetland area this is necessary.  It has a drawstring to tighten the top part around your head and another draw string around the bottom of the webbing to assure the bugs don't fly under it.  It isn't the best stitching but it certainly will hold just fine.  The net folds right back up neatly in the top and is concealed well if you do it right.  My only real complaint is the cheap zipper on it.  They could've incorporated a much better zipper for not much more if any.<br /><br />It's a little lighter then most and depending on your style you'll either love or hate it for that.  It's 100% polyester which is good for a boonie style hat.  I am very happy with my new hat and will wear it proudly when the need arises.  This style hate is used by Militarizes around the world for a reason.  This was a great buy, everyone needs one of these eventually. [SEP] Awesome hat! Finally something to keep the pesky gnats out of my face when I‚Äôm gardening or doing yard work. It‚Äôs so well made. I love that the netting is built in and not an add on. It zips back up in the top of the hat when you don‚Äôt need it. It also came with some great extras of socks and a cool bandana. Really great value for the hat all by itself, add the bonus gifts and wow! 5 star experience! [SEP] Neat hat dont let looks fool you on picture the protective mask is in a zipper on top of the hat that no one will notice if your not wearing it to keep the bugs off. Where I live there is a yearly swarm of flying ants and gnats and this hat came in handy today while fishing. Was nice to not have them buzzing in my eyes ears and nose. [SEP] This is not the kind of hat I wear on constant basis. But, at the right situation (with presence of bugs and mosquitoes), this is the only hat that I would like to wear. The design of this hat is quite interesting, it hides the attached mosquito net in a zipper pocket at the top of the hat. So, the mosquito net is fully concealed when not in use. When I need the net, just unzip the pocket and pull the net out. The net is big enough to cover the whole hat, my face, my neck, till it reaches my shoulder area. No hole for mosquitoes or bugs to sneak in.<br /><br />This hat is a perfect companion when hiking in parks with big trees, like the Big Basin Redwood park in San Francisco south bay area, where mosquitoes are always around as big trees block out plenty of sun light.<br /><br />The brim of the hat is kind of soft and floppy. Though, per my personal preference, I prefer a more stiffer brim to keep the hat shape, I understand the design intend of the soft brim is to make this hat fold-able for easy storage (to pack it into the backpack) when not in use during a trip.<br /><br />The hat is made of light weight nylon material, again, for the purpose of making this hat pack-able. Nevertheless, the light nylon material gives you a cheap-made feeling. Though it survives well after two machine-wash cycles during my ownership, I still suspect the longevity of the hat. I guess this hat is meant to be used on needed basis. In most of time, you can fold the hat and carrying it in the backpack.<br /><br />All in all, this hat meets it's product claim well. For that, I don't have complaint. [SEP] The hat works for my needs.  A.  It is inexpensive.  Like the low cost.  B.  It keeps the mosquitoes off my face.  We have a bad mosquito problem in Dallas.  With this netting pulled down over my face and neck, I no longer am swatting at the little buggers.  The hat fits nicely.  It is comfortable and lightweight.  I like the fact that the netting fits in a zippered pocket on the top.  I at least don't have to keep up with the netting.  It is always ready on the top on this hat.  I don't know anything about the UPF protection.  I like the brim.  It helps keep some of the sun out of my eyes.  I could talk about the features of this hat but I got it to keep the mosquitoes off me and that's exactly what it does.  I love it. [SEP] The gnats were HORRIBLE this June!  I desperately wanted a face net when out walking the dog or doing a few tasks in the yard.  This hat fits the bill.  The net is very fine and doesn't interfere significantly with vision and it is small enough to keep gnats out.  The bottom of the net can be cinched around the neck, but I found that kind of claustrophobic, so I didn't use that much.  The crown of the hat is ""sizable"" through another bungie-cord type cinch, and there is yet another chin strap for the hat, itself.  The brim is wide enough to block as much sun as most ballcaps, but it extends all the way around the head, so provides some shade to the back of the neck, too.  It's a camo pattern which is pretty neutral.  I have a large head and this hat fit comfortably yet snugly, but there was additional room in the cinch that the crown could expand.  The hat is definitely crushable and packable.<br /><br />The hat came with several other items that I don't really care about or find useful and that weren't requested, so I'm not going to review those things.<br /><br />My husband likes this hat enough that he is ordering his own (or, as he puts it, one for me :-D) [SEP] Overall, I like this hat.<br />There are a few things I would change though.<br />First, the brim is a little on the floppy side. I can imagine that with extended use, it will become even more so. This will not only be a nuisance as it will affect visibility, but will also make the bug net a little less effective. I would recommend adding a very light stiffener of some sort to prevent this from happening, (extra fabric, extra stitching or a very thin plastic sheet).<br /><br />The nylon material that the hat is constructed of is not particularly breathable, and the permanently attached bug net is stowed in the very top of the hat...what this means is that when its really hot outside, your head kind of cooks...there's no where for all that heat to escape.<br />It would be great if: A. There was mesh, or more vent holes on the side of the hat, or B. The bug net could be removed to allow for less fabric up top and more air flow.<br /><br />The nylon fabric of the hat is quite lightweight. It hasn't rained since I recieved it, so I've been unable to test the water resistance. However, if it does soak through my bet is that it will dry very quickly.<br /><br />This ""boonie hat"" style is my favorite type of hat to wear outdoors. I own 4 or 5 other hats similar to this one, but they are all made of cotton, or cotton/poly blends. These hats do a great job of keeping the sun out of your eyes and off of your neck, face and ears as well as absorbing your head sweat.<br />They are also outstanding in wet conditions as they redirect water off of your neck, face, ears, and keep large hoods out of your field of vision. Although, once saturated they take quite awhile to dry.<br /><br />I am going to wear this hat on my next backpacking trip. I am returning to an area where I was previously swarmed by mosquitoes, (in fact, that was the impetus for me ordering this hat). I am excited for the bug protection as I really hate slathering all of my exposed skin with bug repellent!!<br /><br />So, all in all, a decent hat.<br />Make it a bit more breathable. Give it a little more rigid brim. Make the net removable.<br />And you've got yourself a winner!<br /><br />For the price though, a bargain.<br /><br />Also, they included a couple of free pairs of cotton socks and a very lightweight, synthetic ""Buff""-like head wrap along with my order.<br />Nice touch!! [SEP] I've been with Amazon since 2005, searched & bought hundreds (if not thousands) of items costing thousands of dollars, I've nevercome across an item and a vendor whom I NEVER knew, that just spells professionalism & epitomizes top Customer Service, especially post-sales support.<br /><br /> As I spend a lot of my time outside on a daily basis, and especially the California sun can be unforgiving at times in the summer, I've been looking for something that can better protect my skins & just shield the sun away from me to reduce UV Ray's exposure.I've seen others wearing them, and they all tend to be a little tacky & uncool<br /><br /> SALAMAT & Thanks to Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I'm so very lucky to have come across THIS „ÄéBayInBulak Sun Hat with UPF 50 Protection„Äè .<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it came in a military camouflage style print, it made me feel very patriotic as we just celebrated the 4th of July. The coolest thing is, not only is it great for general sun blocking capability with it's ultra wide brim around your head,on to of the hat, there's a zippered compartment. Inside, you can find a cylindrical mesh that you can pull out & pull it over your sun gat & this will protect you from all the bugs, insects, and/or sandstorm, etc. The hat itself weighs merely ounces.<br /><br /> PROS<br /> ====<br /> * Cool military style camouflage print design<br /> * Lightweight<br /> * 360¬∞ Ultra Wide Sun Blocking Brim<br /> * UPF 50 Sun Protection<br /> * Hidden zippered compartment on top<br /> * Cylindrical Mesh Insect/Bug Protection<br /> * Superior Customer Support<br /><br /> The VERDICT<br /><br /> If you or your loved ones spend a lot of time outdoors in areas where seems to be always shining strong, eg. Arizona & California, you've got get him/her this very cool military style camouflage sum hat, it's absolutely THE very best money can buy. I can NOTstop wearing it, while I drive, play golf or tennis, fihing or just out on a brisk walk in the trails. Outdoorsman's best companion in addition to his golden retriever pal, don't hesitate, & get one. [SEP] This isn't the kind of hat you'd wear on your beach holiday or out on a walk, but if the situation came about that I was unsure of the conditions or if I just didn't want bugs flying around my face, I'd totally wear this. What's nice about this hat is that the netting is hidden in the top in a zipper pouch, so you can access it easily and quickly. I'm happy that they didn't choose velcro or snaps to make this work. Basically, it works like one of those bags that zips into a pouch. Super simple. It's camo in pattern with a wide brim. It will keep its shape even if tossed in a bag with little care. It's not that bad of a hat, actually, and could definitely come in handy if you want protection from the elements!",3,True

It matches my fall mums really nicely also. I think it is cute all spring and summer but would be amazing with sweater leggings and a cardigan or dressy peacoat. Its so fun just to grab groceries but I love adding a necklace and wearing this style out to dinner. I feel so put together and I didnt even have to match tops and bottoms. Woohoo.

I need evvvvery color.<br />The buttons are very functional and makes this very easy for nursing and gives you the option of taking this from a super modest dress to a very sexy dress in seconds. ÔòØ<br />Overall I'm happy with the length but I'd have been happy with a skirt 2&#34; longer. I'm only 5'3 so if youre especially tall this might be a mini dress. With it being a fit and flare style many could size up and have a longer skirt and simply belt in the excess. If youre very thin that may not work so trust your judgement. The arms are a cap style sleeve and reasonably generous so if you have full or buff arms you may still be able to wear this style.<br />Here is here I docked one star!<br />Like SO many shirt waist dresses there is a cheap and flimsy feeling invisible zipper under one of the arms. This is all too common and I hate it. I'd gladly pay a bit more for a zipper that felt sturdier. But at only $19 with free shipping through prime I'm just going to baby it. I've paid a lot more for dresses that had the same problem. I was NOT paid or discounted for this review in anyway, [SEP] I like this dress, but it's too short. I am worried about my rear being exposed. I am going to wear it and see how it does in action, but I am going to have to be vigilant. Especially since it flares out, it really should be a few inches longer. [SEP] I love this dress but it's way too short. I'm 5'8&#34;, 125 lbs, ordered a medium and it barely covers my thighs. If I had ordered a large it would've been too big and I don't know if it would be much longer. If you're over 5'3&#34; I wouldn't recommend it for everyday wear. [SEP] For $10, I should be nearly as annoyed by this as I am; however, after seeing this dress in an ad on FB and falling in love with it, I am admittedly very disappointed.<br /><br />My coveted dress arrived today, and I anxiously tore open the packaging, which was nothing fancy: a padded envelope, with the dress in a sealed plastic bag with the tags attached.<br /><br />Lo and behold, as I'm preparing to try it on, I notice one of the buttons seems loose. Upon further inspection, I realize that it is attached merely by a safety pin. Theoretically, this could be a fashion trend I'm oblivious to, but I've never been one to follow fashion. I'm also not remotely knowledgeable on how to sew a button on (HomeEc was a thing of the past when I was in middle school).<br /><br />Now I'm stuck returning this otherwise adorable dress, with the caveat that an adult must be home for UPS to pickup the package during a business day, which is another aggravation.<br /><br />Also, I'm a 5'4, 140ish lbs and a 36 big B, small C, and the girls were ready to pop right out of the size M dress I purchased.

They don't have enough rubber or whatever on the sides to help them &#34;stick&#34; to the baseball hats. Other than that, they are fine. [SEP] Made the mistake of buying cheap sunglasses for my son to wear playing baseball. They look great and worked well but easily broke. The plastic is flimsy and they are not built to last, but for $7.00 they are a great buy for a child that treats them well. [SEP] Put them away [SEP] Son loves them [SEP] So glad purple was in the color selection. These glasses are for my granddaughter to use while horseback riding and on her bike. She is a tall 5 year old; the glasses fit well and provide ample space to grow into. They are sturdy and well made (from China). The glasses cover her eye area, the arms wrap nicely around 2/3 of her head. They did not come with a loop as pictured but for the price, style and quality I just added a croakie flowered strap in purple to suit my granddaughter's taste. She was so pleased she wore them both horseback and bike riding yesterday and aired no complaints about the glasses or not being able to see in the bright Florida sunlight. I am very pleased that they will help her protect her eyes, see better in bright sunlight (so she can perform her instructor's directions for her riding lessons) and the price point is reasonable. And she likes wearing them! BONUS!",3,True
"Kate Spade Tied Up Pave Bow Bangle, Golden",[],[],,4.8,8,350546,"My husband gave this bracelet to me for my birthday. I wore it for a few hours and somewhere, somehow the bow portion fell off of it somewhere. I contacted the company and explained to them what happened and they were kind enough to send me a brand new bracelet the same day! I love the bracelet and will definitely purchase through them in the future. [SEP] This bracelet is adorable! It is very nice and I love it. The only thing I'd caution others about is that it is fairly small. I used to weigh a lot more and there is no way this bracelet would have fit me then. I feel that I have rather tiny wrists now (the bones clearly show), so I'm not sure this would fit the average American woman (studies vary, but say the clothing size is between 14-18 for the average American woman).

"Glitziest Women's Cute and Elegant Vintage Bracelet Jewelry Beach Chain Boho Cowrie Shell Bracelet Hawaiian Jewelry, Multicolor",[],[],,4.6,8,770,"Adorable. Looks just like the picture. I don't find it super clunky or too big but I am about 5'8"" so maybe if I was 8 inches shorter I would find it too heavy. [SEP] I really like the look of this bracelet.  It screams ""SUMMER"" and is cute and colorful without being gaudy or looking like a child's bracelet.  My biggest complaint is that it is a bit too clunky and big.  I find myself taking it off a lot because it is in the way.  Right now, it is sitting here on my desk because it is uncomfortable to type with it on.  On a positive note, it doesn't rip the hairs out of my wrist like some of the shell bracelets do.  I will definitely wear it, but I just wish it was a little smaller in diameter. [SEP] Excellent boho style bracelet that is looks great with most summer outfits. Very beachy and stylish and IMO not something limited to just girls and such as any beach lover would enjoy this style and burst of color.<br /><br />Shells are sturdy and strong and don't chip easily. Handles a little bit of water well and the elastic band doesn't break easily or from normal everyday wear.<br /><br />Excellent bracelet [SEP] This is a fun little bracelet for the summer.  It reminds me of the kind we'd make as kids with beach shells (or even cereal).  It's on a stretchy string so it will fit everyone.  If you're looking for a casual piece of wrist candy that won't break the budget then this line of affordable jewelry from Glitziest will let you purchase 3 or 4 or more.<br /><br />This choice is one of many.  It has tiny cowrie shells  in a tutti fruitti color combo.  This will be appropriate for any age group.  It's really cute.  BTW - I've seen similar items at some of the trendy shops in Newport for 3x the price-point.

Durable and breathable webbing belt for tactical activities ; No holes allows easy adjustment.']",[],,4.4,124,2943,"You get 3 of these belts for just $18. They are very comfortable and work very well. I like that they are adjustable so you can make them work for you just like any other belt really so if you know you had a healthy meal these will still work for you. I like that they have a easy quick release to allow to open them quickly which is a nice convenience. I find these to be quite comfortable and they work very well. They seem very durable but only time will tell. [SEP] The description states that the belt will fit from size 28 to 44. I have no doubt on the 28 but the 44 might be a bit snug. At a size 42, I found the belt to fit perfect but think it would be close to it‚Äôs limit at 44.<br /><br />The belt is very comfortable once in place. The closure or buckle is easy to fasten and the belt doesn‚Äôt creep open like some of this style do.<br /><br />The only down side I have found is putting it through loops. One side of the buckle is just a bit too large to fit easily through the loops. If I don‚Äôt remember to thread it all the way around on the smaller side, I have to struggle though half of the belt loops with the larger end.<br /><br />Overall, a really nice belt that is more comfortable to wear than the traditional leather belt. [SEP] These are nice little tactical belts. I got these for my nephew who is super into airsoft. He has used these several times at airsoft fields and love them. The material is super thick and durable. The belts are made well and seem like they should last for a long time. They are easy to click in and easy to release. For being thick and clunky they are still nice looking. [SEP] There is a rivet on the belt loop that looks like it could come worked undone over time and the bigger issue is that this belt doesn't seem to be able to stay tight a whole day and it is somewhat difficult to tighten, a bit more than others of this style. Its okay but I tend to grab a different belt when given the choice. [SEP] La correa es de excelente calidad a mi esposo le gust√≥ mucho, la tela o el material es de excelente calidad y parece de larga durabilidad. La evilla es s√≥lida tipo militar, es f√°cil de poner y quitar. Lo bueno de esta correa es que se puede cortar y ajustar a la medida si quedara muy grande. Un √©xito. [SEP] Great price [SEP] Does a great job at holding my pants up. Love having a click buckle finally. Pretty durable with my edc, so far. No fraying at all. [SEP] The increasing popularity of tactical stuff has been good for me because I like pants with lots of pockets and reinforced knees for operations in the garden, and I've liked webbing belts since I was a Boy Scout.<br /><br />These belts are identical to [[ASIN:B08K3DBFZC some sold under another brand]] (link embedded), and maybe some other brands and listings too, so you can check other listings for the best deal if price matters.<br /><br />These aren't as stiff as the others I've tried, which some may prefer, though some who want to hang their tactical weapons from them may not.<br /><br />The webbing is plenty sturdy, and the buckle appears to be as well.<br /><br />To open the buckle, you have to press both levers. Only pressing one, as you might by accident, won't open the buckle. Opens and closes easily and securely.<br /><br />The belts don't slip while I use them.<br /><br />They come correctly put together, so you can see how they'll need to look if you need to take the buckle off one end to get the belt through the loops on your pants, as you probably will. The buckle is 2"". The webbing is just under 1-1/2"" wide.<br /><br />The strap is 47"" long, and the buckle adds almost 2"" more. Keep in mind that pants sizes measure a couple inches larger inside than their stated size (guess why!), that pants measure more outside than inside, and that you need a few inches at the end of the belt to pass through the buckle, so pants size 44 is probably about the practical limit for these, maybe less if you don't want it to look like you're at the very end of your belt.<br /><br />You can cut the free end of the belt to make it shorter, but you'd probably want to melt the new end to keep it from unraveling.<br /><br />Vinner, as used here, doesn't appear to be a registered brand in the US. The belts are made in China. [SEP] These are extremely strong work type belts.  Having worn actual ""tactical"" belts I wouldn't actually call these ""tactical"" unless you're talking about paintball.  I've been using these type belts for the past year or so and none have worn out yet.  I suspect they'll outlive me.  Important to note that you do have to remove one of the buckles to fit the belt through standard belt loops.  Bottom line is that the quick release feature works great if you're not changing the belt but every time you put the belt on a new pair of pants, you have to remove one of the buckles - and you can only remove one of the two - in order to string it through a normal set of belt loops.  Basically you leave the two parts of the ""buckle"" connected, sting the belt through your belt loops and then restring the webbing  through the one side of the buckle.  It's quick and easy once you get used to it.  They recommend that you not cut the belt but I cut it a 3 or 4 inches longer than I need and sear the new end with a heat gun.  Works great.  A number of 3 belts sets on Amazon are identical, and I mean identical, but these are the least expensive I've found. [SEP] I personally like the look of tactical belts, and I appreciate the easy fastening and unfastening of them.  It sort of reminds me of putting on a seatbelt for your pants.  Depending on the pants, you may find it a challenge to loop it through the pant loops, but in most cases that wasn't an issue really, and you can remove the clasp to get it through. A little annoying but doable of course. The material is strong as hell, and for the three pack it seems to be a very nice value, in my opinion.  If you ever need to tow your car for some reason, and get stuck in a bad situation, you could just undo your belt and use this, seriously (just kidding of course, but it seems strong enough).  For me at a 33 or 34 depending on the pants, I had to cut it to size because it was quite long, but that was to be expected.  As far as function is concerned, they work great, and for this price they will last forever, so great value.",3,True

Soft and slightly fuzzy to the touch, they stretch well enough to get on/off easily, and are not so tight that they leave marks when bunched up near the ankle, which she insists on doing for no good reason.

When they arrived, I was quite surprised at their quality for being costume type jewelry. The metal is polished to a shine.  The post is plenty long to be able to get the into the lobe and to clasp them shut.  Be careful not to bend the posts because if you do they will not close properly.  My wife wore them for an entire day and the clasps did not come open but as she took one off, she bent the post slightly and had to bend it slightly back into the correct place to keep it clasped.<br />The cut of the ‚Äústones‚Äù catches the light.  You can tell by the deep green of the middle stone, that these are lab created.  Most real Emeralds are a lighter green.  I have seen much more expensive earrings with simulated stones, and this set beat most of them in color and quality.  The smaller halo ‚Äústones‚Äù are big enough to catch the light.<br />My wife suffers from some metal allergies. Yet these earrings did not cause any reaction on her skin. Nor did they make her lobe sore or itch.<br />Overall for their price point, these are a very pretty pair of costume jewelry earrings.  The look beautiful on and my wife will get lots of use out of these earrings. [SEP] These earrings are beautiful, but the posts that are supposed to go through the earlobe are thick. As in too thick to fit through my pierced ear holes, so I can't wear them. I wear earrings often and have no trouble with most. [SEP] The green stones surrounded by the cz really pop!  Size is about a fingernail, have lever backs, lever part thru ear is not thin or fragile.  Since I have multiple piercings, I can wear these in lower spot and they dangle a bit and really catch the eye w/movement.  When worn higher up they stay facing the front unlike some earrings w/stones that face down with the weight.  I would like better if these were cheaper, but, whatever :) [SEP] (Reviewed by my wife): Like another reviewer on here, I found the posts way too thick to get into my ear holes.  In addition to being thicker than normal, the posts also have a little hook on them so when I was trying to put them in my ear the little hook was catching inside my ear hole and made it painful.  So unfortunately these earrings are totally unwearable for me.<br /><br />If you have wider ear holes that can accommodate the thick posts I say go for it.  The earrings are extremely beautiful.  They will not fool anyone into thinking they are ""real"" but the green crystal and the faux diamonds are pretty stunning. [SEP] My wife and I have been married over ten years. When we got engaged, she insisted that she didn't want a traditional diamond engagement ring--she wanted something unique and colorful. I eventually settled on an emerald setting in platinum with two smaller diamonds.<br /><br />As the years have gone on, we have talked about getting a pendant and earrings to match the engagement ring. I found a pendant for our tenth wedding anniversary, but earrings have eluded us--not just in design, but because we're more focused on saving for our child's college education than on buying jewelry.<br /><br />When I saw these earrings, I was stunned--they're a PERFECT match for the ring and pendant, looking almost like they were designed as part of a set with the ring--and are VERY affordable.<br /><br />She hasn't had frequent opportunities to wear these earrings, but she loves them. It's hard to believe, looking at the stones, that they aren't real emeralds and diamonds. [SEP] I had purchased a similar pair at the same time.  These are even MORE stunning than the CZ pair I purchased.  Both are the same style, shape, size, weight, design, etc.  However, with the green stone (the look of an emerald), the constrast is so eye catching.  The brilliance of the sparkles as the facets catch the light make it easily the most beautiful piece in my jewelry box.<br /><br />The post of the earrings actually goes through the earring and the back comes up like that of a clip-on style.  The vertical piece in the back has a slot in like a seweing needle does for the thread to goes through.  The post goes through the ""thread hole"" and snaps into place.  Ta-dah!!  A secure closure for a beautiful earrings that you don't want to lose.<br /><br />Over the years, I've come to know that no one asks if the piece of jewely is a precious gem or costume piece.  No one.  Jewely is meant to adorn the body and be beautiful, reflect a certain style of the wearer, or maybe even the class of the wearer.  Making jewelry pieces with from non-traditional sources that result in the same look with a lower price point makes wearing jewelry more affordable.  This pair of earrings is the perfect example of that.<br /><br />With care and gentle clearning, this amazing pair of earrings will look this stunning for years (if not decades) to come.<br /><br />My only ""con"" in my personal pros and cons, is a personal one.  Jewelry doesn't come in sizes.  Costume jewelry is often layered or plated.  Unfortunately for me, the posts of the earrings are somehow just a little too thick to go through my ear piercings.  My lobes may be swollen, so I will try again in a few days.  These phenominal earrings are keepers.  Simply gorgeous!! [SEP] Beautiful!<br /><br />I was given a beautiful white gold necklace with my first grandson‚Äôs birthstone, an emerald. These earrings complement the necklace nicely. Perfect set to wear to an upcoming wedding.<br /><br />These earring have prints with a nice hinged cover. They are cubic zirconias and add so much sparkle.  But, I‚Äôm really having trouble wearing them. I can‚Äôt seem to get them to fit my pierced hole. The stud is really thick. I‚Äôve compared them to my other earrings and they are about twice the thickness.",3,True
Orchid Row Women's Fashionable Everyday Classic Kimono with Lace Trim Detail Saffron,[],[],,2.7,21,1066,"Cute kimono that is comfortable and fits well. I'm 5'4&#34; and 150 pounds and this kimono does not feel oversized. I would imagine it would be too big for those smaller than me though. This color (yellow) is bright and vibrant - perfect for summer and spring! I've worn this over white tank tops with jeans. One main drawback is that it must be hand washed - this is a big drawback for me as I am a busy mom of two young kids.<br />I would agree with other reviewers that this would be a good option for a beach coverup. [SEP] My teenager really loves this chiffon kimono.  I gave it to her yesterday and she wore it to school for picture day, today.  She wore it over a solid black tee-shirt and black skinny jeans and it looked really nice on her.  It's very light-weight and easy to put on.  I haven't washed it yet but will this weekend and report back if it doesn't do well in the machines.  I like for reviews of clothing to include how they did in the wash/dry cycles so I will be back to update that. [SEP] This has garnered a ton of compliments from the very first time it was worn. People love the color, which can be best described as a deep canary yellow. I would call it a fall yellow and works perfectly in the cooler season. The cut is complimentary despite it being a coverall, the length offers a contour without being clingy or shapeless. I love the lace trim, it adds a nice pop and makes this stand out even more. The lace furthers it's versatility in that you can wear it to run out in a pair of jeans or dress it up with a pair of black slacks. It is incredibly light, so this isn't something that will protect you from the outdoor elements or even a needless air conditioner. It is best for a warm fall day or an office that is kept at a reasonable temperature.<br /><br />Don't be afraid of this color. Folks tend to steer away from this, but I feel the depth of the yellow makes it more approachable. This is a fantastic piece that is very popular! It's great for soaking up compliments and having hung by the door. [SEP] This chiffon kimono with lace trim is cute. This looks simple and nice, and it can be worn over a swimsuit or over casual wear, in both cases this adds a nice (dare I say casually elegant) touch to casual wear and/or a swimsuit. Overall I like it, it is also very generously sized, so it looks fluffy and nice. [SEP] The positives... the fringe is cute as it is like a wide stripe of lace and this top is a bright pop of color and an easy and effortless cover-up piece that fits just about any shape or size. This just has no shape to it at all. I don't know what kind of magicians they have photographing pieces like this but there really is nothing attractive about the way it drapes. The fabric is also fragile. Just walking by something in my house, the item poked and hooked through the material because it has such a loose weave. I can't imagine wearing it at a beach or poolside because the fabric doesn't seem durable. [SEP] This versatile kimono is a useful accessory - not only for beach wear - and the colour is lovely. The material is a bit fragile, but it is a fine summer wrap, or accessory to dress up colour coordinated outfits indoors in chillier weather. (It is very light  - not for warmth, but for style.) [SEP] I was hoping for a cute, boho-type thing to throw on over a tank since I'm not a beach-goer, but this is just way to big for me. I'm five feet nothing, neither skinny nor chubby, but I've tried and just can't make this thing work. The lace on the hem is okay, but I really don't know how well it'll wear. The material has a nice feel to it and it is cute, but I do feel it's overpriced as well. Overall, if you're on the smaller side, I'd pass. [SEP] This is a quick beach cover-up to put over your beach wear when you walk through the hotel lobby or when you run off to the snack shed.  The material is very light with just a few seams that seem quite fragile.  There is a lace border at the bottom that, to me, does not seem in character with the beach look.  Again, the chiffon material must be hand washed and hung dry which seems too fussy for rugged outdoor wear. [SEP] This is super sheer and quite lovely. A very very lightweight cover up. [SEP] This is a gauzy, lightweight coverup for the warmer months. The color is a lovely goldenrod that adds a pop of color to any outfit. The lacy trim is nice. The only caveat is that it‚Äôs quite long and looks more proportional on a medium to tall wearer.",3,True

Or the material could be thinner and softer.<br /><br />I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 130 lbs, wear a 34 or 36 B, or C . But this Felt tight. [SEP] Fits as expected, the straps are soft and stretchy. The cups are firmer than most sports bras so that may not be great for those with larger chests as it adds to the bulk. I'll probably size up next time but this is still comfortable [SEP] This review is for YEEPSYS Sports Bra for Women, Criss-Cross Back Padded Strappy Sports Bras Medium Support Yoga Bra with Removable Cups. This is a cute sports bra. I think it runs a little small but I also find most sports bras run small. It offers good coverage and it is about a medium support for a sports bra. It is comfortable and moves with you and you don't feel too restrictive when working out or wearing it for a while. Overall for the price is a good value in a sports bra. [SEP] if you're  a B, this might  be too small for you. i am a B and these are a bit loose. but the design is really nice. i love the crisscrossed back, very cute. no complaints except that it doesn't give much support. good for yoga, not for high impact exercises. not a lot of support. [SEP] Like the fit and it is very comfortable. Only wish it had a hook style opening in the back so it would be easier to put on. Love that I don't have straps sliding down all the time. [SEP] I really like the look and feel of this sports bra.  It's very soft, the criss-cross back looks great and is just like the photo.  I would agree that it's definitely a medium support bra especially for larger chests like mine.  I would also recommend using the sizing chart since I ordered a large for my 38D and should have gone with an XL.  I'm still happy with it and can wear it but it obviously doesn't quite fit as it should.  Overall, a good purchase. [SEP] This was an unexpectedly great purchase.  I'm always looking for a nice sports bra that fits my 36DD without being huge everywhere else.  This was great.  There was no bulging over the top of tightness across the bottom.  The straps were just tight enough to hold everything in place.  Definitely going to get more. [SEP] This sports bra is pretty from the back.  It runs a bit large around the rib cage.  The straps are not adjustable so it either fits well or not.  The padding is very bulky.  Like pillows for your bosom.  I'd say that support is minimal to medium but that may be because of how the straps fit.  Chest coverage is good.<br /><br />My daughter likes it but it really does not fit her well. [SEP] A review from the woman who go this sports bra:<br /><br />This sports bra has many positive features, including removable padding and a crisscrossed back design. It provides good support, especially for the back, yet is very comfortable to wear. Since this sports bra doesn't shift easily, it's perfect for activities such as yoga or working out at the gym. The material is breathable and sweat-wicking.<br /><br />My only criticism is that it has more coverage than the typical sports bra, thus is visible when wearing a sleeveless tank top. It's fine with a typical T-shirt, however. Although I doubt I would order this particular sports bra again, I think someone who prefers the extra coverage would be very pleased. [SEP] This sports bra fits as expected and is comfortable and cute.  The padding stayed in place during washing which is great.  One note about the padding though, is that they are very thick and stiff pads.  They definitely work for modesty, and they didn't get in the way when I was working out, but at one point as I was putting it on, it felt a little like I was putting on body armor.  They are not like any of the other sports bras I own, but I suppose if I had to pick between these and the pads that roll up and shift in the wash or while you are wearing them, I'd definitely pick these.",3,True

Also the tint is just right. I like that the tint is different from top to bottom. All in all the design of them is just perfect, exactly what I would design if I were a designer. The fit is also perfect for me, like they were meant for me. I am happy they added UV protection to them so your eyes are protected even more. I think the price is also just right, actually on the cheaper side especially for the quality. I think these are very well made and to get this kind of quality for $13 is a fantastic deal!<br /><br />The one thing I am not crazy about, I was under the impression they were progressive glasses with correction, meaning the top would have no correction and the bottom would. However, what they do have is no correction on the top but on the bottom they just have a bifocal insert with the 1X correction. So they really are bifocals and not progressive lenses. This is more explained in the actual description but in the title they are advertised more as progressive lenses so read carefully and make sure you want bifocals.<br /><br />As bifocals they are perfect and really have nothing left to ask for. I just wish they would offer more progressive lenses since bifocals are a bit tough to use for reading and such.<br /><br />They do come with a case which I found is a bit cheap, but come on for $13 and getting glasses this good, I am not complaining and at least you have something to protect them with. It also comes with a jewelry screwdriver that is kind of neat and will come in handy. [SEP] If you only need a slight boost in your reading glasses, especially if you like to read outside, these would be perfect for you. They are 1.0X magnifying bifocal reading/sunglasses. The gradually go from darker to lighter (top to bottom). The glasses appear to be well made and they came with a good case, cleaning cloth, and a nice little screwdriver which can always be useful. These are very nice glasses for those that need the slight boost. [SEP] These sunglasses are perfect for outdoor reading which is something that I do a lot. These are lightweight and made with thin metal.  They are suppost to be Bifocal Reading Glasses so at the bottom is for reading but I didn't notice that much of a magnification. These are more purple tinted than grey, and my husband said they look more like women's. They do come with a case and small screwdriver for repairs. [SEP] They seem to be nicely enough made, but they just feel awkward to me. I can't really get into these at all. [SEP] I frequently have to switch between my readers and sunglasses and these SKYWAY Reading Glasses & Sun Glasses have eliminated the constant switching or asking my companion to read the small print for me on labels while shopping or just browsing. I also can now read outdoors and still have my normal distance visions. They are comfortable and have a nicely padded nosepiece. [SEP] Very nice glasses. Bifocals with a gradient tinting.  Included a nice zipper case.<br />Unfortunately the gradient tinting allows too much light through in bright sunlight [SEP] I got these for my husband to try reading fine print with his far sighted eyes.  These do help him see print he can't normally see, but the magnification area is so small and low in the frame, I felt like it restricted how I could read thing.  The upper 2/3 of the lenses are a purple color that might work fine for wearing outside reading a book, but look a bit feminine for my husband's taste to use outside of backup when he needs to read fine print in the house.<br /><br />These glasses seem sturdy and well made. They include a zip closure case, a cleaning cloth, and a glasses repair tool. [SEP] These have an adaptive tint, so they get darker towards the top of the lens. The reading portion which is at the bottom more for wearing at the beach than for driving.  Pretty solid for rimless glasses. Comes with a case, cleaning clothe and a tool to tighten the arms.

I don't mean on the face, since the style is sort of meant to fit that way, but on the head. They were so wide they wouldn't sit anywhere near my ears let alone stay on my face, and I'd say I have a smaller to average head size. Without being able to properly wear them, it's hard to give a thorough review. However, the colors were nice -- classic. They probably wouldn't hold up well to being tossed in a bag as they are prone to scratching and don't have the strongest frame, but hey they're stylish and affordable. [SEP] These sunglasses fit great, even for large or XL heads.  They are just the right size for driving, with good coverage.  They are polarized, which minimizes reflection and increases visibility, making driving safe.  The tint is not too dark, so they may not be dark enough driving at noon in the desert sun, but they will still help.  For driving at other hours or in other parts of the country, the tint is just right for comfortable and safe driving. [SEP] These glasses are very stylish. They look fantastic. I also like the extra picture that comes with them so that you can verify they are polarized. [SEP] Have used these when riding on our bikes and they provide nice glare and wind protection. The frame is a little less sturdy than I like but overall they work well.

They are sheer and make my legs look great in my dresses and skirts.  They do not tear easily and are great for all day use. [SEP] These stretch like no other hose I've worn before.

These are nice, sheer black hose that fit my big size 4x body and that's the important part!  Even us big girls like to get dressed up for a night on the town once in a while! [SEP] These are rather elastic, making them easy to put on. The look (black, translucent) is good, too, though the fibers are not especially strong. They are a nice size, but I'm not sure how long I expect them to last. [SEP] I am infamous for trying new tights. Be careful with these they snag easily. If you‚Äôre careful you can get more then I will wear out if them. Also they don‚Äôt stretch as much as I personally like. I have think thighs and hips so I need that extra pull. Overall these are ok. [SEP] I was immediately struck at how silky these panty hose are.  They seem very durable and the color is a sheer black.  I think the leg length is a bit long but it's fine overall.  I really love the feel of these panty hose.  They feel soft ans silky and very comfortable once on.  I would definitely buy these again.  The quality is good and the value high. [SEP] I actually don't like the product picture, it makes it seem like these are going to be so stretchy and big that they really won't be flattering at all.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  I was really concerned that the top would just be ridiculous and I'd end up tucking it into my bra but the control top is comfortable and form fitting smoothing out my curves.<br /><br />I also like the sheerness of the legs.  They are silky smooth and glossy looking.  the 20 denier is just dark enough to hide some of the flaws on my legs.  They pair beautifully with all of my skirts that require black stockings.<br /><br />I really like these and the three pack pricing makes each pair $3.30.  For me that is a good price for a pair of stockings. [SEP] These are fairly decent quality hosiery, at least as far as hosiery goes. Goodness knows I have the worst of issues either putting similar products on, or going the day without getting a huge snag that is clear and apparent. So far, that hasn‚Äôt been too much of an issue with these. The size is also fairly on point as well. These will be perfect for when I start going back to the office!",3,True

You can wear this year round comfortably. I really like the soft material and it's a really good length to twist into different knots. [SEP] So light and so beautiful without demanding everybody to stare at it.<br /><br />That line was supposed to be my headline for this review, but it fits so much better inside the body of this review, just as the scarf fits so perfectly on the body of my wife.<br /><br />Not sure if the lightness of the weight or the lightness of the color is the most welcome feature. I am exhausted by the vibrant colors of so many articles of clothing that women wear nowadays, so, perhaps, the light color and the almost invisibility of the scarf is what I most appreciate. [SEP] This is a fabulous travel scarf, as it's versatile enough to work as an evening shawl, a regular scarf, and as a scarf/headcover should you walk into a mosque, Jewish temple, or Roman Catholic cathedral and need to quickly cover your hair. The scarf is beautiful and gauzy, meaning it'll take up barely any room in a bag or suitcase, and weighs only slightly more than a feather.  But best of all, despite being made from such modern materials as nylon and polyester, it looks as though it came direct from the costume houses which serviced &#34;Downton Abbey.&#34; (Or, better yet to my taste, it looks as though it was pulled from the pages of the Amelia Peabody book series by Elizabeth Peters. Though the scarf, with its lace border, is too delicate to have been worn by Amelia herself - she would've torn it to bits in the nearest tomb - it's definitely something Mrs. Walter Emerson, aka Evelyn, or Nefret would've worn.) [SEP] Absolutely beautiful scarf. It is delicate, breezy, and it classes up every outfit I wear it with. I am buying one in every color. [SEP] This beautiful scarf pairs with everything.

La Raffine S925 silver star Stud female smooth spring twirling pentagram wave drop earrings(Silver Color) for Women Girl Gifts Present Valentines Birthday Anniversary Mothers Day Christmas,[],[],,3.0,35,2407,"These star earrings, earcuffs were really unique.<br /><br />They were pretty. They are pretty versatile and will work for a great deal of settings and people.<br /><br />I thought these were unique. They came packaged nicely. The quality seemed good.<br /><br />They were very comfortable to wear. They were flattering on. They felt secure on my ears. I thought they were a reasonable value. I would recommend them.<br /><br />It is nice that they are real sterling silver. [SEP] My 13 yr old has double ear piercing. I thought these were great. They are a little thin, but she said they were easy to put on. Now she is excited about it looking like she has three holes. I hope this will curb her desire to get that said hole. [SEP] I bought these earrings for my daughter. She has one piercing in her ears and has REALLY wanted a double piercing, so these earrings seemed like the perfect solution for both of us- daughter that wants a double piercing and mom who says, no, one only.  The earrings are made of a thin silver material that is easily bent. The problem she ran into, was trying to figure out how to place the earring in one hole and wind the earrings around. At first it was an abysmal failure and we could not figure out how to make the earring look like a double piercing. Then we went back to the listing on Amazon that included pictures explaining how to use the earrings if you have piercing or if you have two piercings. Overall, I give this a 4 rating, as the wire is thin, a little thinner than I'd like and you have to go to the Amazon listing to figure out how to situate the earrings in your ears. However, they are quite pretty and now that we've figured out how to put them in, my daughter has received a lot of compliments when she wears them, and loves them. [SEP] I can't say I like these earrings all that much.  They are very thin, tend to catch onto things like clothes being pulled on or off over my head, and on pillows if I forget to take them out.  When they get stuck they catch they stretched out and I have to bend them back.  I wore these for about 2 days and when I took them out the metal had tarnished into another color and looked bad.  I can't advise buying these and mine aren't going to get tossed since they're Sterling silver, but I doubt I'll be wearing them anymore. [SEP] I was so happy when I opened this box and saw how nice these earrings are.  They are very shiny and designed so they use 2 holes...love the design.  Also one of the most important features is they are comfortable. These earrings came in a giftable box. Nice enough to gift if you can bear to part with them, the solution to that problem is to buy one set for you and one set to give. At the reasonable price of $12.99 with free shipping, you can afford to buy 2 sets. [SEP] I wanted to love these. I've had my double lobe piercing since the early 2000's and was hoping these would look really cute. Please be warned these are actually very sharp and rather difficult to put in. I struggled for about ten minutes on each ear to thread through the back and front and find the ""direction"" they went in. When I did finally get them in they looked awkward and too small. I might have bigger ears though so these could very well fit on a smaller ear. The jewelry itself was very pretty. I'm not sure if it's real silver based on the oversize stamp on it but I didn't have any issue with itchy ears or changing color. [SEP] I have some pros and cons for this piece of jewelry.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />This is an unusual piece of jewelry. It's simple in its design but is something that could easily grab someone's attention since it's unusual to have a piercing that wraps around your ears like this. I can also see this working well with cartilage piercings once you get used to putting it on. I also like the simple design, since it allows the wearer to pair it with everyday clothing items or wear to work. I do love more fancy designs, but there's always something to be said for simplicity. This is also fairly sturdy, which proved to be an asset when it came to my fumbling around with it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />While I like these earrings, they are pretty difficult to put on and took quite a lot of practice. This may be because I'm not all that coordinated, but I think it's also because these didn't come with any instructions for wear. There are instructions on the listing, but if I were to give these as a gift I wouldn't really want the recipient to check the listing and see how much I paid for them. It would be good to have some instructions in the packaging just in case the user is unfamiliar with this type of earring, as I was. To put these on you have to start from the back as opposed to the front (the way most earrings are set up), so it took me a lot of fumbling to be able to get used to this. It also seemed that this was a bit thicker than my earring holes. That may be because of the type of earrings I use, but I'm not certain. This also felt a little like costume jewelry but then again, it's not like this is high end silver. I don't think that most would expect this to be at this price poing.<br /><br />Most of my quibbles honestly stem around the lack of instructions with the package, to be honest. [SEP] These earrings look unique and cute; the design can make a single piercing look like a double.  Putting them on can be a little challenging if not in front of a mirror.  However, with a mirror guiding one's hands, the trick is to 'corkscrew' the wire end into the piercing hole from the *back* to the front of the earlobe.  The earrings are lightweight and comfortable.  I am sometimes wary of silver jewelry if a piece looks arduous to keep clean, but this style is very easy to keep free of tarnish; simply dip these earrings into liquid silver cleaner, rinse with soapy water, and they'll look like new.  The spunky design makes these a great gift for teens. [SEP] These look cute BUT they show a slight discoloration although they are brand new, which makes me question their 925 stamping (as shown in pictures).<br /><br />Also, they are slightly difficult to put on because of the swirl design, and in my case my ears are very sensitive, which means that they turn red easily. After the hassle of putting them on, they do look nice!<br /><br />Unsure if I'd recommend this purchase, tho! [SEP] These earrings are so cute! I only have one piercing on my lobe, so I have to thread the earring through the back to the front in order to get the desired effect.  If you have two piercing, you would thread the earring front to back like a normal earring. It took a little longer to put the earring in, but in the long run that didn't matter at all. These are nicely made, come in a cute box, and honestly are absolutely adorable. I slept in these with no issues, and I don't have to adjust them half as much as I thought I was going to have to. Sometimes they do slip off the lobe, but they're easy to adjust back into place. I can't get over how cute these are and I've gotten a lot of compliments on them while wearing them.",3,True
shoeslocker Womens Ankle Boots Slip on Side V Cutout Pointed Toe Faux Leather Chunky Stacked Low Heel Anti-skid Outdoor Warm Boots and Booties for Women and Girls Brown Size 9,['Rubber sole'],[],,3.8,11,6306,"I am astonished by the quality in the stitching and construction of these ankle boots. They are faux-suede, but you'd never know it! And the rubber sole is a real plus. I love the little heel on these to give me a little more height and it's a heel I can manage -- not too high! The design with little tabs on the back give them extra appeal and assist in putting the ankle boots on. These size 9's are big on my 7.5 foot unless I wear a thick sock, and then they're just about the right fit. The foam cushioned insole that's already inside these ankle boots, plus the socks give them a lot of cushioning for comfort. They look attractive on the foot and they'll look even better with book cut jeans. They're easy to slip on and off because there's a slit with a piece of elastic on the side. Very cool ankle boots! [SEP] These are the type of shoes you wear from your house to the car, car to the restaurant, and back to the house.  They are not very comfortable.  The V creates a peak on the front of the shoe and in the back.  It is kind of a hard ""faux"" leather material and it is higher than it looks in the photos. It rubs on the front of your ankle and in the back.  You can wear some small bootie socks to improve some of the comfort but those 2 places are still going to rub due to the ""V"" style.  They are a pretty brown color and a very soft material, but overall not designed for comfort.  They have potential, but I would have probably returned these. [SEP] I've always been a size 9, and these fit in the snug side. I have to wear a thin sock. But to be fair, I've been pregnant twice and my feet grew both times. They're comfortable, though. I don't know if I could walk long distances in them, as the top front rim digs into my ankle a bit. I'm sure they'll soften up, though. The ankle is very low, I may get lower socks or the peds so you can't see a sock. [SEP] These shoes look nice in person. The size fits as expected. They are fairly sturdy and firm. I could see these being uncomfortable if they aren't a perfect fit for your foot but fortunately wasn't an issue for me. They are faux leather so I don't expect them to last for the long haul, but they do give a nice look at a good price.

The traditional waist measurements for a size S are 26 to 27 in (66 to 68 cm) or even more depending on size charts. So these are at least 2‚Äù out of size, which is typically the difference between sizes. Based on my experience you should order a size up. Also I‚Äôm not sure they would flatter many body types.

The pocket is a bit larger than previous zip pocket scarves I have purchased.  My first time opening the zipper I had a tiny trouble the material catching, but it is really  fine.  Glad I got this for what I need. [SEP] really pretty colors and pocket is just the right size. [SEP] Colors pretty for this scarf.  Plan to use it travelling.  Big enough to hold my Samsung 5 and a bit larger phone, passport, and a couple other things.  One issue is the zipper - it's black and obvious, not great for a &#34;hidden&#34; compartment.  But the scarf is attractive and usable. [SEP] Bought this scarf for a trip, liked the idea of a zippered compartment for valuables. The color looks like orange but actually more gold, the pink is as it appears. Like the fabric and that it has plenty of material. [SEP] i orderd 2 more [SEP] plan to try it out during an upcoming trip [SEP] Awesome scarf for traveling or everyday use. Super soft and fast shipping! [SEP] I had heard about pickpockets when traveling especially in Rome and Florence and liked the idea of having my money or phone or keys close to me.  The color was great and looked good with black, white and (surprise!) wine colored tops.  It was warm and I especially when it was windy.  It was great to keep my phone close when I was using it to take pictures.  I spilled dark chocolate gelato on it and stains washed right out and it dried really fast.  My only suggestion is use a zipper that matches the fabric as the black zipper shows through the fabric and please please make this in other colors!  Black would be great or Black/white,  or Two tones of blue, like Turquoise and royal blue!  But this is a keeper!  Price was better than the shouldit brand. [SEP] pocket too small and visible due to black zipper. [SEP] Very nice, the pocket is large with a nice zipper but hidden well.  The fabric is a nice weight.  It is a gift for my daughter so she has not worn it yet.  But I am pleased and would order it again.",3,True

BAGVIO Compression Packing Cubes for Travel - Premium Luggage Organizer Set (Set of 2),[],[],,3.9,26,6291,"We already have several packing cubes with some being able to compress. I got this pack for my camping close. I'm always tossing my stuff in a ruck and then scrounging around in the dark looking for my sleep wear. And with camping, space matters.<br />The set I received came in black rather than the teal that is shown. I would have been okay with either color. The zipper pulls are nice size. They move easily around the cubes. I had no problems getting my socks and tees loaded and pressed in.<br />I really like the window on the larger pack. I think the smaller pack would benefit from the same feature.<br />One thing that I did notice when using these packs is that the zippers make a considerable amount of noise. Maybe not a big deal now, but in the middle of the night, everything always seem louder. I would have like the zipper pulls to be coated in plastic. I may just have to do that myself with some plastidip.<br />Other than those minor observations, these things work great. If you were using these for travel, you might need a second set. [SEP] These are well-made packing cubes. The zippers work very well. The bags have the ability to expand to meet your traveling needs. I love packing cubes in general. They always make for a more organized traveling experience. No more having TSA rummage through your underwear for the whole airport to see üòÇ. [SEP] After reading an article on TheWireCutter about packing cubes, I tried some. Rather than digging through a packed suitcase for socks or T-shirts, I know that I can easily find the cube that has those items and get right to it. I honestly would rather stay home than travel for a two week trip and have all my clothes stuffed into a bag without cubes.<br /><br />These Bagvio cubes are nice. They look nice and are well made. The zippers are top notch quality. The stitching is good and should last. The fabric is lightweight - which is a mixed quality - they don't add much weight to your luggage, but they also flop around a bit and might not last for many many trips.<br /><br />The larger Bagvio cube has a partial mesh window so you can see what is inside. The smaller cube is solid, so no clue what it contains. I prefer packing cubes that easily show what is inside. [SEP] I'm always surprised that one of my colleagues who seem to be able to pack so lightly, yet he's got everything. Later, when we were checking out of our hotel room, I saw these smaller & different sizes of packing bags which allowed him to be more organized and still able to carry more essentials than just throw everything into the luaggages at random - not always the best use of limited space.<br /><br />Inspired by this and through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across & ordered this „ÄéBAGVIO Travel Compression Packing Cubes„Äèwhich had the color scheme that I liked & also quite a few positive reviews. Now, I want to see it for myself & share with you guys.ü§îü§îü§î Let's see how it faresü§îü§îü§îü§î<br /><br />üîÜ‚úîÔ∏èNOTE:‚úîÔ∏èüîÜ Right now, due to short staffing during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Amazon has disabled capabilities to upload photos/videos, so only text reviews are permitted.

With only two cubes included, a large & small, it's just too few to properly organized different categories of items. I'd say, as a MINIMUM, a packing cube set must come in at least 4 different sizes to really EFFECTIVELY make a difference in the way we pack - I mean, do I really want to put my personal hygiene products with my socks & underwears (especially worn stinky socks üôÑüòèüòí). Moreover, despite the product description says ""compression"" cubes, the fabrics is basically loose canvas, unless you pack it to EXTREME tightness, the items inside still will shift around, again, defeating one of the key benefits of using a packing cube. In addition, the canvas material for sure will hold up to wear & tear over time, but the inside stitching may not - would've like to see DOUBLE stitching. Finally, as a value shopper (good stuff bought at a discount - isn't thusvwhy we love Prime Day?üòÇüòÖüòÇüòã), the price info is unavailable as of this review, so it's difficult to comment on the value of this but. In other words, if only two cubes but priced say, for the sake of argument, $10, then it's reasonable in value; $15-$25? Not so much.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />‚ûø„Ä∞Ô∏èüÜí‚ûø„Ä∞Ô∏èüÜí<br />If you only need a couple of packing cubes to help organize your SHORT travel packing, then this might do the job adequately. However, I tend to believe, if you even consider buying a set of packing cubes, you most likely are going on a longer trip & longer durations - needing more stuff in the process, then I'd consider other packing cubes options. This one just didn't do enough for me, unfortunately üôÑüòèü§îüòÅü§î<br /><br />üòèüòíüòí üòÆüò≤Not Recommendedü§´ü§´ü§êü§êü§ê [SEP] I've been using packing cubes for a long time -- it's a great way to organize your luggage.  The problem with this set is how TINY the cubes are.  The larger one is so small that I was only able to get a few t-shirts in it.  The smaller one is best used for toiletries, although I have other toiletry bags that are much better designed.<br /><br />Additionally, these bags are not designed to compress clothing, which is one of the advantages of packing cubes.  They are so formless and flexible that anything you place inside just bulges out (so that the cube ends up looking rounded and ""stuffed"").  This isn't the idea behind compression packing!<br /><br />Overall, I can't see using these tiny bags (they definitely seem more like ""bags"" than ""cubes"").  There are much better options out there. [SEP] This review is for  BAGVIO Compression Packing Cubes for Travel - Premium Luggage Organizer Set (Set of 2). In theory these cubes seem like they would be great for travel. I can see myself using these when I can travel again. The construction of them is decent and the zippers seem pretty heavy duty and not cheap. I can see these lasting a while. What I will say is the description does not say what the sizes are except for one small and one large. The small one measures 11' x 6.5"" and the large one measures 14"" x 9"". Both have a 1"" depth that can be expanded to 4"". Overall I think both of these are small if you are going on a trip. If you have a short weekend away and only using a carry-on then these would be find for that (or even for use in a backpack). I wish the set came with 4 and had a better range of sizes. Most sets of packing cubes come with 4 or more which I think would be a better option. There is no price listed so I don't know how good of a value they are either. If you are a solo traveler with short trips, then these may be a good option for you. If you travel with others and go for longer trips than just just a weekend, then I think there are better sets out there. [SEP] When travel with two kids and wants to bring as less as stuff possible, these kinds of packing bag is my best friend. I love use these bags for kid's clothes and socks so kids can find their stuff easily. Otherwise they have to dig inside the big luggage. These bags have handles can be carried easily. The bag can be expanded which is a big plus. Usually I have to expand if we have to travel more than 3 days. It also works great if one adult have a business travel for underwear or socks. It makes the luggage more organize. [SEP] I travel twice yearly for work, so finding a way to maximize space in my luggage is key. I figured that this would be a nice way to store items in one place, particularly on the return trip when everything is just a teensy bit harder to fit into the suitcase.<br /><br />These are of a decent size and would be good for the smaller essentials such as socks and underwear or night clothes. I don't know that this does a huge-huge job of compressing size like I thought it would, but there may be a difference once I place them in my suitcase for travel (which is of the time of this review, not an option for me because of current events). At the very least this will help with organizing, which is always a plus. [SEP] These organizing bags come in a set of two. The smaller bag is 11x7x1 inches but expands to nearly 4 inches deep. This is an excellent size for a toiletry bag. It can be used to pack all your toiletry items in a small, separate bag within your larger suitcase.  There are no vents in this smaller bag but it does contain a small loop for hanging the bag.<br /><br />The larger bag I received is 14x9x1 inches but also expands to nearly 4 inches deep. On ones side of this bag is a 3 inch mesh that allows this bag to vent. This bag also contains a small loop to allow the bag to hang.  This could be a bag for shoes, linens or any other items that you may want to keep separate from the rest of the items in your suitcase.<br /><br />Esch bag has a sturdy handle on the long side of the bag where you open it. In the 1 depth size, each bag could easily be used to carry papers or small items separate from a suitcase. For example, the smaller bag described above would make a decent small satchel or purse for carrying travel documents.  Similarly, the larger bag described above would make a decent small case for carrying 8x11 papers or documents.<br /><br />Each bag has a zipper that goes all around the top such that the top opens completely for easy packing. Each bag has a second zipper that goes around the mid section of the bag that allows them to expand from 1 inch to nearly 4 inches. Each bag is made of a sturdy, opaque canvas like material. This material easily wipes clean and appears durable. [SEP] I travel a lot and love compression bags.  It's like putting 10 lbs of poop in a 5 lb bag :)  That being said, these bags  are extremely durable but I detracted one star because I like to at least get a peek of what is inside when I open my suitcase.  A bit of clear or screen  on top of these would put these at a 5 star quality.  The zipper is nice and sturdy which  is an issue with compression bags.  People (myself included) have a tendency  to over-stuff the bags and blow out the zippers.  If  you travel often and are always struggling to get the most space out of your bag, I highly recommend these!!",3,True

Unfortunately, I can't wear them.<br /><br />They have a prop 65 warning on them, which I assume is because of nickel content. I definitely had a reaction from wearing these for just a few minutes.

They are so flimsy and don't sit tightly on your face. They look nice though. Thats why I am giving it two stars. [SEP] I've never owned a pair of sunglasses with reddish orange lenses but they are surprisingly attractive to wear. They are lightweight and you can tell they are not expensive by the touch of them (the frame is thin, as is the tips of the stems) but from a distance people will think you spent quite a bit on your glasses. It comes with a faux leather case which is nice but has no cleansing cloth, which I was strange. But I was surprised how well these fit, and they keep out the glare of the sun really well. They are not mirrored (you can see your eyes from the outside) but they look cool. [SEP] These glasses due indeed cut the glare when you are out of doors. I'm not too happy that the brilliant oranges of the sunset are lost (making it a bit flat). But I think this is proof that these do cut out some of the harmful rays which is the point behind wearing them. They wear well and there isn't any of that crazy waviness that one gets from other sunglasses so bonus points.<br /><br />I received this product via Amazon's Vine Program with no expectations but that I provide my honest opinion. [SEP] Awesome aviator glasses.  These have a good color to them but does not effect the vision.  Clear vision out of the lenses.  significantly cuts out glare from the sun.  Flexible enough to be a good fit and not push too hard into the temples or above your ears.  Stays in place on the bridge of the nose well.  Feels like these are durable and should last a good long time.  Nice soft shell carry case too. [SEP] I really wish the aviator style glasses looked better on my small face. For these, while I like the orange color a lot and the style, they just don't fit my face right. However, that doesn't mean they're not great glasses! The polarized, mirrored lenses keep glare at bay on the brightest of days. They're not top of the line, but they're good to toss in your car or purse! They even come with a case so you don't accidentally scratch the mirrored frames. They're light and comfortable on my ears and have adjustable nose pads. Overall, I really wish this style fit my face better, because I'd love to rock these glasses more often. [SEP] For the price of these shades they are great! Very stylish and comfortable. The red/orange color dosnt sound like they would look nice but they do!  My wife Loves them and they pass the test with the card it came with for uv protection. The case they came in is nice and soft, I like it! [SEP] Love these! Not flimsy, like a lot of aviator glasses. Nice, right fit on my head. I love the red color. The lenses are not super dark but still block a good amount of sunshine. Comes with a nice little case! [SEP] The orange colored lens makes this glasses stand out from the ordinary sunglass crowd.  It has a nice wire frame and wears very light on the face.  It does not get too overwhelming like other heavy framed glasses that sit close to your face. [SEP] I don't normally look at sunglasses with an orange lens, but thought I'd try these, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. These glasses fit great on my small head.<br />2. They're very attractive.<br />3. The orange lens do as good a job as other colors in blocking out a great deal of sunlight.<br />4. These are so lightweight that I can hardly tell I have them on.<br /><br />I really can't think of any negatives for these sunglasses, and I highly recommend them. [SEP] These aviators are really nice for the price! They look more expensive than they actually are. They have a nice red/copper metal frame and the lenses are a reddish hue as well. They're very fashionable and look hood when I'm wearing them. I like the they are mirrored polarized lenses and protect my eyes from UV rays. Mine arrived with absolutely no scratches. The nose rests on these are also super comfortable silicone and are very soft.  They send them with a little card that has an image you can only see when wearing the glasses which is pretty cool. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of is the case. The material isn't very nice and the closure isn't the best.

WiliW Women's Footless Tights Black Control Top Opaque Pantyhose 2 Pairs Hold & Stretch XL,[],[],,3.7,41,6316,"These are a nice pair of footless tights that are a light-to-medium weight. They're soft and stretch well. I received the XL, and they're quite tight (I'm currently a 14/16 hip size). Well made and great materials -- 85% Polyamide 15% Elastane. And, these can be machine washed, cold -- I would use a mesh bag. I would also air dry these, although directions indicate you can tumble dry on low. [SEP] I received the XL size black tights for review.  I'm 5'9"", 141 lbs and these tights were hard to get on, and tight.  I doubt I will be wearing them unless I lose about 15 pounds.  The material is durable and very black.  I washed them in the regular laundry and didn't notice any shrinking or fading.  I suggest buying a size larger than what you normally wear. [SEP] I received a Size XL, and I thought it was very tight.  I am 5‚Äô 3‚Äù tall and 120 pounds.  According to the size chart, an XL would fit 45‚Äù-50‚Äù hips.  Looking at the tights, one would have to really stretch it.  Consider that the width at the hip is only 18 inches.  I have 35 inch hip, and I had to really squeeze myself into these.  The material does not stretch much; probably meant to be control top?<br /><br />Length is 34.5 inches, and they come down to my ankles.  I am only 5‚Äô 3‚Äù tall.  The material is 85% nylon 15% spandex and is actually quite warm.  The tummy area is too tight for me, so I‚Äôm giving it 3 stars. For comfort, I would size up. [SEP] These are cozy and perfect for winter. Easy to wear under a dress for work - and then I can wear socks in my boots and not have to worry about my toes poking through my tights! They are so warm and do not lose their shape and look nice enough to wear to work. [SEP] These Wili W footless 70 denier nylon/spandex tights (2 pairs) are opaque enough to cover my pasty white legs and flaws like broken veins. But these aren‚Äôt total blackout tights like the 100 denier tights I buy from Nordstrom, so some skin color does show through. I wear open toe shows and sandals most of the year, which I can‚Äôt wear with regular tights. So I really that I can wear these footless tights with dresses and still wear the shoes I like to wear most. These give me good coverage and some warmth, and these are fashionable while being much more comfortable and less formal than pantyhose.<br /><br />These tights are good quality. They feel smooth and the seams look and feel strong. I wore a pair one day and didn‚Äôt get any snags, so these should last for multiple uses (though I‚Äôm not sure how many yet). These tights seem true to size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù and these hit me just a little above the ankles and the top goes all the way up to my natural waist. I‚Äôd expect to wear a size XL, and the size XL is indeed a good fit. The waist felt a little tight as I was pulling these up over my currently chunky thighs, but once on these aren‚Äôt binding or uncomfortable and offer good control so they‚Äôre smooth and slimming under a dress. I really like these footless tights a lot. 5 stars. [SEP] This 2 pack of footless tights is a great value. They are well made, snug control, and long enough for tall women. These tights are not completely opaque, they are slightly sheer, but if you look at the images provided, they show this accurately. They have good stretch, and tummy control. The color is a true black with a nice sheen. They are smooth and comfortable to the skin. They have a simple cotton crotch. Under lights I can see some lines, and demarcations in the weave but they are not obvious. These are not leggings, they are light to medium weight tights. I am 5'8"" 135lbs, 35 hips, 28 waist and the XL size is comfortable  for me, but there is a lot of give and stretch and I believe that the sizing chart is accurate. Good value, I like them. [SEP] It's winter. In Wisconsin. I need to keep my legs warm when wearing dresses! Works great with boots. The only reason that I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because they are not 100% opaque. Not see through, but a bit light. [SEP] These tights are slightly thicker than stockings but made of the same material. They are snug fitting so it was a bit challenging getting them on but once I had them on it fit great. I'm 5'7"" and about 200lbs and the XL fit perfectly. They really do provide tummy control. As a postpartum mom with limited time to workout this feature is definitely appreciated. These tights aren't like your typical lazy wear around the house tights. These would work perfect for wearing under a dress to a club, church, work or anywhere that you need to look more dressy. [SEP] I would have loved these but they run very small so I can't give me much of a review because I couldn't get it past my thighs.  Overall I think they would have worked had I been able to get them up and actually wear them.  I was very disappointed that I couldn't wear them at all. [SEP] These tights are very stretchy and help keep your legs warm in cold weather. I like the fact that they are footless. I‚Äôve worn them under a dress for a Christmas party and they looked and felt very nice. It‚Äôs control top, but it isn‚Äôt the squishing all your organs type of control top. The control is subtle and comfortable. I really like wearing them under jeans as an additional layer in cold weather.",3,True

A good value pack compare to other named brands. [SEP] These are cute wool socks. They are warm but not overly thick which means I can still wear them with a variety of footwear. They fit in boots or sneakers. I am a women's size 8 and these fit my feet perfectly. What I really like is the length of them. They are somewhere in between ankle socks and crew socks which makes them great to wear with low cut boots. I actually like the way they look peeking out over the boot, almost looks like a boot liner. The height is perfect for me as I usually don't like crew socks because they have a tendency to fall down. The shorter style of these doesn't let them fall down and still keeps my feet warm in boots. [SEP] When the temperature drops, all I want in a pair of socks is to warm up my frozen feet while lounging in the house and these do a good job at that and are comfy too.  This set of five different colors kind of have a drab wintry color scheme and I wish went a little further up the ankle than they do, but they are still good to wear.  Though I do kind of scoff at the hand washing, I am not sure how often that will actually happen. [SEP] I like these socks - they are nice and soft and comfortable.  They are not super thick, so they are not super warm.  But they are better for warmth than the athletic socks I usually wear.  And they come in several nice, neutral colors [SEP] Great socks, soft, warm and comfortable. Bought for mother-in-law and she loves them. [SEP] I wear a size 9 womens shoe and these fit me comfortably.  They have a mild constriction that didn't leave marks when removing after a long day on my feet.  These are thicker then most socks so work really well in winter boots.  They did not cause my feet to over sweat and I had no shrinking after a normal wash/dry with no special care.  Colors are good and they are well stitched. [SEP] I love these socks so far. They are nice and warm and amazingly not too bulky. The top elastic helps hold the socks in place so they don't slide down. I do wish they were slightly taller but they will do. I use them in my boots and like doing my yoga in them! Great buy!

Great quality and very lightweight. Would make a nice gift with a great price. [SEP] I was so happy with this beautiful bracelet.  It's very generous in size and extremely light weight.  I didn't have to wrap it, I was able to slip it on over my hand without any problem.  I think this is a color that can go with any outfit.  I plan on wearing it a lot this summer!!  It was an amazing value as well!  You won't be disappointed with this purchase!  It's very well made! [SEP] This came all ready to put on, and in a nice gift box. My daughter is wearing it all the time with no issues. [SEP] I wear it around my neck sometimes, too. I also got a couple of other bracelets from these folks, and I like to wear all three together. The fastening is a little brass button, so you can adjust it a little bit that way, too. The colors are warm and pleasant. It goes nicely with earth colors or almost anything casual. All for fun and enjoyment. [SEP] Came in a super cute bag that you could use to give someone else a gift (happy accident). The anklet isn't an actual anklet it's a necklace. It's cute and it's loose enough to stay at the base of the ankle and not cut off circulation. I'm 5'4 and 180lbs so my ankles aren't the most slender. I really like the boho look of this anklet. [SEP] Beautiful boho jewelry with green and blue seed beads on a soft necklace. Can be a necklace or wrapped for a bracelet. Button closure. Very comfortable to wear and easy to wrap and secure. I have a 6‚Äù wrist and this wrapped around loosely about 5 times. Very pretty!! [SEP] This came all ready to put on, and in a nice gift box.

Yin & King Heart-Shaped Beaded Hanging Pendant (Gold) PE20002-02,[],[],,3.4,30,3594,"This is a cute piece of costume jewelry - it's gold color, but it's definitely not gold. Still, it's pretty with the faux pearl in a three dimensional heart-shaped cage, and another faux pearl dangling down from it. The necklace isn't too long, and there's a couple of settings so you can adjust it almost choker-like or have it a bit longer. It's on the delicate side (not too big) but the chain isn't so thin that you have to worry about it breaking easily. It comes in a nice box which makes it great for gift giving as well. [SEP] I am a big lady, but when putting this necklace on, I had to hook the lobster claw on the very last loop of the extra chain in order to wear it.  For a young girl, this necklace would be more appropriate.  It is pretty - just be aware of how short chain the chain is. [SEP] This necklace is just as pictured in the product description. It's a delicate chain with a delicate caged pearl pendant. I'm not a petite lady so this seems a little too precious for me. But at this price point it's worth a try for ladies who like smaller jewelry. A very nice gift for a teen. [SEP] This costume jewelry gold color necklace is really cute with a faux pearl (bead) in a heart-shaped cage and a small faux pearl (bead) hanging from a 2‚Äù chain that drops from the cage. This necklace is delicate and made of lightweight materials. This chain is only 15-1/2‚Äù long, though it can lengthen to 17-1/2‚Äù with the attached 2‚Äù extender. This necklace has nice details for a budget piece, such as a little heart at the end of the extender and a lobster claw clasp instead of a little ‚ÄúO‚Äù ring closure.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù and in my 50‚Äôs and would wear this even though the style is young, but it looks too petite and short on me. But I do think it‚Äôs a darling budget necklace (currently $16.99) for a preteen, teen or someone petite. On that basis, I‚Äôm rating it 4.5 stars. [SEP] This pretty necklace comes in a jewelry gift box. But you need to put it on it as it's just laying there with 2 plastic bags on it for shipping.  The chain isn't bulky, but felt light & soft on my skin.  The pearl in the heart shaped cage has a ""rod"" through it so that it stays stationary in the center of the cage.  I would have liked it just like that, but the dropped chain & pearl at the end gives it a nice little something extra to complete the look.  I really like it! [SEP] I don't normally buy costume jewelry, but I'm happy with this one. It's a cute piece. The picture does not lie. I don't plan to wear it often since my skin doesn't react well to anything that is not gold, but I like having pieces like this to wear with certain outfits.  My only complaint is that the chain is bulky and cheap looking. [SEP] Was packed very good and i had no issues with the item during my usage with it. Highly recommend it [SEP] It's kind of telling when the box something arrives in is better made than the product inside.<br /><br />This item was not packaged with any care whatsoever, and it took a long time to untangle the wadded mess it was in without breaking the thin chain.<br /><br />The design is cute and does grab attention. The chain just feels very fragile, and I have questions about its longterm durability. I think it's a fine gift for, say, a young teen who's starting to get into jewelry and accessories, but you'll definitely want to teach them how to store it to keep it from becoming the tangled mess it was when we received it. [SEP] If only it was a bit longer... I can wear standard necklaces, but this seemed a bit small for my neck. As a result, you may want to get an extender for it. I think I would have preferred the pendant was mid chest. This fits more like a choker. The pendant is cute and I like the Y-pendant look, but the chain needs to go... [SEP] I usually go for silver accessories over ""fake"" gold, but I actually think this is a cute little necklace. The chain is thin and not ""sturdy"". I also don't see the gold color holding up too long and will tarnish. It is cute and I'll probably wear it sometimes as long as it holds up. I think it'd be very cute for a young girl teenager. I have to say though that the price is a bit high for the quality.",3,True

They are a slim fit, but since there's an elastic give, they don't feel tight or uncomfortable. The waist and length sizing is true (34x34). The overall build quality is good. It does have a rather short rise, however, which means the jeans sit lower than I like on my hips. The zipper, while of good quality, is also rather short, which is annoying.<br /><br />Not perfect, but a decent (4-star) pair of jeans. If the rise were a little longer, as well as a longer zipper length, it would be a 5-star pair. [SEP] I love the quality of these jeans and the cut is fairly contemporary.  But the style reminds me of the old Gloria Vanderbilt style jeans.  Very dark denim with high contrast stitching.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is just a comment to give some idea of what these jeans are like.  Overall, I am impressed with the quality and fit.  These are good jeans for the money. [SEP] I like these a lot. Fit is spot on target - good length, good waist and no sagging in the backside. These look as good as they feel. Have a classic dark denim appearance but feel a lot more comfortable than those old fashioned Levi's. Good stuff! [SEP] My husband did not like these jeans fit him.<br />The sizing is off.  He typically wears a 32 or 33 with ease. The 34 is too tight and uncomfortable.<br />The back pocket stitching is well below the butt line and they ride low.<br />Sorry... Not the jeans for him. [SEP] I could only order by waist size with no choice in length.  I received a 34X34 pair of pants which for me was the right length but does not mean you will get the right length (unless they correct the ordering).<br />As for jeans these are very nice and fit well. [SEP] These are really attractive jeans. They're definitely one of my nicest-looking pairs. Such a deep, rich color. I prefer them over regular blue jeans.

The gray paisley has a little dot of blue in it so it's really nice and the pink has a small pattern that looks really good for summer. Just keep in mind these are a little on the shorter side. My husband is average 5'11 and if he tied them like other ties, it would hit shorter than normal but to remedy this, you can adjust how you tie these, though, to make them work. It's not a big deal for two nice ties. [SEP] Very nice gift set of neckties. I love the paisley pattern and expect my husband will get a lot of use out of that. The purple striped tie is just a tad more purple than he prefers, but I think I can convince him to wear that one too. They are pretty decent quality and hung nicely. [SEP] Perfect set for a gift.<br />The overall product is fine, good material, vibrant colors, the look as the appear in the online pictures. [SEP] These ties are very nice in person.

"Havana Breeze Men's Regular-fit Silk Cotton Polo Shirt, Mocha M","['Button closure', 'Machine Wash']",[],,3.5,9,230319,"Review of:  Havana Breeze Men's Regular-fit Silk Cotton Polo Shirt, Mocha M<br /><br />With a cut that is perfectly loose fitting and ‚Äòclassy‚Äô enough to be worn untucked, a fabric that is as smooth, comfortable and lightweight, this Havana Breeze Regular-fit Silk/Cotton Polo Shirt will quickly become, as it has for me, your ‚Äògo-to‚Äô Polo shirt for everyday wear.<br /><br />My first impression upon opening the package was how soft and ‚Äòsilk-like‚Äô the material was.  It simply has a nice ‚Äòfeel‚Äô to it ‚Ä¶ soft and comfortable.<br /><br />The second impression was how nice it looked.  The horizontal weaving of the fabric adds some great looking texture and interest to the shirt that may ‚Äòflat-looking‚Äô shirts don‚Äôt have.  The extra ‚Äòfancy‚Äô stitching found around the shirt‚Äôs collar and sleeves is a very nice touch that adds a bit of class, a bit of extra detail to the shirt.  The squared off bottom of the shirt makes this Polo shirt one that you can wear tucked in or untucked and look good either way.<br /><br />The third impression was after trying it on; the fit, I found, was just right.  For a Polo shirt, especially one that will be worn quite a bit in the warmer months, I prefer a looser fit.  A fit that isn‚Äôt constricting at all, a fit that doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòget in the way‚Äô when moving around.  That‚Äôs what the Havana Breeze shirt was designed to give and that is what it delivers.  If you are looking for a tighter fitting Polo shirt you would most likely want to order one size down.  I‚Äôve included a couple of pictures that show the shirt, a size Medium, up against a yard-stick to give you an idea of size.<br /><br />Finally, the Havana Breeze Polo shirt is machine washable.  Cold water and a delicate cycle got the job done for me.  It did need ironing, on a cotton setting, to take out the wrinkles to the point where it didn‚Äôt look slightly crumbled but that didn‚Äôt take a long time to do.  Still, I had hoped to be able to wash-and-wear without the extra effort; I may try hand washing next time.<br /><br />As of the time I write the review (late December 2019) I don‚Äôt see a price listed on the product page so I can‚Äôt comment on that but I can say that, if the price range is acceptable to you when it comes out, then you should most certainly keep this shirt on you wish list. [SEP] Good quality silk mixed with cotton polo shirt.  It looks dressy yet casual enough to wear with jeans or dress pants.  The fit is nice and feels smooth and soft on the body. [SEP] I love the color and fabric of this shirt. I was worried it would run a little small, but it fit great! I think this can be worn with jeans or dressed up for a more business casual look. I love that this comes in so many different colors from your basic colors to fun and vibrant colors.  My husband loves all of these and we have several different colors.  We have had no issues with washing them or them holding up.<br /><br />There is no price listed at this time on Amazon, but the tag on the shirt does say over $100.  I would not pay over $100 for a shirt, but otherwise these are perfect. [SEP] I give this shirt 4 stars because the Regular Fit still fits me quite loose.  But I also give this shirt my recommendation because even though its loose, it still manages to be comfortable and look okay on me.  FYI: The shirt is a LOT more mocha colored IRL, but it still looks fashionable. [SEP] I love the color and fabric of this shirt. I was worried it would run a little small, but it fit great!

[SEP] Watch clasp was broken, this watch was not even worth 14.99 [SEP] Bought this for the wife and she absolutely loved it. Its elegant enough to wear for special occasions. The color hasn't faded yet and we've had it for a good while now. Keeps the time very well. It's a nice buy. [SEP] Exactly what I was looking for; would have given 5 stars except need to have bracelet shortened as not good with tool included so will see a jewler because I am a very petite lady. [SEP] It's a pretty watch, but the links are not as easy to remove as made to believe. The device for removing links that came with it broke before I was done using it so I had to improvise to finish fixing the watch for my wife. [SEP] It's beautiful and runs accurately. But the clasp comes undone easily, and the watch falls off often. [SEP] Was given as a present to my Mom she was thrilled. [SEP] Very pretty and works well for us girls with larger wrists.  It came with a tool to take links out if you would need it smaller.  It is rather dressy and looks expensive but was not. [SEP] needed a sharp watch for work with a second hand, loved the fact that it came adjustable. For the price it's just right.the jury is still out as how durable it will be, but TIME will tell. LOL!

Ever few weeks I have to update the time because it will be between five and fifteen minutes behind.  This does not seem to be a gradual thing, it is just all of a sudden behind.  I would recommend you spend a little more money and choose something of better quality, at least if you plan on using it to tell time.<br /><br />This watch looks nice.  It is pretty large and comes with a tool to resize it.  I have been trying to make it a little smaller, but I have not been able to get the pins out with the tool provided, so I have been wearing it in the size received.  It is very large on me.  I thought since it came with a tool it would be easy to resize, which it has not been.  This is why I am giving it three stars.",3,True

I love them. Part of my love stems from them being a low ankle sock, followed by overall comfort, and of course the grip on the bottom. I love them for around the house, for keeping my large clunky slippers (ok, really my husbands) somewhat secure on my feet, and for keeping my closed/non hole crocks clogs in place (I'm not a fashionista, but I do have dogs, so crocks are my life!). If you have sneakers that kinda slip or slide, the grips on these will help stabilize your shoe. Perhaps less blisters from rubbing? Other details:<br /><br />--They wash and dry well. I have washed them in warm water and medium heat. No problems. They look perfect.<br /><br />--The grip is.. grippy, without being able to feel that material through the sock. It really makes them comfortable to wear as a daily sock.<br /><br />--I like the solid black color with colorful grips and a band of color at top. They are attractive to me, and definitely feel and wear like quality.<br /><br />--Lightweight with an arch support band.<br /><br />--No interior threads to get toenails caught on<br /><br />--Toe hem sits on top of toes, not at toe nail.<br /><br />--Slightly longer spot on rear of opening to help pull them on.<br /><br />--They have never slipped or twisted, no matter what I wear over them (or not wear over them).<br /><br /> I DO recommend them if you are considering this. I have them in my wish list for a future purchase. I love them!<br /><br />Btw, they are labeled as men's size 6-11, so that would fit women's size 8-13. I have size 10 in women (8 in men), and these fit so very well. Lots of strecth, so they will accommodate. [SEP] These are nice gripper socks and fit my female size 11 feet really well.  They are very soft and have some excellent grips on the bottoms and the colors are very attractive.  I washed them in the regular laundry load and they came out of the dryer like new and very soft.  These should last a long time. [SEP] Hospital slippers are sometimes described as some of the best slippers in the world since they tend to be warm, keep you from slipping, and are just plain comfortable.<br /><br />These are a little more form fitting than the ones I've seen in hospitals, but they're definitely comfortable. They are for men but fit me very well, plus I think that they would have wide appeal for anyone since they don't obviously scream hospital socks. They are fairly plain, as hospital socks tend to be very bright colors, which I see as something in its favor. As far as grip goes, they grip well. My floors are mostly carpeted but seemed to grip the carpet pretty well. They don't roll off the feet easily either, which is another plus. They're also thin enough that if I absolutely needed to, I could slip on a pair of shoes over them. It's not what they're for, but it's nice to know that I can do this.<br /><br />Honestly, I'd choose these over some of the other slippers out there if I were to need to purchase more. [SEP] Like most of the sticky socks, the rubber dots on the bottom of my feet hurt when I wear them on the hard wood floors, but these socks do stay on my feet during workout and my feet don't slip around much when I'm using them. They are VERY grippy, so I'd definitely recommend them if you need to use them for safety. They also wash well, just make sure you turn them inside out when you dry them. [SEP] So far these have been very good. I got these primarily for use when using the balance board for my Wii (yes, I still have and use one!). They've worked just fine for that purpose. Grip is good and no slipping. Although not really needed, they're nice for around the house wear. you get a lot more grip on tiled floors and even carpet. I've also gone out when wearing these, putting my shoes or sandals over them.<br /><br />The only thing i've encountered so far that keeps these from being 5-star socks is comfort. They're mostly comfortable, but i'd prefer if the soles were a little more cushioned. Sometimes when walking on a hard surface the rubberized tread pattern pokes into my feet a little.<br /><br />Long-term durability remains to be seen, but thus far they've held up well. [SEP] This 3-pack of non-slip exercise socks fits well, stretches nicely, and gives a good grip. ""One size fits all"" and while I'm on the lower-end of the size spectrum (men's 8.5 shoe), I have no doubt their stretch will indeed fit most.<br /><br />While these are a marked step up from the usual ""hospital socks"", taking away a star for cost and the inability to choose colors (dark green, blue, and white-grey are bundled together). [SEP] I ordered these for my husband to use when he gets home from the hospital (eep! Can‚Äôt wait!) to help prevent slipping on our tile floors.  They do look like they will fit perfectly, and the textured soles feel like they‚Äôll have adequate grip to help keep him safer, but I will update my review once he gets to wear them :) [SEP] I love these socks except that they are too tight at the ankle.  They are thin but cushiony.  They grip well but the grips are not so large that I cant wear my slippers with them. The seams are  tight and flat - no uncomfortable bulges here.  They are perfect for wearing around the house on a cold day.<br /><br />But they're too small at the ankles.  Waah!  :(  I only deducted 1 star for that because in fairness I do have cankles but I sized up so they should have fit. [SEP] So comfy and great grip. [SEP] I bought the Giotto no slip yoga socks for an alternative to slippers during the warmer months and they are great! Our wooden floors can get awful slick, so typically I wear slippers around the house, but when it‚Äôs hot out slippers get awful uncomfortable. These yoga socks grip the floor perfectly and keep my feet at a comfortable temperature. I do practice hot yoga and am excited to try these socks once the quarantine is lifted and classes resume.",3,True

You can easily put 6 or 7 bills in one pocket and 3 credit cards and an ID in the others and still have room for insurance cards. Most importantly you can then easily grip the card you want and get it out without pulling everything out. My very slim card holders are a bit flatter but make it all but impossible to pull a card out.

It will fit in a pocket of your pants or jacket just so you can keep track of it.<br /><br />The leather isn't thin but I'm sure with use it compresses some too. Not an expensive gift and children would love to give Dad this. [SEP] It's nice to have a single wallet like this for my young teenage boy, but it doesn't fit much even for someone without a part-time job!  It fits a few bills in the center, along with a card or two on the outsides.  It's definitely stiff right now, which I expect to a point with leather, but it's stiff enough that it's hard to get the money in the center.  Maybe with time it will break in. [SEP] For the price I purchased and it was really nice.The leather isn't soft so I dont think its full grain,but again for the price no complaints.Very snug at 1st but has comformed to my cards.I hold 6 inside,1 on outside back and cash in front pocket(5-6 bills) Has held up great so far [SEP] Nice leather - supple yet firm so stays in place and holds cards well. Thin design is flexible so if you sit on these the cards will bend. Easy grip dip and overall size will easily hold a half dozen cards while on the go. Nothing fancy but overall solid with nice leather. [SEP] Way too small for any real use.  This company is other products that are much better designed.  This barely holds 4 cards. [SEP] I gave this to my husband to use for his business cards. He has a need to carry them around with him and give them out throughout the day. He used to keep a metal case with him but it kept getting in the way and when his keys hit it, it would make lots of noise. This is softer and quieter. It also looks more sophisticated than the metal case. The leather has a nice look and feel to it. (it also smells really good if you like leather smell) He can fit a little over a dozen cards in here. It slides in and out of his pockets easily. The metal case use to catch on the corners sometimes. Not much else to tell you about it. We both really like it. One of his coworkers even asked him where he got it so he could get his own. [SEP] This little wallet is of leather. It is minimalist and has a center pocket for money and the two sides for cards. It may work best as a travel wallet for just the essentials.",3,True

WXXM Women's Comfort Non Skid Low Cut Grip Yoga Socks 3 Pairs Light Green,[],[],,4.0,10,11898,"This is a nice set of yoga socks.  They grip really well, almost too well.  They are well made, albeit a bit difficult to wear.  They do run small so keep that in mind.  The bottom grid of silicone gripping pads grip so well that it can be difficult to move your foot from one position to another.  There's no sliding from one leg position to another.  The color saturation is really nice and the overall vibe of the socks are pretty cool.  In the end, they don't fit my size 12 feet and the grip pads are a bit to hard to deal with in my book.  They are bad socks, by any means, they just didn't work out for me. [SEP] We have wooden stairs without a runner. Believe me, after they‚Äôre cleaned, those suckers are slippery. Yes, non-slip socks are easy to find, but these are different. They‚Äôre not the soft fluffy ones that twist around until the non-slip part is on top, and they‚Äôre not cotton that stretches and gets baggy. These are really meant for athletic (yoga) use on slippery surfaces. The dots are well placed - they fall squarely under the ball of your foot and cover the center of your heel. Just where your weight comes down to hold a pose. And the fabric used means the socks stay on your foot where they‚Äôre meant to be. I like them, I‚Äôll wear them, and I can recommend them. I even like the color.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I have done my best to give you a detailed and honest opinion. If you found my review helpful, please click the Helpful button below! [SEP] Excellent no slip socks! I love them, they only go up to my ankle and the grippers on the bottom are great! I have a really slippery entryway and with these I have slipped once. I really like the dark colors with just a splash of green. 5 stars! [SEP] Nice socks to wear around the house or for slippery floors.  They have wonderful rubber bubbles on the bottom of the socks to grip slippery surfaces so you don't slip and fall.  The socks also have a heel ""pocket"" (not sure what else to call it) that gives your heels a better fit in the sock.  The design on the socks help you with right and left sides if you match up the patterns as seen in photo one.  I am happy with these socks, anti slip and comfortable. [SEP] We have hardwood floors and tile throughout our entire house and I have feet that are always cold. Normally I‚Äôd just throw on socks and do my best not to slip and land on my face. Recently though I had a baby and didn‚Äôt feel comfortable taking that risk while holding him so I‚Äôve been getting a few pairs of socks with grips and these have been a great addition.<br />While I‚Äôm not too sure what to say about the design they picked for the top of the sock, maybe my mind is just forever childish. I can‚Äôt help but wonder why none of the design team thought ‚Äúmaybe we should consider other options‚Äù<br />Function wise they‚Äôre great though, they hug your foot exactly how you hope your new socks will. The sizing is perfect, they stay on my feet great and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with them sliding down. Most importantly, my feet have stayed warm but I haven‚Äôt come close to slipping even once since wearing them.<br /><br />I haven‚Äôt had them long enough to say how they‚Äôll hold up but I can update this in a few months. I hope this review was helpful! [SEP] Perfect for yoga, exercising, dancing or just hanging out. [SEP] These are awesome. They are great when walking around the house to prevent slips and falls. They are super comfortable and the bag goes up a bit over the back of your ankle. I find that a problem with ankle socks is that they do not cover the back and you gt blister.

UNDER ZERO UO Men's Navy Striped Stretchy Knitted Hat Cap,"['100% Acrylic', 'Hand Wash Only']",[],,4.2,18,82022,"This is a typical winter knitted (yarn) beanie cap.  Relatively lightweight.  100% acrylic. It has wide horizontal stripes of dark red and navy blue. It is soft (not scratchy or itchy) and it is not lined. It is stretchy to fit many size head sizes. Although a woman could wear it, I think it would appeal mostly to men and boys. [SEP] I really like this hat. In the pictures it looks like it might be black but it's navy. It's soft and thin which is good for fall and much of the winter here, especially if I'm doing something active. I have a big head, but it's really stretchy so it doesn't slowly slide upward until it pops off like some hats do, lol. I wish the crown were a little flatter. It comes to a slight point. But the point flattens if I pull the hat down. I really like it. [SEP] I really like this hat, it looks great and keeps my ears warm.  It's comfortable to boot.  The knitting is pretty tight, and the materials seem rugged enough to survive many New England winters.  If I didn't already have a bunch of my favorite beanies with Patriots logos on them, I'd wear this one daily. [SEP] Got this for my Dad to try. He LOVES IT! It's warm and covers his ears perfectly keeping his head and ears warm. The material is comfortable. It protects your head and ears from bone chilling wind. Great quality at a great price. Can't recommend enough! [SEP] Stretchy knit cap , warm and comfy.  This fits everyone in the family  too [SEP] Fashionable and stylish. Comfy too but I doubt this one will work well for the midwest winter. The base material is to thin.

Watches for Women Fashion Genuine Leather Band Waterproof Japanese Movement (White),[],[],,4.7,14,2394,"I liked all the crystals on this watch.

It is very comfortable to wear. It goes on and off easily.<br /><br />It worked without a problem. It kept good time.<br /><br />The quality is very good. This would make a very good gift for someone.<br /><br />The price is reasonable. I would recommend it. [SEP] (Reviewed by my wife): This is a really cute watch.  I have a lot of watches, but none with a white strap.  This one definitely stands out.  The white looks great with the gold color and the faux diamonds.  The strap is a belt-type strap so it is easy to adjust with no need to remove links.  It keeps time perfectly and is well made. [SEP] Great packing. Came with a box. Only reason for 1 less star is, came with a dead battery [SEP] This white watch is designed with class and simplicity. The watch dial doesn‚Äôt have numbers but gold lines to indicate where the numbers should be in the first place. I love watches but I would prefer numerical numbers to indicate the time. The watch band is stylish but white which could mean it gets dirty quickly than a black band. [SEP] My daughter has started a bit of a watch collection, and she loves this one! It is unique and honestly a great size and fit. The only negative that she has noticed is that the second band that holds the watch band in place is rather itchy against her skin. It is held together with a single stich that bothers her a little. Other than that, this is a great watch. [SEP] This watch caused a lot of discussion in our family. My wife loves it. She says it has its own sort of elegance and style. I had mixed feelings. I felt the white strap clashed with the gold of the watch. The watch without the band looks great; we all agree on that.<br /><br />Our (grown) daughter called the watch ""tacky"" but didn't have specific reasons other than she thought it looked on the cheap side. I mostly disagree and my wife completely disagrees.<br /><br />Certainly you can see at once it's not a high-end watch, and it doesn't come at a high-end price. I thought it looked a little cheaper and less well manufactured than some others in the price range. But we all think it's appropriate for casual use (not elegant evenings) and would be better if the strap were changed to something color compatible.<br /><br />As I like to say it, the watch is ""Target"" quality. It doesn't descent to the Walmart level but neither does it rise to the Neiman-Marcus range. Four stars.",3,True
PRAANJAL Indian Handmade Ring - Large Size | Celestial Cocktail Dual Tone Ring | Adjustable Ring with White Beads,['Gift ready item.'],[],,3.3,11,7052,"This has enough detail on the front that it looks really exciting from about 4 to 5 feet away, but once you get up close, the lack of quality is pretty apparent. I might wear this if I were dressing up in a costume of some manner, but I definitely don't think it's the sort of quality I would choose for a daily statement piece to wear to normal gatherings. I love that it is big and flashy and exciting, and I also love that it is an adjustable size.<br /><br />My husband immediately wanted to repurpose this as a super cool shield for an action figure, which will tell you about the level of quality to expect when ordering. It is flashy and exciting, but does not in any way seem like grown-up jewelry. [SEP] This is very pretty and well crafted but entirely too large to wear on your hands. Perhaps would be used best if it could be fashioned into a brooch? [SEP] Product description is accurate and photo is an accurate representation of this ring.  It is large and two-tone.  Looks a bit like antique sterling silver.  The white beads appears to be glued in, but done so attractively.  I estimate the ring size to be about a 9, but it is adjustable with a slit-opening in the ring.  I personally think this makes a better scarf ring than a cocktail ring, so I took a photo for you to see it as a scarf ring. [SEP] If you like your rings large-and-in-charge, this handcrafted Indian ring from Praanjal was made for you!  If you are petite like my lady, you may have to become creative to wear this piece.<br /><br />The ring featured an inner portion that looked like a flower or sunburst pattern, while the outer portion of the ring featured simulated pearls and gold beads.  The ring came packaged in a small plastic bag and an unadorned outer cardboard box (see photo).  The portion that affixed the ring to the finger was a (really cheap-appearing) adjustable metal loop.<br /><br />The diameter of the ring fell just under the circumference of a Kennedy half-dollar coin.  Thus, you needed sizable hands and a love of the unique to wear the ring comfortably.  My lady decided to repurpose the ring since it was far too large for her hand.  She snipped off the adjustable ring portion, and affixed a pin to the back of the disk portion.  Thus, she now had a small, but eyecatching, broach/pin.<br /><br />As a pin, this design worked much better than it did as a ring. Since a hobbyist could make this ring into something new, I give it a tentative recommendation. [SEP] What an awesome statement ring! This totally complements my boho look... I am a huge fan on Indian culture and love all of their patterns, textiles, arts, and colors... I instantly fell in love with this when I opened the package. [SEP] I have huge hands. Like ring size 9+ hands.<br />And this fit me right out of the (plain cardboard) box.<br />It is adjustable, but to make it smaller, you have to squeeze & overlap the 2 sides of the metal band. The band appears to be glued on to the disk, so a lot of squeezing could pop it right off.<br />Assuming you can adjust to your right size, the decorated disk is really big - as in hits my knuckle big!<br />No idea how smaller fingers would wear this.<br /><br />Since it‚Äôs obviously a costume statement piece, I guess wearing it for a special occasion or with a special outfit might be doable, but I‚Äôve worn it only long enough to type this review & it is annoying me. A lot.<br />A couple of stars for the pretty design is all I can do.<br /><br />(Thanks for reading this & hope it‚Äôs Helpful!)",3,True

I think they are better suited for colder temperature.<br />These socks are very comfortable and the toe and heal areas are well padded. All in all, a good quality socks for hiking. [SEP] Warm, soft, comfortable. Fit well, no slipping. Great for hikes, outdoors, etc. Good quality & well made. Really happy with these! [SEP] Great fitting sock as far as matching my size.  They have a comfortable tightness - pseudo compression if you will, though not excessive.  Also good breathe-ability in that you don't feel like your feet are trapped in a furnace. [SEP] I wore these on a 5 mile hike and they felt very comfortable! The compression in them was good enough to keep my feet from swelling and the seat wicking capabilities are satisfying. It's a little thick from the heel to the toe which adds extra cushioning, but I didn't find my feet overheating on my hike.<br /><br />My foot size is an 11, so according to the seller's advertising I should fit an X-Large, but I went with the medium and it fit snugly, thus I suggest buying one size down.<br /><br />Overall, this is a quality hiking sock that I recommend purchasing :) [SEP] These socks are thick and provide cushioning in all the right places. They are specifically designated and labeled with L (left sock) and R (right sock). I wear these for hiking and camping. They keep my feet comfortable, protected, and supported. [SEP] These are great socks, they fit perfectly and definitely do the job of keeping your feet dry by pulling the moisture away from them. I've never seen socks marked L and R! They are cushioned and quite thick so they are comfortable on your feet and actually feel  cushy while you're wearing them. I don't actually hike but I walk alot and they are perfect in my sneakers. [SEP] Extremely comfortable to wear for hiking or any day, especially if you have to wear all day long. Soft and comfortable to wear. It is able to handle a lot of foot traffic with both shoes on and off. [SEP] I wear an 8 1/2W shoe, and when these arrived I was hoping they would stretch enough to comfortably fit.  Sadly they did not AT ALL and wear tight on my lower calves.  And the inside of the socks don't seem ""finished""--there are a lot of loose threads.  I gave them away.

Wild Hazel Women's Viscose Colorful Embroidery Lace Work Tassel Cover-ups Swimwear Caftan (Free Size) White,['Pull On closure'],[],,4.2,18,4637,"This yells ""Ole"" at you. And to be honest, I love the design. I like the embroidery and the tassels. They are nice and colorful against a white background. When you launder this, it is with cold water and it may even bleed the colors from the bright colors, I don't know yet. But, it is perfect for a day on the beach with a nice straw hat. [SEP] I was Super Hesitant about this top since it was ""One Size""  but I absolutely LOVE this Wild Hazel Women's Viscose Embroidered boho top.<br />First I wanna Say The Gorgeous caftan sleeves look ""open"" but they're not. The sleeves are sewn (4th photo) inside and even though they look open on the sides, they're aren't.<br />  The colorful embroidery is really pretty and eye catching.<br /> The top is alittle sheer and see thru but perfect over a bathing suit or Cami.<br />The Measurements: 30"" Across the front, yes 30""! And About 31"" Shoulder To Hem.<br />  So depending on how tall you are it could look like a top, a tunic or a dress... :)<br /> I honestly never dreamed this would fit. I'm 5'10 180 pounds on a good day..lol and 38DDD and it looks GREAT. [SEP] This is a really, colorful top that hides my extreme apple sauce  shaped body, ie my waist is the largest part of my body. Seriously. The embroidery is really nice, and I love the addition of little bright colored tassels on the top sleeve and shoulder area. Now you should‚Äôve aware that this is a loose fitting, garment. It is shaped a lot like a poncho, but with seams holding the two sides together. I wear it out running errands and anything else that doesn‚Äôt involve eating. I am a slob, eating with white shirt = stained and ruined in five minutes. Given the style this would be a great swimsuit coverup with a pair of capris, to look dressed. I personally wear a tight fitting spandex layering tank under it (white) as it is very thin and it IS white. [SEP] First of all, this is plenty big and will fit people of most sizes as a coverup. An extremely large person will not fit this.<br /><br />The photo in the description does not fully show just how bright this is. If you like bright things you will love this. It is definitely eye catching. At a minimum you can use it at home if you have a pool.<br /><br />The quality is good and it should serve its purpose as a pool cover up. Just keep in mind that it is bright and highly decorated with tassels, etc. If this isn't your thing maybe look for another product. [SEP] It is beautiful and I get a lot of compliments on it. I know that it is a bathing suit cover-up but I wear it as a tunic over leggings. You may want to put a camisole under it. I also bought one in blue, pink and black [SEP] When I first ordered this swimsuit cover from Wild Hazel, I thought it would be free flowing underneath with nothing restricting in the way.  However when I recieved it and put it on, I noticed that there's an extra stitching going downwards from armpit to hip. This makes me believe that if a larger woman were to put this on it would not fit at all.  This is a bit misleading as the photo and description don't mention nor make it clear about the extra stitching underneath. While it fits, it's not comfortable due to this restrictive stitching. Material appears adequate nothing high quality nor too flimsy,  just adequate.  Style is based on personal taste, it has bright tassels on an all white ensemble.  My aunt enjoys loud clothing so I thought this style would suit her but instead my mom ended up liking it more.  She is always on the beach anyways as a Florida resident so she got more use out of it.  She doesn't mind the restrictive stitching as she enjoys a tighter fit. I guess everyone is truly different in terms of likes and dislikes.  I like more free-flowing items where as my mom doesn't.  So my mom gives it 5 stars, I give it 4. We settled on 4 1/2 stars. [SEP] Generously sized coverup for anytime. Cute designs, light, breezy material, feels nice on the skin.  It was a bit wrinkled on arrival so I tossed in in the dryer on the ""Steam Fresh"" setting with dryer heat set to ""Low"" and it came out wrinkle free!<br />I wore it as a coverup over a tank top with knee-length shorts to a community event and received many compliments and questions about where I got it.<br />It is very attractive and quite versatile.

"Ace Men's Running Socks, Large/X-Large","['Nylon', 'Machine Wash']",[],,3.2,25,34,"Great running socks for those who need extra support and wear long running pants. Typically my husband likes to run in shorts so these are not good for him as everyday. They are also heavy and would be difficult to wear in the summer weather months down here in Florida. However, I would highly recommend these for cooler climates where running in jogging pants is the norm. Great support and durability. My husband loved the way his legs felt after running 6 miles in them. In his words, his legs felt energized and massaged after his work out. Rated them as 4 stars instead of 5 as they will have limited use down here in the hotter weather and due to the price of $20+. [SEP] My dad tried these socks on and compared it to other running and compression socks he had. These appear to be higher and cover the knee slightly on his 5'7 frame. They have a nice soft feel and the top cuff is smooth and not too tight on top. [SEP] The support and springiness in these socks is as advertised. They are, after all, from the ACE bandage and brace people. Compared to basic socks, they can make running or brisk walking more fun for longer. So chalk up a win on the main purpose. They are useful for any activity, not just running.<br /><br />You do need to know that the sizing is peculiar, with a break at shoe size 10 between the S/M and L/XL socks (i.e., choose big socks or little socks). Since these are tight-feeling support socks, you won't be able to wear the ones that are too small, and I imagine that any looseness in the foot is going to be massively annoying.<br /><br />You might also want to consider whether you want an over-the-calf sock in warmer weather; if you want a similar sock in a shorter length, you'll have to look for another brand.<br /><br />Still, there are a lot of reasons (shin splints!) that athletes and others might want the comfort and support of the compression socks.<br /><br />The price is on the high side, but considering that these socks feel like they'll last forever, I would grin and bear that. [SEP] These are impressive socks.  They are soft, but quite thick, with padded toes and heels which make them incredibly comfortable.  The over-the-calf design provides ‚Äúgraduated compression‚Äù in the leg, which improves circulation during running.  That means the socks are quite tight on the leg (the product description uses the word ‚Äúsnug;‚Äù I think ‚Äútight‚Äù is more accurate) ‚Äì these are not the easiest socks to put on!  But once in place, they are comfortable and supportive.<br /><br />The L/XL size fits those wearing men‚Äôs shoe sizes 10 ¬Ω-12.  My husband wears a size 12, so he‚Äôs at the top end of the range.  While they did fit him (the foot, at least, fit him well), he struggled to get them on over his thick calves.  He did like the way they felt once they were on, but he doubted he‚Äôd wear them on a regular basis.  I tried them on myself (I wear a women‚Äôs 8 ¬Ω, so the foot was a bit big on me), and I liked the way the leg felt, but even I had a bit of trouble pulling them up over my calves.<br /><br />Overall, these socks look good and feel good.  If you‚Äôre looking for a classy running sock that will provide superior leg compression, these are perfect.  Just be aware that they are very long, very thick, and not easy to put on. [SEP] I'm a woman - a tall one, with the shoe size to match - but I wanted to give these a try because I've started doing quite a bit of running and jogging, and had been noticing quite a bit of leg fatigue, and I've experienced some issues with shin splints, as well.<br /><br />As others have noted, these aren't the easiest socks to put on, which has been the case with every other pair of compression socks or stockings I've ever worn.  Unlike those reviewers, I found the most difficult part of the process was putting the socks on my feet and then pulling them past my heels - that takes some time, especially since they tend to bunch up a bit on the foot so you have to work to get that excess material pulled down the foot, over the heel, and smoothed out.  Where others have noted having difficulty pulling these up over calves, I found that to be relatively easy which surprised me, as my calves are not small.<br /><br />Once they are on - and it's important that they're pulled all the way up so that the band doesn't double back on itself, because if that happens, it pinches the leg and feels less than pleasant - they are comfortable; you can a little bit of compression but once you get used to that sensation, it's easy to forget they're on.<br /><br />In terms of effectiveness, I've been on my feet a lot while wearing them, doing everything from day-to-day activities, to chasing after a new puppy, to the aforementioned running and jogging, and I can say that these have helped cut down on some (but not all) of the leg fatigue I'd generally feel after doing such things, and the shin splints haven't really been an issue.<br /><br />These are decent compression socks that may help runners, but only to an extent: they won't completely stave off all muscle fatigue.  If the cost weren't so unreasonable, I'd feel more comfortable recommending these. As the situation stands, though, these socks just aren't worth such a ridiculously high price. [SEP] These ace Men's running rocks are really comfy once you're wearing them. They were great when I went out for a jog this morning<br /><br />However, they're really tight on the leg.. Which isn't uncomfortable when you're wearing it but that does make it difficult to put the sock on in the first place. I hit my foot against a table trying to get my foot inside the sock, twice. Maybe they'll loosen up over time, but for now, that's a major downfall. [SEP] This is a very well-made, beefy (I've wanted to plagiarize Lands End catalogue copy for a while now) sock that has a sporty design and very good padding.  It's not just for runners: Any kind of exercise (or just lounging in a cold/cool room around would be appropriate).  Just a few words of caution, however:  Because they're thick and padded, they can get very warm, perhaps too warm if you wear them for non-sport use.  For sports, they seem fine, as long as (for my comfort zone, anyway) it's not too hot out.  Second caution:  These are like &#34;compression sock,&#34; and, as such, can feel tight, especially as you go up the leg, as compression socks do.  Because they're thick and padded, I find them more comfortable than compression socks made for, say, medical purposes (e.g., if you've had deep vein thrombosis).  If you're not used to this type of sock; however, you might want to try these on in person.<br /><br />They're not itchy, did not seem to shrink or fade immediately upon washing, and I expect them to last quite a while.  They're fairly pricey, and I suspect the compression design may have something to do with that.  As stated above, you may wish to try these on before purchasing, and, as always, consult your coach or health care provider to best determine if these would be appropriate for you. [SEP] I play a lot of softball and prefer to use over-the-calf socks during my games in comparison to wearing long baseball pants, so I was very excited to give this pair of socks a try and compare it to the other brands I've used like Under Armour and Adidas. I wear a size 13 shoe, so I found myself to be on the very cusp of having the Large/X-Large size fit me. Luckily my feet aren't very wide or I think I may have had issues. As other reviewers have commented, the compression aspect of these socks does in fact make them feel tighter than a standard pair of socks. If you have ankle issues, these will be helpful in keeping your ankle in place during running and exercising. Also, the padded cushion on the bottom of the sock is a nice touch that really does make these feel very comfortable.<br /><br />My biggest problem with these socks is the price. Name brands like Under Armour and Adidias charge much less for their over the calf socks, and while these might be more comfortable, I'm not sure that difference accounts for these costing more than double than well known brands. For that reason, I have to dock this item one star. If the price adjusts down to a more competitive level, I will be more than happy to update my rating. [SEP] The hubby was impressed when he initially tried them on, the fit was prefect. However, after the wash they never fit properly in the foot area - saggy. The hubby wears them mostly for the stabilization of the calf muscle, he said that he prefers his calf compression sleeves. [SEP] These are fantastic socks and would have gotten five stars if they weren't so dang long and if they weren't so expensive (more than three-times his other similar socks from New Balance). My husband is 6 foot 1 and the sock goes over his knee. Anyhow, even with that he loves them. He found them a struggle to put on, but well worth the comfort on his daily walk.<br /><br />Anyhow, there's enough elastic material in these socks to keep them tight, although that does mean they feel a bit polyester, unlike softer cotton athletic socks.<br /><br />These are expensive, but I think he will buy another pair if they last more than three months.",3,True

First, the Large size shorts are much smaller than other Large shorts and didn't fit as expected. They do technically fit, but the waist is tight, and the length is shorter than typical men's shorts. My husband says he feels like he's wearing ""short shorts"" and would be a bit embarrassed to wear these to the gym or to run outside. I can see what he means, because the dimensions do make them look a little weird. The material is comfortable, and these would be a breathy pair of shorts to exercise in if not for the uncomfortable tightness. Made of 93% polyester and 7% spandex, they feel almost like a pair of swim trunks. They do seem like they would keep you dry while working out. All in all, though, I don't think he'll be wearing these much. [SEP] The material on these is a light weight athletic, feels similar to girls running shorts.  I am 5'9"" 180lbs (female) and these fit me comfortably in the waist.  My guy, he doesn't care for the cut or feel of them.  For me they are a bit long but for around the house, working in the yard etc not bad.  I would suggest buying at least a size up for guys.  I washed / dried with other athletic gear and had no shrinking or discoloration. [SEP] These athletic shorts dry quickly and allow for easy and free movement. My husband uses these when he works out.

The first thing I noticed was that the color of them is a little more on the bluish-purple side compared to the royal blue in the pictures.  The color is nice and vibrant, but not exactly what I expected.  The material is lightweight and comfortable and has a good stretch to it.  Unfortunately the fit leaves something to be desired.  They are not as short as traditional dedicated running shorts, but are shorter than typical basketball shorts.  The fit is quite tight around the upper thighs and crotch areas, which even though they're stretchy isn't a great feel during active wear.  I'd only recommend these for skinny guys.  The fact that they only have one small pocket on the rear makes them most suitable for running, but they're longer and tighter than I'd want for that.  In the end, I'm not really sure what they're going for but I'm not loving them.",3,True

It's too shallow for me so it doesn't go down far enough on my head, and it's only just big enough around to fit. That's my problem, not the manufacturer's fault, but maybe that information is useful to someone. My head is about 23.5"" around, if that helps. In my experience with dark cotton ""military"" caps, they show white sweat stains if you do outdoorsy stuff in them, then they shrink if you even spray them with water. So if you plan to sweat it in then you probably want to get a bigger size if you can.<br /><br />The cap looks really sharp. The brim is short which I love. The fabric is a brushed fancy weave that's super soft but was already covered in lint by the time I received it. I've had a hat like that before and it was just always covered in lint. Not a problem in a heather gray, but it looks bad on black cotton. You have to brush it a lot. But it does look really nice. It's a heavy cotton (and it's black, obviously) so it probably isn't best for really hot weather.<br /><br />I wish it fit better because I really like it, even if I have to lint roll it. [SEP] The Jeff & Aimy black military style baseball cap reminds me of the cap popularized by Chairman Mao decades ago. This one is a basic cap with no eyelets and more suitable for the spherical head. That is not the shape of my head and so it will be gifted to a lucky college kid. It is youthful. [SEP] I always wear a hat outside for sun protection, and this ""military"" style is my favorite type for a billed cap.  The Jeff & Aimy cap is well made - all seams are finished with no loose threads.  The outer fabric, is slightly brushed for a soft feel, while the inside checked lining is smooth gingham.  The size I received for review, 58 cm, is a medium and is not adjustable.  The tag attached to the hat says, MSRP $15, not a bad price for quality cap. [SEP] I've been trying to find a hat that looks decent on me for awhile. I'm 61 & just about totally bald on top. There are 2 issues I wanted to address:<br />1. Sunburn in the summer<br />2. Appearance; my forehead really looks better covered up (I used to use bangs, but now I have no hair!)<br /><br />I've tried & reviewed 4 hats & several beanies through Vine. My #1 favorite is the ""Cotton Flat Cap Ivy Gatsby Newsboy"" from this same manufacturer & also available on Amazon. While this one is #2 out of the bunch, it's a pretty distant #2.<br /><br />The appearance is a bit too ""good old boy""/""Nascar"", etc for my liking, & while I've never measured my head, the hat is too small on me (the other hat from the same manufacturer fits fine). The listing I selected this hat from to review stated ""M/L"".  From the product page, I think the buyer is supposed to be given a choice. I don't know what size I received. I would GUESS medium.<br /><br />If you like this look & have a small head, it's ok, but just ok imo. [SEP] I didn't end up being a fan simply due to the odd fit of this hat; the quality is fine, there were not complaints, it was well made, stitching was solid as was the overall quality of the fabric itself. The size was standard - just the fit looks terrible. Neutral rating because the style wasn't good but the cap is fine. [SEP] First, size-wise, this military-style cap fit a twenty-something young woman, so it might be too small on a man. But this is a very cute, soft black hat lined with a checkered cotton cloth. It‚Äôs dressy enough to wear to work, due the military style, but would also go with casual outfits. Very pleased with the feel and quality of this hat.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

Awesome! [SEP] This shallow and flat cadet cap is made of one hundred percent cotton and is hand washable in cool water.  It will fit a 22-23-inch head circumference and cannot be adjusted.  This no-frills black hat has a short brim, so it will not provide much protection from the sun. The inside is lined for greater comfort.  This item will likely appeal to adolescent boys or men who like military-style apparel.",3,True

In addition to keeping time it has a calendar. Solar powered it tells time accurately and precisely. The face is large and there are dots where numerals usually are. Still easy to read. I was not impressed with the packaging which consisted of a bright blue branded box and a cheap plastic holder.  The watch is well made and worthy of better. If you like big and bold you will appreciate this timepiece. [SEP] My grandfather loved Casio watches and I got this for my uncle, who misses him dearly. This watch is truly handsome, with a big bold face and clear numbers/dials and the resin band is attractive and easy to keep clean. This is a great watch for every day wear and is a lovely and affordable gift. [SEP] I just got it! My old solar is 12 years old and still working. This a very serious, beautiful, sober diver‚Äôs watch. I own plenty of watches this is a very nice piece. The only problem is trying to see the time at night! I charged full day on the sun! Nothing at night! [SEP] My issue with this watch, and it's a big one, is it's claim of Water Resistance.  Mine apparently had moisture enter the inner mechanism, and no longer works.  I opened the crown to allow the moisture to evaporate.  Which worked for a number of days, but watch has stopped again.<br /><br />The moisture apparently entered while watch was left on bathroom sink counter, surrounded by very little water after washing watch.  Certainly w/in the water-resistant IP-68 rating criteria.  Unfortunately, though I have the watch paperwork/manual, I cannot find my receipt.  And JC Penny, where I bought the watch, has gone out of business.<br /><br />Though others have had better luck, if you care about any kind of water 'resistance', you look for a watch that has a 'screw-down' crown.  This watch does not, and that is the weak link, I believe.<br /><br />A shame, as I like the watch.  But without a replacement under Warranty I would not buy it again.  Instead, I will look for the important screw-down crown ensuring better water resistance.<br /><br />Love the light-rechargeable battery feature.  And, excepting lack of night illumination, everything else about the watch.  Easy enough for me to read at a glance, though I understand others might not agree.<br /><br />*Update:  It finally dawned on me that I could unscrew the watch crown pin and let the interior of the watch 'ventilate' and moisture escape.  A few days was not enough, so I gave it a solid MONTH to dry-out and that did the trick.<br /><br />Watch has been keeping perfect time and functioning beautifully since.  Good to know that, even after a week or so of giving the watch up for dead, ventilating it adequately restored it to perfect operating condition.  Consequently, I'm upgrading my rating to 4 stars --- Very Good. [SEP] Pro:  I've had it for 2 weeks and it keeps time perfectly. (But, then, so does my phone).  It is comfortable on my wrist. It is stylish.<br /><br />Con: I'm old (70+). I learned to read time on an analog clock (that's all there was) and I've never gotten the hang of digital numbers. I can look at a digital clock and read the time easily, but I don't remember it for long. When I look at my old wristwatch I see the numbers and the position of the hands and I retain that memory for quite a bit longer. Not so on this one, probably because the designers chose to use dashes rather than numbers.<br /><br />I got this watch because I wanted to be able to see the time at night without turning on the light (my old watch does not have any sort of fluorescent markings). This one does and they're bright. Maybe even too bright.<br /><br />I think I'm the wrong demographic for this watch. I think that young, active, people who've grown up in the digital world will love it (thus 4 stars, not five) but people like me who have a very different background won't (thus 4 stars, not three). [SEP] This Casio MTP-S110 solar watch is a great looking watch. It features both day and date which is great. Most solar watches in this style such as Seiko only feature the date and cost double the price. The time is easy to read. In addition to the 12 hour markers it also has the 24 hours marked as well. The glowing markers and hands are easily visible at night. The bezel is fixed and does nothing rotate. This was actually better for me so I don‚Äôt have to keep adjusting the bezel. I‚Äôve had some Seiko watches where I had to constantly adjust the bezel because it would turn when I brushed up against it. The back is marked cased in China. The band is not oem Casino. The buckle is stamped made in China. There is definitely a difference in look and feel compared to OEM bands. This band feels more flimsy with a matte texture. I plan to buy an OEM one to replace it. The two step knob feels smooth while adjusting the day, date, and time. I plan to use it for travel as it has all the features that are important to me. The best part about it is the price. For under $100 I don‚Äôt have to worry about it when I travel. Based on the features and price I highly recommend this watch. [SEP] I found this to be a simple men's watch, my kind of simple styling, and not packed with useless features.<br /><br />The band is a simple matte black resin/plastic.  Its comfortable on the skin, and works very well in the wet environment, as it does not soak up water at all.<br /><br />The bezel ring is fixed.<br /><br />The face is simple and easy to quickly read.  The face glows relatively well in the dark; there is no light.  Inset in the face are 24-hour indicators, which is handy.  The hands are big and easy to pick out, helping to quickly show the time.  The day/date feauture is big and clear.<br /><br />I found the single crown good, as I don't like a lot of external buttons.  This is also good for a watch advertising itself as highly water-resistant--if there are lots of crowns and buttons, that's just more opportunities for water to get into the case.  The instructions are clear and simple regarding all adjustments to the watch, using the single crown.<br /><br />The watch touts itself as water-resistant to 100m--that's a good 330 feet, more than we're going to run into at the community pool, in the shower, or taking a rafting trip.  I did some modest testing of the watch in various wet environments and have detected no leakage at all.  The user manual chart indicates that this 10-bar watch is good for hand-washing, rain, ""water-related work"" (whatever that is), swimming, windsurfing, and skin diving.<br /><br />The watch has a battery, but its primary source of power is solar, so it needs to be worn, or stored face-up in a place that is regularly getting light.  I did not run into any power problems with this watch.  There is a nice little indicator with the second hand jumping erratically that indicates a need to charge the watch.<br /><br />Paperwork: you get a lot of paper with this product, a user manual in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Russian, as well as a warranty card and a card a card dedicated to the solar charging.  It's all packed together very tightly, lots of info in a small space.  The English is perfect, and the graphics are clear and easily understood.  There is ample information on how to contact Casio with questions or problems.<br /><br />Price: At about $100, this seems a fair price for this item, given its features.<br /><br />Bottom Line: this is a simple, classic, and classy man's watch, a bit forward-looking in its ability to charge with light, and pretty water-resistant, to help you along with that climate change and attendant flooding.  Nice item, recommend. [SEP] A beauty and a beast. Clear view of day and date. You cant get a more trustworthy watch for this price. [SEP] Glow in the dark option for the hands do not work. [SEP] Attractive, frugal, & solar. All bonuses in my opinion. The bezel not rotating, & it's 100m water resistance make this a four star watch. I think Casio should have taken this module & made a good field watch out of it.  A solar 'Duro' 200m watch should be made to replace this model that would give Citizen some competition. I bought mine used & so far it looks & works perfectly.",3,True

The dress looks more like a night gown for an older women, not something a younger women would wear. [SEP] ugly does not look anything like the pic [SEP] I ordered 2 of these, one in XL and one in 2X. I am 5'4&#34; and 163 lbs. I usually wear a large in tops. My first impression was disappointment, as the dresses I received (except for the stripes) look nothing like the one the model is wearing in the photograph here on Amazon. They are cut strangely and rather than slits on the sides, they have these huge, almost silly-looking U-shape cutouts. They have ordinary boat necklines, and if your shoulders aren't too broad, you'll be able to pull it down off a shoulder, but unless you're truly tiny, it will not hang way off the shoulder like it does on the model. The XL fit me well and looked slenderizing on me. The 2X did have a little extra fabric, and was baggier and less slenderizing on me than the XL. I gave it to a relative who is about 40 lbs heavier than me, and she fit it, although it doesn't really hang off her shoulder. I noticed that both the XL and the 2X have exactly the same size neck opening. I also noticed some sloppy stitching and broken threads. Only because of the very reasonable price, did I decide to keep it and wear it around the house. I may even get a couple more, (at this low price), because they do make nice house dresses and the fabric feels soft and comfortable. [SEP] Cheap looking [SEP] Too Cute and Comfortable",3,True

"Genuine Assembly Men's Denim Jeans, Slim Fit, Work wear, Every Day Staple Collection for Work 34 Light Blue",[],[],,3.8,12,9417,"This is a so-so pair of jeans. The high point is the amount of stretch. They easily give, especially at the waist, which allows them to fit without feeling binding. The material is soft and the washed look is nice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some notable negatives as well. The zipper is shorter than normal, making it a bit challenging to use.  The material is quite thin and, while soft, also feels somewhat cheap. The pocket linings are shorter than customary. It's cut long in the inseam area and a bit baggy in the seat area which makes this look rather ill-fitting even though the waist size (I have it in 34) is true. While no length is specified in the listing, the pair I have are waist 34 and inseam 30.<br /><br />It's not a bad pair of jeans, but certainly not an outstanding pair either. It's a solid 3 stars (average). Not a compelling purchase, but worth considering if the price is good. [SEP] These are good jeans made of light weight denim.  They're good for wearing in the warmer months of the year.  The sewing is very good and they went through the regular laundry cycle just fine.  I didn't notice any fading or shrinking when I took them out of the dryer.  The pocket on the right front did seem to feel thicker  - like the inside pocket was bunched up but it wasn't.  I'm not really sure what was causing that.  Other than that, I think these are very good jeans. [SEP] Unfortunately these didn't feel right for my husband, the legs fit a bit too slim for him. The sizing of the pants is good, but he found that they were too close for his legs to feel okay. [SEP] I found these jeans look and feel good when I put them on. They do have a stretch to them, maybe more than I am used to. The length comes down to below my ankles and I am ok with that. The color is a light blue, somewhat faded look. In general I like them and will continue to wear them. [SEP] Can't brag enough about these. Never heard of the brand before but tried one or two pair then came back for a dozen more including these. I've washed and worn repeatedly over the past several months - they wear well, total comfort, great fit and remain as good as ever six months later. [SEP] I am giving these jeans 2 stars, because they are comfortable, but that's about the only positive I can say about them. They also look fine, but the problems are too numerous to overlook<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. The material is super thin and stretchy. I don't mind clothes that stretch, but these stretch unlike any jeans I've over owned - including ones that advertise stretch. Those will stretch a little... these you can stretch 2-4 inches in any direction. So basically a size 34 will probably fit you if you usually wear 35 probably  36. I wear between 33 and 34, and these are big on me.<br />2. Since you can only pick size (34) I happen to get a 34-30 which is unfortunately too short for me. Not sure what they are thinking just advertising the width... especially online where you cannot try them on first.<br />3. The material is so thin, it's highly unlikely they will last.<br />4. The stitching had already missed spots and loose threads in multiple areas (nothing that would compromise the integrity, but it doesn't inspire confidence or quality when you see that).<br /><br />Overall I cannot recommend these, unless you really like thin jeans that are super stretchy and the company corrects/shows both the width and length when selecting sizes. [SEP] All of us early reviewers seem to have ordered size ""34,"" but one received ""34x34"" and two of us received ""34x30."" I also ordered a size ""34"" of the relaxed-fit Genuine Assembly jeans, and they turned out to be ""34x32."" Hopefully they'll start being more specific about the sizing.<br /><br />The waist on the ""34x30"" I got measures 35"" inside, which is actually an inch *less* than most 34s measure (because we're bigger there than we think), but it stretches out to about 42"". So if you normally wear a 34 waist, meaning you usually have 36"" of room, these will still feel roomy enough.<br /><br />The inseams measure 29-1/2"", so a little shorter than the 30"" claimed on the tag.<br /><br />The cut is slim as advertised, about 2-1/2"" less around in the thighs than some similarly-size regular-cut Lee jeans I have, and a couple inches less in the calves too. But they're very stretchy, easily expanding to larger than the Lees. I think there's more elastane in the material than claimed.<br /><br />They ride a little lower than the Lees, probably lower than some will prefer, but they feel OK for me with a belt to keep them from getting any lower. That lessens the room in the crotch, but not uncomfortably so.<br /><br />The change pocket is over 5"" long but only 2"" at its deepest part. Seems less safe to me.<br /><br />Machine wash cold with like colors, gentle cycle, non-chlorine bleach only if needed, tumble dry low heat, cool iron.<br /><br />Made in Bangladesh.",3,True

They are also a bit thin and are not cushioned in the heel. They do fit well (I have large feet in size 9-10) but the compression is super mild.<br /><br />These are okay but not great. The six pairs in the package come in the following designs:<br /><br />- 2 white w/teal heel<br />- 1 white w/yellow heel<br />- 1 white w/red heel<br />- 1 white w/purple heel<br />- 1 black with teal trim<br /><br />The current price of $12.59 ($13.99 minus 10%) comes to $2.10 per pair. [SEP] They fit perfect and are quite comfortable too [SEP] These ankle high compression socks give great support on the arch of the foot. My only complaint is I wish there was more cotton in the blend of the socks. [SEP] I think these are very good for the money [SEP] Despite the strange sizing information, provided in a graphic in the product details, these compression socks fit.  I wear a US mens 8.5 size.  The foot measures 9.5 inches in length.  So, both fall into the sizing for L/XL, according to their sizing chart.  The chart indicates L/XL fits US mens shoe size 8 inches - 14 inches. Not sure if actually meant inches or shoe sizes 8 - 14.  Fortunately, my feet would qualify either way for the L/XL size.<br />The sock offers adequate compression for targeted areas.  The sock did have to stretch slightly to fit, which I expected from a compression sock. If you have longer feet, higher shoe size, they'll probably stretch more. This might cause more compression.  In my case, it seems perfect.<br />How do they feel? Well, to be honest, I'm not accustomed to wearing low rise socks.  Most of my socks are mid-calf or higher.  But, they do feel like quality socks.  Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.  I provide photos showing ruler measurements of different aspects of a sock.<br />Overall, I do like these compression socks.  I'm happy with the quality and fit.  It earns a 4.5+ star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] Great purchase for the price [SEP] Gives the support needed, comfortable, and much nicer to wear than the normal compression socks. [SEP] Good value, all fit well with exception of one pair. [SEP] While these aren't the most attractive socks, for athletic compression socks -- they are significantly cheaper than some name brand alternatives.  These had a surprisingly strong compression.  They do have a similar fit and feel to some other compression running socks, even if the cut is a little different. [SEP] Things I liked: 1. The cost, $14 for 7 pairs of compression socks, great price.  #2 The colors, nice vibrant colors, good selection.  #3 The compression, nice and tight but still go on easily and they stay in place.  Things I didn't like: #1 My feet got exceptionally hit while wearing these socks with short hiking boots and while wearing very breathable Crocs.  Uncomfortable.  #2 The seams at the toe area are not smooth.  Not noticeable with the shoes I wore the socks with but if I was wearing tight shoes, I think they'd be noticeable.  Summary: Although not perfect, for $14 they're a good buy.",3,True

They're light-weight but I just wish they came in a skin-tone color so they're not so obvious while driving but in general, I'm happy with them and would recommend them. [SEP] They did fit a bit small, however, still like them.  Thank you. [SEP] Not a bad product. Does what it's supposed to do which is block the suns rays. [SEP] They were too small for me width wise, but also too long length wise. So I gave them to a tall, skinny friend who is enjoying them. [SEP] Way too small, tried to send back, but it goes to China and cost more to send international than they are worth! [SEP] I have lupus and these things are imperative toy health.

"Plastic Wallet Insert 2 piece Credit Card Holder with 10 Page 20 Slots and 10 Page 10 Slots, Transparent (Pack of 2)",[],[],,4.1,29,3053,"My husband had some inserts that had become worn.  These fit one particular wallet, but not another.  The color is with a light frost look and they do appear well made.  He has chose this for the wallet that has the pockets for these slots.  This is a good product! [SEP] This is one of those items you always need and can never find. Each plastic wallet insert holds ten cards and will fit securely into the pockets of your wallet. The plastic enclosures are thin and textured but offer adequate protection for paper insurance cards, car registration, etc. They will withstand light credit card use. [SEP] My favorite thing is the size of the holders for credit cards -- they're not so tight that they're hard to get in and out, yet they're small enough to prevent cards from falling out. Perfect. Ten slots can hold 20 cards. Plastic is transparent and protects against moisture. On each end is a plastic flap that lets you insert it into a wallet. Great materials, sturdy and well made. There are TWO of these in the package. [SEP] This packet is good for storing credit cards and any other cards this size. I carry various badges and this makes it easy to keep them organized. I do wish the hinged top was a little wider to accommodate many cards instead of just a few. [SEP] There are still some of us (probably a lot) that still like to carry actual paper photos of our family in our wallets.  We still have kids in High School and they get their pictures taken several times a year and we like to keep them with us to show them off to our friends.  These plastic card holders work well for small photos, credit cards and other small, flat items.  It slips into your wallet via a plastic flat and it stays very well. [SEP] They are exactly what you think they are.  They feel much lighter and cheaper than any I‚Äôve gotten with wallets.  That‚Äôs the bad, I‚Äôm not sure how well they‚Äôd hold up long term.  They‚Äôre also slightly textured, which is theory could make it harder to read some text and certain angles. [SEP] Handy replacement clear plastic sleeve for bank cards and ID. [SEP] Seems like most wallets now don't have the plastic inserts for photos any more.  I guess most people pull out their cell phones now to bore you with photos of their cute kids.  But I like pulling out my wallet to bore people with the photos of my great kids and grandkids and wife.  Well built; should hold up to lots of use.  I suppose it will work well for those with lots of credit cards too. [SEP] My husband doesn't use a wallet he just uses one little plastic sleeve to hold his ID and a few cards, so we are always looking for replacements for him.  These have been great, sturdy and holds the essentials. [SEP] Credit Cards slip in fine. Standard feel and look but they have a matte and textured finish where it makes it hard to read thru it. I would not recommend these due to that. They smell ok.",3,True
925 Sterling Silver 6mm Star Post Back Stud Earrings,[],[],,4.3,17,14058,"These are adorable. They really are sterling. I've worn them since the day I got them in the mail. I love them. I was afraid they would be too big and gaudy, but nope! Perfect.  I have received tons of compliments on them. [SEP] These are exactly what I was looking for! I wanted studs that I wouldn't ever have to take out. I have two holes in each ear so at 5mm these earrings are also the perfect size. They don't interfere with my other studs at all. They also have an excellent shine.<br /><br />Be aware however, the posts are a tad wider than normal studs. Not enough to hurt a normal pierced ear or anything, but I temporarily lost a back to one and none of the backs from my other studs would fit!<br /><br />However, this is probably why they snap on so nicely. So, if you're looking for studs to take on and off all the time, these are not for you. They fit tight, and you'll probably hurt yourself trying to take them out too often.<br /><br />Also, because they are stars, they catch a little more on hair and clothing than a more rounded stud. I hardly noticed after the first couple days though.<br /><br />All in all, works for me! And at a very reasonable price. :) [SEP] &#34;Simply&#34; elegant! [SEP] Beautiful earrings, stars are totally flat so for nicely against ear without sticking up. Arrived quickly [SEP] These are really cute earrings! They're quite small, which I like because I wanted something subtle but didn't want to go with plain ball studs which are boring. I love stars so these are perfect for me! They feel great in my ears and look great as well! Definitely worth it and you can't beat the price! [SEP] Just what I was looking for. I'm not big on large earrings, but wanted more than your standard studs. Gives a subtle and simple detail of cute for everyday wear. [SEP] I love these earrings. They came a day before estimated shipping date. Theyre the perfect size, especially if you have multiple piercings like I do. Sadly, they tarnished. I really don't know why, maybe it was the warring them all the time. Maybe the water from showering or something damaged them [SEP] These earrings are unique. They look just like as shown in the images. I'm happy with them considering the price. [SEP] These earrings are cute and shiny. I love them.

I like the included hand warmers, which have little holes for my thumbs to pop through, the infinity scarf which seems just the right length to feel comfortable and yet not overly snug right around my neck, and the cute hat with pom-pom, which sits with slouchy style atop my head and makes my children think I am especially cool, since they love colorful pom-poms.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with this set. I've worn it so far out for shopping and a casual meeting as a landscaper. I haven't attempted to wash any of it, but I would suggest treating it like it's made of wool, even though it's not.

We've had some ridiculously frigid weather lately and this set holds up.  The pics here don't do it justice.  I've included a few.  The scarf loops around once for fashion, twice for most circumstances, and three times for cold weather.  The beanie is cute and doesn't pouf up too much.

Did not fit [SEP] I don't know that I would consider these to be tights. When I think of tights, I think of thick, opaque stockings with less stretch. To me, panty hose are sheer, thin, and stretchy. These tights don't really fit into either category: they are too sheer to be tights, yet too opaque to be panty hose; they are too thin to be tights, yet too thick to be panty hose.<br /><br />I wear 18W or XXL in women's clothes. The 4X tights fit me pretty well. These tights are stretchy, so they aren't too tight. Waistbands on panty hose and tights are typically painfully tight. These tights felt comfortable almost everywhere.<br /><br />The issue I had was that the legs are a little too short. This is always a problem for me with panty hose and tights, even though my legs are on the shorter end of regular length. [SEP] This two pack is a great value! I'm not sure why the model's whole body is inside them HAHA, but they are really great. These tights fit exactly as expected with a little extra room, just how every girl loves her tights!

I just got a stronger magnet so I can wear these. I wear on my ear, my lip, my nose. So fun without the permanence. The color variety is great too! You will need a stronger magnet or two though to use them. [SEP] More than a couple of traditional ear piercings are silly. I mean, piercings are a thing of the 90s and not edgy or interesting today.

"Orchid Row Women's Fashion, Trendy and Chic Ranger Hat with Velvet Band Camel/Black O/S",['100% Wool'],[],,3.5,21,46249,"I love this hat. The brim is a little all-over floppier than I'd expected, so it's not quite as stylish as I'd imagined. But still it is a fun accessory. I am not a fan of the crushed velvet ribbon around the brim, so I may remove it and replace it with grosgrain ribbon for a more tailored look. This goes great with my Orchid Row Ruana. I'll be stylin' when I return to my classroom in a few weeks. My students will wonder what got into me. [SEP] I wish it looked normal when you take the velvet band off, but it doesn‚Äôt and the velvet is just a bit much for my taste. Other than that the hat fit fine and stayed on. Not too hot and does a good job keeping the sun off my head and out of my eyes. [SEP] This is a really beautiful hat, sure to get compliments from anyone that sees it (and probably wants one too)! The velvet band sets it off too. None of the materials are cheap and it is very well made. However, the ""one size fits all"" doesn't work for me - it is about 2 sizes too large. I am going to make a leather band to insert so that I can wear it. So be warned that this hat runs somewhat large. [SEP] I wanted to like this hat, but when I put it on it became instantly apparent that the color block style isn't working at all. It makes the already high crown of the hat look even higher. The velvet band is a little too thin for the high crown and the silky velvet material looks a little odd against the matte fabric of the hat.<br />Maybe for a bigger head it would work better, but for me I feel swallowed up wearing it. [SEP] This is a beautiful well crafted hat. Orchid Row Women's Fashion Wranger Hat is made with two-toned felt and shaped like a men's fedora. It has a lovely black crushed velvet band. It is unfortunately too large for my head. I must have a very small head. The hat states one size, and it is shown as 0/S but it is too large for my head. I love this hat though so I am going to use hat reducer bands so that I can get a snug fit. [SEP] I loved the combination of the taupe and black together but when it arrived, I quickly saw that the velvet band made the hat look cheap and that its tied knot is oddly placed.  I love the hat though--it fits perfectly (I have a larger head so it might be too big for smaller women) and it keeps me warm.  I am going to remove the band and replace it with simple black felt band instead. [SEP] I am so glad that ladies hats have made a comeback.  There is nothing more fun than adding a hat to complete your outfit.  It ups the look in both a sporty and fashionable way.  These are kind of Carmen Sandiego inspired hats made of wool/felt, they are well designed, hold up well but are just a teeny bit floppy for fun.  They have contrasting colors with a velvet band.  These can be worn by adventurous ladies of all ages. [SEP] I love this hat. It has enough panache to look sophisticated with a camel coat or edgy paired with a cape, poncho or something eclectic. Priced reasonably. Have fun with it! [SEP] This felt hat is great for winter, especially when you want something dressier than a hood or a beanie. I got the black/tan one which is a very versatile combination of colors. The velvet band adds a feminine touch. It fits nice and looks nice. [SEP] Soft felt hat, two tone, very sporty looking. Not a true ‚Äúcowboy‚Äù hat, but similar style.<br /><br />There‚Äôs just enough of a rim to keep the sun off of your neck.<br /><br />It‚Äôs very lightweight, just the perfect size.",3,True
GLADDON MODA Women's Crossbody Bag Sand brown,['Zipper closure'],[],,3.4,14,7185,"This purse is really pretty. Most of the outside is like a dark tan/camel/orange plasticy material and the little pouch is a suede like material. There are so many pockets! There's the two on the front that are small but zippered. There's 3 main big pockets/areas, two on the sides are zippered and there's a kind of hidden pocket with magnetic snaps and a zipper as well. On the side with the exterior pockets are interior smaller pockets for a phone or chapstick/lipstick etc. It has a nice adjustable strap it's also removable if you want to switch it for something else. There are metallic feet on the bottom to help keep the bottom from getting gross. [SEP] Nice bag. Attractive, and small but not TOO small. It fits everything you really need and maybe a little more. It comes with a cloth bag for storage, which is nice touch. So far, it is wearing well [SEP] l was looking for a very compact bag to take shopping, and this purse is larger than I thought it would be. However, it‚Äôs a cute purse with several different compartments to help keep things in your purse organized. It looks nice and is great for casual occasions or for taking to the office. The strap is a good length for a shoulder bag and is easy to adjust to get the preferred length. Although the purse wasn‚Äôt what I expected, I like the purse for casual outings. [SEP] [[VIDEOID:994ff073083ca70628587046b2f122cc]] This purse is very nice, the color isn‚Äôt loud and it looks professional. It offers several compartments to hold personal items. I gave the purse a four star because it only has a long strap and doesn‚Äôt have an option to use a shorter strap. Picking up the purse can feel awkward because the strap is so long, but once I had it on my shoulder, I was set...üëú [SEP] This is definitely a very attractive and well-designed bag.  It's not real leather, though -- it's PU leather (meaning there's a bit of leather coated with polyurethane).  It definitely looks and feels like vinyl.  Still, the color is rich and beautiful, and I love all the zippered pockets and compartments.  There's a sueded outside pocket with two zippered compartments -- a small one (perfect for keys) and a larger one (perfect for my phone).  The bag itself closes at the top with two magnetic buttons, but there's also a zipper (making sure nothing you put in the bag will fall out).  There are additional deep zippered compartments on each side of the bag -- this bag holds a lot!<br /><br />I'm not crazy about the cross-body strap, mainly because it's too long to wear as a regular shoulder bag.  I do own a few cross-body bags, but they are much smaller than this.  I would love to wear this as a regular purse, but the strap (which is adjustable) is too long.  The measurements of the bag differ from the product description -- it is 9 inches high, 11 inches long, and 4.5 inches wide (at the footed bottom).  This is considerably bigger than the measurements provided in the description.  Because of this, it would work much better as a shoulder bag, rather than a cross-body bag.<br /><br />All that said, I do really like this bag.  I will try to use it as a shoulder bag -- I just need to get used to the long strap. [SEP] This is a great size for your phone, reading glasses (if, like me, you are of a certain age), pack of tissues, wallet, etc. The color is neutral and so is the style (aside from the tassels). It seems sturdily built and the zipper works well. I held off on the review to see if they'd list a price, but they have not. In a big box store it would probably be around $20. If it is ever available for sale, recommend. [SEP] Good size crossbody bag. It looks sleek and modern while still feeling rustic. The color is great throughout and the quality of the stitching is pretty good. My only negative, is that the zipper is a bit funky and I am not sure how well it will hold. At the time of the review the pricing was unavailable, thus I didn‚Äôt assess the fairness of the pricing.<br />If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.

"Ldurian Layered Necklace, Set of 2, Choker Chain with Coin Bar Pendant, Layering Drop Lariat For Women, Dainty Minimalist Jewelry (14K Gold Plated)",[],[],,4.1,143,7275,"This is a lovely set of necklaces. They are both 8 inch chain link chains with a 2 inch extender. They both  have a small lobster claw clasps. The chains are really tiny so they will get tangled quite a bit but they have a delicate classy look. The bar is 2 inches long and rests gently against the d√©colletage. The disc is about 1/3 of an inch in the drop/diameter. Both of these have a really great color to start with. I took a picture of what they look like next to my 14 kt rope chain. If it is handled with care and doesn‚Äôt get wet then the color might maintain it selves for a while especially since it‚Äôs 14k over stainless steel and not any kind of copper which would turn fast no matter what. So these are pretty decent. You can‚Äôt beat paying $20.00 for both. That‚Äôs about the cost of costume/plastic jewelry anyway. I know I can get a few years out of these if I‚Äôm super careful. [SEP] This 14 K plated layering necklace is so cute and trendy. Each necklace can be worn alone or worn as a layering set. I believe the price is fair. These are very giftable and can be worn by young or old alike!  I recommend these cute necklaces! [SEP] I was excited to give this necklace set a shot. I hadn't really seen any designs like it out there so I thought it'd be a unique addition to my necklace rotation. It hasn't disappointed!<br /><br />The packaging was a little less than desirable in that the necklaces were quite wadded up and twisted around, but once I took them out of the package they were quite pretty. There are two very delicate, separate strands, one with the round pendant and the other with the bar pendant. The strands have multiple holes so you can make them longer or shorter depending on the look you're going for. It's nice to have the choice to wear them together or separately, or with the circle above or below the bar!<br /><br />I have some sensitivities to certain metals and haven't noticed any issues wearing these. I also haven't noticed any of the gold plating wearing off quite yet, which was my concern with a more affordable necklace set like this.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this affordable necklace set for everyday wear! [SEP] The bar and coin necklaces come  as two separate pieces which allow you to mix and match as needed.  The prices are decent sized, more for teens or daintier wearers.  They provide a subtle but stylish lift to your wardrobe.  The chains are the weak spot, thin and look like they will be easy to break or fail.<br /><br />Overall a good choice as a gift for a friend or an occasional ‚Äòthinking of you‚Äô gift. [SEP] I taught this would be a bigger pendant necklace but it was actually small. From a distance you cannot see the pendant design until your really close. It is a very cute necklace but not what I expected. [SEP] These necklaces are pretty, and have a bright sheen to them. The hammered coin is really nice. The thing is, I don‚Äôt think of these as chokers at all, just shorter necklaces. To me a choker comes up much higher on the neck, and the coin especially dangles to just above the cleavage. They look nice together, or separately, and are a fun set to wear, either dresses up a bit, or more casually. [SEP] These are nice necklaces.  I have another similar one that I could pair well with these.  The two necklace design adds a little style while the color and simplicity make it a classic piece.  They are delicate yet sturdy.  They look nice and come packaged well.  I can also wear them in lots of occasions because of the style, casual or dressed up. [SEP] Excellent design; can be used for daily wear as well. Inexpensive, packed and shipped well.<br />Nice gift possibility for grand kids, friends etc. as well.<br />Recommended [SEP] I really like this necklace. You can wear them individually or in tandem. They layer well with other necklaces as well. However, it tangles easily. I spent 40 minutes untangling it. Then, while wearing it for the day it kept tangling over and over again. I really like how they look together but will wear them separately from now on. The hook holes in the back are great, gives you many options for length. Also, I like that the circle charm has a smooth side and a textured side. I‚Äôm all about options with my jewelry.<br /><br />I recommend storing these necklaces on a hanging post or separately in the plastic bags they came in, otherwise you‚Äôll have a hot tangled mess. Overall, a good product. Out of 5 stars, I give it 3 for style and -2 for tangled. [SEP] These necklaces are cute and simple. Well made however the chain is thin so dont expect it to last too long if you choose to wear it everyday.",3,True

They seem to be good quality and I would buy them again for sure.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  I will buy these again for sure- and probably will give them as gifts. [SEP] At about $2.33/pair, this is decent value pack of non-slip socks with some really odd color choices. They're soft, comfortable, and breathable, plus the rubbery backing near the achilles tendon helps prevent these socks from migrating down your foot into your shoe‚Äîyou know what I‚Äôm talking about, and that‚Äôs so annoying. These are fine with sneakers and low cut boots, but I wouldn‚Äôt really call them no-show. Most flats are cut lower, and these strangely colored socks Will show. 3.5~ stars. [SEP] Good quality low cut, no show socks. Comes in cute colors/patterns, the socks stay put,t hey are well made. Highly rec! [SEP] These are great no show socks.  My daughter and I love them.  a wide variety of colors, and they don't show in most of our shoes.  they stay on well and are comfy. works great and looks nice on.  Made well, good quality. [SEP] I like to wear low cut socks but some of them get loose easily. I have tried Panvbo no show socks few weeks and they are great. The texture is soft and the thickness of the fabric is perfect. I usually wear low cut in summer and I think Panvbo low cut socks is great for summer weather. I have wear it all day and my feet feels like not wear socks- the material is breathable. I wear shoes with size 7-8 and this fits me great. There is a lightly smell when I first opened the package but it went away after few washes. [SEP] There are only six pairs, not eight. Not worth the struggle of returning, but buyer beware. [SEP] We've been on a quest to find no show socks that stay up in the back. Previous pairs from well-known brands don't stay up after a few wearings. These do as they have three small ""sticky"" strips in the back of the heel to help them stay where they belong. It's a small, but brilliant touch that is much appreciated! [SEP] For a 7 1/2  shoe size these are a bit big in the heel but my feet are narrow so that may be why. The colors are nice but mostly hidden in shoes. I say mostly because I do not find these to be no show socks. I wear spin shoes and a few different types of casual slip ons and the socks show in all of them. They are thin, liners as described, and have a nice no slip heel. My feet do not sweat so I cannot review the absorption factor. They are comfortable for a non impact sport. There is no padding, truly a liner. [SEP] I ordered these Panvbo Athletic socks for my Wife mainly because they were no show socks, to wear with her lightweight Athletic type Shoes. It gets very hot here in Texas during the summer and because her Plantar fasciitis she hasn‚Äôt been able to find comfortable sandals, but has found some Athletic Shoes which breathe, stay cool, and have impact cushioning to provide comfortable support she needs. These Socks she says are lightweight and also very breathable which helps keep her feet cool and comfortable. They come in multi colors, are moisture wicking and they don‚Äôt slide around in your shoes like other brands.<br />We had Ordered another type Panvbo Brand Sock before for her mom and knew they have a silicone rubber piece on them to keep from sliding around and was another reason for buying!",3,True

He will pick out the one he wants to wear when we go ‚Äúout‚Äù - to dinner, visit friends etc. Yes we have adapted to our country home of 25 years, on 9 acres in the the sticks,  5 acres of which is a pond. We have converted to Midwest hicks who have ‚Äúdress‚Äù brimmed baseball  hats lol. It has pride of place among the Coast Guard, NYFD, FBI, and many more.<br /><br />To the hat‚Äôs quality, I can say it is well made, thick material and well sewn and put together. The embroidered insignia is well sewn and tightly and neatly applied. It is a high quality lid indeed. If you have a hat lover or collector, this would be a really great gift. I guarantee they will like it [SEP] I like to wear this around to annoy Trumpers [SEP] Excited to get this hat. It‚Äôs very well made and comfortable. The Velcro back adjustable nicely to my smaller head.  It is soft, but holds its shape. Very nice. [SEP] I love this hat! I am a Navy Vet and wear this beautiful hat to honor John McCain for the hero that he was. The hat is high quality - I was very pleased with the embroidered stitching on this hat-it is perfect and eye-catching too! Even has details on the embroidered ship! I have had comments when wearing it, as to how much they like it and where did I get it and I tell them Amazon! I love the curved brim on this cap-it helps shade my eyes better, from the sun. I had a problem initially when they sent the wrong hat, but when I contacted them-they were very polite and sent me the correct hat immediately, with a note apologizing for the error. VERY PLEASED WITH THE HAT & GEANBAYE CUSTOMER SERVICE - I would buy from them with no hesitation ! ! [SEP] The John Mccain you know is a legend and the hat is a great way to tribute in his name.  But did you know his father and grandfather were also epic Admirals?<br /><br />Quality stitching and deep colors, and it expands enough to hold a hat size over 8 (I'm just under that).  It appears flat to some heads because it's not a full dome cap design. The bill is stiff and pre-curved the way I like it.<br /><br />I salute and truly appreciate all of our men and women that are/have served. [SEP] I've now received two hats that look nothing like the picture.  Both hats are without embroidered USS John McCain.  Both are a sea captain style and not baseball type cap.  Now returning for a refund. [SEP] Dad loved his hat [SEP] My husband loves military ships and aircraft.  He frequently gets hats to show his love for them.  This USS John McCain is perfect as a gift for him to add to his collection.  It is good quality.  I think he would have preferred snaps to the velcro but he will get over it since it is a nice hat.  Mine did not ship very securely.  It was just in a mailing bag and not in a box.  It survived well, fortunately.  I would recommend this to a John McCain fan or a fan of military wear. [SEP] I was very impressed with the styling and the stitching on the design.  The hat is very comfortable and I am wearing it now.  Nuff said. [SEP] Good ball cap. Well made adjustable and comfortable. I like the velcro size adjustment, it's much better than other types and thec internal sweat band also adds to the comfort.",3,True

They seem to fit just right, are made, nice material, and have a nice elastic waist. They also have NO uncomforable paper tag in the back! [SEP] This is a good package of underwear because you get so many.  The underwear are comfortable and I like that they are stretchy so they don't bind anywhere.  They fit well and are true to size. They don't have a fly and I prefer that they did but overall they are very good underwear. [SEP] I like these boxer briefs. These are light weight and comfortable. They may be a tad too light weight. I'll have to see how they hold up. The one flaw for me is the boxers don't have an escape hatch or slit for Wee Willy to get out when he has to  whiz. I take frequent walks in the farm land around my house and would hate to be arrested for indecent exposure for being caught with my pants down. (: [SEP] I measured these boxers before and after washing in cold water on delicate and air drying.  The boxers did not shrink as you can see. The boxers waist band is just the right width not to thick or thin.  No slit in the front of the boxer seems to be the going thing in men's undergarments. These boxers did not ride up, contoured to the body and were soft and cool did not heat the seat up. These boxers are comfortable and bendable, move with you. My son was very happy with these boxers. I hope this has helped. Thank You [SEP] These are comfortable and well made. But, like many boxer briefs these days, they lack a pee hole. For that reason, I generally only wear 'em at home. [SEP] I will let my husband describe these boxer briefs.<br />I like them.  as with most boxer briefs I order at least one size larger than the chart.  I don't like the them to fit tight.  Sometimes the XL is too big but a large is often too small.  These are just right for my 33/34"" waist.  They are very stretchy so some men may not like the fit the way I do.  The elastic waistband is not too tight and the poly/cotton fabric is comfortable.  But again, I like them to fit loose.  There is not a fly but I never use it anyway so no big deal.

It is good to lower your chances of having a theft.<br /><br />It was nicely packaged.<br /><br />The quality overall was very nice. It seemed durable. I think it will last a long time. I would recommend it. [SEP] I like that this is simple, not bulky and it holds what I need. The coloring, logo and material are nice- though, I question if there will be any trouble with a couple small parts in the stitching, in the near future (that's the only ""concern"" I'd say I have).<br /><br />The info that came with it says: ""Any natural marking are a distinct part of the character and texture of leather which makes each Louis Pelle leather products unique.""<br /><br />It's a little bigger than a credit/ID card in length and width. There are 3 slots on the left that comfortably fit around 3-4 cards and on the right 1 slot that could potentially hold several cards...there is a pocket behind the slots on each side....I worded it ""potentially holds"" because while it can hold several cards, it will be a matter of personal preference on how thick/how much you want in it. [SEP] It's a good quality wallet with high-end stitching. It's light brown color and smells nice. It fits 6 cards but has no space for cash at all. But it will certainly make a good gift for anyone. [SEP] Nice color, well constructed.  Not a lot of room for cash or credit cards but I think that was the point.  Truly a minimalists wallet.  Perfect for on vacation when you don't need more than a few cards. [SEP] Perfect size for when you just don‚Äôt want to lug EVERY SINGLE SAVINGS CARD. Lee some fast cash, a debit + credit card and your ID & you are ready to go! Both feminine & masculine all in the same glance. Very well made. [SEP] This wallet is a perfect size to fit in my sons pocket. It fits completely in the front pocket where he likes to keep his Waller‚Äôs without falling out. He has all his credit cards as well as cash  in it perfectly. The leather is soft with no rough edges just a perfect designed wallet. [SEP] I've used this wallet everyday for months and it has really aged well. The leather has a very rugged vintage look at this point that I find very attractive. The seams are all tight and look as well made as the day I opened it. It keeps 6 cards handy as well as a few important documents and a few pictures and is still very compact and low profile. [SEP] The first thing that struck me was the minimal packaging; wallet wrapped in tissue paper inside of a recycled cardboard folding box. Nice to see a company reduce waste with as little packaging as possible.<br />Now the wallet... WOW! Very, very nice material and build. I'm sure this will last for a long time, without a doubt. Stitches are study and even, leather is of sufficient grade and my stuff fit inside without issue. I have 6 cards and cash inside and its still slim enough to comfortably fit in my front pocket with ease. If I could rate it higher, I would! Great product! [SEP] I typically use a large bifold wallet but when I travel I tend to go lighter. I just want my 2 ID's, a credit card and some cash and for that there is no reason to have my large wallet. Not knowing what adventure I have coming next the thought of having the bulky wallet with no secure place to put it isn't appealing to me. This wallet is very well built and does everything I need it to plus the added RFID blocking is a huge bonus.

BAGVIO Set of 2 Compression Packing Cubes Travel luggage Suitcase Organizer Set Packs More in Less Space (Royal-Blue),['Zipper closure'],[],,4.4,25,2141,"These BAGVIO Set of 2 Compression Packing Cubes Travel luggage Suitcase Organizers are great. I didn't know they expanded, which I find very useful. I will be using them to store my craft supplies when traveling. I always need a project with me and these bags make it easy to see what is inside. I can also see it being very useful for small items that usually seem to get lost in larger luggage. I will recommend this product to family and friends. [SEP] These are good because they are strong, but we're still waiting for solutions to a couple of problems with the latest generation packing bags in this category.<br /><br />PRO<br />-Sturdier than many competitors<br />-Zippers have holes for attaching labels<br />-Strong enough for toiletries, chargers, AC jacks<br />-Size choices are appropriate<br />-Carrying handles (not always provided on competitive bags)<br />-Good seller return policy<br /><br />CON<br />-Supply your own labels<br />-Despite the claim to the contrary, couldn't see contents very well [SEP] These two bags are terrific. One is slightly smaller than the other, and they are both expandable to many sizes. At first, I was deterred by the small zipper opening, but then I realized it can  actually be an advantage because it lets me pack my items even tighter.<br />These bags look stylish, but have a thick almost rugged feel to them. I‚Äôm pretty sure they are going to last a long time even with regular use. [SEP] This BAGVIO set consists of 2 same size packing cubes that are made of a medium weight fabric and medium duty zippers.  The main zipper opens the packing compartment to a halfway point (unlike packing cubes which zip to fully open), and the second zipper expands/widens the packing compartment.<br /><br />To fill, expand the cube and put in your clothes.  Close the main zipper and then zip up the expansion zipper to ""compress"" the cube.  By doing this, you do squish your clothes and the bag does get smaller (obviously, the expansion portion of the cube is zipped up), thereby allowing you to save some space in your luggage.  For this reason, I rate these BAGVIO packing cubes higher than standard packing cubes.<br /><br />However, if you've ever used true compression bags, these BAGVIO cubes are nothing like true air-removing compression bags and cannot compete with the packability of compression bags.  Your clothes will wrinkle using either method, but the air removal feature of the compression bag allows more clothes in the suitcase than these compression cubes. [SEP] This is the best thing you can purchase to accessorize and compliment your luggage.  These bags are very high quality, durable stitching and high value.  They are the perfect size to use for either shoes, or socks or anything you want to be kept separate from the rest of your wardrobe.  They can also be used for toiletries or a small hair dryer.  If you have luggage, you should have these organizer bags. [SEP] These are fairly small bags. They have mesh lined centers on one side (for breath-ability), and plenty of zippered pockets. Canvas type material should hold up well to handling. They only have a hand carry strap, but would be better if they included a shoulder strap.  Not sure how much gym gear you can really get in these due to their size, but they are handy for smaller items. One of these is slightly smaller than the other (when they arrive, one is packed inside the other). Still, for general use, maybe even as a lunch bag, these are pretty good. If you wanted to pack shoes in a suitcase, these would work well to keep the shoes from dirtying your clothes. [SEP] These travel bags are great. I found them to be durable and easy to use. I like that they can be stored together and they can expand easily to fit all your belongings. [SEP] I discovered the advantages of suitcase packing cubes about 20 years ago. They're splendid for organization, as ""unpacking"" in a hotel room means simply putting the cubes in a drawer; you don't have to hunt for anything since you put related items in the same packing cube; and they make it simple to separate the dirty laundry from the clean clothing. By this point, we've collected at least a dozen such packing cubes, some of which are dedicated to ""traveling kitchen"" (because yes of course we bring along our own coffee gear) or ""winter items"" (so that we Arizona people don't have to hunt for gloves when we head to cold climate). As a result, it was easy for me to say YES when Amazon Vine offered me this set of two packing cubes.<br /><br />...And they're fine. Not astonishing, not disappointing. They do the job adequately.<br /><br />The only oddity is the size and shape of these bags. Most travel packing cubes zip open all the way, so that you can fold items (say, shirts) or flip through them in a hotel room (let's see, which shirt do I want to wear today?). These open up from the top, like a generous woman's purse. You can get into it just fine to sort through your socks and underwear, but it's not quite the same as the open-flat organizers.<br /><br />The construction is good. The bright blue is visible even in a dark space. The size of the bags in the two-pack (one held a week's worth of underwear and socks, the other held my slacks with plenty of room left over); I could have squished in plenty more, if I'd needed to. The price is reasonable, too.<br /><br />So this is a useful set of packing cubes... as long as you're good with the zipper design.",3,True

"Hugitout Women's Natural Cowrie Shell Bracelet, Handmade Shell Bracelet Adjustable Painted Pink Shell Bracelet Hawaii Beach Boho Jewelry",[],[],,3.0,23,11881,"This bracelet is very cute, but i think definitely is for little girls. It looks more like a toy bracelet than a jewelry. It comes in a nice pink sac and the tie system is super easy to lock and unlock. Perfect gift for a kid. [SEP] This is a super cute little bracelet. Perfect for the beach lover, or little girl in your life! Love everything cowrie! [SEP] The Hugitout shell bracelet is made with 6 pink enameled shells. The pink is pretty bright and match with the bag came with the bracelet. It is totally a giftable condition because it came in a plastic bag, the bracelet is put inside a plastic bag with a paper description and are packed in a pink flannel bag. The bracelet is very cute. I really like the design of the two slipknots. Just pull the slipknots to adjust the size of the bracelet. It can be done with just one hand. [SEP] These are simply made, and not something I can see most adults wearing. It's more of a costume piece for teens/preteens.<br /><br />There currently is no listed price, so I can't say whether it is a good value for the price. If affordable enough, I could see this being a cute party favor if your younger one is having a Little Mermaid or Moana theme party. [SEP] Cute bracelet for a girl.  The pink shade was a bit too fake looking, as there was not a fade as you would see in shells naturally.  This is not something you would wear daily due to the finish.  So make sure a slip not is used when tying it. [SEP] This is fun piece that is great with casual clothes in the summer--or even with a bathing suit.  It is for anyone who wants to remember the beach.  Nice gift [SEP] The pink is kind of a weird color but the shells are nice and the string holding them together is good. The back of the shells (which will rest on your wrist) are pretty smooth and it sits comfortably on your wrist. This would make a cute accessory when your at the beach but probably not something you're going to wear to a fancy dinner.

This polo shirt is superb.  I received a Large size for review and it is true to size (American).  The material is soft, durable, and is made of 80% silk and 20% cotton.  The sewing and construction is excellent, and has a nice texture to it.  My husband was thrilled to get it.  This is a very good shirt and can be worn for casual wear and when very nice shirts are required.<br /><br />UPDATE 12.2.19  I have deducted a star from 5 to 4.  I washed it in the regular laundry and it did fine except the collar really crinkled and wrinkled up pretty badly.  The rest of the shirt was fine - no shrinking and no fading and still very soft.  I will have to take a hot iron to the collar to see if I can straighten it out. [SEP] I have ordered several Havana Breeze shirts and have been happy with every one. Very well made, VERY!! Super nice shirts, not a stitch out of place. My husbands favorite new brand!! [SEP] Absolutely gorgeous shirt! Its beautifully made, beautiful fabric, and true to size. It's great for casual wear or something a little dressier. 5 stars!!!! [SEP] Who can ever dislike the brand Havana Breeze? You would have to buy just one of their shirts or shorts to be instantly hooked to the brand. They make excellent quality clothing that always appears true to American sizing. Be sure to know that Havana Breeze makes very roomy shirts, so if you like a fitter style, this probably isn't the brand unless you size down, but even then the style & fabric just isn't made to conform to the body. This Havana Breeze polo shirt was no exception when it comes to the quality we've come to expect, shirt has immaculate stitchings, no loose threads, and great material of 80% silk and 20% cotton. The buttons are what stands out on this beautiful ivory creamed colored polo. The buttons just look so elegant with the faux wood style. We also love the ribbed texture of this polo, it just oozes class. You are sure to dress to impress when wearing this polo but it's versatile as well because it will look great dressed up or down.

Also, there is this small yellow strip around the back of the heel that is meant to help it stay in place.  That is totallly fine if I'm wearing these with exercise shoes, but not sure I want yellow peaking out first with my flats.  These are a bit more of an athletic type of sock, so I'm not sure if I would wear them in my more formal work shoes, but they are a nice sock overall Depending on what you plan to use them for, they could work nicely.

Some slip off and get stuck in my shoe, while the ones that always fit well are the ones that are like a pair of nylons. These, however, and thick and cozy socks! They're comfy and stay on. Thicker in my shoe that any other no show sock I've ever worn. And they stayed on, even in my Converse that normally eat socks. I really like these and would buy more.

I just love it and will be wearing it on those super cold, blustery days.  Two gaiters come in a pack - one blue, one red, and they are very soft and super warm.  I washed them in the regular laundry cycle and they came out of the dryer super soft and ready to wear again. [SEP] I bought these for my nephews now that it's getting so cold since they love being outdoors for so many activities. I also hoped it could double as a ""face covering"" if they have to pop in or out of a store on their travels. They're quite thick and warm, which I'm sure they'll appreciate. They do seem a bit snug - I had to try them on to see if they would fit them. But I'm hopeful they'll fit two teenage boys ok and keep them warm. I like both colors and they seem to be made well. [SEP] The winter neck gaiter is perfect for those that are tired of scarves. It fits snugly on your neck keeping you warm and cozy. The material is soft. There's an cord to adjust tightness. The colors are nice, they look good with just about anything you wear. My husband has taken the blue one and I wear the red one, we love taking using these on forest preserve trails. I highly recommend them. [SEP] This Adjustable Ski Mask is soft, breathable and comfortable, it's also lightweight, can help you keep warm in winter days, good for skiing, fishing, hunting etc. outside sports. But it always go down even I tight the strap, especially when I play golf in cold days. [SEP] I think the 2 for $11 is a really sweet deal.These are amazing. The neck gaiters are soft, warm, and comfortable to wear. They stretch perfectly over the head. You can pull the gaiter over the nose and ears and they'll keep you very warm. There's no discomfort breathing through the materials. [SEP] These things are ok - they will definitely keep you warm, and there isn't really technically anything wrong with them, but they are just not particularly great, either.  The material is like a thick felt on the outside, so they are kind of bulky and look cheap.  The cinch-cord around the top is not particularly comfortable or classy-looking.

I have a very small wrist. It measures between 5.2 and 5.3 inches depending on the day. I was super excited to see this band described as fitting wrists 5.1 inches and greater.<br /><br />Sadly not true. The smallest the band goes is still noticeably loose on my wrist. It needs to be about 2-3 mm smaller to fit my wrist. See pictures. (Sorry, a pretty awkward angle. It‚Äôs very hard to photograph your own wrist.)<br /><br />Materials are nice. Band lays nicely flat. Material is comfortable on the skin. (I have very sensitive skin, so this is a big plus.) Not too excited by the color options but would have used it if it fit better. A darker metal to match the watch would definitely look better. [SEP] I have been using silicon bands which do not breath as well. This band lets my skin breathe, looks nice and is comfortable. I wear it for everyday use and switch to silicon bands for doing my sports like swim, run or bike.<br /><br />This band is also easy to clip in & out of my watch face. [SEP] works well with watch.

[SEP] I didn‚Äôt like the way this looked with my white Garmin. The fit wasn‚Äôt snug enough for my wrist and it felt a little scratchy on my skin. I returned the watch band. [SEP] You get what you pay for.<br />Metal parts that latch/snap onto the watch head seem poorly designed. They look unfinished and when put against the black watch head look out of place. The latches don't feel secure when in place which made me worry that they may come undone during normal wear. Band and is too stiff and feel uncomfortable around the wrist, and the first loop, which is ""glued"" in place, is too close to the buckle which makes it very difficult to loop the band through.

Instead you get the  ‚Äúowned these a while and just left them in and forgot about them look.‚Äù<br />‚Ä¢I LOVED the idea of this clasp.. sort of flip up and spring/pop back into place. But, it doesn‚Äôt function that way‚Ä¶ The pair I already own, you must tuck one end inside the other- and it‚Äôs not easy.. SSilver can bend when trying to close. Seeing this was a trigger shut- that would pull open, put in ear and it would naturally close, aligning the 2 ends.. NoPe! This too makes you ‚Äútuck‚Äù in just the very end, which is nice.. Except, this wants to open up on its own- all the time!<br />‚Ä¢ Unless, you have skinny/thin or, a ‚Äúclose to the edge‚Äù piercing‚Ä¶ These struggle to fit around the ear cuff at all! (If that makes sense?!) Not a chance at all of making the smallest fit. The other 2 sizes will just depend on each individual + your piercing placement as well as, thickness of outer ear cuff.<br /><br />‚Ä¢ Lastly, keep in mind these are gauged fatter then, a standard earring post! I‚Äôve had ears piercing in ears x30yr. and rarely struggle to fit a post into the hole- With these, I had to force it.. and actually only got it to fit in one side. IF, changing hearing from a stud or if, you uses gauges- this may not be an issue.. but, be aware- these are fatter then, a reg. standard gauged earring post!<br /><br />Sorry to say just ‚Äúdid not likes-‚Äú I realize, these could work/fit for some. Take note: these are standard earring size and will need special caveat to make them work. For that I gave it one star and also, one for the price point.<br />I‚Äôm telling you.. Whoever makes a great self closing hoop it step sizes.. that is easy to close and stay that way.. and designed in a standard gauge size.. They will hit the mother load! I found its much harder to locate then, one thinks.. and I‚Äôve tried a handful. For now, I‚Äôll keep looking..<br />I hope this info helps‚Ä¶ Feel free to let me know! [SEP] The hinge is so small that the loop creates a continuous look that is not only visually appealing, but doesn‚Äôt get caught in anything. I strongly prefer these over the loops that I‚Äôve been using before that would always be moving out of place or getting caught with clothing or hair. Great! [SEP] Got these to wear as new lip rings. I was unsure of what circumference I needed for my lip, so I got this set. The smallest seems good for nose, the middle fits my lip well, but the large could also be worn on lip, but it's too large for me. I was able to get it snapped on pretty quickly, and it has not gotten lose or come off so far! [SEP] I was really excited to get these because I lost my pervious nose ring that was just like these. I prefer nose rings that claps close because my children are either grabbing at my face, or snatch it out with their hair when I hug or play with them.<br />I'm sad to say that they where just too big. I compared them to my roommate's septum ring, and they are the same size.<br />Nice design, and great price for 3, just too big. :( [SEP] I am allergic to many kinds of metals.  I am allergic to silver, nickel and sometimes copper too. When I got these I was worried that I could be allergic to these as well.  But my friend who has a body jewelry shop said these are the highest grade of titanium and he'd be shocked if I was allergic to them.  A few people are but it's more rare. I had absolutely no problem with them at all.  Wear them 24/7 with no problem.  The days of losing parts of your earrings is over with these.  Once I put them in I have never ever had them come out.  There is a little piece you set in them that pops in and because titanium is so strong then never let go of the piece.  In fact I was surprised that the way to best snap them in is to put the jewelry pliers in the circle and open the circle to fit the piece in.  You should  be able to do this with your fingers but I have the pliers and they make it simple. It is even easier if someone else puts them in for you. [SEP] The rings are true to size per diameter and the gauge. The metal isn't heavy and has a nice shine to it. The disappointing point with these rings is that they easily pop open. With the slightest tug, the ring pops open. It really doesn't take much for them to pop open. If the designers can tweak this issue, these rings would be perfect! [SEP] These are 16G for sure. I couldn't use them in my nose ring, since that is an 18G at the largest. I did use in my ear cartilage and it was a little difficult to get it to close. They have to be lined up just perfectly and then just the right amount of pressure is needed. I haven't had a problem since putting it in my ear. It is very comfortable and hasn't gotten caught on towels, my hair, or my ear. It hasn't popped open, so it is good once you have it in, but I wouldn't want to change it out a lot due to how difficult to close correctly. [SEP] Milacolato 6pcs titanium 16g endless hoops. These are great for the tragus and cuff ear piercing. I really like the endless hoop it is alot harder to yank these out accidentally when combing my hair. The hoops snap into each other so there is no little wire to string into a tube like the other kinds of hoops. The titanium is strong and did not cause any skin irritation or problems when inserted.  The diffrent sizes are great and the hoops are nice quality and seem durable. Great value pack of sizes. [SEP] The numb that clasp them doesn't stay and pops off a lot [SEP] The Milacolato 6Pcs G23 Titanium 16G Hinged Nose Rings are a decent starter set for those with nose piercings.  That being said, my daughter and my wife, who both have piercings, said that the gauges were awfully small and that the rings opened up way too easily.  So with that in mind, these rings seem to be over-priced by about $6-$8.  I wouldn't pay more than $10 for these.",3,True

[SEP] I am always on the lookout for a nice dress and new style to try.  Let's see how this one worked out..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS DRESS LIKE?<br />This dress is a nice soft knit that drapes well.  It is a bit thin, so you will need to have a slip under it or it is very see-through.  There is a baggy style to it and a tuck at the dropped waist.  The sleeves are cap sleeves.  I did not see where this is a wrap.  Mine is sewn shut.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS LOOK?<br />This dress is made more for a straight up and down figure.  Think of the 1920s type figure.  It is not quite as flattering on an hourglass figure which is more of what I have.  It also might not work on some with a heavy bottom pear shaped figure either.<br /><br />It can be dressed up and accessorized with belts, scarves, etc, so it can work.  As it is, it just isn't too good on my hourglass figure or the pear shaped figure that I had try it on.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you have the type of straight figure which looks good in 1920s styles, this might be a good dress for you.  It does need a slip as the fabric is thin and shows everything through it- including lumps, bumps, panty lines, etc.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />I give this one THREE STARS.  It just is not that flattering of a style on myself or two others that I had try it on. [SEP] This dress is very nicely made and looks nice on you. The front has a slit that gives it a little sexy look. The dress is quite nice and is asymmetrical for more interest. I am looking forward to wearing this in the near future. [SEP] This dress looked good in the picture BUT! The stitches are off. Everything is sewn and surged but not all stitching is tight the lay is very awkward and it lays just as awkward on the body. It has a slit on the side. Short sleeves. The material is stretchy. The size is off it is smaller so I would go up a size. Just Not A Very Attractive Dress in My Opinion!! I hope this has helped. Thank You [SEP] Great material. True to size. Comfortable and stylish. Not to short. Looks amazing on. [SEP] Very synthetic feel. The styling is very odd. There is some sort gathering around the waist on the right that makes an odd diagonal wrinkle across to the left. Very odd and affects the fit as it isn‚Äôt balanced. Odd look and with material that is very fake. [SEP] The fabric is so soft [SEP] Very unique style and flimsy, knit material, better suited for dress down or even a bathing suit cover up. I was so confused, from the pictures, I thought it looked like a dressy dress.<br /><br />I actually ordered it to wear to a funeral. Even with a slip, this is not appropriate.

[SEP] I bought this hat in a size Large, it fits my head, Adult Small.<br />I‚Äôm not sure why they are selling it as a kids hat.<br />The hat is cute but not awesome.<br />I wish that there was some more thickness to it.<br />It would be nice if the ear pieces were a flannel instead of the solid pink - it would give it more style.<br />My least favorite part about the hat is the Velcro /strap.<br />The Velcro on the hat gets stuck to my coat/shirt.<br />The Velcro on the strap just hangs - there isn‚Äôt anything for it to connect to - it can‚Äôt connect to the fur (which I suppose its good - if the side was fleece it could connect to that).<br />Overall its a cute hat but not perfect. [SEP] I absolutely adore trapper hats. Especially on kids, I think they are just the most adorable thing. I have seen a lot of male color combinations or more outdoorsy colors, this is the first true female girly pink one I have seen.<br /><br />I have been having a terrible time keeping those beanie caps on my daughters head when we play out in the snow. They seem to inevitably ride up no matter how small or big they are. Her little ears get cold and wet so I wanted to find something that had proper ear coverage. This trapper hat does the trick! Not only are the ears protected but the hat stays down because of the chin strap and Velcro.<br /><br />The inside of the trapper hat is extremely soft. It‚Äôs fleece lined in the top and it has faux fur on the ears and around the back of the head that match the same fur on the outside. It adds warmth but it‚Äôs not extremely plushy or big. This definitely works better for my child as it doesn‚Äôt get in her way.<br /><br />I always think it‚Äôs really important to wash hats after each use because of the snow and sweat when playing. I washed mine on delicate but I do hang it to dry so that I don‚Äôt risk any change in shape or materials with the fur material. [SEP] So i actually got the blue version from this company which for some reason seemed a lot better quality. This one is thinner and the material feels cheaper. It's still super cute and looks nice, just doesn't feel as nice. This would be nice to not make your head sweat with it being thinner. It does not have fur on the inside flaps of your head. I just got one so that I could match my husbands blue one. For me it works, I think it's cute. But if you are looking for a high quality nice one, I'd look elsewhere. [SEP] Smooth, quilted trapper hat, with plush faux-fur lining. This hat kept my 6YO kid cozy warm and dry even after playing in the snow for hours with her older sister. Better than a beanie with ear muffs. Washed in the washer and hung to dry with no problems.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful! [SEP] I have a kids sized head, so I as an adult will review this and then give you the kids input. This hat is purely for looks, not functionality. The hat is WARM, but that's about it. It has fleece inside and fur on the inside of the ears. As you get to looking closer, it has these wierd flaps on the flaps and it serves no purpose. Even has a button to flip them up. For what reason? It looks silly up. Serves no function down. The velcro will get dirty easily or filled with hair for the strap. It's best unstrapped. Also, the top fur part does not told down like most. It is sewn in place up top.<br /><br />As far as a childs review, it is pink and warm. It didn't turn heads or be amazed by it. This will work for winter days when they need a warm hat that I don't care if it gets dirty. Overall, cute but not functional. [SEP] I wasn't quite sure about the size on this, but it ended up fitting our 4 year old perfectly. It's such an absolutely adorable hat, we've only had it for a day but we love it. It's got a velcro strap to attach it around the chin. She's cute as a button. I wish it was still winter (not)!",3,True

I use this for all my study books, holds so much. No laptop sleeve, but I did not want one, I just wanted a roomy leather tote. Perfect! So good I just ordered a second one so I can retire heavy bulky canvas totes! [SEP] Finally I found the purse I've been looking for! Plus, it was a great price. [SEP] I ended up buying the same bag when my first one was stolen from work. It‚Äôs awesomely sturdy and roomy, and I‚Äôve gotten quite a few compliments on it. A great basic go-with-everything piece. [SEP] I purchased this bag over a year ago. This bag is still beautiful, durable and holds everything I can imagine. The leather is perfect. One of my favorite bags. [SEP] I absolutely love this bag!!! It is roomy and perfect! Yes, it does have a leather smell, but it‚Äôs not horrible. [SEP] LOVE it. Perfect size for me. Beautiful quality.  Would be nice as a large purse also. [SEP] Great bag and no smell.  It is bigger than I had figured by the measurements, but I am happy!!!!! It has long handles, winter coats will fit.  The interior feels soft and looks good.  From other reviewers the angled end of the 1 strap bothers people.  If you go by the rule that the interior zip pocket is on the back wall if you bag- that design flaw will be at your body and not seen by others.  The leather feels more faux than genuine when I opened my package, but it could be treated. I don‚Äôt know.  I like the smoothe feeling as I pet my bags while I wait in lines. [SEP] Beautiful leather, and all in all, a gorgeous bag, with a really great and rugged lining, and inner pockets to boot.  I am 5&#34;2 and I picked this bag over others I saw on amazon because the straps looked like they would be long enough for me to wear this &#34;cross body&#34; ... as in diagonally across my chest, putting the straps over my head.<br /><br />Happily, the straps do fit cross body, and I am able to wear this bag the way I had hoped.<br /><br />I can only tolerate this way of carrying purses or totes, because I have extremely narrow shoulders, and it takes a ridiculous amount of &#34;work&#34; to keep purses or bags hanging on only my shoulder.  They constantly slide down my arm.<br /><br />After ordering this one, another bag caught my attention on Amazon, which was 20 dollars more than this, but even more my style (its actually VERY similar to this one, just slightly more expensive and &#34;rugged&#34; looking).  After seeing that one, I began to regret my purchase and also obsess about the obvious design flaw in this one (look at the pictures and you will see the flaw, its in the unbalanced strap seams, where the straps are sewn onto the bag...  The flaw is only on one side of the purse).  I also started to dislike the large round &#34;button&#34; clasp feature.<br /><br />But I found an amazing solution, and now I am REALLY pleased with my bag and feel I got a great deal.<br /><br />Here is what you can do if those same design elements also bother you:<br /><br />The button is attached to a long leather strap/loop which hangs on the inside, attached through a hole. There is an identical hole on both sides of the bag. First, I traded the sides in which the button fits. This way, the side of the bag with the design flaw in the strap seams will be hidden against my body.  I then I reversed the round button so that it is hidden WITHIN the bag, and I tied a knot on the outside, so that the leather strap/loop hangs outside.  Another thing I did was take the round button feature completely off the leather loop... And I close the bag by using a quick knot on the other side. I like my bag a lot better this way.<br /><br />So, for me, it took a little bit of tweaking, but I am very, very, pleased, and the bag is certainly beautiful, sturdy, gorgeous quality leather, and a great bargain [SEP] Beautiful bag, a little stiffer than I'd prefer for a leather bag. Maybe will soften with time. Also, they're not kidding about the smell. It's like a potent mix of genuine leather and bleach, somehow. Not something that'll smell up your entire car, but definitely something to be aware of when you open the box.<br /><br />Update: 6 months later -- barely use it because the smell doesn't seem to dissipate. I'm also finding the lack of a decent top closure a pretty big hassle. It tips over and everything falls out. Dropping to two stars, unfortunately. [SEP] Wow...much nicer than I ever expected for 25.00! Looks much nicer in person than the photo. Definitely recommend. I keep my laptop in it and use it as a purse. The quality is great and stitching seems like it will last. The inside has an open pocket and a zipper pocket. I use a laptop sleeve for my laptop and it fits nicely in this bag.",3,True

It makes them easier to match in the qeekly laundry.<br /><br />I washed these once on warm and as an added extra, I put them in my mesh lingerie bag) mostly because I have a bad history of losing socks in the washing machine.<br /><br />They turned out perfect and didn't smell like burnt rubber nor did they shrink after being dried on medium heat. [SEP] The women's yoga socks with the non slip bottoms only fit up to a size 9. I cannot wear these. It just gob smacked me when I saw the sizes. So, I checked them over, they look nice and the bottoms were covered in the anti slip grips and then I put them in my charitable donations box. [SEP] I got these for my brother since he was wearing shoes in the house because he was scared of slipping on our stone floors. These are very nice quality socks with grips on the bottom. Very well made, and they keep their shape. Not tight around the ankle which a big deal for him. [SEP] Giotto non slip socks are great for activities that do not need shoes, like yoga, or just to wear around the house. The socks have grips to keep you from sliding around  on tile or hardwood floors. The fit is normal and the pads on the bottom are comfortable. I have washed them in a washing machine and then let them air dry and they are holding up well so far. [SEP] We have hardwood flooring throughout a good part of the house, and laminate flooring in the basement.  Hardwood stairs can be slippery, and the laminate is quite slick.<br /><br />Wearing good sandals is one way to help with that.  On chilly winter days (or early spring / late fall), these socks warm your feet (my moccasins are too warm) while providing a lot of grip on these hard surfaces.  Definitely increases safety coming down the stairs, very important especially for older people.<br /><br />Price is not cheap, but they do serve a safety function. [SEP] I liked everything about these socks. I got them for my son to wear at home as we have a tiled floor. They are stretchy, don't shrink, not itchy - just great quality socks. [SEP] I use these for pilates and they work great.  I like the full coverage on the top of the foot as opposed to most pilates socks which have a strap across the instep.  For one thing these are easier to pull on and so far they haven't shrunk in the wash! The silicone dots on the bottom work very well and I feel secure when doing standing work on the reformer.  Kinda fun that they have different color silicone dots.  Very nice sock. [SEP] These socks are perfect for walking on hardwood floors and down hardwood stairs. I like the coverage (high ankle), the bright accent colors, the thickness of the socks, and the sure grip it gives me with every step. I have more confidence walking in these as they're far safer than just socks. They feel like good quality too. I'm pleased and would gladly recommend them. [SEP] First, let me start off by letting you know that I am part of the Amazon Vine Program so Amazon did send this product out to me for review. The Giotto Men's no slip yoga sock are great. They come in great colors, they are super comfy. The socks slide on very easy, they kinda feel like they just wrap around your foot. After putting them on they feel like you have on a pair slippers, they are not tight around the ankles but not too loose. The Grip on the bottom is super grippy even running your hand of the bottom it grips to your hand so, on the floor it really sticks. They feel super lite weighted when wearing them but your feet feels really protected, I even wear these with my tennis shoes and they still feel great. Overall, I love these Yoga sock.",3,True

I have not washed it, so cannot speak to how it holds up in the laundry.<br /><br />The fit is boxy and huge. It is marked ""Large"" but it fits more like an XL or even XXL.

It is so soft and great as a casual dress. I didn't realize how low the tie portion went but you can loosen/tighten it to whatever you want. It is a perfect summer dress for hanging out, running errands, or even at the beach! [SEP] This is really cute but wow, that lace up front is lowwww cut! For that reason, I probably wouldn't wear it without a swimsuit or a sports bra underneath.<br />The cut is really cute though. The material seems to be of good quality and it's nice and soft. [SEP] Got this as a comfy dress for after a surgery. It‚Äôs very loose fitting. And very soft. But cute at the same time. Great for what I need it for [SEP] I‚Äôll admit, I‚Äôm not big into dresses. I like them, but I almost never wear them in public. I don‚Äôt like to stand out. This one caught my eye though, because it is cute, casual, comfy, but the lace up A-line neck makes it different and adds interest.<br />You can adjust the strings to be more modest or show a little skin. The arm holes are purposefully a little large- just the style of the dress. It gives a little bit of shape, but is not form-fitting- it is loose and flowy in a flattering way. The length is appropriate-not too short or long. I actually like the fabric a lot. First, I love this shade of grey. Second, I think it is soft, stretchy, and thick enough- I had no issues with anything showing through underneath. Everything seems well-made. The stitching looks fine.<br /><br />If I can‚Äôt gather up the courage to wear this dress out, then I can definitely lounge around in this. I think it would even look good with leggings if you wanted. I think it would even look cute as a beach cover up, especially if you open up the neck line more.<br /><br />The only issue I can think of is that you would need to pick out a specific bra that won‚Äôt show, but that isn‚Äôt a big deal. Also, I can‚Äôt tell you how this holds up with regular washing yet. The tag says to hand wash in cold water and hang to dry. I would just treat this as a delicate item and wash using a gentle cycle with cold water. I will either hang this to dry or put it on a low heat setting for a little while prior to hanging.<br /><br />For reference, I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and currently about 145lbs wearing size 6-8 pants. I ordered the medium and I think it fits the way it should. I think a small would fit me well too, just be more form fitting.<br /><br />Overall, I‚Äôm definitely happy with this dress, and would recommend it. I‚Äôll be sure to update this review if any issues arise. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so I would love to know-thanks! [SEP] This dress is adorable. Sleeveless so that it can be worn during the summer but also a thick almost sweater like material that you could put a Jean jacket over and wear during the winter. Comfortable and for an amazing price! [SEP] 5‚Äô6‚Äù 163lb. This is a really pretty dress that is very comfortable. I would love to wear a dress that‚Äôs this stylish but the dress clings to curves that aren‚Äôt usually a problem for me.

The medium fits well, but the arm holes seem really big. Maybe a small would have fit closer; however, when I looked at the model she is wearing a small and the arm holes are bigger on her too. It might just be the cut of the dress.<br /><br />This is a very comfortable dress to wear. It's super soft and has a nice flow. Nothing clings anywhere and it is thick enough that you don't have to worry about anything showing through. This is a wear anywhere type of dress - shopping, out with friends, hanging out, or even work! The ties are close so the front of you is not overly exposed. Basically like wearing a V-neck dress.

It is pretty flexible and doesn‚Äôt leave too much of a mark after wearing it for a bit. It is wider than most belts, but it does fit through the loops of jeans. Only issue I have is with the sizing. It seems to run smaller than standardized men‚Äôs belts. [SEP] This belt leather is very nice and soft. The width of the belt from top to bottom when slid through the buckle is slightly wider than the buckle itself. This may lead to some wear in the future as the belt is taken on and off. But, overall, a very nice looking and feeling belt. [SEP] The belt is great for casual wear. I wear a 34W pant and this belt fit me well, allowing me to use the center hole out of the 5 available. It is a soft leather and the buckle is very sturdy. I only have one thing that bothered me. After only wearing twice it was already showing a crease where I buckled it, that leads me to think that after wearing for a year it is likely to look pretty worn. Fine for casual wear, but I thought I‚Äôd mention it. On the good side it doesn't look prone to peeling at all. [SEP] The Men's genuine full grain oil tanned leather jeans belt with silver buckle is the real deal.<br /><br />This is simply a great belt.  I received the 34"" size which is perfect for my oldest son.  This fits jeans and jean shorts easily.  It is an attractive belt that is over one inch in diameter.  This is a light tan belt and is perfect not only for jeans in my opinion, but to pair with a pair of khakis for a more formal look.  The silver belt buckle is fashionable and works easily.  It holds up pants well.<br /><br />My son has now worn this belt with jeans and with shorts, and looks good in it.  I think this is a good quality belt. [SEP] My husband like testing out this leather belt, at first I taught it wouldn‚Äôt fit him as it look very small but it worked good. My husband is 32W mostly a small so this is a good size if your in that range. The quality of the belt is great, has a lot of insert holes and looks very stylish with jeans! [SEP] Really nice thick leather belt that I hope to use someday because it's a little to small for me, perhaps it will fit a 38 or smaller waist. [SEP] Great looking belt! Waiting for it to break in [SEP] I like the red and white stitching near the buckle. I am not familiar with the brand, but I like how they very subtly incorporate their logo on the belt and the packaging. It‚Äôs done in a very classy way.<br /><br />The belt is a lighter shade of brown than what you see pictured. The buckle is a bit wider than I would have liked- measurements are pictured. The prong feels like it should be tightened. The material was cut in a way where the edges of the belt are frail.  All in all, it‚Äôs still a pretty nice looking belt. It looks good with a pair of dark denim jeans.<br /><br />As far as sizing, the belt is about 42 inches long. The buckle is 2 inches and the holes start at 4 inches. We have the belt in size 34. The belt is a bit on the larger side. [SEP] Leather mens belt. This is a heavy duty sturdy leather belt.  The buckle is a heavier duty silver color. The entire belt is very well made and made from quality materials.  The length of the belt is 42 inches and it has a 2 inch buckle.  This is a great medium brown colored leather belt. This belt looks good with jeans. [SEP] I am pretty impressed by this belt. It is nice thick leather and it seems to be good quality. The band is a little wide as well as the buckle but I like it. The stitching has held up well so far. I will update the review if anything changes. Great belt!",3,True

These are my favorite colors so I‚Äôm bummed the earrings are too long for me. [SEP] These are cute and stylish. Put together well. Just smooth out and go. Make a great gift or keep for yourself. I hope this has helped. Thank You [SEP] These are lightweight earrings, but very long. They graze my shoulders. They are fun to wear, but probably a bit too youthful for me.

[SEP] These are really lovely, fun tiered tassel earrings for spicing up an outfit or date night. Love the look and the neutral colors make them a little more approachable than some of the bolder tassel looks. [SEP] These earrings are cute but they‚Äôre definitely not just like the picture.  The threads were not cut as evenly and they were sticking out all over the place instead of hanging straight down.  A huge pro is that they are lightweight since they are really big/long.  I tried to wear them with a chunky turtleneck sweater and they kept getting hung up.  The colors are very neutral so they will go with a wide variety of things.

Neck Size<br />Because of the design of this jewelry there will be a limited neck size. The neck size should be 13""-12"" in Circumference more than this would have less to no space between the jewelry and your neck, or someone using it.<br /><br />2. Design<br />Since the jewelry has 3 curves dangling down, its seems like it will be a problem when the wearer is moving to much because the jewelry will get tangled and there will effort in fixing it from time to time. the 2 chains can easily break if not cautious<br /><br />3. Quality<br />For my perspective, its like its cheaply made, like coated metal, the ones dangling, the details on it are not refined.<br /><br />Overall<br />if the person is someone who is not particular on the quality, and just used for times where there is less movement then this would be something you can consider to buy.

The overall impression of the dress is nice. It's flowy and whatnot. But the second time I wore it the piece that ties behind the neck just broke off. The craftsmanship and sewing on this is poor.

Nearly all the ones I  have/had are Fytto brand. I have a pair of Nuvein I liked (others didn't fit so well) and I tried some Solimo which I LOVED but then after wearing for a while they were just too tight right under the knees.<br />So now to LOLLOP. These are a fun design and you could wear these and people would think they are socks. They are much thicker than ALL my other compression socks. Unfortunately for me there's just next to no compression.<br />These (not worn--from the pack) measure 10 inches around. so I pulled out  a brand new pair of Fytto for comparison and they measure about 8 1/2 inches around the top.<br />I tried M/L which according to the manufacturer should be ok. I wear size 9 (or 9 1/2 depending on manufacturer shoe). My calf measures 14 inches around. JUst under the knee my leg measures about 13 inches if that helps.<br />There's stretch here in the LOLLOP socks, but I would have to have MUCH bigger legs for them to even begin to stretch.<br />There's just no compression here for me. Perhaps a s/m would have been better but according to the size chart, they would not have fit my foot size. [SEP] Compression socks with hearts a nd a salmon color.  Not your grand mothers ...for sure.  I wear compression daily. ...sitting commotion for hours.  My legs do not swell, are not achy.  Love these socks.<br />Not thinning.  Thick and comfortable to wear.<br />I own several from Lolisp.  now  to mention the medical benefits ...muscle recovery ..I having taken a nasty fall..they sure did their job.<br />Highlyrecommend . [SEP] These are a really cute way to wear compression socks. They are a thick weave but are not super tight around your leg. I wear an 8.5 shoe and received the M/L size; there is a slight excess of material at the toe. I am hoping that over time this doesn‚Äôt move and create pain under my toes. These did take the moisture away from my foot so I‚Äôm not overheated yet my sock doesn‚Äôt get damp. [SEP] Cute, but REALLY tight and suffocating on my calves and I don‚Äôt even have naturally thick calves. Hard to even put on/pull up and so tight it leaves marks on your legs ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Money wasted and will not be buying again. I really wanted to like these. [SEP] If you're planning to take a long flight or know you'll be inactive for a period of time, protect your legs! These moderate compression socks (15-20 mmHg) are both comfortable and stylish! The color is like a salmon pink with black hearts and black tips on toes & heels. These do not look like 'medical' socks in any way, shape, or form. I'm so happy to have these and yes - I would definitely recommend them! Ps - they're made of cotton, nylon & a little bit of spandex. But mostly cotton which is a big win for me. [SEP] These are really comfortable long socks.  I got them in a size M and they fit perfectly. I wear a women‚Äôs size 8, I think the small would have been too tight but the medium, even after several washings, still fit well.<br /><br />These are higher and come up to my upper calf.  They have a really cute pattern and are a nice light pink color.  They are perfect for lounging around in or even sleeping in.<br /><br />These are pretty great quality and I‚Äôve been very happy with the comfort, durability and style of these socks [SEP] I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by these compression socks.  Usually I can't wear socks like this because they are far too tight and uncomfortable, however with these socks the compression factor was a lot less, this meant that my legs felt somewhat compressed but blood was still able to flow freely.  Also there were no harsh lines left by over compression.  The heart design is nice and appealing and they do look rather well with some casual shoes.  The only thing is that they are warm socks even though thin, so great for autumn days but not summer ones. [SEP] Design is cute and the pink is like shown a pretty blush color, the hearts are black though. I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù 180lbs with a size 9 women‚Äôs shoe.  I have this in the M/L size and I am able to wear them comfortably just like in the advertisement photo.  Fully pulled up they come just below my knee.  They are somewhat stiff at first and feel thicker then other socks.  Nice compression and no major sweating when wearing.  I washed / dried normal laundry settings no special care and had no shrinking or discoloration. [SEP] Love these compression socks.  Decent compression and they're cute.  They even fit well.

[SEP] It's cold this time of year in the Pacific Northwest, so I hoped this would be good to hold off the winter chill. It actually looks really cheap, like a low end stuffed toy. It does feel warm, like, sweat-inducing warmth. It made me overwhelmingly hot and sweaty, then itchy. I just can't recommend this at all. [SEP] This is pretty decent - it's very soft, and it does not really look like its price point, especially when worn with a nice wool coat or jacket. It's warm and washes well so far.

And I discovered that it was actually a nuisance when doing something at my desk- I couldn't see part of the keyboard and had to take it off. Never had a scarf do that before. But it's really warm to pull up over my lower face, and feels great! [SEP] This cowl is just adorable.  It is extremely soft and comfortable.  It looks very stylish and is extremely warm.  A complete and total win. [SEP] The scarf is soft and fluffy. It looks more like a fabric approximation of fur than actual faux fur, but it is very nice and had a cool texture. It has gray and black yarns or fabric threads that blend to make a dark gray - but with shifting coloring due to the alternating yarns. The scarf is an infinity design and makes a nice one loop scarf. The length of the scarf is longer than the picture makes it seem. So it is closer in size to an average fashion infinity scarf rather than a chocker/collar that the photo seems to depict. Very nice scarf. Warm and soft.

The green is a lovely olive, and the sleeves are puffy at the cuffs, but I like that unusual take on the coat. The material, since it is a wood blend, is a bit rougher (I would say it is shetland wool) but that doesn't bother me a bit. Again, a great buy and a lovely sweater coat for the fall. Can't wait to wear it! [SEP] I love the material and color is spot on.  It is a 3 star only because it fits significantly shorter than pictured.

It is soft and warm and is perfect for the temperature drop that has just occurred. She had some errands to run today and with the colder weather she is comfortable with the warmth this scarf provides. [SEP] My first impression of this scarf was that it looks very similar to one by the designer brand, Burberry. This scarf is soft and well made. I actually think it looks classier and more interesting than the one by that other brand. I really like the pattern, print, and colors on this. The black floral print design on it makes it even more stylish. [SEP] This is one of the softest scarves I've ever felt and feels great wrapped around my neck.  There's no itchy, scratchy going  on.  It's super long so I fold  it in half lengthwise and wrap around my neck.  I have both a black & brown  winter coat and this goes beautifully  with both.  One side of this scarf is all plaid  and  the other is the same plaid but with a design/border on it.  Between the softness and the colors going with both my winter coats, I  give it a top rating!

You can never own too many great scarfs, and this is absolutely hands down one of the greats! Accessories First Lace Plaid Scarf is so wonderfully soft you will find any excuse to wear it again and again, you will literally search for a coat that goes with this scarf just to wear it everyday! The scarf is seriously that heavenly soft, the description definitely wasn‚Äôt lying this time in its claims of being one of the softest scarfs. I love the design as well, it‚Äôs reversible too! The front is all plaid with a beautiful black intricate border design and the other side is all black with the same intricate gorgeous border only in plaid this time! How cool is that? The ends have fringes, it‚Äôs very long & wide so you can wrap yourself up a few times or wear it as a snood aka scarf hoodie.  I am in love with my Accessories First Lace scarf and would recommend it to everyone I know! It‚Äôs worth every penny! [SEP] This is a classy, yet whimsical, scarf that‚Äôs wonderfully long, wide, and warm. It feels rather like less-fluffy merino wool but is 100% acrylic made in Germany. It will definitely go well with classic dress coats or casual jackets to add a unique flare. This is a great scarf to wrap multiple times around your neck and snug into your coat to keep out the winter wind.

They have that casual slouchy design with a soft knit chenille corduroy look, with a faux fur soft fleece white lining. The insole is cushy and comfortable memory foam and covered with the same white fur.  The sole is a white rubbery material only on the bottom with a raised circle/diamond surface for non-slip, and there's a pretty decorative stitching all around the base of the slipper at the sole. [SEP] See Edit at bottom:<br /><br />Original review: When I first put these on, I was slightly disappointed for a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First, they seemed roomier than brand new slippers should feel (I wear a 7 1/2, and I got the 7/8  slippers.  Second, the memory foam was so thick that my feet didn't want to stay in one place in the slippers when I walked.<br /><br />It took no time at all though, for my feet to settle in. The memory foam is now molded to my feet, and the slippers still feel very cushy and comfy. The sizing is no longer an issue since my feet and the memory foam have become one!<br /><br />I wear them without socks, but they are comfortable with socks as well. I have some Ugg slippers,  but I like these better!<br /><br />Edit: Ok, after several days of wearing these, they started to get sloppy big on me. I washed them in hot water and dried them on high, hoping to shrink them. When I put them back on, they were still a little loose, then after just a few more minutes they were sloppy huge again. I ended up giving them to my sister who wears a 9 to 9 1/2. They fit her perfectly. I definitely recommend sizing down at least a whole size. You may need to give them a few days if they feel a little snug, but believe me they will definitely stretch out. I wish I would have gotten the 5-6 size. The 7-8 size fits my size 9+ sister! [SEP] These slippers are so warm and cozy! I was really surprised by how amazing they felt on my feet. Like little warm soft fluffy clouds! They fit pretty true to size and the quality is really good and the bottoms are anti skid. These will be amazing in winter! [SEP] I got these as a surprise for my wife however my teenage daughter opened the package and immediately laid claim to them. My wife thought this was a good idea as she already has a pair of slippers she loves but my daughter doesn't so it all worked out in the end. My daughter says that they are very comfortable, soft and sized correctly. As far as durability goes I can't comment since we just got them however they look decently made so I suspect if she doesn't wear them outside in the rain or snow they should hold up just fine. [SEP] these shoes/ slippers are perfect in house shoes. you can wear them out and about. for the needs i use them inside only. they are very soft. fit well. There is not a lot of support in them but they are nice for keeping your feet warm in the winter [SEP] I have not wore them outside at all.  Only in my house.  Had them a week and they are torn.  Not much memory foam in those either.  Disappointing [SEP] My wife is crazy over these slippers. They look cute.

I think the price was amazing and the durability so far seems to be good.  These are extremely comfortable and fit nicely.  I wear a 7 1/2 and these are listed as 7-8 size - so the sizing is very reliable. [SEP] Warm and soft. Not a lot of cushion. More for quick wear then all day.

Both top and bottom are tagless. Elastic waist band, slightly tapered leg. They are a boxy fit, so they do run a bit big as a result. It's hard to find 100% cotton pjs these days! My children seem to sleep so much better in them. The cotton in these is thick, no piling, all stitching is even and strong. [SEP] This pajama set is soft and stretchy.  The material is not real thick but should be warm nonetheless.  I received the large size for review and they fit my skinny teen - approx. 103 lbs, 5'4"" but were a few inches too short in length.  Since these are going to be worn around the house she doesn't care if they are too short. They fit well otherwise.  I washed them in the regular laundry and they came out of the dryer just fine with no noticeable shrinking or fading.  They look exactly as pictured on the product page. [SEP] These UNACOO kids striped pajamas are made from a soft cotton. Super comfortable and could be worn by girls or boys. The material is thin, but should provide plenty of warmth in the winter and would be perfect in warmer weather too.  I recommend these pjs. [SEP] I washed these in medium and dried on high as soon as we got them- experienced no pilling, bleeding, or shrinking. After my son's nightly shower, he put these on and he was so snuggly perfect. They fit him perfectly and he thought that they were so comfortable that he did not want to take them off the next day... luckily for us, we are on vacation, but I would be a bit frazzled if it was a school day... Since we were on vacation, we let him stay in them all day. [SEP] We got these pajamas to have for a change of clothing when our 7 year old grandkids are visiting  They are tall kids both just over 80 pounds and about 4 feet 2 and 4 feet 5 inches tall. These are a touch on the large size for them so it so they won't outgrow them immediately. The fabric is soft to the touch and nicely stretchy and the fabric still seemed very nice after an  initial wash and dry cycle.  Overall the set seems nicely made and fit was as expected. [SEP] Soft and comfy, little large in size for my 8 year old but doesn't faze him at all.  Looks like a long lasting pajama set for us. [SEP] I got these as a gift for my niece and nephew for Christmas, so I wanted them to be cute and quality. They were both. The fabric is medium weight and the design is unisex. So, now they can have to match PJs at ages 8 and 9 without looking too kiddish.  I looked at all the seams, everything was well done. They look TTS, on point with other clothing items I bought from other companies. Their mom was thrilled when they came in the mail. [SEP] My son jokes that these are his prison pajamas because of the striped pattern. They fit him well and they are comfortable. They're not quite as tight-fitting as some other pajamas can be, which is nice. They have held up well to multiple washes. [SEP] Unacoo kids size large stripped pj's. Soft material and stretchy. Nice and comfortable and good quality. My only complaint is they are a little short like a few inches if your child is over 5'1 these may be short. Since they are pajamas I didnt care but they do run short. Cute navy stripes and the material is a medium weight. They did not shrink or fade after washing. Good kids pajamas.",3,True
GLADDON MODA Women's Crossbody Bag Black,['Zipper closure'],[],,3.3,15,6324,"I'd feel comfortable using this day or night and even for formal dinners. This is thin and very comfortable -- not too bulky. It's beautifully designed and constructed. It has a lot of PU suede and some textured PU leather accents. Fully lined. Top notch construction. Shiny brass-like zippers, plate, chain and other hardware. The interior is big enough for a paperback, a scarf, sunglasses, car keys and more. A zippered interior pocket can hold my passport. Two exterior pockets -- top one fits my ipod touch and bottom one is also deep enough for my passport. Adjustable shoulder strap for a perfect fit. I love this one! [SEP] With this bag lacks in divisions on the inside, it makes up for with the three zip pockets on the front. This bag is just the right size, not too big not too small, and has a fun, funky look that combines a shiny faux snake skin at the front top, with a faux suede bottom. There are nice stitching details, and the hardware looks good too. Nice bag! [SEP] I loved this little purse when I received it.. Couldn't wait to use it. The look is so upscale for the price point. The gold hardware and the alligator accent. A nice long adjustable strap with gold chains in both ends. Perfect for any outfit really.<br />Roomy inside with the main compartment being quite deep. Also having a small zipperd pocket as most purses do and 2 small open pockets on the other side.. The front has 2 zippered pockets. The top one would hold a cell phone. The bottom one has 2 small open pockets very small perhaps keys or money. The zippers are good quality and move smoothly. The top zipper is recessed which is a nice safety feature. It would be difficult for someone to unzip it without you knowing it.<br />They day I received this I had dinner with my daughter so I decided to use it First let me say that the moment she saw this purse... She wanted it!<br />Let me get back to the one flaw. And I'm assuming that mine was just defective. When I tried to use the zippered compartment inside it was odd. At first I thought it was just for looks. I couldn't open the zipper<br />I ran it back and forth but it wouldn't open. Finally I did get it. But when I tried to put my things inside the pocket pulled up from the bottom and puckered the entire inside compartment. It's like the small pocket is part of the bottom of the purse. Making it much smaller inside . As I mentioned though I believe its a flaw in this one. Not all of them.<br />That being said. This is a lovely little bag.

"Go-Tan Mens Belt Genuine Leather Ratchet Belt for Men Dress Adjustable 1 3/8"" Trim to fit Black 28"" 46""",[],[],,3.6,32,103413,"I like the style of this belt, but the one I got said something like 28"" to 46"", but this thing is huge, way bigger than that.  they belt is cool looking, but either something got messed up (packaging also said 28"" on it) or they run very big...  It is a cool latch system closure, once you figure out how to do it. [SEP] I had recently seen ratchet belts designed specifically for people who carry concealed handguns and was intrigued by the idea. I have one traditional leather gun belt but it's not ideal in terms of fit, comfort, or adjustability. I then tried a Grip6 belt, which threads through the buckle and allows more adjustment, but the material is too thin to be effective as a gun belt. I was about to try a ratchet gun belt when this dress belt became available.<br /><br />I love it. I wear it with dress slacks and it fits and looks great. I love the unlimited adjustability. It's nice and thick, and ideal for wearing with a holster, and with a price that's half what a dedicated gun belt costs. It's a winner. [SEP] Apparently the previous reviewers understand mechanical items better than I do. The 4 panel miniature manual is worthless. I have 30 minutes into this. It took about 10 to figure out how to open the ""groove door"". It was easy to size & cut; though the manual is a bit confusing as to which side to cut, common sense tells me that the thin front part needs to be left alone. I have spent 20 more minutes unsuccessfully trying to put it back together.  If Go-Tan would like to contact me through Amazon & provide customer service as to how to use the belt, I will revise the review. For now, I can't use the belt at all. [SEP] Very good belt. Excellent fit and finish. Comes in one standard size, very generous in length. Easy to trim based on needs. So far the head held very well, got tossed in several airport baggage claim trolleys and there is  no visible scratches. [SEP] Why did I wait so long to get a new belt? Every time I would go clothes shopping I would forget to purchase a new one.<br /><br />This new Go-Tan belt is perfect for me. It has a one-piece buckle (remember the old one you had on your Scout uniform? Like that only classier). It‚Äôs a sturdy hold, with rachet lines that grasp the buckle‚Äînot just a tension fit. The mechanism works easily, though at first it might take a bit of getting used to (the instructions aren‚Äôt very helpful). The belt itself can be cut short if you need a lesser length.<br /><br />I find it a proper belt to wear both with a suit or in casual dress. Recommended.<br /><br />Highly recommended. [SEP] As described [SEP] Very solid belt with locking channels (shown in picture) that give this belt a perfect fit.  Similar to what a military belt is designed. Great look! [SEP] My previous ratchet belt was starting to wear out so I bought this one to replace it. I'm glad I did because this one is fantastic. My old one tightened with a very loud VVRRRRRRRPPPP. When I got dressed in the morning I would leave our bedroom to fasten it so I wouldn't wake my wife. This one is almost silent which I appreciate. It holds tight in position and releases very easily with the flip of a tiny lever at the bottom of the buckle. Looks nice too. I've only had it a couple months so I can't speak to its reliability, but so far so good. [SEP] I cant say enough about ratchet belts. I am always in between belt sizes. Ratchet belts fix this problem. Instead of hole a half inch or so apart, this belt has many notches close together so you can always find that perfect fit.  If you have tried ratchet belts in the past and didn't like them, try them again its different now. [SEP] I really dig this belt.  The ratchet adjustment system allows for a truly custom fit.  You'll need to trim the belt to your desired length, and the process is easy: open the latch on the back of the buckle that holds the belt, pull the belt out and trim it (be careful not to trim too much!), then re-insert the cut end back into the latch and press it closed.  The buckle is slightly large but not so much as to be distracting or unappealing, and it has a nice clean style.  The leather is handsome and pleasingly thick.  Releasing the belt is easy using the small lever, and wearing the belt is a breeze - and the fit is perfect.  Great belt all around.",3,True

My husband sometimes works as an extra on movie sets and this was exactly what he needed to carry some extra clothes and stuff that he frequently needs.  It doesn't have many pouches.  There's a pouch on each side on the outside, and a slot on the inside.  There are no zippers but there is a drawstring on the top outside to cinch the main bag up.  I like that the shoulders that are padded and the back is padded making it comfortable to wear.  It's water resistant and has couple of long reflective strips on the front.  I don't know what this backpack costs, but if it's less that $25 I will raise the star level from 4 to 5. [SEP] It's ok, it has nice reflectors on the front and I like the clasps in the front, but it just seems kind of cheaply made. Once you un-clasp the front it has a drawsting to open the top of the backpack and I dont like that at all. The two side pockets are open/closed with velcro, and I just don't like the material that actually make up the backpack. I'll sum up the review like I started it it's ok. [SEP] Not sure about the cost on this item as pricing was not available to factor in value but this appears to be designed to hold lightweight items.  The construction and fabric are basic and it might function well as a backpack for a rustic weekend away.  It won't last for long with regular use considering the simple quality use but it appears to be intended as a low-cost, temporary backpack. [SEP] Great backpack, and perfect for small hiking trips or carrying picnic items. It's very roomy and is great at keeping the moisture outside if you get wet. It was perfect using on raft rides as well. [SEP] I love this backpack! We like to go out to the desert with our RC cars to hike and drive them around and this backpack is perfect to carry everything we need! My kids smaller cars fit perfect and leaves enough room for drinks, snacks and my emergency candy for any low blood sugar episodes i may get. It has reflective strips on it which is great for what we use it for and its durability is also great for all the weight we pack in it. [SEP] I‚Äôm very impressed with these Tanc backpacks.  They are very lightweight but also very well constructed.  The design is good for most any use ‚Äì from going to school, using for a walkabout, commuting, etc.  The pack is easy to get in and out of without a lot of fussing.  There‚Äôs ample storage inside.  I sometimes walk to the farmers market and prefer a backpack to a conventional bag or utility cart.<br /><br />This has it all:  water resistant,  lightweight, reflective straps, inside and outside pockets, and is ease to tote.  Very well designed and very utilitarian. [SEP] This is a good sized pack with reflective tape and weatherized to protect against rain and humidity...almost. The flap on top has a tendency to pool and drop into the main pack so despite the weatherized fabric which is great, things may still get wet due to the design itself. On the other hand, it won't seep through like other bags so still give this a good rating...just not the best rating. Holds a decent amount and is fairly comfortable for a budget priced bag. [SEP] The thing I like best about this backpack is that it doesn't sacrifice durability for its light weight -- and it's VERY lightweight, making it perfect as a day bag or backpack for light afternoon hikes.<br /><br />Storage is basic to the point of being bare bones, and that's fine. One main storage area where you can put some extra clothes, sandals for the beach, lunch, some books, or whatever else you need.  There is a small inside slot, good for smaller toiletries or valuables, and two small pouches on the sides for tiny items you want to access quickly.<br /><br />The main flap buckles shut and also has a drawstring. Shoulder straps are comfortable as long as the bag is loaded down too much -- and with a generous main compartment, you can pack a lot in here.<br /><br />The look is neutral; nothing too fancy.<br /><br />And once again, it's VERY lightweight.<br /><br />This has replaced my messenger bag as my every day go-to. [SEP] This is a great Tanc black Oxford fabric and web/woven backpack with some really cool strips that look like racing stripes that are fully reflective. It has a traditional rucksack look.  There are Velcro pockets on the sides. The black Oxford fabric has a really cool camouflage type of design that is simply the texture of the fabric. The top of the backpack buckles down. There‚Äôs an opening at the top with a drawstring. Inside, it has a zippered pocket, pretty deep. This is a really nice, big backpack. And it has a pocket that isn‚Äôt zippered. So a zippered pocket and an unzippered pocket obviously made of material that is more waterproof.  The back of it is padded and it has traditional backpack shoulder straps.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sturdy backpack with the Oxford fabric and black-on-black camouflage giving it a nice visual touch.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

Now, swimming or lounging cannot be done without being slathered in sunscreen, but thanks to my glorious pigmentation, it doesn't always help 100%.  I started wearing Rashguards after one particularly bad burn I received while on a cruise to the Caribbean and haven't been without one since.  This rashguard is now my absolute favorites because of its versatility.  The adjustable strings make it less than a cover-up and more of a total package.  It's easy to go straight from the pool in your swim shirt to grab a quick bite to eat in your full covered dress.  I got so many compliments on this shirt while on the beach this summer and was told by all that liked it that the front zipper was the most attractive feature!  It is something that sets it apart from the other items like it and I think it should definitely be seen as a key selling feature.

The sequins definitely look and feel like they're on their securely. The sequins are also really pretty in person, just the right amount of sparkle, but it doesn't look over the top or too much bc it's all black.<br /><br />This hat fits my adult size head so on a child it may be a bit big.<br /><br />Also it's not that evident in the picture, but the under part of the bill is a hot pink color.<br /><br />I'm not sure where or when I'll wear this, but it's an adorable cap!:) [SEP] It's sooooo cute and sparkly. The ears aren't overly big but enough to be seen. The sequence are well done, and the hint of bright pink pops. Unfortunately (this is just personal preference) the bill is just too long. [SEP] This is a very cute idea for a baseball cap.  Unfortunately, I really don't like baseball caps with a mesh back - not feminine enough and reminds me of what truck drivers wear.  But, the sequins are sparkly and the little ears are cute.  I think it would have been better to have sewn all the sequins on a cloth baseball cap.  But, if you like mesh backed caps then this cap should make you very happy. [SEP] I wear hats, a lot! This one is so cute! It's well made and very sparkly! [SEP] I couldn't tell from the photo, but this hat is entirely covered with sequins along the front.  It has cute ears, covered with black sequins.  It reminds me of a Disney item.  It's pretty cute but extremely over the top flashy.  I'm taking some stars off because it is absolutely not cotton in any way shape or form.  It is nylon/plastic with attached sequins.  If you want a cotton hat, look elsewhere! [SEP] I don‚Äôt imagine my Dad would wear this Particular Hat, for Baseball or Golf but, it is a fine and well made Hat by Jeff & Aimy so, it‚Äôs all good. It‚Äôs definitely ready for some Hip and Fancy Night Out on the Town, especially if it‚Äôs an 1980‚Äôs Night. I think they did another fine job on a Hat.  I would refer it to anyone that is into Styling, especially the ladies but, I don‚Äôt think a guy want to wear it as a Fishing Cap but, you never know; they may bite more. Haha! Enjoy! [SEP] By far one of the cutest hats I've ever owned.<br /><br />Just put it in your cart already!<br />You only live once :) [SEP] Two things good about this cap, it‚Äôs cute, and it has the mesh at the back that provide breathable air.  However, there is one problem, the cap is made with some kind of material that‚Äôs a big harder than what I would like, so it‚Äôs not that comfortable. [SEP] This is a basic trucker style hat (mesh backing with plastic size adjuster on the back).  But....wait for it...covered in black sequins and it has tiny ears/ poofs on the top.  The sequins cover the front of the bill and front half of the hat.  The back is a black open mesh.  The underside of the bill is in a beautiful pink color.  Also, the threading on the back is in pink.  Fits adult heads no problem.  Only issue is the sequins are heavy duty so this hat isn't fun to touch.  It's super cute and the ears / poofs are a bit smaller then I personally would want but I wear this hat all the time. [SEP] I ordered this bb style cap on a whim and am soooo glad I did.  It's fun, fun, fun.  First it's a conventional style cap.  Then it a sparkly and blingly as the front is covered with black sequins.  Next - it has bear ears.

These run a size larger than expected.  I take a size 9 to 9.5 in a woman's shoe and 7.5 to 8 in a man's boot. I ordered these in a small / medium size which is rated for up to size 8 in a woman's size and they fit me almost perfectly. I did try a medium / large pair in another style and they were too loose. Even in this small /medium size, the heel can come up above my heel if I pull on the sock too much; nevertheless, they are almost a perfect fit.<br /><br />They offer medium compression around my calves and some compression on the soles of the feet and archs. I like the ""normal sock"" look of these knee-highs. I like the stripes but what I do not like is the washed out pink color that looks very dingy. They wash well in the washer but I lay them flat to dry.<br /><br />They offer 15 to 20 mmHg Compression and are made of 45% cotton, 40% nylon, and 15% spandex.

This will help other users like you to make informed decisions before spending their money! [SEP] These socks are very comfortable to wear. They look attractive and stylish too. I really like the colors and stripes on these. I wear these compression socks to help reduce my risk for blood clots and to improve circulation in my feet and legs. Since wearing these, I have noticed reduced swelling in my feet and calves. [SEP] Two months ago, I had a fall in the basement and ended up with a Grade 3 sprain and a fracture. While the fracture has healed, the sprain is still persisting. It makes my foot feel tight and weird and difficult (if not impossible) to walk on. I noticed that my torn deltoid ligament felt a lot better whenever I squeezed it. That's why I thought compression socks would be a good solution to my problem.<br /><br />These compression socks have helped me regain some of my lost mobility. When I noticed I'd gotten ""S/M"" size, I was a bit concerned. I do have small feet, but my legs are a bit chubby, so I was worried they'd be too small for me. To my relief, they're not too small at all. They compress my foot in just the right place to make walking so much easier. When I'm wearing them, my bad foot feels almost normal again.<br /><br />Any time I have pain my foot, putting on this socks takes the pain away. It's like magic. I'd recommend them to anyone who's healing from an injury. [SEP] Ordered a S/M and they are a little long for my size 6 feet. Although these are tight compression socks and are therefore a bit of work to put on, I felt that the tops weren't as tight as they should be. They are a bit rough but I hope they soften up over time. I purchased these to wear mostly while traveling and wearing while pregnant and I was glad to find a pair that were not boring black compression socks. These are a cute light pink and grey and don't necessarily look like compression socks, which I do like, but the colors are a little dull. I would have preferred something a bit more vibrant as these look a little faded (maybe due to the color combo??) [SEP] i am travelling to the philippines soon and so happy that i ordered these. my legs swelled from flying the last time i went and i found out it was from the high altitude. i got a pair already but they are super super tight and hard to put on -- those only come in one size and my calves are huge, so when i tried these on, i was so happy that they are not as hard to pull up like the ones i bought earlier and that they are prettier! i wouldn't mind walking around with these on. they are actually pretty! [SEP] Lollop women's cotton compression socks.  These are great socks with 15-20mmhg of compression.  I wear a size 7.5 in women's and the s/m fit good.  The socks come to just under my knees. Being a nurse and on your feet all the time can take a toll on your lower legs.  Swelling is just part of the job description until these socks.  I hate compression ted hose but these are great. They help with the swelling and they are cute and comfortable.  Great black and white striped compression socks.",3,True

He said he can just throw it in a pocket to run out on errands. C [SEP] I hardly got this out of the box before my husband scooped it up to start using it.  He has at least 25 cards that went in with ease.  The quality of the leather is second to none and it is really attractive with the logo and stitching.  I will update this review after a few weeks of use.  But according to my husband (who has had many wallets) this will definitely hold up to everyday use. [SEP] This is a great, well-made leather wallet that perfect for storing just a few cards and bills. Even though it's marketed towards men, it's also great for women, especially for those occasions that call for carrying a small purse (or no purse at all). The construction is great and I know it will last a long time. [SEP] Of the different Louis Pelle slim wallets, this is one of my favorites. Though it is a bifold, the overall thickness is still within tolerance of one who aims for less bulk in their pockets (relative to using a traditional wallet).<br /><br />This offers 6 well-constructed slots for cards, two of which can conveniently store bills. Overall thickness can vary from 1.0 - 2.0cms (~0.4 - 0.8 in), which can be compressed to ~1.5cms (0.6 in.) at moderate capacity. Variations in overall thickness would be dependent on the number of folded bills kept in addition to the stored cards. RFID protection is an added incentive for the organization it delivers.<br /><br />Stitches are sturdy and the overall construct is well-made. The model I got (as pictured) is a rugged brown leather which works nicely as a versatile wallet for casual wear due to its inherent ‚Äúworn-out‚Äù look. After using it for a month, it is fair to say that the material does NOT easily crack; but it does leave clear irreversible ‚Äúcrease‚Äù marks at points where it is sharply bent/folded.<br /><br />Though it may not be typically ‚Äúminimalist‚Äù, it is a nice slimmer alternative to more traditional wallets. [SEP] This wallet is a nice slim size to hold a few cards (driver's license, credit/debit/membership cards).  The RFID blocking is an added bonus!  Very happy with this wallet! [SEP] Nowadays, everything we do or need pretty much can be done via our smartphone, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, etc just to name a few cashless transaction options. This means, for men anyways, the need to carry a full traditional wallet is nearly non-existent or necessary. There are times you may still need to use the credit cards, car rentals, airfares payments, these are the occasions where a minimalist wallet would be ideal.<br /><br /> Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this„ÄéLouis Pelle Genuine Leather Slim Wallet„Äè. Unboxing revealed that it's slightly larger than the size of a typical credit card. You can fold it in half, & then it shrinks to half in size & you can easily put in any of your pants or jacket pockets. Being a slim minimalist wallet  to coincide with the prevailing trends, it has enough capacity to carry 3-4 credit cards & money bills. This reduces the bulge men used to have in their back pockets - that was an accident waiting to happen, or pickpockets' dream sights.<br /><br />This wallet is made of soft, yet strong, leather, it's very chic, and made by one of the leading wallet brand Louis Pelle, it's a perfect gift for Father's Day, Christmas, or a special man in your life.<br /><br />The VERDICT:<br /><br />  A well designed, cool, slim minimalist genuine soft leather wallet!<br /><br />  üòãüíóüíûüíØüí™üëç HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDüí™üíØüí¢üíìüíûüíï [SEP] My previous wallet was a good slim bifold wallet.

Still, I saw two major shortcomings after using it for a while, the ID window made my DL info visible (I know it is the purpose of ID window but I never thought it would bothers me) and the money clip (again showing the bills). It also had few card pockets and each pocket could only fit one card.<br />The Louis Pelle Genuine Leather Slim wallet is made of good leather and put together nicely.<br /><br />What I love about the wallet is that despite slim design it has lots of storage. It is single fold, and nothing is visible until you open it. It has 4 card slots, although I was able to store 2 cards at each slot. The Cash compartments (two) big enough to hold 8-10 bills or can be used to store additional cards.

It has 3 Credit card slots on both sides plus a larger hidden pocket behind each credit card area. The credit card slots could double up if needed. There is a Full sized area for currency.  With 6 credit cards it is about 1/2 inch thick.  The leather is supple with nice stitching. It feels nice in your hand and is comfortable in your pocket.

I will be using this for years to come. [SEP] This shawl is soft, warm and is long enough to wrap around your shoulders and then some. It will suit for both everyday use and special occasions as a wrap. I recommend it. [SEP] (Reviewed by my wife): This is a very soft and large pashima/shawl.  It is perfect for those times when you have a nice sleeveless dress but cannot seem to find a sweater or jacket that looks suitable over it when it gets cold.  It is perfect for draping over a sleeveless dress.  It is large without being bulky.  It is warm and soft, and not itchy at all. [SEP] I received this in the black/gray combo, and I like the two-tone concept. Depending on how your wear/wrap the pashmina, you can show just one color, or you can drape it so both colors show. Again, nice concept.<br /><br />It's a long pashmina, and wide, but fortunately, it is not bulky. That's good, because it means you could wear this as a scarf either tucked into a coat, or wrapped outside the coat.<br /><br />I'm rating it four stars instead of five simply because I think if you want something for real WARMTH, this might not be the item. It is lovely and soft, without being bulky, but that lack of weight cuts down on the warmth factor. [SEP] This faux cashmere pashmina is made of a soft and smooth fabric. It feels like a synthetic blend, but there no tag or indication of what it‚Äôs made of and also no care instructions. I received one that‚Äôs solid grey on one side and solid black on the other. It has short fringe at the edge. The weather where I live only gets cold enough for a coat for 5 minutes and the  I‚Äôm stuck lugging it around. I prefer just wearing a scarf or wrap and gloves that I can just stow in my backpack when that chill is gone. This pashmina works well as I can wear it hanging like a scarf or wrapped around my shoulders so it hangs long in the front but short in the back. This pashmina is flat and isn‚Äôt bulky or heavy, but still adds a nice extra layer of warmth. I love black and gray accessories, and the grey/black color combo is practical and compliments a lot of my wardrobe. I like it. 4 stars. [SEP] This 2 tone breathable pashmina shawl is nice and looks elegant. This is really fit to wear during work, and it can be flipped to be black with grey contour or grey with black contour. So it is like having two shawls in one. This shawl is soft and comfortable and practical. The size of this shawl is approximately 76 inches x 27 inches, so it is of a good size. Overall this is a good quality shawl. [SEP] This feels and looks amazing! I love the softness and color of the fabric. The two tones are beautiful and classy, plus it's versatile and interchangeable. It's not as big and bulky as a blanket scarf, but is wide enough to wear over your shoulders like a shawl. It's perfect with a pair of boots for that clasic fall look or paired with business attire. It's a flexible material so you can easily style it. I wear it with my everyday clothes, but it would also pair well with a winter peacoat. It is not overly heavy, so you don't overheat. In love with it! [SEP] I like that it's two tone. This makes it like having two of these instead of just one. It is soft and feels good. I can see this being used a lot once it gets cool. I washed it in gentle cycle and hanged it to dry. It came out great. I would be a great gift for someone for Christmas or a birthday. [SEP] This Crndzsis Women's 2-tone shawl is a medium weight that has been great to grab from the back of the sofa to wrap up with in the air conditioning.  It finally got cold enough today to wear with a coat, but I thought it was a bit heavy. I think it's going to be an asset when the weather gets around zero. I don't find the black/gray attractive, but that is personal preference. It is a good price for the value. Enjoy! [SEP] The first thing I noticed straight off the bat is how strange the material is for a scarf. Now since its double sided its understandable that its going to be thick in which case they should have gone with thinner materials to begin with. It almost feels like felt and when you put two of them together it adds a lot of volume to it.<br />The sides are sewn together so well, no frayed edges, just solid craftsmanship.<br />Now if you're intending to wear this as a wrap it'll work perfectly for you, it'll also do a pretty decent job keeping you warm. But if you're looking for a double sided hijaab (head scarf) let me tell you all you need to know.<br />This will keep your head very warm, works great for winters, not so much in the summers. If you're planning to do a style which requires bunching up the cloth it wont cooperate with you because it becomes very bulky and will make your style very poofy.<br />It will be heavy so be careful when pinning up to make sure its comfortable.<br />Overall I'm very excited to use this more often as we're heading towards a cool down!",3,True
Moyabo Dresses for Women Party Wedding Long Sleeve Funnel Neck Color Block Sheath Formal Work Party Bodycon Dress Black Large,[],[],,4.5,6,925,"This dress has a cute throwback feel. I can't usually pull off a drop-waist style, but this somehow works on me. I really like the details on the neckline and the skirt. The fabric is soft and stretchy.

[SEP] The material is very comfortable, with a soft and stretchy feel. It fits well and is figure-flattering. I like the design (the funnel neck), which gives it a unique look. [SEP] This dress is cute but not cut for anyone that is built like me.  I am 5‚Äô9‚Äù 180lbs 36B with an athletic build.  There is a pretty good seem line where the color changes from black to grey. Unfortunately , for me, this seems line is right across my natural waist line and makes the dress look like it bulges out and not in.  Pretty much the exact opposite of how it looks on the model.  Also, the pockets in the front aren‚Äôt actually pockets they are pieces of fabric cut and sewn on to look like pockets.. The fabric is very heavy , making this a great dress for the winter but the color folds over on itself so it feels like you have a blanket on around your neck.  For me it just didn‚Äôt work.  Also, the interior had so abrasive seems so I would need to wear someone under it.  Which is sad because the material itself is very nice to the touch. [SEP] Lots of compliments on how fashionable this is and still provides coverage and warmth. Pairs amazingly well with knee high boots and tights. No necklace accessories, but a sparkly or shiny bracelet and earrings make this pop!

They seem well made and have a nice finish on them.  Chain is decent size and thickness and the clasp is durable and works smoothly.  Style is not really masculine (but the colors are) so it is an odd combo.  I can't really see myself wearing one.  Other issue is the heart does not stay together when joined so you really can't get the full effect of you wore them together.  Love the quality and the look but just not for me (or my wife- she was meh on the whole thing) [SEP] I thought I'd just get one necklace (with two pieces) but the package arrived, and there were both the silver/gold combination and the silver/black necklace! Lucky for me, because I was planning on ordering a second one for me and my best friend. I split the first one apart for me and my mom.<br />These are a great size, with the little hearts inside the big heart clearly visible, as well as the two little sparklies. It's a nice, sturdy chain, nonadjustable, that reaches right to the middle of the chest. I like the length because it's a necklace you wear close to your heart! It's a great gift for friends, relationships, or relatives. The ""I love you"" engraved in each half of the necklace is small, but still visible. Very cute, and a sweet token of affection. Lifelike and looks just like the product photos! [SEP] You get 2 sets and they are much nicer than you would expect for the price. [SEP] Yes, yes, amazing product for me and my daughters. It doesn't look cheap, and the symbolism is great. The lockets fit together perfectly once I put them together; it appears to be a magnetic force keeping them together once interlocked, I am really impressed. [SEP] Apparently I should have read the description more thoroughly, because I was expecting ONE set of necklaces, and got two. One of them has black and silver, the other has gold and silver. My husband and I like to wear the black and silver, while the other can be gifted to another couple, or saved for a situation in which one accidentally loses theirs (which I am unfortunately prone to doing).<br /><br />These necklaces feel thick and well made. The gems do not feel like they will fall out, and the writing will not be easily scratched off or damaged over time due to wear. They both come with a short chain that will reach mid to upper sternum when worn. So, if a longer or shorter chain is desired, it can easily be replaced.<br /><br />CAUTION: I nearly lost one of mine due to an issue with the clasp. If you open it too far, it seems to get stuck open. Just be sure to make sure it is completely closed when wearing the necklace so you don't come across the same issue! It does not occur, or slide open, when the clasp has been closed. [SEP] Excellent product to give to the two people you love the most. [SEP] The Udalyn 4 piece strainless steel necklaces are a great value. You get two necklaces that separate into 4 pieces! They come with a soft felt or velvet-like black pouch for storage. At the time of this review the items were currently unavailable so I'm unable to see the price, but I still think it appears to be a great bargain! What they don't have in general quality they make up for on durability. They may not be the most fancy or flashy, but they appear to be decently made, the little faux diamonds look tightly in place so that they won't fall out easily like flimsier jewelry. Keep in mind these do appear to be much more on the feminine side, so I don't think those that identify as masculine will don this. They however are perfect for BFFs, mother,MIL/daughter DIL aunt/grandma/niece/<br />grandaughter relationships. They sit right at the chest, I personally prefer longer chains which these are able to be swapped out for. These necklaces make great gifts, I will be sharing one with my mom and the other my aunt can share with her granddaughter. I am pleased with them and would recommend them. [SEP] These came in a really nice fleece type of drawstring bag. They are for sure a little on the heavier side. I didn‚Äôt realize they would be coming with 4 total which is a plus! Would do great for a necklace but also work for a keychain, around a rear core mirror or any other application you can thing about. They are individually wrapped also inside of their packages to prevent scratches! Super giftable item [SEP] We didn‚Äôt like these necklaces. They were long chains...too long. The jewelry wasn‚Äôt of our taste or liking. [SEP] Very cute set! Great gifts for teen couples. I love them so much! The necklaces and bracelets are so cute!!! My partner loves his!

Only complaint is a lot of colors are sold out [SEP] good quality sweater, but be sure to order a size larger since this sweater runs quite small! [SEP] Very soft, form-fitting cardigan. I usually run a medium and this fits like a glove. So the sizing chart is accurate. If you want a little room or a baggy fit, size up a size. When worn open over a t-shirt, this lays very well on the body. Very high quality for the price. A lot of the reviews said this was thinner, which was what I was hoping for, but it's actually quite warm and thicker (to me). Most of my cardigans come from ModCloth and they are very thin, which I like. I wear cardigans as an accent piece more so than for warmth. That being said, I would not lower the star rating based on that expectation because this is a good quality cardigan and very flattering. I will just have to wait until it's a little cooler out before I wear it. [SEP] Love this cardigan. It's super soft yet stretchy, good quality material. Will be using more in different colors. [SEP] Item was received looking like it was used and worn with lots of fuzz.  Disappointing. [SEP] I love this cardigan.  It wears and feels like it is more expensive that it actually is.  I needed something dressy and versatile to throw on in a chilly, over-air-conditioned office setting.  I ordered the medium even though I normally wear a small.  I wanted a little extra room so I could wear it over other things, very happy with the sizing.  As another reviewer noted the white band along the inside of the collar is a nice extra detail.

Not so practical for winter weather. The fabric is not waterproof and the fur and leather are fake. The flaps aren't functional. It's super cute though. It fits my husband perfectly, it's a little too big for me (it covers my eyes). There were a few loose strings on it, but nothing that affects structural integrity. [SEP] This is the hat I know I'll be wearing this winter when shoveling snow and taking winter walks.  It's not what I would wear for a social occasion but should the weather get into the single digits or below, you bet I'll be wearing it!  It's really warm with faux fur lined flaps that come under the chin and can be buckled.  The inner lining of the hat is quilted and even though I can't measure it, there's a thickness between the lining and the outer material used.  The faux fur looks realistic to me although it doesn't have the thickness and quite the softness of actual fur.  It's sort of like real fur in that there's some shedding going on.  There are a number of 'hairs' on the hat that come from the faux fur.  This is only noticeable up close but since these are light-colored, one may not want to wear with black clothes/coats.  There are also some faux leather accents on the sides of the hat and for the chin strap belting to fasten.  This hat is serious about cold weather head protection.  Even with the slight 'shedding', this is so warm and practical as well as different looking that I still rate at 5 stars. [SEP] When I first saw this, I almost passed on it.  After thinking about it a little more, I thought it would be perfect for my nephew.  He loves different types of hats.  I was right.  He loved it!  He wore it all day today (it is still in the 80s).

[SEP] There was one sock that had some dirty mark.  Its well knitted and comfortable, yet very warm.  No complaints here. [SEP] For me personally they aren't comfortable. They are tight across the top of my foot near the ankle so they get tighter as I step. I would have returned them but they were open. They may fit someone else better. I usually wear 8.5 or 9.

They're a little shorter than indicated, and I wouldn't expect them to fit if you wear a size 9 or larger shoe.<br /><br />I find myself wondering why they should need to be handwashed, as I normally toss socks I've handknit with superwash wool yarn in with the normal wash, and even have some which are still in very good, wearable condition over two decades after I knit them.  I handwash them when I'm going to need a fresh pair before other clothes need to be washed, and washing them is not a big deal.  Just put them in some warm water with a little shampoo, and squish them thoroughly, then rinse in some fresh water.  It's drying them which is more an issue unless you have a sock blocker, or an out of the way place to lay them out until they can finish drying completely.<br /><br />If my review was helpful, please click the button below.",3,True

I dont care for the design or the materials this purse is made out of. It, to me, looks very cheap, the chain and the zipper especially. I hate to give reviews this bad but I just don't like it. [SEP] I have to say, this is a highly fashionable looking bag and is just perfect for a night out.  It works best with brown leathers or suede but denim looks good with it too.  The bag itself is big enough to allow ample storage for a night out but without being so big it gets in the way.  It feels solidly made and the material has a nice rich texture to it.  Love this bag! [SEP] I love this purse!! The strap is very long and can be worn across the body with or without a coat.  The compartments are zippered which I love so things won't fall out easily.  It is the perfect size when I'm going to sporting events or to the movies and don't have to worry where I have to set my purse.  It is made to last and very well made.

The upper portion is white and the trimming/zippers are gold. This purse truly matching most if not all outfits, making it a versatile, must buy.

I was really surprised at how awesome they looked and felt when I took them out of the package.  I washed them in the regular cycle with whites in warm water and they might have shrunk a little bit, but they came out of the dryer just fine.  I think a child will outgrow these tees long before they wear out. [SEP] These are very comfortable material, long-sleeved t-shirts for boys or girls. Nice design. [SEP] These shirts are soft, thick, and stretchy. They‚Äôre comfortable to wear. My 9 year old son is tall, so we would prefer if these were a little longer.

Not at all standard sizing. They are pretty soft material though. [SEP] These v-necked tees are very silky smooth. They‚Äôre 95% cotton, but the 5% spandex seems to make a big difference in the feel of the cloth. These are nicely made a great weight for warmer days or wearing under sweaters, etc. These are a little shorter than I‚Äôd like them to be, but wide enough around to fit loosely, which is good unless you have a really skinny kiddo. The sleeves are nice and long, and overall the fit is decent. I just wish these were about 2 inches longer, but they‚Äôll work as is, so I can‚Äôt really complain about the style, even though I just did, LOL.

They are light weight and stay securely in the ears. They are sparkly and so far have not tarnished. [SEP] I typically only wear stud earrings because I don't like the feel of things dangling down from my ears.  I wanted to try these for something different and because they looked like a good smaller size hoop.  I was very happy when I got them to find they were just the size I was expecting, a bit smaller than the size of a dime.  They fit just right, hugging the lobe of my ear.  I was worried about the clasp, but I have not had any problems with opening or closing them.  The current price is a great value for a pair of earrings with cubic zirconia.  I would definitely recommend these! [SEP] These small earrings provided my mother with just the hint of sparkle she wanted for a formal occasion.  They aren't for those times when you want bling, as the earrings are small and subtle.<br /><br />Build quality seemed very good considering the price point.  The stones were securely mounted and the clasp on the earrings held well.  Because of the earrings' size, they would not be suitable for people with hand problems, as they require some dexterity to put into the ear and snap the clasp shut.<br /><br />If you need just a subtle touch of sparkle, these earrings should work for you!

Gemspire Healing Crystals Set - Real Crystals and Healing Stones Set- Amethyst Kit - 100% Natural Authentic Gemstones and Crystal- Healing Crystals Chakra- E-Book Guide Included,[],[],,4.2,35,13770,"This set of crystals is ok, but they are not as pretty as in their pictures. Especially the amethyst cluster is not as good.<br /><br />Note: the pendants do not cord with chains or cord, you have to provide those yourself. [SEP] This is a nice set. The presentation feels more natural. There is a natural brown crinkle paper as the fluff inside of the box. Loose in the box are the large stones among the paper. Then in a light ivory colored drawstring pouch are the stones with pendant loops. Also in this set there is a pamphlet that tells about each stone. It‚Äôs in color and easy to identify/read. The larger stones are polished and smoother. They are shiny and their colors are pure. They are technically irregular shapes and sizes but their finish is smooth. Now the pendants on the other hand are more natural in shape and finish. They are lightweight and a good representation of the gemstone. The metal loop is large enough to string any of the pendants onto a variety of chains. Overall this set would make a lovely gift for any gem lover but the addition of the pendants is my favorite. My set did not come with any chains but luckily I had some so I could wear them right away. I think the price is reasonable considering the set comes with loose stones and the pendants. [SEP] This is probably one of the nicest quality ones I've gotten off Amazon to date. The crystals are beautiful, a good size (not teeny tiny), and most are beautifully polished. The necklace pendants are beautiful as well, but know that you will have to provide your own chain for them. The rutilated quartz is huge, probably one of the largest I've seen in a set like this. So far the other sets I've gotten, the rutilated quarts is a tiny one, so I was very impressed and frankly, surprised. The amethyst cluster is also beautiful and a good size, and once again, if I am comparing it with other sets I've gotten, this one is slightly larger.<br /><br />If you get some of these crystals individually from your local crystal store you are easily looking at $50 and more. This set is easily worth over $70 with the pendants and everything. This set has a good variety - a very nice starter kit. So far based off this set I got, I would recommend Gemspire's crystals - they are of quality. [SEP] The significant other, the resident chakra/energy expert, gives this product set thumbs up. üëçüëç<br />She likes the quality and polish of the stones.  She said the quartz and amethyst were a bit small, but still attractive.  She gave high marks to the four pendants. Her favorite is the amethyst pendant, with the color gradations.<br />I am disappointed that there were no included necklaces. They are shown in the product details pictures, giving the impression that they are a part of the product offering.  The text only mentions pendants, though.  I think it's a bit confusing, on the verge of misleading. I do think it merits a slight ding to the rating.<br />I thought the amethyst cluster was on the thinner side, considerably different than the product details pictures.  But, i know that the stones/crystals are all subject to the vagaries of nature.<br />Included is a brief guide to cyrstals/stones, which is a nice touch.  This would make a very nice gift (although it would be a complete set if necklaces were included).  Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.  I tried to provide a good overview of the components.<br />Overall, she has a very favorable impression of the product set.  I mentioned the few aspects that bothered me. The combined assessment results in a 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation. [SEP] Stones feel and look authentic. [SEP] This Gemspire Crystal set is a decent set of gemstones. I got them for my son who is really into gemstones and rocks, and had previously been asking for a necklace with a gemstone on it. So this kit seamed perfect for my needs!<br /><br />The gems themselves all seam to be doing ok. They are definitely not as nice and round and polished like the photos on the Amazon page suggest, but you do get all that‚Äôs promised. The little hook that is on a few of the gems so that you can wear them as a necklace are not the best quality. One was broken on arrival and the other didn‚Äôt last the week. So if your getting them for that reason I would definitely pass. But other than that it‚Äôs a cute set of an assortment of gems! [SEP] This set of crystals is ok, but they are not as pretty as in their pictures. Especially the amethyst cluster is not as good.<br /><br />Note: the pendants do not cord with chains or cord, you have to provide those yourself. [SEP] Very happy with Gemspire crystal set! You get 10 excellent quality stones and 4 pendants! I bought this as a gift for my niece, she loved it and I was very please with my purchase.

It has the round neckline, a button in the back, ruffled hem and a ruffle on the sleeves. This is for younger people. The girl will probably not be able to wear this to school, due to how the blouse rises when you lift your arms. I love the checkered look and I love the laciness between the top and ruffle. Here is what I don't like and I see it in too many clothing articles. This is made of 100% viscose. You can wash it in a washing machine, but you can't use softeners or a dryer. And you can't lay it on itself. That very statement puzzles me and you tell me if a teen is going to follow these directions, [SEP] This shirt is really nice! I love the plaid perfect for fall and winter. It fits really nicely and is made of a lightweight material that you can wear in warmer weather. I like the style of this shirt, I like how the ruffles are layered on the sleeves and around the bottom. I can easily move my shoulders and it's easy to button in the back. [SEP] I like this top. It‚Äôs quite adorable on. Be aware that it runs small. I‚Äôm a size 6 and the medium fits me perfectly. The ruffles are such an adorable pairing with the small buffalo check design, and the fact that they run on the diagonal on the sleeves is most unusual. If I had not gotten this for free, I would not have chosen this top. I‚Äôm not even sure I‚Äôd try it on. One of the few times that a top looks great on the model and my-regular-ol‚Äô-self.<br /><br />I am not thrilled with the fact that it arrived stinking of the plastic bag it came in. Not a great way to receive clothing. [SEP] I love a buffalo check for fall and winter so was excited about this. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not very practical for me fit wise. While this will look cute with jeans or a mini with tights, it‚Äôs not going to keep you warm and the sleeves are a bit wide and bulky to wear with a sweater or light jacket. This shirt is a thin, kind of slick viscose fabric.<br /><br />I‚Äôm between a small and medium and normally take a medium in flowy shirts. This shirt is deceptive as it‚Äôs not really loose (as shown on model) unless you‚Äôre very petite or size up. I‚Äôm a 36B and this is a bit restrictive in the bust and upper arms. The fitted bust area and boxy shape make it hitch up when you lift your arms so your stomach will show.<br /><br />The strip of crochet really adds to the style and I think this would be very cute if it was less fitted up top. If you‚Äôre small on top or size up, I‚Äôd recommend. [SEP] I really thought this was a cute shirt from the picture and the way it fit the model. I got a medium, which, most of the time, fits me fine (I will occasionally get a large). I had high hopes for this shirt for the fall and winter months, especially because of the colors. The material is rather lightweight, which is okay, I guess. It seems to be well made. I'm not tall (5'-6&#34;) and this shirt comes to just barely below my waist. If I lift my arms, forget-about-it. I think it's a bit tight in the chest and I really thought I'd like the ruffle on the sleeves...but I don't. When I put it on, I felt like I was in elementary school. It's just not what I thought it would be. [SEP] This shirt is really nice! I love the plaid perfect for fall and winter.

I have reviewed many inexpensive acrylic scarves and they have all been well made so my expectations were probably too high in light of what I just received.  The edges are poorly finished and rough with uneven threads. It looks very cheap, and I cannot recommend this.<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much üòä ** [SEP] One has to look very carefully at the scarf photo to see that only one side of the scarf is printed.  I didn‚Äôt look at it carefully, but I learned my lesson.  It‚Äôs a nice scarf about 83 inches long at maximum length.  It‚Äôs shaped like a long parallelogram (ends are tapered).  The ends are fringed with no hemming.  The color is camel with black and cinnamon colored cross plaid stripes.  It‚Äôs warm, but then I don‚Äôt live in a very cold place.  It‚Äôs made of 100% acrylic and made in Germany.<br /><br />I gave it 2 fewer stars, because when I wear it around my neck, the unprinted side shows.  It takes a little bit of time to arrange it so it doesn‚Äôt show.  In my opinion, it‚Äôs a little expensive for a scarf printed only on one side. [SEP] This is a nice soft scarf. However, it's not a warm scarf, it's more for decoration. I've never had a scarf that's only printed on one side, so that's kind of odd. The ends are cut in points to give a cascading look. The uneven edges feel unfinished if that makes sense. The scarf is made in Germany. I'll wear it under a coat to keep the wind off my neck, but I'll have to be mindful of the blank side showing. [SEP] Beautiful plaid design that will go with many outfits. I believe this is more to be used as an accessory and not for warmth. It is thin but soft. Unfortunately, the design is only on one side. [SEP] This Burberry-esc frantic is  both traditional and trendy.  The browns , reds and black make a stunning plaid .<br />The scarf is easy to fold around your neck to bring another element to your wardrobe",3,True

This bag is huge as has a ton of room for storage! Got this for my son for sports, however would also be perfect to take to the gym.<br />The handle and bag itself seem very durable. Zippers open and close easily. Great bag for the price! [SEP] I put this duffle through the paces and was pretty impressed by how well it held up.<br /><br />The lightweight gym bag is roomy, versatile and easy to use.  Loved that it has breathable ports on either end to keep the bag from becoming odorous with time.  I packed 3 outfits and two pairs of shoes within this duffle easily and the bag did not become cumbersome as many would with that many items packed in.  There are plenty of storage places inside and on either end.<br /><br />The only downfall I see is that the fabric is very thin and I am unsure how this bag will hold up over time.  I would still recommend for how roomy and easy this gym bag is. [SEP] This is a huge bag (considering that i just take a bottle of water and my earphones to the gym).<br />Super light weight, it is nylon, water repellent. Easy to wash it or clean it. Good stitching, well constructed and looks and feel sturdy.<br />It has 3 outside pockets. One of them has a build in strap where you can attach your keys. The other side pockets is for shoes or socks or wet clothes, it has air vents. And the front pocket is big.<br />It comes with a padded shoulder strap, very confortable. Zippers are big and they run very smooth.<br />I am going to use it as a travel bag or pool bag, because it is very big and can hold a lot.<br />The price is good for the size.<br />Highly recommended. [SEP] Overall, this is a good gym bag.  It has plenty of room for your clothes and shoes and seems to be well put-together.  The material is a bit thin (like the outer layer of a windbreaker) and I'm a bit concerned it will tear easily if snagged.  When empty, it can be ""wadded"" up (I can't think of a better word at the moment) and stored in a small space. [SEP] This bag is just ok. It seems very thin and cheap, I'm not sure how long it'll last. These just nothing special about it, and it doesn't seem very big. For me, the longest trip it would last for is an overnight trip. If it was all I had I'd use it, but its definitely not my favorite. [SEP] Abillon Foldable Duffle is super light weight bag ideal for travel and gym usage. The bag measures  about 23x12 x12 inch  which makes it big enough to fit all your gears at once. Going back to the impressive and super light  weight which might not seem a big deal for some people, but for others it is. For instances, I travel to my country where each ounce counts and so this makes this bag pretty convenient. The bag's quality material is a solid nylon and waterproof. Also, it comes with two different type of handles for carrying it, one of the two ways handles wraps the bag all around for a better weight lifting resistance. Definitely a good investment worth while. I recommend it. [SEP] This is a simple and nicely functional nylon gym bag.  It of course can be used for other things, but it‚Äôs designed for gym use.<br /><br />The dimensions mentioned in the online copy are correct, abut 12‚Äù in diameter and about 23‚Äù long.<br /><br />All zippers are in black nylon, with nice silver metals tabs and hardware.  The pulls could be a little bigger.  The pulls all were covered with plastic on arrival to keep from being scratched--nice touch.<br /><br />One end has an almost full circular zipper, which opens to a nylon pouch for shoes.  That way the shoes are inside the bag, but never touch anything inside it.  The pouch is roomy and long, and has two vents on the outside.  This pouch does not open on the inside.<br /><br />The other end has a horizontal zipper which is the foldable feature of the bag, if you pull it inside out.  There is a nice heavy-duty carrying handle for this inside this pouch.  This pouch does not open on the inside.<br /><br />There is a small pouch, about 11‚Äù wide, amidships on the bag, but only on one side.  It does not open on the inside of the bag.<br /><br />On the end opposite the shoe pouch there is a mesh pouch on the inside of the bag.  There are no other pouches in the bag, nor are there any dividers.<br /><br />The bag itself is made of lightweight ripstop nylon.  The online copy says it‚Äôs ‚Äúwaterproof,‚Äù but ‚Äúwater-resistant‚Äù is much more accurate, as neither the zippers nor the seams are waterproof.  This would be fine in the rain or out in the weather for short periods, but you can‚Äôt submerse this thing or allow it in the wet for too long.<br /><br />The dual handles close together with a Velcro wrap.  The two handles are part of single nylon 1 ¬Ω‚Äù nylon straps that go all the way around the bag.  This is nice as it provides a little bit more structure to the bag, if it‚Äôs not fully filled.<br /><br />There is a nylon carrying strap, also 1 ¬Ω‚Äù wide.  It is adjustable, with a hard plastic buckle.  The strap is removable, with two hard plastic swiveling clips on each end.  The shoulder strap has a modest pad, which can slide about on the strap.<br /><br />The product images show the black bag with dark gray nylon strapping.  That is not the case with the one I received; it is black through and through.<br /><br />There is no padding at all anywhere in/on the bag, except for the shoulder strap pad.<br /><br />Documentation: There is no documentation with this bag.  If you have any problems or questions, there essentially is not way to contact the manufacturer.<br /><br />Price: At about $33.50, that‚Äôs closer to the higher end for plain nylon bags like this one.  This has some nice features and appears well made and solid.  There are cheaper ones out there, but they may not be of the same quality.<br /><br />Bottom Line: This is a simple bag that in its lifetime is going to get regular use and punishment.  The functional features of this bag are good, and it appears to be worth the slightly higher price for plain nylon bags of this type. [SEP] Heavy duty nylon bag with generous and unique compartments.  Bag comes with a heavy duty shoulder strap with a heavily padded shoulder piece as well as the standard ‚Äúbriefcase‚Äù straps. There are four awesome compartment. One, the main compartment accessible from the top zipper is large and roomy. A small, side pocket along the side is perfect for keys, papers, wallet and other ‚Äúneed to get to‚Äù items. The one end has a large, waterproof bag that stretches into the main compartment and has air holes. This is perfect for wet items or smelly shoes. The last compartment is on the other end. It is smaller but also allows you to fold the bag inside out into this compartment. This makes the bag very small, compact and easy to carry when not in use. This is a great design and multifunctional bag! [SEP] This bag is generally good but a bit pricy.<br />Pro:<br />Lightweight, super light.<br />Easy to store, you can fold it and it takes very little space if you are not using it.<br />Roomy, you can store a lot of things in it, and because of the material, it can be ""expand"" side way.<br />Water resistance, repels water (at least when new)<br />Con:<br />Relatively pricy<br />fold-able comes with a price, the bottom doesn't have those flat pad, so in the case of gym locker room that provides only stall (not the usual long bench), the two long ends will just go down and not stay flat.

"MIAODAM 3-in-1 Waist and Thigh Trainer, Adjustable Hip Enhancer Shaper for Women, Waist and Thigh Trainer for Women Pink","['Neoprene', 'Hook and Loop closure']",[],,3.5,235,5721,"I read various reviews before I purchased this product and made sure to purchase a larger size, as many reviews said this ran small. I normally wear a size 14- between a large and an XL. I ordered a 3x and it was just a tiny bit too big. I'm convinced the large or XL would've been too snug. So make sure you order at least a size up from what you would normally wear.<br /><br />The one nit that I have for the product is there are no instructions telling you how to place it on your body. The picture that I saw when ordering shows the model wearing this product outside her clothes. I tried it both outside my clothes, with just my t-shirt over the waist and over my pants. I also tried this with the entire waist and thigh trimmer underneath my clothes. You sweat much more and it absolutely works better if you put the 3-in1 trimmer next to your skin, instead of over top your clothing.  I've been using this 3-in1 trimmer as I exercise and diet this week and now that I know to put the 3 in-1 trimmer directly against my skin, I'm pleased to see how much it makes me sweat! [SEP] I have a couple waist trainers that are specifically for my waist but thought that this would be a great product for my thighs too. The concept of this product is great, but the reality for me was not good. I have thick thighs and the thigh part barely fit regardless of it being a size 3XL. As a reference point, I wear a sz 14 which would typically be an XL or 1 XL so this really runs small. Also, I have a latex allergy so I was intentional about not finding a product with latex and excited that this one doesn't have it, but fresh out of the pack it had a smell and irritated my skin.  Overall, this might be a good product for someone else, but it was a NO for me because of the small thigh size and the material [SEP] Couldn‚Äôt tell you how it fit because it was too small. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying something like this from Amazon because the sizing is always off. Completely off!! [SEP] Just as described works like a charm! [SEP] So I ordered a XL and received a bigger size of 3X and the waist trainer is not fitting what so ever. The material doesn't really stretch at all for me even though I don't need it to. The waist trainer doesn't;t hold in the right areas of my thighs to shape my thighs or butt and it can't get tight enough around my stomach area. The trainer has so much space from my skin even when I pulled it the tightest as you can see in my photos.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this waist trainer unless you maybe get a size that might fit you. [SEP] The waist and tide trainer fits really well. It was easy to put on. It is great to use when you're doing squat. It really helps you sweat in the areas that you really wanna sweat. You will be sweating all over your lower stomach and also your thighs. [SEP] It took me a few minutes to figure out how to put it on but it covers everything and the velcro has a great grip so you don't have to worry about it coming loose during workouts [SEP] It was not true to size I was very excited to receive this item and that quickly turned into disappointment. [SEP] The reason I gave this product a 4 star is because is a bit uncomfortable and when you put it on your self you can‚Äôt move well you feel stiff maybe after using it a couple of times it will feel better . [SEP] Not going to lie, when I first opened this trainer I thought they sent me the wrong thing because it looked like there was no way this would fit on my body like it was advertised. But after I took the time to carefully wrap it around my thighs and butt, it started to make sense. It does feel like the Velcro will hold up through exercise, and since I'm not rigorously working out, I think the material will hold up just nicely.",3,True
Konssy 15 PCS Chokers Set Black Choker Necklaces for Women Teen Girls Gothic Collar Lace Velvet Chockers,[],[],,4.2,1222,6101,"My girlfriend loved them and nice variety of styles [SEP] This KONSSY Chocker set interested me, since summer wear means lower neck styles, I could use some of them.  The set show 15 different styles of chockers and all are of black velvet design with metal ornaments as decorations.  I have one other chocker necklace but of brown beads so having these black ones should update some of my outfits.  These black-velvet chockers are more formal so not useful for sporting events such as golf outings.  Would work for yoga classes or other meetings you attend.  They are adjustable as a small length of chain in back will give you a good comfortable fit.<br /><br />All of these KONSSY Chockers come with a spring opening clasp to hook onto the chain from opposite side.  This is my only objection as many of us of the older generations our fingers are not as nimble as before.  We find it difficult to open the clasp with one hand and hook the other chain with the other hand.  For me it was a stretch and fumble around to get it hooked for these pitchers.  It was another stretch to unhook it to try another.  I know it is more expensive to try the magnetic clasps but we older generations still love to look nice so we will struggle on.  Thanks, KONSSY for making this set of attractive black velvet chockers. [SEP] This was well worth the money. You get a bunch of cute chokers and they are pretty well made considering it was only like 6 or 7 bucks [SEP] good variety of chokers, very cute. but the clasp comes off after a day on almost all of them.

The only reason why I would not give as a gift because of how it's cheaply made. I like some of the necklaces but not all. I prefer a more sturdy type of choker. These chokers are more like for an special occasion but not everyday use.

Orchid Row Women's Fall Winter Chic Fashion and Trendy Faux Fur Earmuff Premium Fur Quality,[],[],,3.9,28,183,"These aren't very good quality for the price.  For $25, I would expect a softer feeling fur.  The fur is a bit on the long, silky side, but not very plush. Warmth is ok, not as good as it could be. [SEP] I love the variegated color and the soft feel of the faux fur against my ears. I wore them last night and they kept my ears warm in the cold.<br /><br />However, these ear muffs suffer from the same problem as most of my ear muffs . If my hood or coat collar hits into them, they will move around or pop off my head. The only muffs that stay put are the cheap ones whose ear ""buds"" fold in on themselves. Even my expensive UGG muffs have this issue, because like these, there is no flex built in for movement.<br /><br />The faux fur did shed a bit at the beginning but now that has stopped. I believe that is probably due to ""wayward hairs"" left over from the manufacturing process.<br /><br />Overall, I really love these. One other positive is that they do not give me a headache. Some other muffs squeeze my brain so tight, that I get head pain. I do feel the current price of $25.95 is about $6 too much for these, however. The only reason I took off one star is because of both the price and the fact that there is no movement in the ear piece or headband--but then again that is typical of most muffs.<br /><br />- Body is 94% polyester and 6% spandex.<br />- Faux Fur is 84% moda acrylic and 16% polyester<br />- Filling is 100% polyester<br /><br />UPDATE Jan 10, 2019 - I also ordered this in the [[ASIN:B07HKSBNCF gray]], which looks like a variegated brown. It is just as nice as the other ones, except the pair I received is a bit tighter around my head and the end of the muff comes right to the end of my ears. Since these are not adjustable, I would expect some people with big or tall heads to have a problem with these muffs not covering their ears. [SEP] These are really fun ear muffs. They are fuzzy and purple. My tween thinks they are awesome. They more sit on top of the ears than cover them, but it isn‚Äôt uncomfortable. [SEP] Pretty colors and well made.  They keep your ears adequately warm but do not pull down far enough to cover my ears.  They are not at all adjustable.  Marked down for that.<br />Very fashionable and cute on a younger woman.  I am 70 years old and just plain look silly. [SEP] I don't think I have an overly large head - so I'm guessing these are meant for kids. My daughter was able to get them to fit on her ears properly, but not me - they barely made it over my head to both ears, and they're not adjustable. So they're hers now. Otherwise, super-cute, fluffy, pretty colors. But not, I think, meant for adult heads. [SEP] I purchased these as a gift for my mother who has advanced Alzheimer‚Äôs. She loves purple, and things with a soft texture such as these are intriguing to this patient population. They are nice looking and seemingly well-made. [SEP] If you want something out of the ordinary to keep your ears warm, these are just the ticket. Versatile colors match any outfit; they stay in place easily instead of sliding off. Very comfortable. [SEP] Right out of the package, the two girls were fighting over this cute pair of earmuffs.  I think they are a bit on the pricey side, but they do appear more stylist than most generic earmuffs, so that's to be expected probably.  The colors are fun and most importantly, they do work.  They definitely do run a bit small, so they're ideal for kids and tweens. [SEP] I absolutely love these I practically sleep with them on. The are so comfy and beautiful. [SEP] Earmuffs do the trick at keeping your ears warm, but the fuzz did cause my earlobes to itch after wearing for 5 minutes.",3,True

The buttons are shaped like hearts (not on all of them, so look close at what you are ordering) and they are SO DANG CUTE. I washed it in cold and put it in the dryer on delicate dewrinkle and it didn't shrink or lose color.  I did not wash the belt, and do not plan to, because they tend to fold and wrinkle weird and I hate to iron. Lol.  it is extremely flattering.  The belt can be worn to the front, to the back (which is cuter I think) or not at all.  It falls just below the knee.  The sleeves are capped but are not restricting to my linebacker sized shoulders.  I would highly recommend this dress. [SEP] Beautiful!! Color is gorgeous and fit as expected... [SEP] perfect",3,True

I couldn't even bring myself to take a pic in it.:(...overall, it just wasn't for me. [SEP] This arrived today after being ordered sometime ago. If you are wanting quick shipping this isn't going to happen, not unless you pay for it. It was nicely packaged and neatly folded in the packaging. Upon opening it, the product is nice and soft and more thin fabric than one might think, but not see through. It is also very black and not a faded black color. The seams are all straight and it is well made. I cannot seem to find a tag for how to wash it safely, so either it's an oversight or the company doesn't put one in it. I washed mine on delicate so I suggest that putting it on a gentle cycle would be the best thing to do. It comes with a belt that at first glance looks huge, but once I put it on it was perfect with plenty of options to fit people at several different sizes. I really like this pant suit, I have never had one before. The only thing I wish was different, is that it the legs are incredibly long, it fits the way it is supposed to but the length is insanely long. I am not sure if heels would help or if I am going to have to have that fixed. Either way, I am very pleased with this product and it is very nice.<br /><br />I am blessed to have received this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.
