User Reviews:
VERANDA reigns along with the other three most beautiful and stylish U.S. shelter magazines today: Architectural Digest, Elle Decor and House Beautiful. What I like about VERANDA is the photography and rooms dominate and the text takes a supporting role.  The magazine features many full-page and double-page spreads of gorgeous rooms with not a lot of text interrupting.  Design is one of the fields in which you can learn by just studying a room in detail to get a sense of the scale, proportion, balance of texture and light and shadow etc.<br /><br />You are training your eye in what the best designers find beautiful.  A full and double-page spread allows you to do that better than smaller, choppier photos. It's great to have more visual, less words in which the rooms triumph. More to see--less to read. There's enough text in VERANDA to get into the designers'/homeowners' minds. VERANDA'S lush heavy paper stock is a joy, too, and increases the aesthetic experience.  The photos of the rooms look spectacular on it.<br /><br />VERANDA features eclectic styles and locations.  This month, for example, the magazine showcases a townhouse in Georgetown, a Park Avenue apartment, a Parisian pied-a-terre, a Florida ocean-front home and a Normandy-inspired Atlanta home along with a Cotswold garden. There's a mix of styles from Provencal antiques to Art Deco to a soft, tailored modern. It's a monthly infusion of visual beauty and grace. (As an aside: I love buying my shelter magazines through Amazon as I've been able to get great subscription prices and track my subscriptions so I don't miss a single issue, which is helpful when you subscribe to lots of magazines.)<br /><br />Under new editor Dara Caponigro's vision, VERANDA magazine sings and soars. [SEP] enjoying reading [SEP] I enjoy the high quality paper and illustrations in Veranda. [SEP] I ordered this magazine be cause the price through Amazon was so low.  I will enjoy it for the years subscription I took out and then decide if I want to renew it. [SEP] Terrific magazine! [SEP] Great pricing through Amazon!!!!! [SEP] bought this magazine as part of a bundle with two others.  i'm embarrased by the amount of paper i'm wasting.  you see more photos of interiors in the ads then in the articles.  5 minutes on the web and you'll see far more ideas then a years subscription to all three. [SEP] Pictures seem data.  Nothing but jewelry advertising.  No new ideas.  When I can finally afford magazine, I will not be renewing.

84,"Title: Interview Magazine    Print Magazine

User Reviews:
Interview is definitely a different type of magazine for me- someone who usually reads business and travel mags- and it's not quite what I expected. With a title like ""Interview"" I read my first copy of this magazine anticipating pages and pages of nothing but interviews. It turns out that interviewing is the main focus of the magazine, but it's not the only one. There is substantial space given to fashion, movies, and other areas, too. Some of these columns are worth an occasional look, but they failed to grab my attention. The writers seem to play it safe, and that includes the interview section. They don't ask many daring or controversial questions. They keep it simple, asking questions about an entertainer's latest album or movie, without delving much into their personal lives.<br /><br />Interview has many general annoyances. My greatest complaint is the advertising and the arrangement of the contents. About half of the pages in each issue are covered with ads, with fashion, liquor, beer, and hair care items providing the bulk of the advertising revenue. The ads are everywhere, with the majority in the front pages of each issue. The table of contents is buried, and I find this very frustrating. The contents starts with the interviews for that specific issue on one page, then a few pages later, proceeds to the remainder of the contents, which is the regular monthly features. What's annoying is that you have to search for the table of contents. It varies from one issue to the next, falling somewhere in the first half.<br /><br />Interview also varies greatly in length. Some issues are as short as 80 pages while others are more than 200 pages long. The shorter issues use staples for binding while the longer issues are bound in a more professional way, minus any metal.<br /><br />This magazine centers on entertainers, fashion, music, and the like. You won't find any interviews with politicians, businessmen, etc. Interview sticks strictly to entertainers, and that includes the regular monthly columns. You won't find a column about the business side of the music industry or film industry. You will find only articles about the stars themselves.<br /><br />Interview's only saving grace is the photography. It would make a nice gift for those who enjoy fashion and who like looking at pages and pages of men and women modeling fancy clothing. But in many ways, the photos are overemphasized and there isn't enough substance to the magazine. The articles are very shallow with more eye candy than reading material.<br /><br />Overall, Interview is sloppy and cluttered with too many ads to make it worthwhile reading material. My subscription was free, and I'm thankful that it was. Besides a few nice photos for clothing, there isn't much to make this magazine worth the cost. [SEP] Bottom-Line: I subscribe to ""Interview Magazine"" but I will not be renewing my subscription.<br /><br />I have been making a conscience effort of late to expand my horizons, to get out of (magazine reading) comfort zone.  To that end I have cast my reading net out from the usual news rag, and started reading a new diverse set of magazines, including Esquire, Ebony, Business Week, US, People, Popular Science, Jet, Car & Driver, Essence, Laptop Magazine, Travel & Leisure, Cooks, and ""Interview Magazine"", just to name a few.<br /><br />For a person like me who usually frequents the aforementioned news magazines, ""Interview Magazine"" is like a culture shock.  First off the magazine is large; larger in fact than any magazine you might find on the newsstand or in the local chain book store with the exception of Rolling Stone.  Second the magazine is printed on thick paper stock, which has a gritty feel to it; say good-bye to glossy and hello to matte and muted colors.<br /><br />""Interview Magazine"" features advertisements, wall to wall advertisements; the interviews with up-and-coming and established celebrities interspersed throughout the pages of the magazine seem almost coincidental.  I am currently reading the April 2007 issue, with a large inviting picture of Liv Tyler on the front cover.  To the magazines credit it does try and cover the full spectrum of entertainment from fashion to music, from art to the movies and places in between.<br /><br />Most of the interviews--especially those done on up-and-coming stars and starlet's--are mere snapshots of the persons personal and or professional life; there is little sink my proverbial intellectual, or even mildly interested teeth into.  There is just enough there to try and goad me into find out more.  The in-depth interviews are a lot more fulfilling; most of these are done by other celebrities; for instance in this issue Rose McGowan is interviewed by Quentin Tarantino, and Liza Minnelli interviewed musician Gerald Way.  Past issue have followed this same formula, with mostly good results, meaning I have enjoyed the interviews and images.<br /><br />But the one huge downside to ""Interview Magazine"" is its slavish devotion to advertising.  In fact the first 50 pages of this issue are devoted to wall-to-wall cutting edge, youth-inspired clothing and fragrance advertising.  The masthead of the magazine is stuck somewhere with this advertising soup, but the table of contents did not show up until one third of the magazine was leafed through--very annoying!  Not only that, but every celebrity image was accompanied by a solid paragraph on who made what they were wearing, who styled their hair, who did their make-up, and incredibly, what fragrance they happened to be wearing during the shoot!<br /><br />Is this an example of advertising run amok, or am I being far too sensitive and demanding in wanting ""Interview Magazine"" to at least be a magazine and not a run-on poster board for the chic and impossibly unfettered youth of America (New York City) and Europe is wearing?  But so many magazines follow this advertisement-on-every-page formula; is this the new norm, and should I get used to it?<br /><br />I could in ""Interview Magazine's"" case if most of the writing were not so rushed and devoid of substance.  This is something I alluded to above; sound-bites have their place, but not inside the covers of a magazine name ""Interview Magazine"", where I at least expect to learn something more about an artist than where they were discovered, their age, or how often they frequent Starbucks.  It's called substance and ""Interview Magazine"" just doesn't have enough to justify its larger than life existence.<br /><br />I subscribe to ""Interview Magazine"" but I will not be renewing my subscription; in this case my bid to broaden my horizons found a mostly vapid landscape full of wasted paper, muted colors, and questionable prose. [SEP] I dig Interview ok, what makes them good is that they don't try to be other magazines. Interview is pretty much a vehicle for glossy, high value haute couture advertisement, and each issue usually has several interview of well known or up and coming artists or musicians or actors, the catch is that they go get some other, non-journalistic similarly well known celebrity to do the interviewing.<br /><br /> Interview is well done -- the photographs are eyecatching. Some of the features are a bit like 'look at all the cool parties we went to this month' and others are 'look at all these beautiful people' but it works because the magazine has good design and execution and it manages to be arty without being flaky.  Sometimes the interviews are a bit wooden, as you'd expect from non-interviewers doing interviews, but it's redeemed by others where the interplay is fun and witty.  Also, it's funny to see an actor interview another actor, because they both often end up talking about themselves as much as the other. [SEP] No contact information to unsubscribe. What's with this magazine? [SEP] If you love in-depth interviews with the biggest stars, look no further. Interview Magazine does have a little bit of a European slant to it but I tend to think that the best cinema in the world is coming from the UK and Australia and that Hollywood has fallen woefully behind. The magazine also includes very artistic photos and much more. [SEP] I have been sucked in to getting this magazine twice for subscriptions simply because it was so cheap. Both times I found it to be just awful. If I found one interview in it that I was interested in it was lucky. And then the concept of having a famous person interview another famous person? Well that sounds like a novel concept but it usually really stinks and the interviews and interviewer prove to be inept. I gave it a second chance and it still does nothing for me. They will not get a third chance once this subscription runs out. [SEP] Nice mag.  Hadn't picked it up for a while<br />Nice pics, decent articles.  Worth giving a look to. [SEP] how can i contact this magazine? need to know which magazine i m getting. that's the only thing bad i found out. [SEP] OK. For those of you who continue to believe that New York is the center of the United States, Hell, the world, who forgot the map CNN kept flashing with the two different colors after the election that MIGHT infer there are several schools of thought about the polycentric views of the US, for those of you who can take a little criticism from the midwest, the dark states, middle earth, the Elba of the 21st century, you're not.<br /><br />There's a whole world out here. People have jobs. Yes, it's true. We work, send our kids to school, even go to church on Sundays. And on other days too. We vote. Oh, yeah, you already know that.<br /><br />So having an interview with an actor who goes on about how he meditates, is a vegan and thinks about trees and birds when he has a particularly stressful scene with Ashley or Uma or Diane, you know, it just doesn't carry a lot of weight with the serfs. But . . . .<br /><br />It's a great magazine. Andy lives. Photography is tight and realistic. The ads are sexy and provocative. The sidebars interesting and insightful. It's wordly. It covers music as well as RS. It's (don't get all riled up now) a fun magazine to read.<br /><br />However, the interviews which we are led to believe are the heart and soul of the magazine, seem to be along the lines of 'damn, it's so good to be me and I guess you're OK too.' Or, 'I see you're wearing a $15,000 Versace with a plunging neckline and . . . you've selected old, black, Converse All Stars to wear with it! How Noveau! How tasteful!'<br /><br />Come on. Where's the bite? Where's the interview with Alex Rodriguez that says 'how come you went to therapy . . . it's only New York?' or with Marv Alpert 'hey what's on your fashion agenda now?'<br /><br />Chris Berman from ESPN says he was on Maui a couple of years back and he was walking with his kids one dawn and he ran into Steven Stills with his kids. Now that's a conversation I would have liked to hear, not one that ends up with me thinking the two parties to the conversation (it sure isn't an interview - see Columbia University's Interviewing 101 in their School of Journalism) are off to pick out furniture.<br /><br />It's New York. Show your teeth. Flex. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury [SEP] My wife got a free subscription to Interview by using some Coke Rewards. I've never read anything so stupid in all my life. It's nothing but a bunch of full page ads and self indulgent drivel. Not a single ounce of substance. Who reads this junk...how could they possibly have been around for 40 years??  Then I read that Warhol started it and suddenly it all made sense. Anyone who thinks Andy Warhol actually contributed anything meaningful to...anything ...probably thinks this is better than the bible...

Good recipes. Good workouts [SEP] All Ads<br />Don't waste you money [SEP] Great magazine [SEP] I thought I was subscribing to SELF magazine. Then I found out SELF has been out of circulation since 2016. I still kept this subscription. Self-care is a must-do now.

enjoy all the recipes [SEP] stop auto billing!!!!  I don't want the stupid magazine anymore!!!!! [SEP] I used to be a huge fan of all you and have been a subscriber for about two years. At first the content was valuable, websites for saving money, energy tips, etc. but for the past year I have been really disappointed. The magazine has changed in that there are fewer coupons than their used to be, and several of the coupons are not for items that I need. The primary reason for subscribing to this magazine was for the money saving tips... not the silly fashion advice. After reading these lame articles, I often feel like I could have written something better myself. My mother and sister also subscribed but they too will be ending their subscriptions. Was a great magazine for individuals trying to save a bunch of money but... no more. Don't waste your money. Just one less thing to clutter the mailbox!! [SEP] Love it! [SEP] I found All You magazine to just be ok this last year. I think it used to issue better coupons, although there still are some good ones! But... not enough. I find that I don't use the coupons in the magazine as much so I will probably stop my subscription. Although the articles are good, I find that the pay out isn't worth it for me anymore. It works great for some, but not for all! [SEP] I love this magazine. [SEP] I like this magazine a lot, mostly for all the coupons but also for recipes. What I do not like is the ""automatic renewal"" feature tacked onto the 3 month trial subscription. After waiting many weeks after entering my trial subscription, I received just ONE trial issue before being automatically charged for a full year's renewal. I've been sharing a co-workers copy of this magazine for quite a while, so I intended to renew the subscription anyway - but I would have preferred to make that decision for myself AFTER I'd received my three trial issues. That gripe aside, this is a very useful magazine which really does pay for itself if you use the coupons - which are usually fairly high-dollar value on name brand products a person actually would want to buy! I like that the coupons are often tied to featured recipe ingredients as well. [SEP] Great magazine filled with tons of recipes and lots of tips and tricks. It used to have far more coupons and the lack thereof is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. [SEP] While I really enjoy the print version of &#34;All You&#34; I am disappointed with the Kindle version.  After 10 minutes only 2 pages had downloaded. This is ridiculous. I won't be subscribing to anymore digital magazines. [SEP] A practical magazine full of good info, coupons and recipes. When I first picked up a copy I thought the recipes and articules would suck because the magazine is so cheap, but not so! The recipes were great, the coupons were for stuff I actually used and the articles weren't boring. I'll definitely become a subscriber, but not through amazon.

User Reviews:
I bought one Prevention magazine at the grocery store and loved the info that it contained, so I ordered a subscription.  It said that it would take 6-10 weeks to arrive so I bought the next month's magazine at the grocery store.  The subscription arrived the same week!!  The second magazine did not hit home with me as much as the first month, but that is to be expected.  I'm looking forward to next month's.  It's material is not life changing for me, but it gives me ideas on how to tweak my diet and exercise/lifstyle.  I enjoy the magazine.  I would order it again. [SEP] I realize every publication has to depend on advertising as well as subscribers to suceed, but Prevention Magazine just has too much advertising. I buy a magazine to read the content, not to get ads stuffed down my throat.<br /><br />  I feel like others that the magazine has changed since I used to read my moms' subscription.<br /><br />  The Jan. 2009 issue has the following: a 24 pg. insert trying to SELL a book, ads for Welches - 2 pg spread, Fruit of the Loom - 1 pg, Chevy - 1 pg, GNC - 1 pg, Robitussin - 1 pg, Alli - 1 pg, (I'm up to only pg. 8), Nature's Path - 1 pg, NyQuil - 1 pg, Spot Shot - a 2 pg spread, Zetia - 4 pg spread,  One Touch - 2 pg spread, Splenda - 1 pg, Walmart - 1 pg, Mucinex - 1 pg, Restasis - 2 pg spread, Vicks - 1 pg, Nature's Bounty- 1 pg, truvia - 1 pg, Weight Watchers - spread over 3 pages, Imodium - 1 pg, Spiriva - 4 pg spread, Campbell's - 1 pg, Lipton - 1 pg, Morningstar - 1 pg, another Campbell's -1 pg., Healthy Ones - 1 pg, pg. 78 has 6 ads on one page, AARP - 1 pg, Blue Diamond - 1 pg, Enablex - 4 pg spread.....must I go on only at pg.102 our of 165 pg. magazine?  I think you get the idea. If I counted correctly, 45 of the first 102 pages are ads leaving just 57 pages to read. I didn't include the 24 page insert nor the FULL page Prevention ads. If I included their own ads, the ratio would come closer to 50% advertising!<br /><br />  I gave this a 3 month chance and cancelled today! [SEP] Prevention is not as good as it used to be. The new version is watered down. It's like reading Good Housekeeping. Shallow. [SEP] One of my favorite subscription. Too bad they don't have it in free magazine subscription online. I use to read this at my high school library. [SEP] Very informative [SEP] I've been receiving prevention magazine for years even after being scammed ,I moved at one point ,forgettig subscription I started getting demand for payments on a magazine I had not been receiving and was reordered without my know leg .further more NEVER order a book as you will get taken for a lot of money on any of there books the 30day to see ,well if you return the book your looking for at least spending 30 ,so much for a free look.  As for the last person I agree ,every month it is the same thing new? Diets ,not much of real value anymore also stoked with questiol advertisement for items defiantly not heathy [SEP] There are more ads than articles in Prevention, and the few articles are either only a couple of paragraphs long and/or are pushing you to buy some other Prevention product.  It's a total waste of money.  Even worse, the customer service is beyond belief.  The customer service website is nonfunctional--after a few failed attempts to log in, it will refer you to their 800 number.  Once you call the 800 number, good luck getting a human being.  Attempts to cancel my subscription have gone unacknowledged, and I keep getting bills. [SEP] I enjoy a lot of the tips in this easy to read magazine.  They usually have an insert, which is one big ad booklet for the product they focus on for that month (I guess that's why the subscription rate is low).  Only con is that there are way too many ads. I second guess a lot of the information assuming that they are pushing advertiser's products but I've also learned a lot that has kept me healthier.  Not a wasted read. [SEP] Although I've paid for this magazine, it has yet to arrive so it's difficult to evaluate.  I've read Prevention magazine before and think I'll like this book but....I need to have it physically arrive before I can read it! [SEP] I received a free yearly subscription after enjoying Stonyfield Farms yogurt. I found absolutely no content worthy of reading. 75% of the tiny magazine was ads for medications, which I live a much more natural lifestyle than that. This magazine was not for me. I'll stick to my Women's Health Magazine!","Prevention Print Magazine offers a mix of informative content aimed at providing readers with ideas to improve their diet, exercise, and lifestyle.

I purchased a one year subscription on Amazon after Christmas (around Dec 29) for $5 for the entire year.  I enjoyed reading the magazine....mostly fashion tips and style tips...clothing, purses, accessories, etc.  but will not be renewing it at the suggested renewal cost.  I would renew it for $5 but will probably stick with Real Simple, which is more my style. [SEP] I love this magazine! I love how you can find the clothes in stores that I can find locally. The clothes also range in price so everyone can find something in their price range. It's full of great current fashions and so many choices! [SEP] Wonderful. [SEP] This is a good magazine, the price is right and it gives you a lot to look at. It really is all about style and clothing so there is more to look at than to read but the style diva in your life would love this. [SEP] Better for younger women [SEP] This magazine is nothing but page after page of ads for overpriced clothes and accessories. I learn nothing, I am not inspired. Its a waste of money [SEP] This offer beat what the magazine's publisher's best offer. If you like this magazine, why pay more than you have to? Good-o for Amazon! [SEP] Dumb, Dumb, Dumb. Unless you are strictly into what people are wearing, you wont find this magazine interesting. Cancelled after receiving 1st issue. [SEP] StyleWatch tries REALLY hard to sound trendy and of the moment but fails- If you are looking for something similar to InStyle, this is not for you; Better targeted to the preteen reader of Seventeen. Fashion focuses on teen and plus- nothing for a stylish 20-40 year old demographic unless they are plus sized.

Too expensive for my taste! [SEP] I got this as a gift 2yrs ago & I found myself looking for it in the mailbox. Although my home will never be so nice lol, a girl can dream right? I find it to be relaxing & mesmerizing eye candy. I love all the ideas, colors, textures. I got DECOR ... YUCK!! It is like a cheap wanna be version of H.B. to me. So glad to have again is all I can say. [SEP] Great magazine [SEP] ---If you found this review helpful, please click ""Helpful""---<br /><br />INSIDER SECRET: Don't pay full price for this. You can get magazine subscriptions for super cheap with Amazon on their ""daily deals"" they rotate the featured magazines daily but it will be back on there in a few days. You need to go back into your subscriptions and click ""Do not Autorenew"" OR ELSE it will renew it whenever it runs out automatically for whatever the price shown is, not the ""daily deal"" (AKA dirt cheap) price. Enjoy your new magazines :-)<br /><br />For more Amazon reviews, follow @CassandraMercedes on Instagram [SEP] Helpful. [SEP] Didn't order this,  charged anyway.

User Reviews:
Backpacker is an outstanding magazine for those who love to hike and also for those who enjoy paging through a magazine containing lots of enticing photographs of nature scenes. This magazine is, first and foremost, a publication for lovers of the outdoors and the sport of backpacking. But the pictures of mountains, lakes, streams, wildlife, etc., are enticing to anyone. They can quickly convert the non- outdoorsman type into a nature lover.<br />Besides the great pictures, Backpacker is also excellent for its product testing and for its advice and educational material. Backpacks, mountain bikes, tents, and so forth might seem like simple products, but you would be surprised at how many different varieties and options are available for this type of merchandise. Backpacker describes different items available for sale, complete with web site address and phone# so you can make a purchase, and it often conducts tests to see how the different products stack up. It also offers educational material on the sport of backpacking and general advice on such topics as food, exercise, proper nutrition, first aid, etc.<br />Backpacker averages between 90 and 120 pages in total length and it's published 9 times per year (three of the issues combine two months into one). It's one of the few special interest magazines I have read that has something to offer most anyone. Even if you don't like hiking, there is still a good chance you will enjoy thumbing through the pages of Backpacker, if nothing else, just to enjoy the great photography.<br />Overall, this is an outstanding outdoor publication. The articles, the personal stories, the advice, the photos, and the educational material all add up to a perfect magazine for anyone who loves to partake in outdoor activity or who just enjoys looking at the stunning photos. 5+ stars to Backpacker! [SEP] I had a subscription to this magazine a few years ago. I let my sub run out because the magazine was not that good.<br />I decided to give it another try and see if this magazine had improved. Nope, still the same old magazine.<br />The gear reviews always seem to review the high end gear that only a small percentage of people can afford.<br /><br /> The articles are usually about hiking trails that are the top tier trails. PCT, AT, CDT, etc. How about some trails that are in different states that do not take MONTHS to finish! Some nice weekend trails would be awesome!! Seems like this magazine has always been biased towards the west coast. You know, there are many, many other trails in the US, across all 50 States!! Not just CA!<br /><br />So, looks like this sub will be just like the first time I subbed. Going to let it expire. I can find better content on youtube anyways! [SEP] 10 Magazines a year.  Less than other subscriptions I have but more informative than most.  Great pics of the destinations and even better maps/guides of the areas.  Definitely a subscription I'm gonna keep. [SEP] Love this magazine - read it cover to cover [SEP] This magazine is pretty much a giant advertisement for equipment and vacations most people cannot afford. There is little if any useful information on actual backpacking. If you want to read a bunch of reviews of expensive gear and poorly written stories about other people's vacations then this is the magazine for you. [SEP] The gear reviews are why I buy this magazine. Gear is expensive. I'm appreciative of the advice from folks that have tried it. Well, that and the daydream factor. You know, the &#34;someday I will hike there&#34; inspiration. The subscription started arriving very quickly... nice. [SEP] I enjoy the magazine and it provides information for hikers and backpackers of all experience levels.  I like the regional sections and the gear reviews.  There are not many magazine options in this genre, and I feel this one offers the most information that will appeal to the most people. [SEP] The information about gear alone has more  payed for magazine by avoiding purchasing blunders. [SEP] i have been getting backpacker for many years. i love the information and details on specific hikes. great food ideas as well as training.i recently hike down to phantom ranch and back @ the grand canyon. i used many of the training tips this magazine provided. i will continue to subscribe as long as info stays so positive.

User Reviews:
This is what SciAM used to be. Sigma Xi is the publisher. Here, the society remains loyal to the scientific reader. The first copy I received turned into a cover to cover read.<br /><br />Four specific `things I learned' in my first copy included:<br /><br />1. Only in 2011 have arctic glaciers receded to the 1300AD, pre Little Ice Age extant based on carbon dating newly exposed flora. The LIA may be finally over, 160 later than previously believed. The cause of the LIA is hypothesized on 4 nearly simultaneous volcanic eruptions.<br /><br />2. The human eye's white sclera and small iris are unique in nature allowing the ability to discern and communicate `gaze'. It is hypothesized that this ability to discern visual direction permitted the domestication of dogs. H.nea did not domestic dogs in the same period. Dog domestication may have been a critical factor in H.sap's success.<br /><br />3. Civilization's development of `cities' has been pushed back 5,000 years based on Jordanian excavations to 20,000 years ago.<br /><br />4. The soap-bubble analog computer reveals a previously unknown form of crystal symmetry new to both mathematics and science.<br /><br />If I can glean 4 new specifics to think about between mag editions, I'm happy.<br /><br />Thank you previous Amazon reviewers! It was your reviews that prompted me to exit SciAM [SEP] A way better publication for science geeks than SciAm or Discovery or Popular Science...up there with Nature and the other big gun magazines.  The print editions are way better than the e-versions for old guys like me, young people may think otherwise, their techno-competence notwithstanding. [SEP] I subscribed to this magazine and several other well known scientific publications at the same time. This was by far the best. I love it. [SEP] Awesome [SEP] There are or have been a fair number of ‘science’ magazines — magazines devoted to general science and technology, written for an audience most of whom will not have an expert background in most of the major fields covered.  Unfortunately, most of them are written not so much to convey some understanding of their ostensible topics as to give the reader the impression that he or she has been informed. (In high school, we called essays and papers written that way ‘B.S.’)<br /><br />American Scientist (not to be confused with Scientific American) is one of the exceptions.  It began and remains a house organ of Sigma Xi (a society of scientists and engineers), and is written as if on the assumption that the readership has a strong background in some science, if not necessarily in the specific science of a given article. (You can sample some of the articles by going to www.americanscientist.org .)<br /><br />One deficiency that this magazine shares with every other general magazine that I have read is that, when the relationship of science or technology to social policy is discussed, the authors usually make unquestioned technocratic assumptions of one sort or of another (presuming that administrated solutions will necessarily be at least as good and usually better than those of any other sort), and are also inclined to insist (as if it is just obvious to all Right-Thinking people) that the marginal value of satisfying scientific curiosity outweighs that of rival concerns. [SEP] We've lost another one [SEP] Approximate ship date for first issue was 2 to 3 months out, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived just 1 month after placing order. After receiving this publication it was clear that the articles were written for individuals with an interest and a background in science. The articles aren't just a page with flashy pictures and a short write-up. All articles gave a brief synopsis of the technology and research behind the topics being discussed before diving into the details. I also subscribe to Popular Science, which pales in comparison to American Scientist. American Scientist gives readers realist applications for the topics covered and gives information sources after most articles.<br /><br />My only wish is that American Scientist was published every month, instead of bimonthly. But you can't have everything. [SEP] American Scientist is my science zine of choice. It is written to pull in all sciences in language that is understandable by my 9th graders. I love this zone so much! [SEP] Much better than Scientific American which I read for years. I quit when they started to editorialize their stories. If you want objective reporting of facts, this is your best bet unless you want peer review. [SEP] This bimonthly magazine contains science articles written by scientists for the scientifically literate reader (primarily other scientists).  W Boudville's review is, in my view, incorrect on most points.  His/her claim that the American Scientist is simply the American equivalent of Nature is totally wrong.  Nature is a peer-reviewed scientific journal that contains (tersely written) professional articles at the cutting edge of modern research.  The American Scientist contains articles that are written by scientists but for a much wider audience, it is certainly not meant to publish latest/greatest scientific results.  It is not a peer reviewed journal, and the articles are not research papers and are meant to be accessible to a wider audience. Virtually all areas of the natural and physical sciences are covered in this publication including physics, astrophysics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, geology, paleontology, psychology, neuro-chemistry and many others.  There are also occassionally contributions in the fields of enginerring and architecture as well.  This may sound like a real hodge-podge, but the articles are generally well written and informative.  There are typically 10 or so articles in each issue as well as 10-15 book reviews.  I've been a subscriber for 10+ years.  Some of the articles that have been most memorable include one on the complex chemistry of the iron in African rocks and how difficult it was for ancient Africans to smelt iron, a recent article on the complex geology of the Moon and what it tells us about it's formation and early evolution, and some surprising results about the Riemann Zeta function.  The level (and amount of technical detail) of the articles is well above Scientific American or Sky and Telescope for example, and it is typically assumed that the reader has at least a batchelor's degree in science or engineering.  If you are broadly interested in science and want to read a wide range of interesting, technical detailed articles, this is the magazine for you.","Title: American Scientist

User Reviews:
Lately it seems like Vogue has lost its premium quality. The paper is thinner and so are most of the issues, the editorials are less inviting and overwhelmed by the ads which can be printed on paper so thick it makes it hard to leaf through the magazine. And don't get me started on the vile mix of too many competing perfume samples! I don't like many scents and a number of them make me nauseous, so I pull the things out immediately and put them in the farthest-away-from-me recycling bin. Even so, the scents still linger in the paper, especially on the facing pages, so I have to wash my hands after touching the magazine--something that cuts deeply into my enjoyment of Vogue and other mags with perfume sample ads. What's still great are the personal experience essays. Vogue has always had the best writers and the most interesting takes. Some of the fashion pages are still gorgeous, though many seem like recycled versions with poses we've already seen other models do better, or photos where the clothes can't be seen in the landscape or lighting used. With the poses, I don't know if the fault is the model's, because she has a limited range of poses, expressions or emotions, or if the fault is the editor's for choosing clothes or photos that look alike, but there's a lot too much sameness to the magazine recently. I look back longingly at Grace Coddington's amazing 1920s shoot, or the Versailles spread with those incredible clothes and stunning model with her gift for inventive poses that still let us see what she's wearing, or the Alice in Wonderland shoot--all examples of the best fashion photography available--and I hope Vogue gets a renewed jolt of the creativity, craftsmanship and professional pride that has made it an exemplar. [SEP] Be careful.  My subscription was renewed without notice and when I tried to cancel it after the fact I was refused. [SEP] Great to see all the fascinating things designers create. Stay up to date on what is THE THING. [SEP] Happy to purchase the 1 year subscription for such a great price! Looking forward to my reading nook with my favorite magazine! Reading it online just doesn't have the same feel as a hard copy :) [SEP] Great read [SEP] Vogue is my go to magazine for fashion, meaningful articles for women, health news for women, beauty hints/secrets.

User Reviews:
I love the multiple stories and articles. [SEP] Still fun and informative [SEP] Been around forever the best! [SEP] I subscribed to Reader's Digest for a decade while living in Australia, so it was only natural to start up a subscription now I live in the US. I didn't think there would be any real difference in the magazine.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with this periodical. It still contains great stories, feature articles, good pictures and graphics, and the same standard regular contributions such as the humor section &#34;Laughter - the Best Medicine&#34; - all of which I enjoy very much.<br /><br />Unfortunately there are two areas I am disappointed with about this magazine. The first is the number of ads. Not only are there ads sprinkled liberally throughout the digest, but it also comes with several loose ads stuck in between the pages or included in the wrapping. I find this distracting and annoying.<br />The other thing that I have noticed that's different is the quality of the paper used in these Reader's Digest magazines. The paper seems a lot less durable and has a &#34;recycled&#34; feel to it. If that means more trees are saved and the paper is more eco-friendly, then I will support it. But if it is just cost cutting, then I am a bit disappointed in the quality.<br /><br />On a positive note, the digest is also available in digital form, which I find convenient - although I do like to curl up with the magazine in hand and have some quiet time away from the computer to just read :)<br /><br />All up, I do enjoy the content of the Reader's Digest (minus the ads) and I am glad I have a subscription to it so I am ensured of a regular good read! [SEP] Okay [SEP] I love the different stories, articles, jokes, tips and more in this magazine. There is a ton of stuff in each issue, although there are quite a few ads. I personally believe where the ads are is inconveniently placed as they break up articles, but at least Reader's Digest doesn't seem to be made up of at least half or more of ads. The price is reasonable and makes a wonderful gift [SEP] I liked that readers digest has small articles that work well for the hospital waiting room I work at. Not as good as it used to be.

157,"Title: Saveur    Print Magazine

User Reviews:
I enjoy this magazine because of the articles about families and their traditions. Some recent offerings were an article about a family who canned tomatoes for friends and family, and a heartwarming history of Thanksgiving for a family in California who combined foods of India with traditional American foods. What other magazines would have such articles? I study the sociology of food. How what we eat affects and is affected by our environment, religion, income, etc. The articles in Saveur invite you in and then delight, exceeding your expectations. [SEP] Saveur is a celebration of authentic cuisine with everything from Food Festivals to very easy-to-make recipes, like Blueberry Pudding. While there are a few book reviews for foodies to enjoy, the writing introduces cooks to international flavors and seasonal fare. Restaurants are also a feature as are gourmet cooking essentials.<br /><br />While reading you may discover a pastry shop or start to dream of making a recipe like Chicken Fried Steak. Yes, this very gourmet book has comfort food recipes as well as more complex recipes like the one for Olive Bread which actually only requires a minimum of bread making skills.<br /><br />After reading this magazine I'm normally in the mood to drizzle olive oil over just about anything I'm putting in the oven. The recipe for Stuffed Tomatoes and Summer Squash had me wishing it was October again and the recipe for Fig Jam reminded me of my childhood in Africa where we had a Fig Tree in the backyard.<br /><br />Saveur is filled with nostalgia, entertaining food adventures and delicious recipes. With Amazon's Gourmet food section, we can now find the ingredients to make many of the recipes in this magazine.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review [SEP] I bought this magazine several times at the store and then decided to buy a subscription.  I mailed my subscription check in mid-late-December and I had already bought the November and December magazines in the store; they promptly sent me November and December and I am waiting to see when they cancel my subscription ...<br /><br />If you like to travel this magazine is really for you, if you are like me and like to stay home and cook there is probably one recipe each issue that I am interested in.  There was a wonderful spatzle recipe and terrific canapes, a simple ""real alfredo"" but being that I live in rural America, many of their recipes don't use ingredients that I can readily buy and I am probably not going to, or at least have not, ordered away for ingredients that I might try using once, although they do have vendors who sell unusual ingredients listed.  I do appreciate interesting ideas for our family gatherings such as in the November 2008 issue they had recipes from Laos and had a recipe for a custard baked in a squash; I will try that this fall when I have so much winter squash I will be looking  for new interesting ways to use them ...<br /><br />One last bit that I like is the lay out of the magazine, they list all the recipes in the front and then in the back they list all the unusual ingredients and vendors in the ""Pantry"" and then they list the recipes again by category; that is nice when your preparing for a family gathering and you are in charge of appetizers or side dishes and you can just breeze through the back issues and find the recipes people might enjoy.<br /><br />I started writing this feeling cool on Saveur but I realize there is more in it than I might be appreciating.<br /><br />I did contact the magazine company and they did agree that they received my check in mid-December and that they sent me November and December after that. I explained that I had already bought those issues, and they agreed to give me 3 more months; I hate doing that because I know all paper businesses are hurting with readership down and the economy in the state that it is ... but I felt I needed to, to be satisfied with my subscription.<br /><br />October 2009 update: I had called them a couple months ago, they agreed to give me a full subscription, rather than counting the back-dated months that they sent upon arrival of my mid-December check; since then I did not receive October's issue and I received November's issue as a ""gift"" since they said my subscription ran out - I am too fed up to deal with them again and they have lost a customer.  Although the November issue had good Kimchee recipes ...<br /><br />November 2009 update: still no more issues - [SEP] I look forward to each new magazine. Unlike other cooking related magazines, this one takes you places. It mixes some of my favorite life experiences together. I get to learn about new people in new places centered around different cuisines. I enjoy creating some of the dishes in the articles. [SEP] I look forward to each new magazine.

I get to learn about new people in new places centered around different cuisines. I enjoy creating some of the dishes in the articles. [SEP] Saveur got a new Editor-in-Chief in 2006, when Colman Andrews (one of the original founding crew from the magazine's inception) stepped down after long-running battles with the new corporate ownership (World Publications out of Winter Park Florida.) Andrews was a curmudgeon, and a brilliant iconoclast.  For years, he refused to run an image of a turkey on the cover of the November issue, to the displeasure of the newsstand sales dept. He was replaced by James Oseland, a contributor and Associate Editor at the magazine (one of his first acts was to run a picture of a turkey on the cover of the November issue - get it?) Saveur has fallen on tough times. Since most ad budgets for the food category are gobbled up by Rachel Ray, Gourmet, BonAppetit, Food and Wine and the like, Saveur is left with table scraps, and issues are skinny. Photography and art direction have always been first rate, and Oseland builds on this tradition with his passion for food photos that border on pornography, they are so luscious) But a shift in focus from Andrews' euro-centric vision to Oseland's more pan-asian outlook (he is the author of an excellent book on Indonesian cuisine, ""Spice Islands"") leaves something in translation as these themes don't resonate as heartily with Saveur's core audience.  But he does seem to be attracting some younger, more urban readers. (Somehow, images of sweaty, grimy cooks behind-the-scene in a Bombay restaurant doesn't stir my soul for Indian food, though.) There is one bright spot - a greater focus on Asia has lightened up Saveur's previous artery-clogging fare. The editorial staff write for themselves mainly, so if you share their vision, then you'll love Saveur. (A special issue in 2007 was all about Chicago for instance, which happens to be Oseland's home town.) And other reviewers are spot-on about the recipes - if you don't live in NYC, you'll have trouble handily finding ingredients such as chicken feet, although they do reference websites for you to source things via mail-order. Wine coverage since Andrews left has been improving but still not back to where it should be - Oseland isn't a wine drinker, and wine stories compete for precious editorial space in these lean times for magazine advertising.  I give Saveur high marks for uniqueness.  If you do subscribe, broaden your palette and pair Saveur's mineral, flinty undertones with a more practical, off-dry recipe holder such as Bon Appetit, Southern Living, or even Everyday with Rachel Ray (especially if you are the type that likes to hit the ""Easy"" button!) [SEP] I've received Saveur for years and have gifted it to many friends and family!  Good recipes and how to instructions and great articles! [SEP] all ads [SEP] Great magazine. The recipes inside are doable for non gourmet cooks like myself, and I always learn about new food to try. [SEP] Excellent magazine for anyone interested in cooking.

User Reviews:
Men's Journal is a decent magazine full of varied topics of interest to men. This magazine covers areas like sports, adventure travel, fashion and style, cars and trucks, career issues, etc. This publication directs all of its articles toward men, with an emphasis on what is most appealing to males throughout a typical week in their lives.<br /><br />One thing about Men's Journal that is a little different from other men's magazines is that it doesn't flaunt women to sell its issues. In fact, there are practically no pictures of women at all in this publication- something that will be considered an asset to some, and a liability to others. This magazine refuses to play the female card and instead focuses its articles on topics that men like to read about.<br /><br />Men's Journal is often obsessed with lists, and I think this is especially true in the last few years. Take a look at the cover of most issues and you will see a large, boldface advertisement for some sort of list. In one issue, it might be a ranking of the best cities for entry level jobs. In another issue, it might be a listing of the best places for young entrepreneurs. Whatever it might be, Men's Journal seems to have an infatuation with lists, probably because men like lists and it helps increase sales.<br /><br />This magazine can be counted on to produce some fairly good reading, but I must warn that many of the articles are a little too simplistic, with little emphasis on intellectualism. Even the articles about politics and business are often riddled with obvious statements that most anyone would know. But overall, I still think Men's Journal is a good magazine. It is varied enough that most anyone will find something interesting to read and the price is very low. [SEP] Not just a &#34; sports &#34; magazine but a publication with great articles any man can appreciate. [SEP] I selected this mag for my husband through a free-subscription-with-purchase offer.  I actually snag it before he does when it arrives!  It's got a variety of articles about lots of different STUFF (gadgets, travel, food, etc.).  I've always been a bit of a trivia junkie, enjoying reading a little bit about a lot of different things, and this mag fits that mold.  It has a definite liberal bent politically, which might turn some people off, but that doesn't affect every article. [SEP] Missed 1st. issue but 2nd, was right on time. [SEP] Perfect for you man. lots of info and things to ponder about [SEP] awesome seller and great product. thank you [SEP] I like this magazine. Easy to read. A little too much of the &#34;jump off a cliff like these guys&#34; thing (too old for that nonsense and the editors need to get a grip on how many people are out there buying $400,000 Ford race cars) but a nice read. [SEP] Good magazine [SEP] I'll have to agree with the other reviewer that Men's Jounal may not be quite as good as it used to be. But it is still the best men's magazine around IMO. Flip through the other men's magazine fodder at the grocery store or your buddy's place, and save your money for a subscription to Men's Journal.

great [SEP] This is a review of the magazine and not the subscription through Amazon.<br /><br />Good Housekeeping, like many magazines if its ilk, makes its money on advertising.  Given that fact, many pages are nothing but either ads or infomercials.  Once past that, there really IS a good magazine hidden between those pages.<br /><br />I have been an on again and off again subscriber since the early 80s when I returned to the U.S. after a five year stint in the military living in Europe.  You might find it odd but this magazine helped with my transition to the land of consumerism and commercialism.<br /><br />Good Housekeeping keeps up with trends and ideas for the modern home.  From solar water systems to water heated floors, from pink rose pedals to rose hip tea, GH has been there.  Given the duration this magazine has been in operation, earning a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval is sometimea a boon to business and that push needed for national recognition.<br /><br />GH is NOT a controversial magazine.  The editors would probably have coronaries just at the thought of causing controversy.  This is an enjoyable read, cover to cover, once the advertising is overlooked.  But sometimes, that advertising is just what is needed.

Unfortunately, for my tastes and lifestyle (40s, married, business owner, no children). I think Redbook is trying to be too well-rounded. I used to love this magazine (especially back in HS and college), but now it seems like it trying to appeal to too many audiences at once...a few pages of Cosmo-style sex-related articles, a few pages of Women's World-style life-threatening articles, a few pages of Health- magazine ""you too can have abs of steel"" articles, and way too pages of Parent's Magazine-style articles. The only thing I found myself enjoying was the ""Most Embarrassing Moments"" feature. I think that a magazine with an article about ""Red Hot Sex Kissing Games"" a few pages away from an article about ""Kids Get Dry Skin Too"" is not focused enough. On top of this (and perhaps because of it), it seemed as though most of their articles only touched the surface of any one topic, -- all headlines and captions, no substance. I think Vanity Fair, Jane, or Marie Claire might be a better choice for those who want a more focused magazine that delves into its topics more thoroughly. [SEP] This magazine has improved greatly. In a time where other magazines have shrunk and contain mostly advertisement, Redbook has expanded it's content. A delight to read every month.

User Reviews:
This is one of my fitness magazines. Love the material and articles. Usually pick up some new tips. [SEP] What happened to Women's Health magazine?? I ordered a year subscription and literally every month is a scantily clad celebrity on the cover, and additional lingerie/ swimsuit type shots all through the interior. Minimal ""health"" information and what is presented is questionable. I have thrown several issues directly into the trash and will never purchase again. If you want to feel bad about your body, go ahead and get this crap. [SEP] I still haven’t received my first issueb😡 [SEP] Love it! [SEP] I received one copy in a year and now it is auto renewed. Trying to figure out his to cancel it. [SEP] I got my first issue last week after ordering it a month earlier, so it came right on time! It was a great issue and definitely made me happy that I ordered it. I just became a stay at home mom so this magazine is perfect when I have that precious &#34;me time&#34;. Yes, there are quite a few ads (but honestly, what magazine doesn't have them?!) but the articles are in depth and actually taught me a thing or two. Love this magazine and recommend it to everyone! :) [SEP] Good magazine for my customers [SEP] I've subscribed to this for several years, and I'm letting it drop.  It's definitely, or &#34;def&#34; in the magazine's language for 18 to maybe 40-year-old females.  It's heavy on celebrities and using abbreviated words such as &#34;sess&#34; for session and &#34;inspo&#34; for inspiration, etc.  Ugh.  Plus, there is HUGE product placement in the articles, and you'll see the same item in an ad in the same magazine.  There's a lot of information on clothing, makeup and hair.  Ugh. I get it - they call it &#34;Women's Health&#34; to encompass all of health, but with  fit looking people on the cover, I'm expecting it to be more about physical health.  Oh, well.  I'm not their target demographic.  I've kept the subscription because I can usually get something out of each issue.  It reminds me of SELF magazine, which recently stopped publishing. It's like Glamour with a heavier does of physical fitness added.  It's a Rodale publication, so Rodale books and DVDs are heavily promoted in each issue. [SEP] not what I thought [SEP] Not worth it, found better articles in other magazines that were more interesting and entertaining.","Title: Women's Health Print Magazine

User Reviews:
Popular Mechanics is a magazine dedicated to mechanics, repair, industry, and technology. This magazine offers timely articles that are often intelligent, thought- provoking, and often fascinating and/or awe- inspiring. They often talk about mechanical achievements, impressive technology, record- setting feats, etc. These articles show what humans are capable of doing and they remain in your memory for some time.<br /><br />These achievement- type articles are often the best in each issue, however, Popular Mechanics is more than just a magazine about incredible achievements. With Popular Mechanics, you get articles about cars, home improvement, repair, etc., which are more practical than anything. Car enthusiasts often enjoy Popular Mechanics more than anyone, due to the magazine's consistent articles on automobiles and reviews of automobiles. There are, in fact, multiple articles on automobiles and/or automotive technology in each issue and they are often among the lengthiest in the magazine.<br /><br />Besides cars, Popular Mechanics likes to devote space to the subject of home repair and improvement. These articles are nice because they offer practical advice that can help do- it- yourself readers save a good deal of cash. They are often educational in nature, too. How Your House Works, for example, is a subsection of the Home department and it describes in detail how a certain part of your home functions. It might sound boring at first, but it is often fascinating to learn what goes on behind the walls, under the foundation, inside the appliances, etc. Sometimes, the educational lesson is obvious but other times, the lessons learned are eye- opening and will expose homeowners to things about their home they never knew existed.<br /><br />Popular Mechanics is, overall, a very nice publication that I will continue to read. I like the articles that emphasize fascinating innovation and achievement best, but I can also agree that the home and automotive articles are very practical and useful. The over- emphasis on automobiles is a small complaint about Popular Mechanics, but the magazine as a whole is very good and very readable. [SEP] I've always enjoyed reading the articles and ads in popular mechanics.  The auto renewal and subscription method make this really easy to keep coming.  If you enjoy modern science and mechanical input, this is a great magazine for you. [SEP] Pop-Mech is the necessary bookend to Pop-Sci. Pop-Mech explores the hands on tech as it emerges. It's the tool and tech geek must have to consider the application of innovation to problems. The latest gizmos are dastardly creative! I've lost count of the stuff I've bought and tried over the years after seeing them here first. [SEP] This magazine has articles covering a variety of topics from weather to airplanes and cars. There is something in each magazine that will appeal to both the adults and the teens in your family. The price is right so it's a great item for yourself or a gift. [SEP] Great to deal with a great product! [SEP] Gift [SEP] I've been reading this since I was about 12 years old. It is still interesting. Good articles. Interesting facts. [SEP] This magazine is getting more and more simple with more and more advertising. I'd say 60% of the pages are advertising, if not more.<br /><br />I especially dislike their new 'articles' which highlight a person or company while filling the text and images with product placement, complete with info on what each person is wearing.<br /><br />What galls me the most is their automatic renewal policy. I used to always have to accept a renewal, but now they automatically renew you and if you don't pay, they threaten collection. What's worse is, they try and renew you at $36, when they freely advertise $8 or $12 offers on their website, open to everyone, not just new subscribers.<br /><br />Tool and car reviews are also getting very simplified. I'll most likely cancel (if they will let me) when my subscription runs out. [SEP] When Pop Mech decided to go to the digital edition, I was glad- you pay for it when you buy the mag subscription. Why glad? Because people like to steal the magazine from the USPS so for months I might not get it- So I went to the digital edition and guess what- The articles in the printed MAGAZINE aren't even accessible- the Digital Edition is NOT the same- all the articles are different- GREAT articles- BUT not what I signed on for- POPULAR MECHANICS- go the first mile and put what I paid for online!!!!!!!!!!!

And five minutes later, you are still looking for ""that"" article. Well, in this magazine they have a great Contents page with a special: ""On the Cover"" section. So, if you want to read about Nicole Kidman she is on page 110! OK, that was in the November 2001 issue and it is quite a sad article. What ever happened to the fairy tale? I just don't know...<br /><br />Now, if you love reading about other people who are making the news, the People section always has something fun to read about.

The articles on relationships are interesting.<br /><br />This magazine also has sections for: Health & Well Being, Consumer Sense, The Better Way, Food & Home, Fiction, Departments and Columns.

It is not that special it is chucked full of ads.  The cover stories are dull and boring and many of the articles you would want to read have about one paragraph good information.  I find this magazine a waste of our money.  It will not be getting renewed at the end of the subscription.  My mom has already stated that. [SEP] It's just okay. Don't expect much when you order it through Amazon for cheap - pretty sure it's about half of their regular issue size. [SEP] Cute articles, it's a hit or miss every month. [SEP] I moved back to the States last year after doing a stint overseas and was so eager to start subscribing to magazines again. I subscribed to 4, and among those GH is the only one I'm renewing. It's really the one where I feel I'm getting my money's worth (and more - I think I only paid $7 for 12 issues through Amazon). With other similar magazines I can flip through the whole thing in one sitting; with GH I need alot more time to go through it since there is alot of info in there that I find useful. I also find myself bookmarking various pages to go back to. I like the different tips they have and its focus on living budget-conscious. The recipes are great too; I was going to buy a cookbook until I tried a few recipes from GH and realized that they ALWAYS come out tasty, and I am not an experienced or particularly good cook!

The wife likes it for the beautiful advertising. [SEP] Girl friend loves this magazine [SEP] I expected morae fashion, but love the mag anyway! [SEP] Love this magazine.  It is always delivered on time. [SEP] ""W"" magazine is such an important staple in the world of fashion, that even guys like me can't help but read it. To call this a women's magazine would really be unfair, for it offers in-depth articles on the fashion industry, profiles on celebrities, and an excellent supplement for men published on a quarterly basis. This men's supplement offers fashion info that's hip and contemporary, but not trendy enough to spook the average American male. As with all fashion magazines, ""W"" could feature more models of color on their cover, but that's a relatively small gripe compared to the wealth of good stuff this magazine offers. Overall, bravo the folks at ""W"" a job well done! [SEP] Arrived ahead of schedule. Great pics. [SEP] One of my former friends got me hooked on this magazine and I do enjoy it. I enjoy reading about the designers and their lifestyles. What I like the most is the page after page of interesting and beautiful people in their clothes. The articles are in depth and not usually everyone's cup of tea. There is one section called SUZY which is okay at best. That section is geared towards the ""upper crust"" (in my opinion).<br />I like reading the articles about the ""empire"" of fashion such as Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren, Tom Ford, Gucci, Versace, etc. I love how these people have set the world of fashion on fire and people like me enjoy what is out on the market.<br />I enjoy fashion and the fashion trends. I tend to shop at Versace, Hermes, Ralph Lauren and Neiman Marcus. I like to keep on top of the world of fashion. I consider myself a slightly above average fashion expert. I know what looks good and how it should be worn. Granted I am not that good at telling the difference between designer fashions, but I try.<br />I recommend this magazine for those who yern to be part of the ""fashion conscience"" elite. This magazine is not just for women. Even men, like myself, can appreciate beauty in all of its forms: including haute couture and the runway. [SEP] The photographs are simply amazing and the articles are great, Conde Nast is just a solid publisher of magazines.  I know folks who get W just for the photography alone (much less the excellent fashion and trend-spotting).  However, getting the magazine from Amazon proved a lot more trouble than it was worth.<br /><br />I tried ordering this as a gift off of my friend's wishlist.  Four months later, my friend had yet to receive her first issue of her subscription.  I called Conde Nast, I called Amazon: they insisted it was the other.  Amazon offered to refund my money when all I really wanted was just the mere fulfillment of the order.  So I went to W's web site and ordered it for a couple dollars less and they even included a gift e-mail with the order.<br /><br />I suggest you save yourself time and trouble and order directly from W's web site. [SEP] What do fine dining, high fashion, celebrities, beauty tips, travel, exceptional photography, and entertainment all have in common? They can be found in W magazine. A magazine of women's interests, W is a huge publication measuring approximately 9"" X 13"". Which is one reason I like it, it's like getting a magazine from the 1940's with 21st century fashions. I would put it in the same category as Vogue. Anyone will love viewing W., but it's not hard to figure out who it's mainly aimed at, especially when you occasionally see jewelry priced between $20,000 and $200,000, and when you notice who some of the advertisers are, namely Prada, Calvin Klein, and Armani.W also has superb photography, photography that borders on Art. I have a subscription and share it with family and friends, then place it in my collection( I collect magazines ).<br /><br />If you like magazines such as Vogue and Harper's Bizarre, you are sure to love this fine publication. [SEP] This magazine has excellent fashion photography.  Mostly this is in the form of advertisements, which take up the first 175 pages and many more throughout.  The pages are almost twice the size of a standard magazine, which leaves room for more artistic ads.  The articles, I find hard to relate to or take seriously.  To me, they seem more like tabloid tales of sordid love affairs and over-hyped parties than any kind of actual informative articles.  For a magazine that is touted as a fashion industry standard, I expected to see many more articles about fashion, styles, and designers rather than Hollywood gossip.  The photographs and fashion advertisements really are great, and I believe they would be the most useful aspect of this magazine for people interested in fashion.","""W"" Print Magazine offers a unique blend of high fashion, celebrity profiles, and in-depth articles that cater to a sophisticated and exclusive audience. Boasting a big, over-sized format, ""W"" provides readers with elegant, opulent, and colorful fashion coverage, alongside insider style news and cultural insights.

Readers appreciate the magazine for its artistic sensibility and visual inspiration, with the majority drawn to its luxurious layout and iconic images.

User Reviews:
Simply the best magazine around for scale modelers who are interested in planes, tanks and ships of various eras.  A must have mag! [SEP] Fine Scale Modeler is the outstanding modeling magazine. Filled with great photos and tips as well as detailed feature articles. No matter your favorite modeling subject, Fine Scale Modeler has it covered. [SEP] I have been reading Finescale since about 1986. It has covered just about ever kind of modeling there is, so there is always some new information no matter what kind of modeler you are. There are other model magazines out there, that may be slightly better (depending on what kind of models you build), but those are more expensive.  I build all kinds of models, so I have stayed with this one for many years. Once you start reading it, you will want to keep re-subscribing as well. It also makes a great gift for kids who have an interest in creating things. [SEP] The only real downside to this is the heavy emphasis on tanks and planes. I wish they'd put up more articles on other things. Ships or rockets, for example. That's why it doesn't get my 5 stars. [SEP] Love the magazine, which is why I subscribed - but never got a single issue due to delivery problems. Amazon magazines gave me a full refund without any fuss, and now I get the electronic edition via Zinio. [SEP] Very good [SEP] I've been a reader and subscriber since the magazines conception back in the 80's..One of the best modelers magazines on the american market.The articles are well written,with nice photos and how to articles for all levels of modeling.Been building models for over 40 years and a lot of what I've learned has come from the pages of this magazine.Is it on par with Tamiya's magazines? No but it is headed in that direction,Matthew Usher the current editor is making the changes needed to keep up with the modeling world,world wide.Do yourself a favor and pick up a least one copy of the magazine and give it a read,you'll be pleasantly suprise at what you'll find inside.Excellent web page with plenty of advice and photos of modelers builds from around the globe also. [SEP] This magazine has helped me develope my skills as a modeler for quite a while.  I am still a novice but I have to say, using some of the tips and tricks found in these articles has really helped me.  Every now and then I look at some of the detail that I would have otherwise missed.  It makes the difference between being a toy and being a historical story.  My dad used to build models all the time and I remember he always told me that building the model was the easy part, making it look real is the FUN (hard) part!  The weathering tricks and scratch building how to's are all awesome even for an intermediate/skilled modeler.  Okay, now I am rambling on.  It's a great buy!  Get it now, you won't regret it! [SEP] Probably my fault but the subscribtion is suppose to be a gift to my son.<br /><br />The magazine is coming to my address not his.<br /><br />Please redirect the subscription shipping address to :<br /><br />Sean Johnson<br />1321 R St North West Washington  DC 20009<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Brant Johnson [SEP] the magazine arrived earlier than stated...which is good! it was for a christmas present. although i don't model my husband does, ad he was thrilled with the order. how ever,it being a present,i had requested a note to be enclosed with it. that never appeared. i was diappointed in that.<br />pqw","""Finescale Modeler is a print magazine that provides information on constructing realistic and accurate models, offering new project ideas and tips and techniques for model aircraft, military vehicles, ships, cars, spacecraft, historical figures, and dioramas.

72,"Title: Maximum PC    Print Magazine

User Reviews:
Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.<br /><br />When Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.<br /><br />One thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.<br /><br />Overall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading. [SEP] I started buying this in Sept of '03 because of the short blurb on the cover (of every issue) ""Maximum PC - Minimum BS"".<br /><br />I have never seen that proved wrong.  Every issue is crammed full of articles that bring maximum PC goodness right to your mailbox.<br /><br />There are articles about building and modifying your own PC, reviews of PC's and PC components, a ""Watchdog"" column that keeps readers abreast of problems in the industry (and attempts to find solutions for readers, too - a nice touch), a head-to-head article that compares one similar product to another, an ""Ask the Doctor"" column that provides answers to both simple and very complex computer questions, and many others.<br /><br />My favorite is the how-to's in just about every issue.  All of the how-to's show even neophytes how to get down and get dirty with mods (modifications) to their machine.  But, the articles take neither a ""write down to the lowest level"" nor a ""technogeek know-it-all"" approach - they tell you what to do and how to do it simply, and reveal many ""secrets"" you won't read in mainstream computer magazines.<br /><br />And the reviews.  I love the ""Kick-A**"" award - you know that product is good.  And when a product doesn't meet their standards they simply come right out and tell you it sucks - saving people lots of money in the bargain, I suspect.<br /><br />This product is managed by the same people who do ""PC Gamer"" and it shows.  Many games =require= the latest and greatest machines in order to run well.  And the few game reviews shows that they know games just as well as they know computers.<br /><br />Their writing style isn't for everyone, but I really enjoy the almost in-your-face attitude that they project.  This is the kind of person I want standing behind me when I make expensive modifications to my computer system - keeping me from making mistakes before I start to turn a single screw.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone who has ever thought of opening the cover of their computer and doing thier own upgrades and modifications.  Highly recommended to any person who builds and modifies computers - especially highly recommended to any people who do this for computers that are virtually dedicated to gaming.  Well worth reading and keeping. [SEP] I have subscribed off and on since 2006.  Great articles, accurate reviews, hilarious editorials...very informative and always a great read.  I wish it were as hilarious as PC Accelerator (God Bless and Rest that wonderful Magazine).... but nothing will beat it...ever.... so this I give the second best PC Mag ever, with varied content and honest reviews/articles.  If you want the scoop and don't mind waiting for a magazine, this is your answer.  The new editor-in-chief knows his stuff very well, and is always entertaining to read. Great PC Journalism. [SEP] was great computer magazine, lot of inormation. [SEP] I am a little disappointed I am unable to purchase Maximun PC. The magazine is still being published monthly so I have no idea why amazon will not sell it.<br /><br />About the product:  I look forward to receiving this magazine.  I have worked in IT for over 15 years, and with each magazine, I would end up learning at least 10 new things. It is different than PC World.  Maximum PC is more ""techy"" then PC World.  Both magazines have how-to's and discuss up and coming products.  Maximum PC, gets more in depth and not for the avagee computer user.  Maximum PC covers much more hardware and digs deeper.<br /><br />You can subscribe (puchase) the magazine by going to [...]  1 year subscription ( 12 issues) is $19.95.  A 2 year (24 issues) is $29.95. [SEP] I won't repeat what others already said.  Instead let me add that this is the only magazine that I don't throw out.  Each issue has a &quot;How to...&quot; guide.  It can be anything from &quot;Windows XP Secret Tools&quot; to &quot;How to overclock your PC.&quot;  As I get each issue, I save it and build my own library of guides.  If I ever need to know how to do something, I just go back to my Maximum PC library and select the issue that covers that topic.<br />Also each issue has a section where the PC techies take a new product and test it under hazardous conditions to see whether it survives or not.  3 issues ago, techies took 4 USB &quot;keychain&quot; drives and tested them in 4 ways:  Dropped them from a 5-story building, put each one in a block of ice, in a clothes drier and put each one under the tires of a semi-truck.  At the end, they let you know which usb drive survived and which didn't.<br />This magazine covers much, much more.  However, I do not want to repeat other reviewers.  Great magazine! [SEP] At one time, this was my least favorite computer magazine. As more and more computer magazines discontinued the print editions (which i prefer), this and one other remained. When renewal time came, I asked myself, &#34;do I really need two ccomputer magazines&#34;. No. One will be suficient. I decided that page for page, Maximum PC offered more useful content per page. A bonus is that if you are a 'computer geek', you'll simply 'droll' over some of the 'dream machines' Maximum PC reviews. Highly recommended. [SEP] I really like this magazine with its in depth insight into the PC and related software. If you like PC info, software, some hardware hacks and more you'll like this magizine. [SEP] I have subscribed to the nook version for a few years now and thoroughly enjoy this magazine. It has enough tech and what's new to keep me happy. [SEP] I have read them all, and for me, this is the best one.  I look so forward to it coming in the mail, that I end up reading it in one sitting when it finally arrives.  Then I spend the rest of the month rereading it & wishing that the next month's would get here sooner.  Great compaisons & reviews that are concise & to the point.  If I want more info, I can go to their website & get more in-depth.  And then there is the disk with programs to try.  Yes, I could download the files on my own, but the convenience of having the collection at my fingertips is very valuable to me.","""Maximum PC is a print magazine catering to electronics enthusiasts, offering a wide range of articles on how to purchase, repair, optimize, and upgrade electronic devices.

User Reviews:
I found a Cooking Light magazine from 2009 and tried their banana bars with browned butter pecan frosting. Can I say delicious (the bananas are roasted with brown sugar and butter first), but I think personally I'd about half the sugar. When they say light in this magazine they seem to mean reducing fat. So the recipe had 8.4g of fat but 35.1g of carbs . I think if they are going to say a recipe is healthier they should also reduce the sugar. So next time I'll remember how sweet the cake was and lower the amount of sugar to say 3/4 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup. Light to me at least seems to mean less fat AND sugar. I didn't play around with the recipe because I only had three bananas and couldn't afford to get it wrong on the first try.

User Reviews:
Motorcycle enthusiasts are a unique breed and the main quality that sets them apart from the rest of civilization is their unyielding enthusiasm for their chosen sport/hobby. They often become consumed with biking and, like golf fanatics and others, they view every spare moment as an excuse to partake in their chosen activity.<br /><br />Cycle World is a magazine designed with the motorcycle enthusiast in mind. This publication is made for the type of biker who not only likes to ride his cycle, but also liked to learn as much about motorcycles as possible. There are, of course, plenty of articles in each issue of Cycle World that talk about the joys of riding and the sport of motorcycle racing. But Cycle World includes other articles, too- articles that only the well- rounded motorcycle fan will be likely to read and appreciate. Some articles focus on new technology. Others dispense advice on motorcycle repair. There are also travel articles and personality profiles as well, making for a nicely rounded publication.<br /><br />I'm not a motorcycle enthusiast or even a casual fan, but I still like certain sections of Cycle World and I try to read a few of them every month. My favorite sections of Cycle World are those that feature new products. Cycle World is among the first publications to report on new motorcycles and other related products and the magazine includes plenty of great photos, test data, and various statistics. In a matter of minutes, one can quickly learn the pros and cons of a specific motorcycle and more easily make a buying decision. Even though I am not a fan, I still like these articles because, like articles on new cars, they often include some very cool new product offerings that can easily impress anyone- even a nonfan like me.<br /><br />Motorcycles are loved by their many enthusiastic fans and Cycle World is a magazine intended for those who want a well- rounded publication about motorcycles, their upkeep, and their use for entertainment. Most of the pages in each issue are dedicated to the different motorcycles produced by different manufacturers, but there is plenty other information to be found in this magazine about motorcycles and Cycle World makes a good choice for those who want to know how to ride, repair, and enjoy their hobby as much as possible. [SEP] I've been a suscriber of this magazine for about 15 years and find it the most well rounded writings of the motorcycle offerings in the US.<br />If you are looking for a broad interest in motorcycle coverage this is it. For the price to content ratio this magazine remains a constant in my readings. I currently read about 4 brands a month and Cycle World is the first one I pick up.<br /> Good Reading!! [SEP] Great reviews on new bike, new products and maintenance and test rides.<br />What I really like is that they cover all makes and models from scooters to exotics in every magazine.<br />One of my favorite features is their long term test rides after a year of use which includes maintenance and upgrades etc.<br />Another column I like is their best buys of used cycles each month.<br /><br />Keep in mind I have to cycle subscriptions each month, but this is my favorite. [SEP] Great magazine for a great price [SEP] ok [SEP] Got it for work. [SEP] This is better than picking it up at news stand each month. Even if don't like what is in every issue with subscription still way cheaper than newsstand. [SEP] I love motorcycles. Always have. I currently have 4. I subscribe or have subscribed to every cycle magazine. I'm an AMA member. But I cancelled my sub once Cycle World switched to becoming Architectural Cycling Digest. I can't imagine any significant number of motorcyclist want this faux high brow moto-naval-gazing bullshirt.<br /><br />For example: I was very interested in the Yamaha Nikken. And it was the cover story. But good luck finding out what it actually looks like since the design department seems more interested in winning design awards from their friends at Adobe than actually conveying visual information. All the pics of the Nikken were covered with a heavy red filter. At least Rider magazine had a story on the bike the same month and took actual unmolested photos of it so you could see what color it was.<br /><br />And of course nothing says froo-froo design than making type as small as possible. Many of the captions in this version of Cycle World I can't read even with my glasses.  But the run amok designers at CW can do you one even better. In the article on the Yamaha GTS1000 they made them light gray instead of black. Apparently some people over 40 were still able to read some captions and they couldn't have that. Maybe lemon yellow next month.<br /><br />I didn't care that it was expensive but between not being able to read portions of it at all, other parts seeming to be more interested in design for its own sake and the ever increasing amount of moto-naval-gazing I decided to cut my losses. I'm hoping enough others do as well so we can get the good old Cycle World back. You know the one that was about motorcycles first and had regular pictures of them, lots of them. In colors other than just red. [SEP] Ok to read, but predictable...if you love a magazine and cup of coffee in your hands, worth getting. [SEP] Ordered for my husband, the only problem, when it comes he sits down and reads until it is finished cover to cover.","Cycle World is a print magazine tailored for motorcycle enthusiasts who have a deep passion for all things related to biking. This publication is not just about the joy of riding and motorcycle racing, but also delves into new technology, motorcycle repair advice, travel stories, and personality profiles.

I really like wired magazine.  Some of the articles are a little too geeky even for me mostly because they get so technical that I am somewhat lost.

It's consistently prescient in its speculation ... the management keeps a tidy score. There are success stories and smoking-black-hole failure stories that push the reader's critical thinking skills.<br /><br />I don't know how they make money selling subscriptions this cheap.

User Reviews:
The Atlantic is an intellectual magazine and one that I have been reading on and off for many years. This magazine is best known for its political/current events/social articles that tackle some tough issues of the day and it delivers most effectively when it's offering some commentary on world events and social issues and these are the articles I turn to first when I read The Atlantic. I like the political articles best, but there are plenty of other non- political yet very thoughtful articles in each issue.<br />Most every article in The Atlantic is thoughtful and well- written. Look closely at the authors of some of the stories in this magazine and you will notice some high- profile names on more than one occasion. Christopher Hitchens, Mark Bowden, Eric Schlosser, and others are known to contribute an article or two in each issue of The Atlantic. These writers, and others like them, are ready to offer their take on some of the critical issues of the day.<br /><br />The Atlantic certainly offers some interesting, thoughtful, intellectual articles and one fact that sets them apart from those found in most other magazines is that the featured articles are often very long- sometimes exceeding ten pages in length. Most magazines shy away from articles this long because they know that most reader's have an attention span that is far too short to finish the entire piece of reading in one sitting. But The Atlantic is different. If the subject matter is such that an article needs to be ten- plus pages in order to thoroughly cover everything, then The Atlantic is quick to oblige. I appreciate the excellent coverage but I must admit that some articles are almost too long. Even when I have an interest in the subject matter, I often end up stopping halfway through because I cannot hold my attention any longer.<br /><br />Another section I like in The Atlantic is the book reviews section. To present a fair and balanced perspective, The Atlantic reviews new books from many different genres and I like that there are different reviews of varying lengths. One section of The Atlantic called Cover to Cover includes short summaries of many different books. These are nice when you don't have time to read a lengthy review of a book and just want the basics. But there are also some very long book reviews in The Atlantic, along with some advertisements for new books that include a short, 50 to 100 word summary of the book. I like reading the reviews, but I like this section best for its exposure to new book releases. It is like looking at a quick rundown of intellectual books and I have, in fact, discovered some very good titles from this part of the magazine.<br /><br />Overall, The Atlantic ranks among my favorite magazines and I look forward to some serious, intellectual reading in each issue. I admit that some articles are a tad too lengthy, but I still like The Atlantic for its intellectual stimulation and for its focus on current events. It's a very good magazine for cerebral types who like to read about politics and social issues. [SEP] Love the lack of ads and the essay style of writing rather than interviews.  I've read two issues through and through.  Also get the NYer (wish it was as good as previous), dumped Nation, love The Sun.  Wonderful intelligent and informative writing in the time of tweets. [SEP] I like the Atlantic, but I confess I do not like it enough so that I will continue to subscribe. I read it while awaiting treatment at my dentist's office, while on the train or at a coffee shop. In 45 minutes, I have had my fill. It is otherwise not compelling in its originality or capacity.<br /><br />The articles are better than most popular magazines. I enjoy Mark Steyn and Mark Bowden, but get tired of Christopher Hitchens' proselytory writing tone.<br /><br />Occasional issues have been dumbed down, are feel as if they are being geared for the Entertainment Tonight crowd.<br /><br />The Atlantic is a good read in short spurts, but inconsistent over the entire issue, I now only buy a couple issues a year, at most.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />[...] [SEP] Sent as a gift to my adult daughter. A great magazine to read that promotes stimulating, well timed,  and informed debates about the current issues on the national and international arena. [SEP] One article might be informative and the next 5 with be full of liberal agenda driven absurdities.<br /><br />For example, I quote: “The president laughed off the virus and the Democrats’ response to it, calling it their “new hoax,” which immediately polarized the citizenry’s response to precautionary public-health information.”<br /><br />Well that is just a bare-faced lie. A “fake news” story that had been debunked, and yet they were repeating it with an updated spin.<br /><br />The fact is Democrats were not concerned about the virus at all. They were obsessed with an impotent impeachment game when Trump said no more travel from China, they’re having an epidemic there. Democrats ATTACKED him (because it’s all they do - ad nauseam) for having a hysterical overreaction and being xenophobic! It was their absurd spin as they tried to politicize the virus - Trump was doing too much/he wasn’t doing enough - that he was referring to as their “new hoax.” Clearly meaning the new thing they were trying to bludgeon him with.<br /><br />If anyone’s been paying attention with half a brain cell, or has a modicum of honesty, they could see clearly that the WH has been taking it seriously from the get-go, while not trying to panic people. They’ve been having briefings with experts daily for weeks! If people aren’t taking it seriously it’s because they’ve got their heads up their asses! (Pardon me, but come on!🤨)<br /><br /> “The Atlantic” is apparently joining the media mob sensationalizing and politicizing this crisis with the virus.  With erroneous panic inducing click bait meant to drive traffic to their stations, websites, and advertisers. Guess who’s going to be making a profit from all the havoc they’ve created? [SEP] Always a good read [SEP] The most intelligent magazine around. [SEP] This is a great magazine. I thought I'd find it frustrating to only have one a month in this time of news at the speed of light, but the articles are exactly what I needed to fill in the gaps my daily newspaper left. [SEP] Best writing around.  Much nicer companion than the New Yorker. [SEP] We had purchased the Atlantic from newsstands over the years and finally decided to subscribe.<br />We went through Amazon and the process was smooth and worked easily.<br />So now we are subscribers to a magazine that always offers good information and excellent writers.<br />No complaints only praise for a good product and easy subscribing process.","The Atlantic is a prestigious print magazine that has been a leading journal of American thought, culture, and politics since its founding in 1857.

User Reviews:
This review is on the magazine Fortune and not the Amazon subscription or subscription process.<br /><br />I neither have a lot of savings nor a lot of debt.  I have a variety of small investments in the form of mutual funds and gold funds.  Fortune does not directly steer the way I do things.  I does, however, guide my intentions occasionally.  I have learned a great deal by reading this magazine.  Things aren't necessarily crystal clear but I get a good grasp on what I must do in order to stay afloat.<br /><br />Fortune magazine is well written.  Why it certainly deals with business, business is what keeps this country moving and that's where the money is and goes.  It's watching these deals, mergers, sales and bankruptcies that guide where I put my money and how much of it goes there.<br /><br />I do like this magazine.  For anyone who has concern for their future and eventual retirement - and that SHOULD be everyone - this magazine is a treasure trove. [SEP] apparently we cant even escape politics in something straight forward as a finance magazine.  I started receiving these in place of ""money"" magazine that just recently quit printing monthly magazines.<br /><br />If you're a democrat or a far left nut case you'll love the magazine.  if you actually believe in something besides socialism and communism you might find the constant bashing of the right and praise of the left to be a little much.  Look forward to this magazine going out of business.  #learntocode [SEP] Love Fortune Magazine.  Learn something business-critical with every issue. [SEP] To be honest, none of the big business/investing rags seem to do a very good job with a crystal ball. So I would caution Fortune readers - read for interest, read for fun, but don't bet your savings on ""Best Picks for 2012"" headlines. As a for instance, while the S&P 500 was up 15.1% in 2010, the Fortune ""10 Best Stocks for 2010"" returned 2.2%. Great headline, poor advice! For more on the big investing magazines predictions vs performance, check out the Ric Edelman article -[...] [SEP] We love this magazine. [SEP] great magazine. interesting ideas. great price [SEP] Learn who's making the big bucks. [SEP] Extremely informative magazine [SEP] I've tried all the business and investing magazines out there, and this is by far the best one.  Money is full of fluff, Business Week's coverage is too trivial and sensational.  Fortune hits the mark with deep relevant topics.<br />The articles aren't quite as good as they were several years ago, but that doesn't stop it from being better than the rest. [SEP] This iPad App SUCKS!<br /><br />The purpose of having an App is to be intuitive.<br /><br />First, if I come across an interesting article, I should be able to click a button and share it.

User Reviews:
I've always liked this magazine. Its articles about food culture and about how food works with societies, families, and customs really speak to an age where those things have been divorced from eating for many years. I learn something new and amazing every time. Sometimes the articles are about American food culture; sometimes they're about foreign food culture; every time, the articles highlight some commonality that binds all of us through what we eat. I've tried several of the recipes and haven't ever been disappointed, either. This is going to sound wonky, but I even like the ads--they talk about foods I'd never heard of before and ways of preparing existing products I hadn't ever thought of trying.<br /><br />The magazine assumes that readers have a fair-to-middling amount of cooking skills as well as a fair-to-middling outfitted kitchen. Recipes range from vegetarian to full-bore carnivorous. They don't generally include nutritional data or cooking times, but are traditionally-formatted (with proper measurements and yields). My main quibble with the recipes is that you really need to read them--they don't normally list things like water in the ingredients, but when you read the directions, you'll notice they call for things not in the ingredient list sometimes. So just pay attention, that's all.<br /><br />Gorgeous photography, great ideas, fascinating articles... this is definitely one of the better cooking magazines out there. [SEP] Love these recipes [SEP] excellent magazine [SEP] This is a great magazine for learning about the origins of food and also for authentic recipes.  Very colorful and thorough.

Not impressed, I've only got a few magazines but I already canceled the subscription, couldn't find anything I would want to make.  The recipes are very rich, a lot of butter and cream. [SEP] If you can't blanch, roast, braise, deep fry or poach decently, this cooking magazine probably isn't for you.<br />Try Martha Stewart Living.<br /><br />I love how matter-of-fact the recipes are, It instructs you without making you feel like a novice in the kitchen.<br />The format of the magazine is very entertaining and educational. Plus gives you recipes for things that you<br />didn't even know you wanted to learn.<br /><br />Make my own butter? Absolutely!<br /><br />Highly recommend this magazine for those who CAN cook and want to expand their horizons. [SEP] I subscribed to 6 issues in November, 2017. The magazine frequency since changed to 4 issues. Eight months later I have only received 1 magazine and automated responses to my emails asking for help. I’m disappointed by the overall customer experience especially since I love Saveur, I just wish I could get a magazine. [SEP] It's just okay. Since the demise of Gourmet I've tried all mags. Cooks Is one of the best. I would not have renewed this subscription but it auto renewed . I'll change that for next year. [SEP] Always agreeable read, inspires you on a dull day. Lovely food photography and interesting travel perspectives. [SEP] Except when they do stupid things like adding family unfriendly articles that I can't let my kids look at, this is the magazine we all run to grab first. Not just great recipes, but stories about food and cooking and food culture around the world. Tantalizing photos. Very nice. Just keep the sexuality and homosexuality, religion and liberal politics out of the stories please. There's enough passionate stuff to say about the food without inserting those little unrelated plugs in there.","Saveur Print Magazine celebrates the culture and tradition of cooking with stories and recipes from around the world. Aimed at home cooks who enjoy preparing a variety of classic and innovative dishes for their families and friends, the magazine presents articles on everything from how to prepare simple weeknight meals to profiles of unique ingredients only available in a single specific location.

Got this for a friend (Teenager) and she's thrilled.  Still a good source for teens and not nasty like so many. [SEP] I purchased this subscription for my two teenage daughters and they liked it so much that I've renewed it already. We had to set up a schedule of who gets the mag first each month so they can take turns because they were fighting over it at the mailbox each month. I remember reading this same mag when I was a teenager and it was just as interesting then. Highly recommended mag and the Amazon price was great!! [SEP] Seventeen is a fun positive magazine for girls probably 11 or so and up.  Helps transition the girl into womanhood with great fashion, stories, and advice.  The magazine is clean and promotes bright women which I think is key to go along with all the fashion and make-up.<br />[[ASIN:B000297VQA Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath]] [SEP] Granddaughters love the magazines! [SEP] Full of advertisements and not any stories my teen was interested in. I know they need to pay for the mag with ads but it was crazy how many pages you turn and turn before you get to a story or article. I was not able to cancel the subscription they told me so I transferred it to another teen I knew who was really excited about getting it. [SEP] I ordered this for my sister for her birthday and she loved it. She received all the magazines and I am happy that she received them since we dont live together but they were sent to her house. [SEP] with the promotion i ended up getting a 2 year subscription for my fiancee for 5 dollars. great deal. [SEP] Took over a month to get the first copy, I had ordered a gift card but niece never got it...I wondered why she didn't thank my for the birthday gift.<br />She just got her first copy, so all is good [SEP] If your looking for a magazine for your young teenager, Seventeen Magazine is great!  I never let my  young teen read any magazine before I look through it thoroughly.  Other magazines just don't seem age appropriate.  It has everything in it a girl could want, such as fashion, stories written by other teens, contest and much more. [SEP] I wouldn't read this crap but my daughter loves it. Its perfect for coming of age.

[SEP] the only thing you need to watch - a lot of magazine subscriptions on here auto renew!  Manage that in your account before you get charged more for extra year [SEP] Bought this magazine on a lark and have found it a good read every month when it arrives.  Lots of gems of information for diet, health and many other informational articles.  Got a great deal on the magazine via amazon. [SEP] Happ [SEP] Bottom-Line: If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.<br /><br />The world of Men's magazines, or magazines that are marketed towards a certain portion of the male reading populace, is littered with twaddle that only seems to appeal to the baser instincts of the male gender.  You know the magazines; they need not be mentioned here.  Some are happily folding tent never to heard from again.  Truth be told there are very few magazines that appeal to the more intellectual side of a man (yes ladies we do have such a side).<br /><br />But recently as ""special gift"" for renewing my Bally's Total Fitness membership I received a 1 year subscription to ""Men's Journal Magazine"", ""a general interest, active lifestyle magazine with a focus on adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.""<br /><br />""Men's Journal Magazine"", is published monthly by Wenner Media, the same publishing house that brings us such notable sidewalk fare as Us Weekly and Rolling Stone.  The magazine will set you back $3.95 an issue at the local newsstand, but 1 year subscriptions can be had for $9.95.  Inside each approximately 120-page magazine you will not find half clothed women dripping with sexy come hither stares.  Nor will you find the next Hollywood ""it"" girl, or wannabe skinny model with a fake tan gracing the pages of this Men's magazine.  No, ""Men's Journal"" is serious business folks; vapid men with one track minds and adolescent libido's need not apply!<br /><br />""Men's Journal"" is a smartly written, thoughtfully designed magazine for the active intellectual male.  The magazine offer feature-length articles on a wide range of subjects based on the magazine's central theme: adventure, travel, equipment, sports, fitness, health, and style.<br /><br />However, like most magazines in America, ""Men's Journal"" depends heavily on advertising to generate revenue, but unlike fashion magazines that seem to be 90% advertising and 10% substance, ""Men's Journal"" only dedicates every other page to colorful spreads bent on selling us stuff we don't really need, or in some cases don't need but really, really want, but can't afford.  To its credit, most of the advertising is not dedicated to men's fashions, wore by young impeccably sculpted and groomed men, or automobiles that are impossibly expensive, but instead to the business of adventure and sports.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />When all is said and done I enjoy reading ""Men's Journal Magazine.""  Granted, given my current lifestyle (my days of adventures have been traded in for the American Dream and all that entails for now), the information the magazine imparts is only marginally useful to me.  The fitness articles are rater short and are mostly how-to's that while useful are just barely so.  Most of the equipment discussed in Men's Journal is for the magazines target audience with the appropriate disposable income; that's not me.<br /><br />Nonetheless, when my subscription runs out in another ten months I will probably renew.  Why?  Because ""Men's Journal"" represents my kind of man: thoughtful, intelligent, adventurous (hey, I used to ride submarines, hike mountains and scuba dive and I still want to go sky-diving), man who actually appreciates full-length feature articles or two written by grown-ups for grown-ups.<br /><br />If you are looking for a magazine written for the not-so-average Joe, filled with those little tidbits in life only men can appreciate, but also brings a healthy infusion of intelligent to its well written and information pages, ""Men's Journal Magazine"" might be for you.

Usually ended up in recycle bin soon after arriving in mailbox. [SEP] They’ve really lost their edge. I only got it because Macaulay was on the cover and then I wanted my money back. This is a gay magazine and I don’t mean that in a negative way. I just wish they would just say that.

I especially enjoy the many projects and ideas for planning various holidays from Valentine’s Day cookies to Christmas crafts and everything in between. Besides the content, the magazine has such eye appeal. As soon as I receive my monthly copy, I flip through it just to look at  the photos that are so beautifully done. I would highly recommend. [SEP] I love the articles in this magazine. [SEP] got a free subscription with a purchase of a product.  wish I never sent the card in.  I toss in the recycling the instant I get it.  Maybe I will contact them to  cancel ""free"" subscription!  Ad every other page.  Huge pictures of recipes but no recipe until end of magazine.  No reference to page number either!!!.  When you find the recipe at the end of magazine, there are brief fairly useless instructions, and a tiny if any picture.  the recipes are in columns. Would make more sense to print on a whole page, so you can rip the entire page out, or in recipe card format, where you can cut them out in put in recipe card file or better yet, print on card stock with tear marks so you can tear out just the recipes you want. If there are any articles she toots her own horn.  She she should pay me to read the thing.  Waste of time to read.  Don't subscribe to this ever free, or heaven forbid pay for this useless ad ridden magazine.  She has ads for her own products mostly.  OK done blasting the magazine.  Order it, if you must and make up your own mind.","""Martha Stewart Living is a magazine that offers a mix of content including recipes, home decorating ideas, crafts, and garden advice.

Not even close to the original. It's not Taste of Home, it's more like Taste of a Restaurant Dish At Home. Did not renew. So sad, I miss the old one. :'( [SEP] Love this magazine!  Great price too! [SEP] Great magazine [SEP] Great ideas for meals [SEP] Years ago my mother was one of the original &#34;editors&#34; of Taste of Home.  That said, anyone who wrote a recipe and had it published was considered an editor.<br /><br />This WAS a great magazine for the home cook.  Most of the recipes were kitchen friendly with ingredients and tools you would have in a decently stocked kitchen.  Something along the lines of smoked paprika might have been considered &#34;classy&#34; or even foreign.  Today, with Reader's Digest at the helm, it's a different magazine.  Gone are the days of no advertisements (subscriptions paid for the publishing and profit) and it is now filled with big glossy photos of food, kitchen and body related items that the publishers feel you cannot live without.  I, for one, can live without them.<br /><br />Having spend more than 20 years in the culinary business from the bottom of the chain to operator and now educator, I would occasionally use Taste of Home for a &#34;comfort food selection&#34;.  These particular recipes would be given to the newest of the new cooks to prepare and have ready for service.<br /><br />Taste of Home still has decent recipes.  It isn't the friendly magazine that it once was.  It's part of a conglomerate that feels numbers are more important the quality.  I'll read it, but I no longer subscribe.

National Geographic is one of the best magazines of its kind, with plenty of great photography, thoughtful articles, and diverse coverage of several different topics relating to the planet earth. Stories about wildlife, different cultures, and even environmentalism and the politics it breeds can be found on the pages within each issue.<br /><br />What makes this magazine so enjoyable is the fact that it goes so in- depth in its coverage and includes stories with a personal element. When most people think about National Geographic, they usually think about the great photographs of natural wonders, exotic plants, and animal wildlife. These things are all great, but they form only part of the magazine's overall appeal. Stories about different cultures and peoples from around the world are just as good, and are usually presented in a personal way. You feel like you know the people on an intimate level when you read this magazine.<br /><br />This publication contains between 120 and 160 pages in most issues, with about a dozen or so monthly departments, as well as some varied articles that change each month, but are always concentrated on nature, science, politics, culture, etc.<br /><br />National Geographic is often very educational and intellectual, making it a learning device as well as a magazine for entertainment. It's one of the better, more thorough magazines on the market. Go ahead and give it a try. You just might learn something in the process. [SEP] Low on the &#34;Geographic&#34; high on the &#34;People Magazine&#34; . Interview with Paul McCartney...really. [SEP] The articles and pictures are incredible. I bought an issue in a bookstore when I was in Japan for a while, and paid nearly as much for one copy as for the whole year. This is a fantastic buy. The only problem is what to do with them once I've read them?! Can't discard them. [SEP] I never get bored reading a National Geographic magazine. The photos are simply amazing and the articles are extremely informative. I love being able to see the world we live in from the comfort of my own home. Other than the price, this magazine is one of  a kind. [SEP] Love this magazine and as far as I can tell no advantage to  getting from amazon vs national Geo just happend to see it.

User Reviews:
This magazine is a product of CondeNet publishing and it is aimed at the younger female market, roughly from ages 18 to 30. This publication is a shopper's paradise, with more advertising than most any other magazine on the market.<br /><br />I got a complimentary subscription to this magazine one day and I accepted, not only because it was free, but also because I really didn't know it was a woman's fashion magazine. With a title like ""Lucky"", there were all sorts of possibilities. It could have been about gambling, sweepstakes, or about getting lucky. I didn't know it was a woman's magazine, so I accepted it. And from what I can see, this magazine is one of average worth to the average person and it will appeal mostly to younger women.<br /><br />Fashion covers a good amount of the magazine's 200 plus pages. Beauty tips are another important area of coverage. It is also common to see samples of different products inside the pages of each issue. Things like perfume samples, shampoo, and other things can be found buried somewhere within each copy. The coverage includes casual as well as high- class clothing and beauty products, with most of it falling at the upper end of the cost scale.<br /><br />If you can tolerate the clogging of advertisements, this magazine might be a good choice for the younger female crowd that likes to keep in- tune with the latest styles and trends. Outside of that targeted market, however, I don't see much use for Lucky magazine. The photography is very good and the presentation is professional, but the magazine will likely be rated average by a large cross- section of the population. [SEP] I'm glad my subscription is expiring.  I found nothing of use in 12 issues of this magazine.  Even the articles seemed suspect like the authors were given a list of products to promote. [SEP] While fun to look at, this magazine is not realistic and hard to take seriously.  You can get some style tips but the prices for items shown are way more expensive than the average consumer can afford, especially in this economy.  I let my subscription run out and won't buy it again. [SEP] ... and getting ideas based on the latest styles.  Yes, it's basically a cataloge of girls playing dress up, but it is almost as fun looking at the outfits as it was playing dress up as a kid. [SEP] This magazine is definitely not geared toward the girl next door. The products featured are typically very pricey. Also, it is all about fashion, so if you're not a fashionista, look for another magazine. [SEP] I look forward to getting this delivered to me every month.  If you are into clothes, handbags, accessories, shoes, fragrances, or beauty products then you will love Lucky.  Right down to the little stickers that are available for you to place on your ""YES/Maybe"" items.<br />Lucky gives your trendy, classic, chic, preppy - whatever your taste may be.  I like to see what's hot and then try to find copy-cats of the designer duds b/c who really can afford to spend(...) on a pair of Manolo shoes?? [SEP] I placed the order over a month ago and I still haven't received it.  I placed another magazine order at the same time, and that one was delivered last week. [SEP] This magazine is a major plus in all departments, flirty, informative, trendy, and flattering with reasonable, realistic advice (which you can either take or leave -- a major plus is that it isn't mainly centered on size 2 waifs and makes sound fashion and beauty advice for the every woman).<br /><br />Of course some of this is so over the top one would never dare to to buy some of these products though the fun part is looking and there is so much sound advice that the reader/consumer is then able to make realistic determinations from these suggestions and incorporate them into her everyday life plus....kill me, I adore looking at what I can only dream about NOT having....and planning on the occasional splurge in my life....investments so worth the money.<br /><br />Beauty tips out of the world...some fav Bravo tid-bits...and just plain fun to browse and dream and I adore...did I say I adore the stickers to mark where to go back and peruse all the must have's that you'll likely never purchase but just makes dreaming more fun....Plus I've actually gotten some fabulous killer advice (both beauty and fashion do's and don'ts that have totally been worth the price of admission)<br /><br />Love it....Second best to the beauty bible Allure! [SEP] This is not the kind of magazine you read, at least not cover to cover.  This is for serious shopping, or shopping ideas.  Feel a whole in your wardrobe? Lucky can tell you what to put in it for a variety of price ranges.  That is one of the reasons I really like this magazine it shows different price ranges of a style so you can decide how much you want to spend on the perfect look.

User Reviews:
Sunset is a magazine dedicated to the people, culture, and lifestyle of the American west. This magazine divides its space among many different topics, such as food and entertainment, travel, recreation, gardening and more.<br /><br />I have been reading this magazine for about six months now and there are several things about it that make it worthwhile. The thing that stands out the most are the photographs, and I'm not talking about just the stunning scenery one normally associates with the West (like the National Parks or the coastline). Even the ordinary pictures are striking. In the Gardening section, for example, it is common to find pictures of family homes that have beautifully landscaped yards full of blossoming flowers and colorful plants. In the Home & Design section, one can find nice photographs of home interiors, showing different designs and furniture.<br /><br />One of the most unique qualities of Sunset is the fact that it is published in five different editions. There is a specially designed issue for the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia), Northern California (Northern California and the majority of Nevada), Southern California (Southern California and Hawaii), The Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas area of Nevada), and Rocky Mountain (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah). This is a nice idea and it's one that other magazines should consider emulating. Based on where you live or where you have an active interest, this will be the region that your issue spends its pages covering. My subscription is for the Northern California region, so I am treated each month to articles about places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Reno (Nevada), Lake Tahoe, etc.<br /><br />One of the specialties of this magazine is food and it is common to find recipes throughout every issue. There is a special section set aside for food, but one can expect to find food articles and recipes everywhere as they read. Even the cover page of each issue features a food dish. And as you might guess, the featured recipes are generally those types of cuisine normally associated with each specific region of the west, with plenty of generic recipes thrown in to make sure everyone has something to cook.<br /><br />One of the specialty sections of this magazine that I like is the ""Value Vacation""- a subsection of Travel & Recreation. This section highlights a specific place to travel and then offers a day by day breakdown of things to do and places to see, with the cost for each itemized so you know exactly what to expect. The highlighted city or tourist area can be anyplace in the west and isn't limited to the region that your issue covers. This section is nice because it lets you see in black & white what it will cost for a few days of budget entertainment. It reminds me of some of the television programs shown on the Travel Channel.<br /><br />Advertisements cover about 40 to 50 percent of the pages of each issue and they are often found in bunches in the front and back and on alternating pages for much of the rest of each issue (typical for most magazines). The ads can center on all sorts of different things. Because this is a combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home & garden/living magazine, the ads cover a wide range of products and services, from laundry detergent to credit cards to cat food.<br /><br />Overall, Sunset has proven itself an enjoyable magazine. I don't live in the western United States but this region is my favorite part of the country, so it makes sense that I would find something of value in this publication. I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine. If you're dead set in your ways and refuse to read about anything that deviates from your Eastern, Southern, or Midwestern lifestyle, then you may not like Sunset. But for the majority of people, Sunset has much to offer with pages and pages of eye- catching pictures and friendly articles about life in the American West. [SEP] My Grandmother used to give me all her Sunset Magazines when she was done looking through them. Now my Aunt is carrying on the family tradition of keeping a subscription going.<br /><br />A unique feature in this magazine is the Recipe Index. You can also find ideas for Travel and Recreation, Garden and Outdoor Living, Home and Design and of course Food and Entertaining. The monthly columns are quite unique. Like in the December 2001 issue, Peter Fish wrote an article about The voice of Christmas which is about Bing Crosby.<br /><br />In the middle of the magazine, you can find a postcard that says: Information worth sending for. They do all the work for you...you just have to circle the information number to receive information on everything from International Travel to products you see advertised. They never leave you wondering where to find a unique product as they have a ""Sources: Where to Find It"" section.<br /><br />The Holiday Section always has me dreaming! Who would not want to walk on the Multnomah Falls Trail in Oregon or stand on a log bridge over a river and just dream a day away. Sometimes I would just like to dissolve into some of the pictures. Especially the last issue, where they showed a cabin in the woods with Christmas Lights in Stehekin, Washington.<br /><br />If you live in Washington, this is a MUST HAVE!<br /><br />The January 2002 issue has an article on kayaks and a recipe for French Cream with Blueberry Pudding.<br /><br />Reading this magazine is really almost a family traditon!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review [SEP] Unfortunately, it usually goes home with a patient the first day I put it out.  But it's perfect because it covers a variety of subjects with quick read writing and great illustrations.  I think all waiting rooms should offer multiple copies. [SEP] I live in NYC and recognize the difference between East and West Coast cooking. I find that this magazine is more practical for West Coast cooks.  Though different, both coasts can rest on their own merits. [SEP] It's OK [SEP] Sunset is a pleasure to read. The photographs are amazing and the recommendations are spot on. The recipies are always wonderful too. It's like a min-vacation with every issue! [SEP] My sister who lives in California requests this subscription every year. [SEP] Great magazine.  Great ideas, recipes, articles, and especially interesting on travel & restaurant, activities & attractions in other areas.  I have used this information extensively as I've traveled. [SEP] Always look forward to getting the latest addition of Sunset.  From travel destinations to recipes to travel tips it is a solid read.  My only complaint is I wish they were bi-weekly instead of monthly. [SEP] Wonderful magazine. Girlfriend loves it. A lot about semi-local travel & fab food ideas. Grace & Style.

You can expect the same kind of subjects to be included in National Geographic Kids magazine that you get in the adult version-animals, science, archaeology, and geography-but with technology and pop culture added to the mix too.

Your children can explore ancient civilizations on one page, come face-to-face with exotic wildlife on another, and turn the next page to a make and do project, which is often perfect for homework. There are always plenty of gross/interesting facts about animals that your children are certain to share with you, or they can turn to the page that gives them the low-down on their favorite star.

User Reviews:
We were looking for a magazine for our 4 year old that would allow him to discover new things and let us expose him to the amazing things around him.  National Geographic for Kids sounded perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the magazine turned out to be filled with advertisements and non-educational articles.  At least once per issue, a story is dedicated to an children's movie.  Also, there are lots of ads for video games, many of which contain violent content (just a warning if you are trying to keep your kids away from violent video games).<br /><br />In the end, the magazine seemed more like Saturday morning TV rather than a PBS nature show, which is what we were expecting.  The potential is there, but in all honesty, I think we get more out of flipping through a National Geographic with our son, then we do flipping through a National Geographick Kids.<br /><br />Ranger Rick, Big Backyard are better choices, although they are wildlife/nature specific.  It would be nice if National Geographic really could make a children's version of their adult magazine, keep the substance and throw out the garbage. [SEP] Kids like to read magazines and books as long as they contain visual elements, games, and other things to keep them entertained. They don't even mind a little bit of education and learning as long as it is entertaining in some way. This is why kids' magazines are often so visual and colorful and National Geographic kids is, as expected, a publication loaded with pictures and bright colors. The magazine is focused mainly on animals, but also includes material on science, geography, technology, etc.<br /><br />My girls are big fans of several kids' magazines and they look forward to receiving issues in the mail each month. I like most of them, due to their educational value. But I must take exception to National Geographic Kids magazine. This publication does contain some educational material, but the problem is that the education is minimal, with the remaining pages covered with meaningless fluff and advertisements. The ads are especially annoying because National Geographic Kids intermingles the ads into what seems like an educational article. It is done in a subtle way that you may not even notice at first.<br /><br />National Geographic Kids attempts to break up the educational material with trivia, some photographs, and a few other things, but they are not items I would expect to see in a publication that is supposed to be aimed at children in the later elementary school age years and that is supposed to educate. It is also surprising how thin the magazine is- it seems more like a thick newsletter than a magazine publication.<br /><br />National Geographic itself is a great magazine and I am very surprised that such a quality publication would permit its name to be scarred by the likes of this magazine. It could be so much better with a little work. It isn't like National Geographic doesn't have the resources to make improvements. They have the expertise and the know- how to make a quality kids magazine, but seem content with this publication in its present form, in spite of its many flaws.<br /><br />Kids magazines are plentiful and there are some really good publications available that help teach kids about different subjects in an entertaining way. National Geographic Kids, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The worthwhile material can be isolated to about one- third of the magazine's limited pages and the overall educational value is minimal. Sum everything together and you have a magazine that isn't worth the money and should be avoided. [SEP] Son likes! He is 6 years old and sat still for a while  to enjoy beautiful pictures [SEP] My kids fight over these, they love them so much.  I love hearing the random facts they've learned. [SEP] My Grandkids have gotten 3 copies over a 6 month period., and what they have received are very poor quality.

Great magazine with healthy recipes that are easy and great tasting! Well written articles.  Well worth the money. [SEP] Perfect magazine to learn ways in which to clean up your eating habits.  Well written recipes with healthy ingredients! [SEP] It's okay - has a lot of different articles. Wish it came out more than six times a year.

I will purchase this one for friends in the future because it is full of great tips and yummy recipes. [SEP] Only paid $5 for 1 year! Interesting recipes, have not tried them but planning on doing so. I still like better Everyday Food from Martha Stewart. [SEP] Just ok. [SEP] Gorgeous photography, nice recipes -- fun to read!  I like that they are inclusive of gluten-free vegetarians like me.  And I am stunned and awed by the gorgous photopgrahy -- I have rarely seen a magazine that is so much fun to look at.  Also they seem to really &#34;get&#34; nutrition, which some food magazines do not.  My subscription to this magazine was at a bargain-basement price, so I got an amazing deal! [SEP] I love this magazine. The problem is, though, my daughter also loves it so I can rarely find it without digging through her stuff! The pictures are beautiful, the recipes are delicious, and the articles are very interesting. I don't often purchase magazine subscriptions because I ignore them when they come in the mail, but I will definitely renew this one! I read it cover to cover every time. It's very inspirational and a great price. [SEP] I have been getting this magazine for two years. I love it. I follow an organic and clean eating lifestyle and this is right up my alley. The first year I paid $5 and the second year $10. It always has good recipes, tips, etc. This is for cooks that like to make healthy meals without using processed ingredients. Most of the recipes have been adapted for lower calories and fat, but I would not consider this for someone that is just dieting.

Very practical.  Great ideas. [SEP] Good magazine, but I didn't renew for another year due to so many ads. [SEP] It’s one of two magazine subscriptions I have delivered through snail mail.

User Reviews:
Husband loves it! [SEP] I find that about 10 % of the content actually relates to the common person. Girly men fashion models are strange looking and in need of a Big Mac. This is supposed to make their clothes more appealing ? Yikes. It was the easiest way to use a magazine gift card. Guess next time Ill be more selective. [SEP] I loved esquire, hate where it's gone, hopefully it comes back, I see glimmers of what I loved [SEP] Good all around magazine for men [SEP] I've been a Esquire reader over three years,when my subscription came due,this was a great price for a legendary magazine! [SEP] i thought this was a magazine that would tell me how to be classy. and it does that but having that pit-boss guy on the cover of my first issue was kind of disheartening. OF COURSE HE HAS A CUSTOM SUIT! dont try and sell me on a tailored suit by using a dwarf that still looks like he went to the children's section at JC Penny [SEP] A lot of this magazine is very good.  There are some smart articles in here, and some fun reads.  But to often if the writer or editor is able to pop a political message or bent into an article they will do so.  I don't mind this every so often, but there is a definite heavy bias to the left in this magazine without any counter balance.  I guess it would be the equal of having a liberal watch Fox News all day.  I first really noticed this with their supposed unbiased ""election guide"", it was any thing but laughably biased.  You could tell it was written by a team that was heavily fans of Obama.  It was mostly factual, but doesn't tell the whole truth if you catch my drift.<br /><br />Then lately they have been parading excellent but heavily leftist folk through the covers, (Bill Clinton, Sean Penn, Tina Fey, George Clooney) Nothing in and of itself wrong with those people, but the sum effect between the people they focus on and the article bias; is that if you have views right of center, you are often left out in the cold or ridiculed.  Despite the common leftist bias of magazines, news, television and other media this magazine is a little more in that direction.  I am open minded, but would like a little less politics in such a magazine, and if you are going to go there, even it out occasionally or own up to it!<br /><br />I would think their staff is so heavily leftist that they can even see where they are at.  It is still otherwise a fine magazine, better than most, but your going to enjoy this magazine a whole lot better if you voted for Obama.<br /><br />In the end the political stuff wore on me, and some of the lightly lingerie clad gals who are beautiful gracing the cover, keep it from being coffee table fodder at my family home.  My subscription is now ended. [SEP] Esquire Magazine used to be something I looked forward to each month. Great reporting, terrific features, beautiful and innovative typography and design, and great fiction. Sad to say, over the last three years this magazine has undergone a transformation and become a sorry excuse for what it used to be. Terrible content, lackluster writing, ugly and uninspired design. I couldn’t wait for my subscription to run out, and I have many friends that feel exactly the same way. [SEP] I love this magazine! It seems to be designed for men, but I think it's great for ladies as well. The articles are great, and I love the humor added throughout.

User Reviews:
I love TV Guide and have always been a huge fan.  I was a subscriber years ago but wound up canceling due to the TV show schedule the cable company provides right on the TV. Seemed like a waste of money to subscribe to TV Guide when I could just take a look at the schedule chart right on the TV for free.  But I missed TV Guide and when I spotted a one year subscription  for both print and Kindle for only $20, I couldn't resist and subscribed once again.  I've now received my first issue and I'm thrilled. I really have missed this magazine. Yes, I can see the same TV show schedule right on the TV but I like having the paper magazine by my side to check out the schedule and I especially LOVE to read the articles and look over the TV show rating results.  And, of course, the crossword puzzle! SO happy to have my weekly crossword puzzle back! I do love my Kindle and use it all the time. I like that I have TV Guide access there but I definitely prefer having the actual magazine in my hand to hold and read.  If you are a fan of television, I cannot recommend TV Guide enough.  Definitely a 'must have' for TV watchers and the price can't be beat! [SEP] Only evening listings!  Not much info on the shows.  There must be something better! [SEP] great price point compared to other avenues.  I like this magazine to see what is coming and to see things I need to program to my DVR.  Refuse to watch anything in real time as this way I record and watch when I can and skip commercials on programs my Hopper doesn't offer that feature. [SEP] Great buy! [SEP] Subscription started on time [SEP] I record everything I watch, and am able to do a good job of it with the schedules and articles. [SEP] I live in AZ and it does not fit our time zone nor does it carry our local channel 3.  I probably will not renew [SEP] I subscribed to this TV Guide because our local paper stopped printing a tv guide to go with our paper. I thought this would replace the local tv guide. WRONG. It is like a little Celebrity what's-going-on magazine. When you thumb through all the celebrity stuff, there is a tv guide of sorts. But all the local channels indicate: ""LOCAL PROGRAMMING"" Well, if I didn't know that without this TV Guide!<br />Total waste of money. Wish I could get a refund. Will not subscribe to this for a second year, for sure. [SEP] So far I am liking the printed copy of TV Guide.  It is especially helpful to know what is coming up on tv and for the weekend schedule (Thurs-Sunday), as my local paper does not carry a guide for all the movie channels.  The Kindle version is not too good for me because I cannot make the print large enough to really read with ease. [SEP] Now that our newspapers no longer print the television schedule, we have found this VERY nice.  The only problem is they don't list daytime television programs.","Title: TV Guide Magazine

User Reviews:
Spend HOURS reading this magazine. [SEP] Good information [SEP] I’m honestly torn about what to write in this review. This magazine is for food stylists, not home chefs. It’s absolutely gorgeous and I’ve gotten inspiration from it many times, but it’s also rife with ads for $60 cocktail glasses and weird brands of food you can’t find in a real grocery store.<br /><br />I renew my subscription every couple years when I can pick it up for super cheap, but I don’t get enough serious inspiration from this publication to take it seriously.<br /><br />If you’re pursuing a career in the culinary arts, if you love fancy pictures of fancy food and posh people who passive aggressively make you feel inferior for sometimes using processed ingredients, or if you want to be an edgier Martha Stewart, you’ll love this. If you’re looking for a fun new twist to cook for yourself or a family, try this when it’s on sale and don’t judge yourself for having realistic standards or substituting the reasonably-priced alternative from your normal-person grocer. [SEP] Not even worth a free subscription.

1132,"Title: Harper's Magazine

User Reviews:
Harpers used to be my go-to source for smart, left-leaning political commentary. I loved there book reviews and the short story. However, since Trump got elected it sis the wall anti-Trump network so overflowing with leftist virtue signaling it is nauseating. Not sure what happened. Want to get some counter-intuitive insights? Unfortunately, you will have to look elsewhere as the magazine is nearly 100% Marxist drivel. IT is really shocking how the far left has taken over liberal politics and infected it with the most intolerance, uniform, pro-Marxist rubbish imaginable. I miss the old Harpers greatly.<br /><br />Now it reads like a political tract written by hyperventilating hippies from the 60s. Will it reform once Trump is out of office? Who knows. However, they have shown their true colors–their intoxication of leftist dogma that no sane person who lived throughout the last half of the 20th century cold ever endorse. A truly appalling transformation. [SEP] This is the best magazine on the planet. It's not affordable in comparison to all of the $5 magazine deals on Amazon, but don't let that influence you. This mag is worth the money. In the summer you'll read it on the beach and in the winter you'll read it by the fireplace. The fiction--&#62; the best part! [SEP] Having never read long-form journalism during my teenager years in India, I was quite intimidated by the length of articles in the New Yorker and Harpers Magazine when I first started reading them in 2009. Though the New Yorker initially won me over with their broad mix of political, invstigative, profile and feature writing, it is Harpers  Magazine that I now frequently turn to these days for their insightful and remarkable commentary on a broad range of topics. The writing is brilliant and some of their nonfiction<br />pieces are worth coming back to year after year. [SEP] In June of 1850, a new magazine appeared on the American scene. Created by a New York publishing company called Harper & Brothers, the periodical received the appropriate name ""Harper's Magazine."" Over the years, the magazine began printing articles and stories from American authors, including William Dean Howells, Mark Twain, Theodore Dreiser, John Muir, Jack London, and many other big literary names immediately recognizable to readers of literature. Harper's also published news about the big stories of the day, such as an article written by Henry Stimson defending the use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. Astonishingly enough, the magazine nearly folded in 1980 until several big shots stepped in and rescued the periodical with grant money. Needless to say, Harper's Magazine still chugs along, and I recently subscribed to see what this historic publication looks like today. What I found both elated and bothered me. Harper's Magazine is an entertaining read, if the September 2003 edition is any indication, but at the same time the politics expressed in several of the entries left a slightly sour taste in my mouth.<br /><br />The September issue overflows with articles about politics, book reviews, essays, letters from readers, pictures of artwork, and several excerpts from current literary efforts. There is even a doozy of a puzzle towards the end of the magazine for those who want to test their mental powers. It looks as though the editors of the magazine keep advertising to a minimum (a good thing), and there weren't any of those annoying, and sometimes perfumed, inserts you find in most magazines. Nothing kills a magazine quicker in my mind than detecting waves of some cheap cologne wafting off an article about politics or entertainment.<br /><br />My favorite odor free articles in this issue of Harper's included a travelogue piece about Waziristan, a rugged region in Pakistan where Taliban exiles mix with hostile Pashtun tribes who possess a decidedly anti-American mentality. The article, written by an American woman, is slightly histrionic in its presentation but it is very informative. Sure enough, a week after I read this article someone on the news mentioned the region in the context of American anti-terrorism efforts, and I was happy to know something about it before hand. Another article worth mentioning is an essay about the public school system written by a retired teacher. The author of this piece derides the crushing boredom of the educational system for both students and teachers, and traces the development of our schools back to Prussia in the 18th and 19th century. While I disagreed with his political leanings, I did find his conclusion that our schools serve as factories to churn out good little sheep that only know how to shop relevant and satisfying. My favorite literary excerpt comes from an Israeli journalist named Oz Shelach, who wrote a book called ""Picnic Grounds.""  The excerpts come in bite sized little fragments that shed some insight into the problems between the Israelis and Palestinians, among other topics. Some of the stuff in this issue of Harper's Magazine is good reading material.<br /><br />Regrettably, my politics do not mesh well with the staff at Harper's Magazine. I sighed aloud every time I saw a reference to identity politics, specifically in a literary critique about V.S. Naipaul written by Terry Eagleton. I should be fair and state that I saw a full page advertisement from a group seeking to limit immigration into the United States, and there is a critique of the new Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry that does question the inclusion of several poets who write about nothing except identity themes, so there does seem to be an attempt at balance. Overall, Harper's Magazine is definitely a left oriented publication. I think I can live with it now that I know what to look for in future issues, but for some people this might present a significant problem. One good aspect: while there may be a mess of leftists at the helm of this magazine, at least they still know how to have a laugh. Included in this issue is a description of an Italian board game about women of the night. Based on Monopoly, the Italians call this game ""Puttanopoly,"" and the excerpts taken from the cards in the game are as hilarious as they are inappropriate for this review.<br /><br />After finishing this issue of the magazine, I realized that even though I disagree with its politics, I am still looking forward to receiving my next issue. I read this magazine cover to cover in just a couple of days, and for the most part I felt I learned a lot about various topics in the process. You simply cannot resist the price offered here for a year's subscription, so give Harper's Magazine a chance. No matter what your outlook on life, I guarantee you will find something here to tickle your fancy. [SEP] Lewis H. Lapham was the reason I initially subscribed to Harper's. His template and influence is still present. I enjoy my reading hobby and this magazine touches a lot of my reading hot buttons.<br /> Investigative reporting is my red meat hot botton. Perhaps the best book on that subject is Into The Buzzsaw by Kristina Borjesson. If one reads that, than one understands, what they need to know about a ""free press"". Despite those draw backs(read the book), Harper's manages to touch some hot wires that are ever present in today's envirnoment of elaborate PR facades. For example, the ""global warming' that is allegedly caused by carbon dioxide. Read(google)/ Climate Change: There's Money To Be Made by Ken Silverstein Harper's.<br /> Another hot botton of mine is books/literature, and Harper's not only reviews several books, but selects some for very in-depth anaylses.<br /> Another hot button of mine is science and they have a feature, every month: Findings, which is quite good(short but sweet). Also, some articles, at times, feature science stories.<br /> Another great feature they have every month is their ""Index"" feature, which relates some factual statistics on current topics that are in the public eye.<br /> Another feature is ""Readings"", which is an eclectic assortment of various odds & ends that cover things that one would never imagine to come across.<br /> Perhaps one of the most outstanding reasons to subscribe is Harper's provides access to its vast archives, dating back to 1850! I accessed an article that noted historian Charles Beard wrote in December 1931 titled 'The Myth of Rugged American Individualism'. In it he documented 15 examples of government handouts/subsidies to business when the country was sinking into Depression. It demolished the notion that business had single-handedly achieved the building of the country(or even its own special projects)due to the acumen and strength of character of big American entreneurs, revealing the extent to which government (as funded by the taxpayer) was not just instrumental, but an indespensable participant. Government was engaged in these projects in such a way that corporations were primary beneficiaries to the detriment of the public-such as the elaborate construction of networks of highways favoring the auto industry and Big Oil instead of cheap public transit. The giant businesses have enjoyed tremendous benefits while commanding public policy agenda, distorting public policy priorities and expendatures in ways that are not in (or even against) the public interest. And then, even as they reap immense government subsidies, they have the audacity to preach 'individualism' and self-sufficientcy to the American public, to tell Americans that we should demand nothing /expect nothing from the government we elected to address OUR NEEDS.<br /> This article of the past is representative of what a magazines should writing today. Unfortunately, it is NOT the case.<br /><br /> All in all, a very worthwhile magazine in today's mainstream media full of emptiness. [SEP] So left leaning it's unbelievable,  talk about Fake news!! [SEP] I have read Harpers for over thirty years and have always found it provocative and eclectic enough to entertain many of my interests,  art, literature, poetry, investigative reporting, a refreshing political viewpoint. [SEP] Here's a quick breakdown:<br />1. Harpers will feed your need for the trivial. The Index is a fascinating collection of facts and figures, and the front-of-book section is probably one of the most quirky, laugh-out-loud funny and stimulating in the business.<br />2. Great fiction. Some up-and-comers submit, along with some old pros (a recent story by Joyce Carol Oates was outstanding)<br />3. Great features. Some great topics, albeit a lot of environmental stuff, it's still well-rounded and well-informed. Great ones I've read recently include a look at maids, SUVs, education reform and more.<br />I can see why people might not like this magazine because it appears to be &quot;uppity.&quot; In fact, the only thing that annoys me about this magazine is the letters to the editor, where all of the Ivy-league intellectuals write in and try to prove how smart they are. But I think the appeal is more widespread than that. And you'll be paying less than a dollar an issue -- you'll definitely get your money's worth. [SEP] A quick survey of a typical issue of this magazine will show that it offers well written, leftist oriented writing presented seemingly for an audience of very well off, financially secure urbanites, who if fortunate are ideally situated in Manhattan. The magazine often espouses a leftist critique of our nasty capitalist society and features ads for silly products that only a certain segment of that comfy financially secure class of educated professionals who receive much benefit from that nasty capitalism could consider acquiring. Having said as much, I am a repeat subscriber and enjoy the fine, creative and often insightful writing. Features like Thomas Frank's, cranky, snarky and entertaining ""Easy Chair"", ""Harper's Index"" and ""Findings"" alone make the magazine worth a subscription. The fact that there is such a variety of literature to read in each issue from poetry to investigative journalism also make this a magazine to have. [SEP] [Harpers began before the Civil War and is still a wonderful read, whatever the topic: politics, literature, fine or performing arts....everything!![ASIN:B00005N7QO Harper's Magazine]]","Harper's Magazine, established in June of 1850 by Harper & Brothers, has a rich history of featuring articles and stories from renowned American authors such as Mark Twain and Jack London.

Entrepreneur magazine is one of my favorite business publications and it's the type of magazine I can count on for up- to- date information on business startups and for possible resolutions of common problems to the small business owner. A monthly publication, this magazine is designed to appeal to those who are presently owners of a small enterprise or who aspire to open their own business in the near future.<br /><br />What I enjoy most about this magazine are its personal articles- stories about ordinary people like you and me who have successfully started a new business venture. These people share their success stories with the reader, offering insight on what strategies helped them reach their present level of success and what challenges they still face. The people featured in the articles are more down to earth types who own smaller companies, making the magazine more realistic and something I and others can better relate to. Many other business magazines spend too much time interviewing billionaire CEO's and others who, while they may have some interesting stories to share, live lifestyles and have problems that only someone of their stature can relate.<br /><br />On the practical side, Entrepreneur contains many timely articles about common issues/problems/challenges that arise when you own your own company. Money, marketing, management, and other key topics are covered in each issue, with a regular department for these critical aspects of business ownership. In these sections, you can learn about tax law changes, legal issues with benefits, and other related topics.<br /><br />Entrepreneur organizes each issue quite nicely, with colored tabs on the pages that indicate which section (money, technology, marketing, etc.) they pertain to. This makes it that much easier to sift through, to find the information you need. And there is a section titled ""Sources"" that helps to index the different services and companies mentioned in each issue.<br /><br />Overall, this is a useful, practical magazine that can come in very handy for present business owners and for those who have an interest in proprietorship.

703,"Title: Cook's Illustrated

User Reviews:
The recipes and information is great in Cook's Illustrated. The only really bad thing is that it's not in color. When they're comparing the a burnt bread to a well cooked bread it would be easier to see it if the photo was in color. [SEP] I have been a long time CI subscriber both magazine and web. They teach viable, updated techniques for a hoard of main ingredients. I like the publication for its lack of advertisements and honest, no-nonsense character. Background and trial and error information is shared for featured recipes and that makes interesting reading. Every CI recipe I've ever tried is successful to a basic extent. But many, like other recipe sources, lack the results to warrant the titles CI endows on them like ""ultimate"" and ""Best ever"". About half the recipes are simply lackluster. Most of the recipes have no consideration for nutrition and all lack nutrition information.<br /><br />I agree with all the critical reviews here concerning the tactics of the publisher. Most disturbing is my latest subscription debacle. According to CI I had ""auto subscribed"", but after checking (yes I kept the paperwork) I had not. They didn't send me any reminders, nor did they have my credit card information to just bill me. Instead, after sending me 2 issues beyond the expiration date of the old subscription, they sent me overdue notices. I called the customer service and told the rep how disappointed I was that the publisher uses these tactics. They agreed to cancel immediately (of course) and that is that, I'll never subscribe to CI again, it's just not acceptable to try to trick your way into continued business.<br /><br />The website is really convenient and I do maintain that subscription for now. Like other reviewers stated, you still don't get access to ""Editors Pics"", the so called best of the best. Another shady tactic to bilk more money from you.<br /><br />To CI: What's more important (and profitable), Keeping lifelong customers through a good magazine (which it is) and honest business practices or constantly trying to scam your way into more subscriptions? Why don't you put that in the test kitchen and see how it bakes up? [SEP] While I am not professionally trained, I have attended many advanced cooking classes over the years and have built up a fairly decent repertoire of skills. I am proud to say I receive consistent praise for my platings and have been asked to demonstrate techniques or help out at parties. My wife loves to boast about her ""live-in-chef"". (She just told me to put that in) ;) If you are someone like me or an aspiring enthusiast and would like to understand why food prepared with the same ingredients but with different technique will taste different, this is the magazine for you.<br />  Additionally, the product comparisons have, I my opinion, have been spot on. Yes, other magazines feature products but none of the others really test and compare them against each other for fear of insulting their advertisers. Which brings up a another point: The reason the other magazines cost less is because their budget is subsidized by advertising.<br />  If you want lots of enticing pictures, mountains of advertising, recipes with little background or technique and want to save 8 dollars a year you could buy a different magazine and probably be happy with it.  If you really want to be a better cook, buy Cook's Illustrated. [SEP] I am a 'challenged' cook but have learned dozens of tips,methods and great recipes from these classy and informative magazines.  I bought a subscription for my son, who is a fabulous cook (possibly out of necessity) and he scours each issue from cover to cover.  We both love them. [SEP] I subscribed to Cooks Magazine some years ago, back when it  began publishing again.  I had problems with issues that failed to arrive, and wrote to them about it - never received a reply or any note of concern.<br /><br />Since that time, I occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest.  Even by dint of casual glance, I've begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone takes me on a torturous journey through the addition/deletion of various ingredients in order to finally arrive at the ""perfect recipe"". I now skip right to the ""perfected"" recipe, and decide whether its worth committing to memory.  I should mention that some of the ""perfect"" recipes are mediocre - after all of that torment and flailing around.  Some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are not well thought out.  They should keep a copy handy of one of Harold McGee's excellent books on the Science of Cooking.<br />There are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me:<br /><br />1.  Product Reviews:  They range from just plain wrong to idiotic.<br /><br />The KitchenAid Pro 600 stand mixer was hailed by Cook's as the best in its class for many mixing chores.  Yet, Amazon reviews tell a different tale - one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gearbox cover that deforms and finally comes apart, a fatal event that allows the metal gears to separate.<br /><br />Christopher Kimball (the editor) once made an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight.  No, I'm not joking.  In that evaluation, Le Creuset was deemed a good buy simply because it was heavy, and therefore cost the least per pound.  All-Clad, even though it conducts heat very evenly, suffered for not having as much heft, and therefore was judged pricey on a pound weight basis.  I might add that I have Le Creuset and All-Clad - both have great heat distribution - but why penalize a saucepan if it can distribute heat as well at half the weight?  It seems as if Mr. Kimball likes to come up with comparisons just for the sake of developing ratings, but not necessarily to measure anything relavent.<br /><br />One issue of Cooks boasted on its cover ""Unsweetened chocolate -supermarket brand beats others"".  Apparently, Hershey's was designated best.  Not too many months later, Callebaut Unsweetened was recommended above all others, and Hershey's was judged barely acceptable.  Feeling manipulated yet?  I've always used Callebaut unsweetened and bittersweet in cooking.  Pity the poor soul to takes these capricious ratings seriously and sprints out to the store to buy the latest and greatest, only to find that the same product is at the bottom of the list a few months later.<br /><br />2.  Finally, there are those dreadful editorials by Mr. Kimball.  Rambling, painfully written, Mr. Kimball seems to be a Garrison Keilor wanna-be.  I recommend that he take a lesson or two on writing from Ruth Reichl.  In contrast, Mr. Kimball writes as if he is chanelling Helen Gurley Brown, but donning red and black flannel watch-plaid and without her sense of play.  If I read another story about 'old Mr. Jeepers' down the road or the local square dance....yawn. [SEP] Gift at Xmas for a lost friend.

My mother-in-law has a subscription to this magazine and gives me her copies when she is done with them. The last one I read was from July/August 2011. This magazine has stories about hanging clothes on clotheslines and canning vegetables. Since I grew up overseas in Africa this magazine appeals to me since it talks about things from my childhood. I'm only 47 but it is like I lived 100 years ago. The advertisements in this magazine do seem geared for people in their 70s and beyond. What I love reading is the Wanted ads. A lot of people are looking for old friends or for items to make their lives more fun.

I opted out of receiving any mail other than the magazine.  I still get junk mail to my home.  I know that this is the source because it is addressed to the person I got the magazine for.  I called and asked to take my name off of their mailing lists.  I still get junk mail.  I am paying for the magazine.  I don't need to pay a second time by receiving junk in the mail.  It is not People Magazine, but the distributor used by Amazon.  I would suggest finding a more reputable distributor, and not to buy any magazines through Amazon.

Why are we into reading about other peoples lives. People that really have no meaning to us. And why have a magazine about people that for the most part are pretty degenerate and is usually just back-fence gossip?I think if people paid more attention to their own families and tried improving on that one aspect of life, magazines like this would go out of business.  These magazines serve no real purpose,,,,and don't say entertainment!  If you want entertainment read a book, watch the History channel, see a good clean movie.

Lots of info and pictures we've not found in other magazines, we learn a lot every month. [SEP] Well done. Thanks. [SEP] Way more ads than content.<br /><br />Unfortunately this magazine does not keep my attention long enough to justify the price. [SEP] This review is on the magazine Smithsonian and not the Amazon subscription or subscription process.<br /><br />The Smithsonian is a very intriguing magazine.  While it centers around the Smithsonian's world, it will take you, as an explorer to archaeological sites and discoveries worldwide.  From the comfort of your easy chair, recliner or couch, you can journey the world and back in as little as a few minutes to several hours, depending on how much you might read and your actual reading habits.  (I know I often get interrupted while trying to read a story.)<br /><br />This is well written, professionally written material.  This sates the explorer in us all and allows us to see, for the price of subscription, things I could never afford to see or place to go in life.  While having spent 20+ years in the U.S. Navy and being quite well traveled from it, I don't often come across articles of things I've seen or places I've been.  I'm saying this in a positive way.  I've been quite broadened in my &quot;travels&quot; because of this. [SEP] As of today the purchase still HAS not shown up on my KINDLE magazine subscription site.  And, it still has not been added to my ongoing subscription for Smithsonian.  So, I honestly cannot decide if it is or was a good move.  It is cheaper, but do I have a new added subscription??

I probably shouldn't have been, but I was shocked at how much popular pseudo-science and opinion are injected into otherwise sound articles.  They are clearly intended to persuade and that is not the role of science.  So, mostly what I have Discovered is another tool of the demagogues.

Back then, the advice was a little mature for me as it was catered to men in their early forties and I was only in my twenties. But now, I wanted to give GQ a try. Instead of being filled with advice on how to remain a gentleman, how to be an upstanding citizen in society, how to find the latest trends in clothes or how to keep a classic, etc. It's become a super nuanced sub-sub culture magazine seemingly written by 19-year-olds. Now before you criticize my review, I will state that there are some legitimate, well thought out articles but these are few and far between. A couple of articles I read are interviewing self-absorbed, dare I say cocky subjects - and the worst part is the interviewer goes along with it! I feel like it's catered to extremely young people and even though I constantly stay up to date and are usually hip to the latest trends and the latest technology, I sometimes find myself shaking my head and wondering what the hell I'm reading with GQ.

Lots of good advice and i always read everything.  The recipes are easy. [SEP] I have renewed my subscription numerous times as I think Real Simple has so many good ideas that I have used!  And when I traveled I missed getting my monthly magazine! [SEP] I am wheelchair bound but can do everything except walk and I have all my brain cells so  I always add new magazines to my many subscriptions as I seldom get out and I love to read. This magazine is a total waste to me. Very little things of interest unless you like reading ads! As a new subscriber to RS I will definitely not renew. When I get it in the mail it takes me about 5 minutes to flip through it and then it hits the trash can. I do not even recycle by passing it on to my friends either. Just plain junk. Recipes don't even sound interesting and ""tips"" are archaic or stupid. Junk, Junk and more Junk. Sorry RS but you are not for me. [SEP] I really love the comparisons for consumer goods. It could use an article of interest every now and then. [SEP] Good read [SEP] Best magazine<br />Short sweet articles that get to the point [SEP] This was a perfect opportunity to enjoy this magazine.

User Reviews:
The information was exactly what I wanted to see and the extra stories are quite informative.  I'll definitely renew when the time comes. [SEP] I have subscribed to TV Guide for decades. I was initially leery when the large format came along some time ago, but it just gets better all the time. I have come to depend on TV Guide's reviews of existing and new TV shows--most especially its detailed information about the fall, spring and summer lineups of new shows--to help me choose what I will record on my DVR. I also enjoy the many interviews with TV stars that TV Guide offers each week.<br /><br />Always in the past when subscribing directly with TV Guide, I paid with a paper check and used snail mail--something I almost never do for anyone any more. Now I don't have to do it for TV Guide either! It is so wonderfully convenient to now subscribe through Amazon. After you order your subscription, Amazon communicates with TV Guide to let them know if you have an existing subscription, which I do. Your new subscription is tacked onto the end of your existing subscription through TV Guide.<br /><br />When ordering my subscription here on Amazon, I was careful to supply a shipping address with my name and street address exactly as they appear on my TV Guide mailing label. For good measure, I included my TV Guide existing subscription number as part of that address to make it easier for the subscription department of TV Guide to combine my new subscription through Amazon with my existing one. [SEP] Great price for a good magazine [SEP] There is no Tv listings  times during the day, only for the evening, and it ends at 10:30 pm.  The whole first half of the mag. Is mostly ads.  I  hate it and won't waste my money.  It is definately not user friendly! [SEP] I have been reading this since my teens and really enjoy it. I love getting magazines on Amazon as they take care of the renewal every January and I can ignore the 37 renewals that come every month [SEP] Program my TV two weeks using my TV Guide.  This way I don't miss any programs I really want to watch! [SEP] You get to read ""just enough"" news about the upcoming programs due to be on TV and get to see a program of most of the shows to be on TV. The only magazine that I purchase in print form. [SEP] Very handy to have the digital edition as we have a second home, and don't always remember to take the print edition with us. [SEP] Great inside information on tv shows or series.<br />Tells you what is a repeat or new. Nothing better. My food store is always sold out so now I subscribe [SEP] I’ve been using the TV Guide now for the last three months and I love it I don’t miss any of my programs and I don’t have to watch channel 99 for 20 minutes to see what’s on.","Title: TV Guide Magazine

User Reviews:
This Old House is a magazine dedicated to home improvement. Based on the popular PBS television program, this magazine aims to help its readers find new and better ways to improve the home and perform routine maintenance.<br /><br />Magazines and the internet are my primary sources when home repair reaches the critical point. This Old House is one of several magazines I like to read and it is the one I turn to most frequently when I need to find out about home maintenance. The majority of other home- related publications deal strictly with enhancements, remodeling, and general improvement. This Old House offers these types of articles, along with articles on general home repair, landscaping techniques, utility cost savings, and more.<br /><br />My favorite departments in This Old House are ""Around the House"", ""Toolbox"", and ""Salvage"". The last department, Salvage, sounds boring at first but it often gets very creative. This department selects a common household item- usually one that is probably slated to get tossed in the trash- and points out a creative way to re- use the item. Some of the ideas they come up with are surprising, making this one of the first sections I turn to when I get a new issue in the mail.<br /><br />Some parts of This Old House are not appealing at all, either because the suggestions are far too costly for someone like me; because they involve skills that I do not possess; or a combination of the two. The Luxury department is one such area. Another is the Design sections. These areas are intended for the more advanced home improver who has advanced skills at home design. There are some very expensive suggestions, too, and these parts of the magazine provide more fantasy reading than anything. However, there are still enough less expensive ideas to keep the magazine useful and practical.<br /><br />Overall, This Old House is a good magazine that offers some home improvement ideas, some repair suggestions, and some ways to enhance your home's value. The general repair advice is pretty handy and while I don't have much use for other parts of the magazine, I can agree that these are helpful to the right type of person. It makes This Old House a good publication for those who seek advice for home repair and home enhancement. [SEP] I bought a subscription of this magazine via Amazon all the way back in 2005, and she's asked for it ever year since! She's difficult to buy gifts for so this one was a great find. I still find copies at her house whenever I visit.<br /><br />What's cool is that she's actually used info from the magazine for at least three home improvements (two interior and one exterior). So, it's fun to know this magazine isn't just collecting dust as a coffee table decoration, but actually provides practical, useful information. [SEP] We have a 1920's house and have gotten a lot of inspiration from this magazine. Nice layout, great to flip through. [SEP] This is a magazine for paid product-placement in articles, tons of ads, and so-so articles.  You are paying for the name, and getting much less in return.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend [[ASIN:B000063XJR Fine Homebuilding]] instead of This Old House.  You will not only see fabulous new and old construction, but actually take something away from it (that is the point behind magazines, right?)  A magazine that actually saved me money!<br /><br />I'm cancelling my subscription to T.O.H. and adding another year onto my Fine Homebuilding subscription.  It's money well spent. [SEP] If you're looking for d.i.y. information on maintenance and minor repairs for your old house, skip this one. As the publisher says, it's pretty much all about major restorations by professionals, and there's very little the average homeowner could even participate in, let alone do on his or her own. If you want to learn how an architect chooses historically correct replacement windows for your old ones that stick, buy &quot;This Old House.&quot; If you just want to know how to get the old ones unstuck, move on to &quot;Family Handyman.&quot; [SEP] We have had this magazine before and really like it.  We renewed at Amazon because of the more reasonable price.  The renewal has not started so unable to rate at the efficiency of the company to set up the renewal to continue the original subscription. [SEP] My hubby's favorite magazine that he keeps in his library - the bathroom. He gets so many ideas and gets inspiration to make our humble home beautiful. He's happy and that makes us happier! [SEP] look forward to each issue [SEP] Great magazine for any homeowner, whether you have a new or old house.  It is full of tips and information that are applicable to any house.  Any issue I open has valuable information that I can use.  It is presented in an interesting way so that it is fun to read.

User Reviews:
I read every issue of The New York.  I am getting it weekly for a total of only $5.00.  This is the best magazine value out there. [SEP] I knew when I subscribed that I was getting the Kindle version and that there would be an expensive auto renewal. I'm okay with it, but I wouldn't be if I hadn't known what to expect.<br /><br />I am willing to pay what I consider to be an exorbitant price for a magazine (omg!) because the writing and the reporting are stellar. I'm not a grammar or spelling fascist, which should be obvious from this review (and all of them). However, when writers are being paid for their work, and copy editors are being paid to correct it, I expect to see very few errors. And no really terrible ones. This magazine does pretty well, which means that I will pay what it takes to keep excellent writers and editors employed.<br /><br />As for the content? The reviews, fiction, and poetry are the main draws for me. The news articles are well-researched and well-written, but they come from clear points of view (i.e., they are not strictly objective). I guess that's okay, since they do not pretend otherwise. Either way, I recommend the magazine for its form and most of its content. [SEP] I had  nothing in common with the people in the stories.  I did not and do not speak the same language--of sophistication. I canceled the subscription. [SEP] Good  to actual read again.

I've been getting this magazine for about five years now and it's still my favorite magazine for truly relaxing.  The calming colors and scenes make problems fade away.  The houses and rooms are ones you can see yourself living in.  I tend to book-ear and research at least one page out of every issue.  An number of pages have made it to my save folder.<br /><br />Also, very few advertisements or at least you like the ads because they go with the theme of the magazine. [SEP] had this magazine for years but never paid such a price. so sorry but will throw this offer in the trash ! [SEP] Even though I don't live on the coast, we visit North Padre Island fairly often, and we lived near Corpus for many years.  I will probably renew this one. [SEP] When I receive my issue I get to pretend for a while that it's not raining and dreary outside my window - and that I can afford to live in the magnificent homes shown in the magazine. Paper quality is nice. Photos are beautiful. Design ideas are endless - but don't expect to be able to afford to buy most of the items shown in the magazine.

User Reviews:
This is a great magazine - buy it anywhere but from the source. If you do go ahead and get a subscription, be prepared to receive books and 'specials' you haven't ordered as 'previews'.  Of course they offer a preview period, which is usually over by the time you actually get whatever it is they sent you. Also be wary of ordering books or DVD's from them. I ordered a DVD and kept getting unsolicited  books from CI for a year. The material is pretty good, although not particularly healthy - usually high in fat and calories. It's the company and it's sales approach that is aggravating. [SEP] At one point I was paying for seven gift subscriptions a year.  But every year they would start telling me it was time to renew months in advance and they would screw up the billing and payment.  Accessing your account online has gotten better but they are nowhere near as clear as Amazon is about keeping up with subscriptions and you don't have the option to cancel online.  I tried just letting the orders expire but they would send me letters thanking me for new subscriptions I hadn't made and saying they were extending the subscriptions ""on credit"".  They also charge a steep price for online access with no discount for people who also have print subscriptions.<br /><br />If you subscribe through Amazon, you might not have all of those problems but I've decided to just go with online access. [SEP] Unsubscribing from Cook's Illustrated is almost impossible. You can write, you can phone, but once they get your credit card number, the magazines and the bills just keep coming. [SEP] This review is on the magazine Cook's Illustrated and not the Amazon subscription or subscription policy.<br /><br />Cook's Illustrated is the Consumer Reports(tm) of the food world.  They are indepth and take their time to figure out the workings of a recipe.<br /><br />All recipes are well thought out, well written -and let me tell you, as a professional I've seen poorly written recipes- and darned tasty recipes.  Again, as a professional, I have seen these recipes to work for both home and the restaurant.  This is about as good as it gets. [SEP] I have had a subscription, but I cancelled it because I have too<br />many mags. coming.  However, I found and old on, so I decided<br />to subscribe again.  But this is a gift for my nephew, who loves<br /> to cook.  I'm sure he will love it [SEP] In an age when any schmuck celebrity with perfect teeth can put out a goofy themed cookbook, there are very few breaths of fresh air, very few publications that a novice can trust to help get a good meal on the table. As Julia Child discovered many years ago when she was first learning to cook, most cookbooks are awful! And the situation's only gotten worse in our modern age of celebrity ""chefs"" with no training, no understanding of the science in cooking, and absolutely no appreciation for good food.<br /><br />That's why we need this magazine. Cook's Illustrated (and its Best Recipe books and ""Cook's Country"" super-newbie heritage-food magazine) has been one of my Bibles of cooking ever since I was in college. The articles are fascinating and educational; the recipes are straightforward and generally easy to make; the reviews are rock-solid and reliable. I love reading about how the writers went about finding the perfect recipe for whatever it is they're trying to make. Best of all, the recipes rarely require exotic equipment or ingredients. A decently tricked-out kitchen with knives, a blender, and appropriate pots and pans will manage most of these; a food processor is nice, but you can skate by without. Though the magazine expects you to be able to do the basic stuff like whisk or slice raw vegetables, it provides illustrations for anything that might be less-well-known.<br /><br />Best of all, this magazine is one that has not suffered ""mission drift"" over the years. It's never taken advertisements, and it completely lacks the ""lifestyle"" idiocy that plagues just about every one of the other cooking magazines on the market. CI knows that if I wanted to read about yoga or makeup, I'd go read one of those ""women's magazines."" I want to learn about cooking, so they give me nothing but articles about cooking. Yay!<br /><br />If you need a cooking magazine that will help you learn and grow in skill, this is a good one.<br /><br />(PS: I've had subscriptions off and on for about a decade and haven't had any trouble with junk mail. I did have a direct marketer call about a cookbook, but declined and haven't heard anything in the year since.) [SEP] Very good source of ideas and trying new ways to cook [SEP] If you enjoy cooking, or want to learn, this is hands down the best cooking magazine there is! No advertisements. Each recipe is tested in several ways to find the best and tastiest way to make something. Has great tips, and recommendations on kitchen gadgets, tools, or ingredients. In black and white, except the inside back cover is a color picture of each of the recipes in that issue. [SEP] I love Cooks Illustrated magazine.  The illustration are gorgeous, and I find that I read it cover to cover, and I don't usually do that with magazines.  Loads of helpful tips, product reviews, and recipes.

I decided to get a subscription to this magazine and discovered that it's nothing but ads with a few blah recipes with obscure ingredients.

I am a Vietnsm Veteran and at this stage of life I wanted a magazine that reflected things that I grew up through; those changes that seem so common. I guess I was looking for a magazine that reflected the past like Ctacker Barrel does in their restaurants. This is full of short comments from senders, very little photos or reflections from our past and nothing to sit and show my kids that this was my life. This will give you a heads up. I just wanted to remember something of the past beside Vietnam, Riots etc. That washing machine. That television. The grocery store. The simple life [SEP] My favorite magazine of all time. It's a great stroll down memory lane. [SEP] nothing I liked. Not a thing is like it used to be. Was in the past an awesome magazine. So sorry I ordered it. Just a worthless magazine with nothing to reminisce about. Anyone can write crap up about the 50's and 60''s. Common stuff that nearly all know. Used to so love this magazine. Had such greay stuff yrs ago. Now not even paper for a fireplace fire starter. [SEP] Purchased as a gift - recipient is enjoying content [SEP] While I was at the far end of the age bracket this is aimed at, I still found  quite a bit of details that were part of my early childhood.  And it gave me a better appreciation for the period before I was born as well. [SEP] Wife likes [SEP] Beautiful magazine full of great information and beautiful pictures [SEP] I now reminisce about the days when Reminisce was my absolute favorite magazine. I was a subscriber right from the beginning. In fact it is the only one I repeatedly and eagerly re-subscribed to. But after the death of dear Clancy Strock, the editing and format of Reminisce changed dramatically and for the worse. I remember the first time I noticed it. I was paging through the issue in disbelief. Gone were the colorful and chock-full pages of cleverly written reader stories, tidbits, poems and whatnot. Instead, I found wasteful double-page spreads of a single enlarged photo. And dozens upon dozens of stock celebrity photos. Huh?? This was supposed to be a READER-written magazine that specialized in readers submitted  memories and photos. But with the new format, reader photos and stories are sparse. Suddenly staff written articles about old movie stars and such appeared. No thanks. I let my subscription lapse and haven't renewed. I hope the publishers read these low star reviews and know that the changes they've made were at sacrifice of their most dedicated and valuable subscribers.  Bring back the good ol' magazines, Reminisce!! [SEP] Bought as a present for Mom.  She requested I not renew the subscription.  In her words, the articles review information she already knows about.

I love it [SEP] I like reading about the tv shows and celebrities that I like.  Full of good gossip.

Nothing too deep, it is also a good source of new movies, TV shows, books etc. [SEP] Yes, Entertainment Weekly has been a MONTHLY magazine for quite some time now, since it was bought by new publishers.  Yet they don't change the name.  So if you think you are getting an issue on a week, nope!  You're getting only 1/4 the number of issues you think you are.

Through the first 8 issues I received - 3 were double issues. What it is closer to is 3 issues a month (with one being a double issue). So plan accordingly.

User Reviews:
I have been a subscriber for many years. More than I care to count! This year, however, will be my last.<br /><br />The magazine has been overhauled. It used to be full of fabulous recipes, travel stories about food, wine information ... everything you needed to really get to know and create food. Now, it is no better than a 30 minute Rachel Ray show. In other words, you'll get something to eat but it won't be special and you won't learn anything if you are already an accomplished cook.<br /><br />The design used to be clean and simple. Now, it is cluttered and might as well have a feed running across the bottom.<br /><br />Instead of it being a magazine for people who love to truly embrace the culinary arts, it has become just another magazine about food. Very sad.<br /><br />If you are just starting to cook, you might enjoy this magazine. If you can put together a meal without a box or can ... it is really not for you anymore. [SEP] The magazine is okay, but impractical for me. A lot of the recipes are expensive to make or take up a lot of time. I received this magazine for a year and never once made a recipe in it because of the expense, mainly. Most of the recipes do sound good but this magazine is just not made for a person without a lot of time or money. [SEP] I have been subscribing to Bon Appetit for close to 10 years and I decided to write this review because I feel the magazine has really changed...for the worse...over the last 2 years. I used to love BA because the recipes were fantastic, ideal for entertaining, mostly easy and/or fast, with a few exceptions, and not too ""fancy"" with hard to find ingredients and things that a lot of people, just don't cook. It seems like the magazine has become much more ""high end"", more like Gourmet , which I don't like. I love to cook but I don't like to spend hours and hours searching for ingredients and standing over the stove everytime I decide to do so. [SEP] No problem except that the new subscription started before the previous one ended resulting in duplicate copies being delivered and, no doubt, only eleven months benefit (or less) from the new subscription. [SEP] NEW REVIEW! I take back what I said before about my sister liking this magazine. I mean, she likes it OK, but she says the articles are strange and only marginally cooking-related. She doesn't like how there are more ads than actual magazine content, and she was confused about the products being highlighted, as they are things even kitchen-gadget collectors (like my sister) kind of scratch their heads at.<br /><br />Wish I could change the star rating to 2 stars. [SEP] I have always enjoyed bon appitit magazine and couldn't resist the special price. It is a great magazine with lots of down-to-earth recipes and interesting information. However, I am somewhat perplexed that, 2 issues into my 1 year subscription, I got a notice saying that I have one issue remaining on my subscription. [SEP] I take several cooking magazines and I like this one the best.  Gourmet seems to have recipes that are a bit gourmand, that need ingredients that you will need to do a search for, while this isn't entirely bad, sometimes you want to make something that is in your cupboards.  I like that these recipes are everyday recipes that have been taken up a level or two.  Articles are informative, with discussing a particular food, ingredient, or technique.  I love the artistic photography.  This strikes me as a balance between Gourmet, and Cooking Illustrated.  This beats cooking illustrated for the photography and the depth of the recipes in each issue.  I highly recommend this one! [SEP] I've recently started reading my Bon Appetit from cover to cover just because everything is so good (pictures, recipes, articles, etc...).  Having three small busy children, my time is limited for meals during the week and my favorite section of this book is ""Fast Easy Fresh"".  I can always find a few recipes that are easy to make yet edible in the eyes of my children.  My second favorite section is ""Readers' Timesaving Recipes"".  These readers seem to share the same type of lifestyle as me (limited kitchen time) and they submit very yummy, quick recipes that I can whip up in no time.<br /><br />My husband and I believe that dinnertime as a family is so important to the well-being of our children that making meals that require endless preparation and cooking just isn't a priority for us.<br /><br />I also love to entertain and have dinner parties so the new column that begins in the April 2005 issue entitled ""Party Improv"" is a great addition.  I like that they give big, delicious ideas with little effort... including suggestions for table settings, cocktail concoctions, music, wine and a complete menu for your party!!!  They thought of it all!<br /><br />I highly suggest getting your subscription today so you don't miss out on any future issues! [SEP] A fancy food magazine. Interesting articles but odd recipes. It would be nice for those looking to really expand their cooking tastes but I found it not so useful for my kitchen. [SEP] THEY RUINED MY VINTAGE CAST IRON PAN. I followed their directions exactly, to the letter, for how to season a cast iron pan. The first and only time after that when I tried to brown something a bunch of black chunks came off the pan and it obviously was ruined. I wrote to them 4 times to request some kind of compensation or replacement. They never even offered an apology. Absolutely no excuse. See photo for the wreckage.Those black pieces you see are not from meat browning-they came off the pan. I am SO angry.","Title: Bon Appetit Print Magazine

User Reviews:
Being new to the Apple experience I thought this might be helpful. It is not. I am not the most computer savvy person but I do use a windows based PC with the standard Office apps every day. This magazine assumes a higher level of MAC awareness then I possess. I was hoping for more of an introduction to using the different mac apps. I will not renew this. [SEP] This magazine provides useful information for Mac users.  Sure you can get lots of information on the web but first you have to know you want it and then decide whether to trust the information you get.  MacLife is good adjunct to the Internet.<br /><br />FYI... I do not consider myself a ""power"" user but I do use my iLife and iWork applications every day. [SEP] none [SEP] I have been subscribed for little over a year now (no discs on my magazines though - they must have phased this out). I look forward to the day my Mac Addict arrives as it is always full of great tips to make life easier. A must have for anyone who owns a Mac, this magazine contains useful tips, troubleshooting, guides to free downloads, and loads of tech support. I especially love the Q&A section, and find that this part is the most useful to my day to day computing needs. I have just renewed my subscription for another year! [SEP] This magazine was purchased on a gold box last time it was offered (before today 4/8). I got it and it is an OK magazine but has many of the same articles and many times they just seem irrelevant by the time they finally hit the shelves. I won't buy again even for a few bucks a year.... [SEP] If you're looking for a macintosh magazine and can't afford subscribing to Macworld, MacDesign, and MacAddict, get MacAddict. Not only has it been redesigned from the ground up, but they got rid of their insipidly stupid mascot Max in the review section. No longer are we faced with the blech, freakin' awesome, etc... of this tiresome cartoon character.<br />But more than that are its features, reviews (that everyone can understand), games sections, get info, and more. It's irreverant, fun, sometimes a little too juvenile, but you get the impression that the people who run this magazine LOVE using macs. I never got that impression from the other mac magazines (except maybe MacDesign) or from any PC magazine on the market.

User Reviews:
Harper's is easily my second favorite fashion magazine, second only to InStyle.  It is great and packed with great fashion.  It actually does have some good articles too that I thoroughly enjoy reading.  (The articles are MUCH better than the ones in Elle.)  If you can only get one sub, get InStyle.  If you can get two, get InStyle and Harper's Bazaar.  It is well-worth the money. [SEP] Lots of perfume samples, can't beat the price.  I like it.  :)  When I am finished with the issues I upcycle them to my Son's Head-start for cutting and pasting. [SEP] 95% of the magazine are ads!! I bought this subscription for $5 but still wasn't worth it, decided to cancel after first month. [SEP] Though I have never been into looking fashionable myself, I find fashion photos beautiful, and if you feel the same way, this is the magazine for you! I love looking through the magazine each month. It is HUGE compared with every other magazine I've seen in the past--much thicker. There aren't many articles in it compared with advertisements, and I don't care at all because the advertisements are really pretty and I like them just as well as the content of the magazine. I really like drawing the pictures in the magazines for drawing practice, too, or as reference for drawings. I have no complaints with this magazine. My recommendation is to order it during Black Friday--this is when I ordered mine, and I got a full year subscription for only $5, no strings attached, which was awesome and well well well worth it. [SEP] Very chill magazine full of luxury ads and this awesome feature where a famous fashion wacko narrates 24 hours in their shoes. [SEP] Over the top fashion and articles. One can't relate to their products. [SEP] I ordered this magazine because is it amazing and lots of articles to read, besides viewing the new fashion. [SEP] Not reviewing Harper's Bazaar so much (I've been a reader for years) but rather subscribing through Amazon.  Placing my order was very easy and I was able to pay with my Amazon store credit card.  I have received two issues so far.  They began arriving exactly when order processing said they would and are perfect condition.  In pre-Covid days I enjoyed purchasing a group of magazines on a trip to the local bookstore but now it's much safer (and less expensive) to have a mail subscription. [SEP] Hi! Love this magazine. [SEP] I love the magazine, the photos are stunning and it is the perfect distraction when I am running on the treadmill. I deducted a couple of stars because it took the publisher an inordinate amount of time to fulfill my subscription. I got my first issue well after the promised arrival date window. I opened a ticket and did not receive a response. A couple of weeks later it arrived.","Title: Harper's Bazaar Print Magazine

Fav magazine! [SEP] I did not want to renew this magazine but did not have an option to cancel [SEP] We have been long subscribers to Sunset, but in the past few years the size, topics, especially gardening related, photos, paper quality & even the ink & typestyle have dropped dramatically. By the time you skip the numerous ads & yes, they have to make money from those to offer the major bargains they do on a yearly subscription, there's not much left.  Back in the say, it was a THICK, loaded monthly that we looked forward to receiving, but now, it's flipped through in 15 minutes & put into the recycle pile.  Sad [SEP] i love it.  sometime is repetitive. [SEP] This is a review of the magazine and NOT the subscription through Amazon.<br /><br />I had subscribed to Sunset several times over the years.  After moving to the Atlantic Coast side of the U.S., reading it was haphazard and only through an odd passing.  Fast forward nearly 40 years and I'm back on the Pacific side of the country where Sunset actually matters to me now.<br /><br />I've always like their writing.  It's an easy comfortable read without dummying it down so much I feel as though I'm being talked through instead of to.  Their articles seem to hit home for me.  Being an avid hiker, camper and backpacker (as well as retired chef), there seems to be many choices that speak directly TO me.<br /><br />Sunset magazine isn't going to shake up the world.

User Reviews:
This is one magazine that I read cover to cover.  The articles are great and the recipes are actually ones that ordinary folk can use.  No fancy ingredients, just good healthy foods and easy to prepare.  The photos are a major plus.  If you love to cook and want to eat healthy, this is the magazine for you. [SEP] As a standard cooking magazine it contains some interesting and some not too interesting recipes and articles. The recipes are not on the higher level of Bon Appetite or the late Gourmet magazines. Lately, this magazine is resembling a medical periodical with all the very clinical medical advertisements that go on and on page after page, making following recipes sort of like a ""Scavenger Hunt""!  Yes, advertising is important to a magazine, but the ads featured herein are becoming major obstacles rather than information for the general public. It's not good when a magazine makes itself too challenging to the average reader who is mainly interested in reading the featured contents, yet still willing to accept advertisements that do not dominate the articles therein. [SEP] Great magazine subscription for Cooking Fans. I purchased this for myself and I loved it. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys cooking, but is looking for a way to cook lighter meals. Great recipes. [SEP] Cooking light has great recipes.  I really love the format of the recipes and the beautiful pictures.  I find this magazine extremely inspiring to actually get me to the kitchen to make something extra special.  There is also a great variety of healthy foods. [SEP] Bought this for my boyfriend who loved it, and then the articles started getting repetitive, so I cancelled it because he didn't want it anymore. [SEP] I have been reading this magazine for years. I love every issue. I have pulled ideas and recipies out of every issue. The recipies are wonderful and the pictures make it all so vivid and fun. I love to cook and this magazine is my standby favorite. [SEP] My sister, the gourmet cook, loves this magazine. [SEP] I've seen this magazine in the grocery store for some time and have thought about ordering it but wondered if there would be enough recipes and tips to make it worthwhile. Now that the issues have begun to arrive, I find that I should not have hesitated. I love the magazine. [SEP] I have subscribed to 'food' magazines for over 35 years beginning with my first, Bon Appetit in 1970's. I have subscribed to every major and some minor food preparation magazine out there through the years. I have a degree in Home Economics Education (now called Environmental Sciences), a minor degree in nutrition and I love to cook 'wisely' avoiding empty-calorie foods.<br /><br />Making efforts to unclutter my life in recent years,  I ceased all subscriptions with the exception of two: Eating Well and Cooking Light.  Both of these publications have terrific recipes but also offer excellent articles on nutrition and health issues.  There are great articles on various physical exercises (CL), herbal supplements and even wine.

I can't give a true review since I haven't read them. But the pictures are great and my husband was truly thrilled to receive the subscription. [SEP] LOVE this magazine !  Has GREAT ideas that are not too hard to make. [SEP] I used to subscribe to Todays Homeowner, a great rag.  Unfortunately it was purchased by This Old House which covers what the rich and famous own.  It's great to have dreams, but for those who want to act on them, or more appropriately, the rest of us, there is Family Handyman.<br />For help redoing a floor, rehabbing a kitchen, replacing a deck,  discussions on the latest techniques you will want Family Handiman.

The only problem is I don't have enough time to build all the great projects, but boy do I want to.<br /><br />The information is good and complete.  The projects are desirable and practical. [SEP] Always fun to read and has some fun projects ideas [SEP] My ONLY gripe with this magazine is that the pictures are like those you would find in GQ magazine: they hire models to show you driving a nail or shoveling dirt for that new patio.  These people use only brand new tools (brand name label showing of course) in a perfect-world dust free environment.  The pictures make it look like it's a Sears catalogue.<br /><br />Aside from that, the articles are great making it one of the best magazines for the do-it-yourselfer.  I have saved more money from the tips in this magazine than any other magazine I subscribe to.  Most articles can be done by any semi-skilled craftsman with access to a decent set of tools, making it an approachable magazine for the DIY'er.<br /><br />I highly recedommend this magazine in conjunction with Fine Homebuilding magazine.

Many, if not most of the articles are several pages long and because the magazine comes once per week, I never feel like I can get caught up on current happenings in sports so I end up not reading it at all.

User Reviews:
My mailbox overflows with magazines and among the themes, home and home- related topics are the most common. Dwell Magazine ranks as one of the better home magazines I read each month and it is one of only a few publications that I will return to throughout the month for entertainment and other purposes.<br /><br />What makes Dwell a unique publication is its dedication to more interesting and unusual home remodeling and rebuilding ideas. Other modern home magazines exist, but Dwell Magazine takes the idea of modern to a slightly different level than other, similar publications. With Dwell Magazine, the reader is presented with unusual homes, both on the exterior and interior, and many of them are certainly eye- catching, if nothing else. This magazine is all about homes that offer distinction and some of the design ideas are very interesting and will stick with you for a long time.<br /><br />Probably the most unique fact about Dwell Magazine is that, while it focuses on unusual and creative home design, it manages to maintain a level of livability. Other magazines that focus on unusual things- whether it's the home or something else- often take the weirdness factor to the extreme and they end up alienating most readers. But Dwell Magazine avoids making this mistake. The ideas it presents are unusual and creative, but still within the boundaries of taste and practicality.<br /><br />Magazines usually offer articles that cover a large range of topics each month, but one other interesting aspect of Dwell Magazine is that each magazine is based on a specific theme. This theme is clearly spelled out on the front cover, directly under the magazine's name, in bold letters. This is nice because you already have a good idea what to expect when you open the pages of any issue. The featured articles for the month will stick to the main theme for that particular issue.<br /><br />Dwell Magazine is one of hundreds of publications that focus on the home, but it easily stands out in the pack and I rank it among my favorites in this genre. I'm not into home design on a do-it-yourself level, but I do like to look at homes and the rooms within homes and I am always open to new ideas. Dwell Magazine offers plenty of creative ideas every month and it's a good magazine to consult for home makeover plans. [SEP] ""Creativity is like life insurance. If you are creative, you are never afraid, because you can design yourself out of any situation."" ~Li Edelkoort<br /><br />If you are interested in items like the Nissan Actic Concept Car (that has a matching trailer) or you want to discover new modern options for your bathroom, kitchen or garden, this magazine delivers.<br /><br />DWELL has a variety of articles to interest the casual decorator or the seriously focused chef. For example, the April/May 2004 issue had articles on:<br /><br />Home Cooking - a contractor and his three sons design a home with the kitchen at the heart of the home.<br /><br />Cutting It Up - A downtown Los Angeles loft gets a makeover.<br /><br />Stainless Chef - Designer John Picard finds a sanctuary with a high-tech steam oven and a hand-carved tub.<br /><br />Victorian Revival - A San Franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations.<br /><br />Trend Diva - Jane Szita talks about nesting and nihilism.<br /><br />Other interesting articles include information on houses that become art, short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or CD changers which are most modern.<br /><br />Well, until I can afford a 9,500 buck oven, I'll keep reading and dreaming. The library in the April/May issue is to die for! Big windows and shelves galore.<br /><br />Dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did! Even some of the text is in color. The Marketplace section gives you a wealth of sources to encourage you to start on your own dream design, house or otherwise. The sourcing section also provides page by page information on sources.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review [SEP] Great ideas in this book just my style [SEP] Subscribe only if you have plenty of time on your hands and little to do with it.  It's very slick, nice to look at, but irrelevant.  Not worth either the time or the money unless you have LOTS of one or the other or an obsession with ultra modern building. [SEP] Amazon and Dwell, and all the other magazines, need to work together to make the first issue of a magazine arrive in a more timely fashion. Honestly I'd pay a premium for that. It's ridiculous, the gap between when you order your first issue and when it's supposed to arrive.<br /><br />If the system worked really well, I'd be able to choose which issue arrived - the current issue, or the next issue.<br />I guess paper is dying so noone wants to invest in it. [SEP] after about two months of recieving this magazine I returned it. It just wasnt what I was hoping for. I normally subscribe to veranda, and coastal living and thought that the magazine was along those lines but was bored with everything in the magazine [SEP] great! [SEP] This is one of those great magazines that pack a lot of ideas and information into each issue.  I love the innovative photography, the fresh ideas, and the range of dwellings (apartments to mansions) they cover.<br /><br />I'm really pleased that Amazon suggested this magazine to me, and -- as usual -- offered it at a great price.  If I use even one idea from each issue (and I'm likely to use at least a dozen), our home will be more comfortable, attractive and efficient each month.<br /><br />Sure, I get starry-eyed over the color schemes and frou-frou ideas in magazines such as Country Living and House Beautiful.  However, Dwell is the one that gets me out of my reading chair and actually making positive changes, right away. [SEP] Here is a magazine that focuses on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that makes a competitor like ""Wallpaper"" an expensive, hit-or-miss read. What I like most about ""Dwell"" is its consistency in presenting interesting designs from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time. Even the advertisements are quite compatible to the flow of the magazine, so much so that they often look like they are part of the editorial. There is a very useful ""Marketplace"" section at the end that tells you where to get a lot of the art, furniture and accessories complementary to the designs presented. I have often used these helpful listings to find some interesting things for my own place.<br /><br />This magazine is definitely geared toward the urban loft dweller, but I like how they highlight homes with families in mind as well. Individual issues are often focused on either geographic or utility-related themes, thus keeping a library mandatory for future reference. The photography is superb. If you are tired of design magazines that seem to be talking specifically to designers, this is a great, reasonably priced alternative for people who simply appreciate great design. Highly recommended. [SEP] horrible waste of money","""Dwell Single Issue Magazine offers a fresh perspective on modern living through its award-winning photography and insightful text.

Very nice magazine. Having lived in England for several years, I do enjoy this magazine. [SEP] Some nice images--some of it is so forcibly snooty its a bit laughable really--keep up with the times folks, even the so called &#34;working classes&#34; can afford some of these houses now.... The &#34;Mrs Minerva&#34; feature takes the cake as an attempt at tongue in cheek (a sort of faux Sloane Ranger but more like Hyacinth Bucket style snobbism)  Drop it English Home, its classist and redundant. [SEP] Lovely magazine [SEP] The English Home is a lovely magazine focusing on both the interiors of real homes and on decorating workshops given by illustrious professionals.  In addition to showing a variety of beautiful interiors, gardens are shown and described. Although most homes featured are way beyond what I could ever afford, it's fun to daydream.  Furthermore, unlike homes featured in many American magazines, the settings seem less contrived. [SEP] Ordered through Amazon, then when it was time to renew I was auto charged by Amazon and billed by magazine. Amazon corrected without issue, and I discontinued the magazine. When alerting the actual magazine by telephone about the double billing issue, the fellow was impatient and rude. I did, however, continue the ""Discover Britain"" magazine which I prefer.

User Reviews:
This review is on the Gourmet magazine and not the Amazon subscription or subscription process.<br /><br />If you live in New York City, Gourmet is a great magazine.  If you want to follow trends, Gourmet is a great magazine.  If you DON'T live in NYC, Gourmet has mostly forgotten about you.  That, my friend, is why I give it only 3*.  As a culinary professional who worked from Miami up to the St. Lawrence River in Upstate NY, I had often read the magazine and wondered, sometimes not even quietly, why the writers and editors were so stuck on the City.  If you didn't life there, you didn't matter.  That was the basic philosophy.<br /><br />On the plus side, the articles were usually well written, the interviews decent and the recipes interesting.  The following of trends was usually spot on.  Yes, NYC DOES have a lot of restaurants and a lot of chefs.  It isn't, however, the only place in the universe much less the United States. [SEP] I am not receiving this magazine. I don't understand why it's in my list. I used to receive it many years ago, and I liked it, but most of the pages were not recipes, but advertisings, so I stopped buying it. [SEP] I like this magazine for a variety of reasons.  First of all I like the informative articles regarding a paticular food subject.  Cooking shows only seem to high the highlights, but when I want more about something this is a good source.  Secondly this has a section where they feature restaurant recipes, always something that I welcome.  It has information about restaurants.  In addition to all of these things they often share several good recipes each month.  I have always been pleased with their choices.  Overall I give this a 4 because I would like to see more recipes.  While the format is good, I personally like to collect recipes, and prepare new dishes. [SEP] ...I found that Gourmet dealt more on the international recipes than I really cared for. The articles and recipes were good for the reading but when you subscribe to over 16 magazines a month 10 of them being food, you tend to become quite picky on what is worth it and really a necessity in having.<br />I subscribed to ""Bon Appetit"" as well and these two go hand in hand. As I mentioned in another review I did you can easily get all of these recipes on their website at Epicurous and save yourself some money, but If you like to be swept away to Dazzling places and enjoy the full page pictures of your entrees then get the magazine........ but get it from Amazon, you can't beat their price.<br />Happy Reading [SEP] Gourmet magazine has been around for over 60 years now, but by the fresh look and the up-to-date topics and trends you would never know. Fortunately the editors of the magazine also take pride in the treasure chest of their publication's history and firmly believe that old does not have to mean out of date or bad. So every once in a while they go back to wonderful recipes or articles of the past that have stood the test of time. And this is what Gourmet is all about in general: good quality. The recipes are always solid and can be recreated in your kitchen with reliable success. The table decorating and entertaining tips and themes strike a good balance between the fancy and the everyday useful suggestions. While this is definitely to be considered an upscale magazine, you don't have to be well off to live well in Gourmet style. I have subscribed to Gourmet for years now and still look forward to every new issue. [SEP] I think I read about three articles every issue--Editor Ruth Reichl's intro and a feature article or two--and then I just focus on the pics and fabulous recipes.  I especially enjoy the Gourmet Everyday section, a collection of the easiest dishes.  A brief description of the dish, prep time (always underestimated, naturally), and usually a picture completes every recipe.<br /><br />If anything, I kind of wish there was more on vegetarian mains, but the magazine's recipes are quite inspired and diverse overall. [SEP] Today I purchased my first and probably last issue of Gourmet. While there were plenty of recipes (some of which I won't use but they were still cool to look at) there were TONS of ads.<br /><br />It makes you wonder either a) how much the people who make this magazine get paid or b) for all the ads why this isn't free.<br /><br />I can see the need for a few ads so that we the consumers don't have to pay a fortune for a good magazine. But I took out 33 pages of ads and figured there were about 140 full page ads. That's over half of the magazine which is 260 pages. That's really sad.<br /><br />Recipe wise, some of them look interesting and very gourmet, but there are things you need to have that I can't get in the middle of the U.S.<br /><br />And about three of the six articles were interesting to read - when you could find them slipped inbetween their plethora of ads.<br /><br />Fine Cooking is still the best one out there. [SEP] After subscribing to and enjoying &quot;Gourmet&quot; for over a decade, I recently let my subscription run out.  Over a year ago the editorial staff of the magazine changed, and with it, the content of the magazine.  The &quot;Gourmet&quot; I knew and loved was always a treat to receive because it focused on exciting and complex recipes that were going to be fun and challenging to cook at home.  The recipes were very user friendly, and no matter how advanced, always designed to be prepared in a home kitchen.<br />The new &quot;Gourmet&quot; is much more of a travel magazine than a cook's magazine.  It particularly focuses on New York restaurants, and most of the recipes showcase famous dishes from various restaurants, not recipes that were designed for the home cook.  While the old &quot;Gourmet&quot; certainly had its fair share of restaurant and travel coverage, the focus was on different culinary traditions and exciting culinary innovations.  In other words, it was a more scholarly look at cooking.  The new magazine feels like a bunch of fluff pieces set up by New York PR agents.  Next time I'm planning a trip to New York, I'll probably pick up an issue to see what's new and hot, but this isn't the kind of information that's useful to me on a monthly basis. [SEP] Too many drug ads. [SEP] Gourmet- it's the food magazine that you don't want to be seen reading. It's precious, pedantic, and short on prose. The energy that came with editor Ruth Reichl was palpable a few years ago. Heads rolled, and after a few surprises , it has now settled into horribly written articles, pious editorials, unappealing recipes and a virtual altar for foodies. It is not relevant or interesting except to a very narrowly focused group of food intelligentsia. If a magazine is not capable of surprising you, teaching you, or exposing you to the world we live in, what's the point? If someone reads Gourmet fifty years from now, they will have no idea of what kind of culture we live in. Fear and hatred of food, smart foods, packaged dinners, frozen food, unaffordable food...the list goes on. Gourmet is in a bubble of their own making. Maybe they actually want to attend the staged parties they create in every issue complete with models vainly attempting to eat a sparerib.","""Gourmet magazine, a longstanding publication with a focus on culinary excellence, offers a mix of informative articles, well-crafted interviews, and interesting recipes. While some reviewers note a heavy emphasis on New York City and international recipes, others appreciate the magazine's solid recipes that can be easily recreated at home.

User Reviews:
Texas Monthly Magazine is a magazine about a state, its places, and its people. This publication covers Texas culture, travel, music, arts, dining, special events, and more. Each issue takes readers on a journey throughout the state and keeps them up to date on the Lone Star State and her people.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine has more departments than the typical magazine and many of them are fun to read, offering a quick look inside a lesser- known town, festival, or individual that calls Texas home. A good example is the department titled Street Smarts. This short section offers a glimpse inside one of Texas' thousands of small towns along with a numbered list of special points of interest in the city. The music and books departments are fun, too, because they present some popular and soon- to- be- popular media from Texas residents. Another department I like for its pleasant amusement is one called the Manual. It presents something Texas- related in the areas of fashion and style and then offers some advice on the best usage or display of the item based on Texas culture.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine offers several long, featured articles and they can usually be found starting in the middle of each issue and continuing all the way to about the three- quarter mark. These longer featured articles can focus on most anything, from travel to art to food, to the people who create the art and prepare the food.  There are usually at least a few current event- type articles related to something important in the news while the other featured articles include stories about people, events, etc., that are generally timeless.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine is a well- written, well- edited magazine and it a nice reference and reading tool for Texas residents who like to learn more about the state and find new places to visit and things to try. I like having it handy, but if I could change one thing about this magazine, it would be the number of ads in each issue. True, all magazines need advertisements in order to generate reveune, but the number of ads in Texas Monthly Magazine is a tad excessive. Each issue opens up with about eighteen pages of ads before even reaching the table of contents. The next hundred or so pages have ads on every other page and the ads only diminish when you get to one of the featured articles. After that, the ads return for the remainder of the issue, with the final thirty to fifty pages consisting of practically nothing but ads.<br /><br />Going back to the positive points, another reason to like Texas Monthly is the long length of each issue. The magazine is much longer than most, with some issues approaching 300 pages in length. Yes, the ads are excessive, but even if all the ads were removed, you would still have a very large amount of reading material in each issue- much more than found in the majority of magazines.<br /><br />Texas is a very large, very diverse state with many things to offer and Texas Monthly is a very enjoyable read that helps Texas residents keep up with some of the many happenings in this great state. The ads are excessive, but when all factors are taken into account, this is still an enjoyable publication that every Texan should read and that many outsiders will enjoy as well. [SEP] Gift for my dad.  He loves the articles and has truly enjoyed this magazine.  He has also recommended it to his friends. [SEP] Good Articles for the Texas Lover but Loaded with advertisements, more focused towards marketing. Did not renew because of this. [SEP] I bought this magazine with high hopes that it would focus on issues pertaining to Texas. It does in part, but there is a blatant political bias in almost all the articles that is not representative of Texas as a whole. The writing in this magazine smacks of elitism under the guise of Lone Star pride (although there have been a few superb articles that defy the norm). If you like ads, this is your magazine. If you like an editor with a political axe to grind, this is your magazine. If you like to line the bottom of your birdcage with something other than newsprint, sadly, this is your magazine. [SEP] Home sick Texan.  Keeps me informed about the rich folks and BBQ joints [SEP] great buy, thanks [SEP] This magazine is totally awesome! It covers everything from the panhandle to the valley. Only complaint is that I am getting sick and tired of them and the rest of the media re-hashing Lance Armstrong... ENOUGH already! LOL [SEP] Love this magazine. Great articles. Very informative. [SEP] Amazon took their time getting the subscription going, but it is a good magazine.  A little more ""left"" than most Texan's views, but lots of good article none the less. [SEP] Stuck for a day in a motel during a freak snow storm in West Texas 1987 or so, to pass the time, I bought a Texas Monthly at the next-door 7-ll.  I loved it so much, when I finally got back home to Pacific Palisades, CA, I ordered a subscription that I kept for years.  After many moves in the next two decades, I let my subscription lapse.

Marie Claire is Marie Claire. good price, though. [SEP] This would have been better had it not auto renewed itself over and over and over years after I ordered it. Marie Claire is a fun magazine full of beauty tips and interesting articles. [SEP] i get great fashion ideas from magazines. this helps. i dont ve to look and figure things out. the trend is already in the magazine [SEP] Remember the old Glamour magazine that used to have such great articles with some ads here and there? this is not it!<br /> this is all ads targeted to young women. [SEP] I am impressed with the quick processing of this order. I ordered on 12/30/08 and received my first issue on 1/30/09. (I didn't think I would receive my first issue until March at best!)

User Reviews:
Golfers share many things in common and one of these is an often fanatical love for the game. For these types, nothing can take the place of heading to the nearest golf course, but Golf Digest comes very close. This magazine contains over 200 pages each month, dedicated exclusively to the sport of golf.<br /><br />The things that set Golf Digest apart from the competition are the numerous articles about learning and improving your game and the personal stories and interviews. Other golfing publications attempt to help you learn, but they often get too mechanical. Golf Digest shows you how to improve your game with tips from professionals, including some of the star- studded members of the golfing elite like Tiger Woods.<br /><br />Besides all the tips and tricks, Golf Digest also shows the personal side of the sport with interviews and more intimate stories about the many colorful personalities in the game. This personal dimension adds greatly to the magazine's overall appeal, providing great reading material to complement the more instructional side of the magazine.<br /><br />Golfing Digest may not be as great as a day spent on your favorite golf course, but it comes close. I consider it the best publication of its kind and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the game. [SEP] Great value. Great magazine. Up-to-date content. Order with confidence! [SEP] Must have for the avid golfer in your life [SEP] Always a good read [SEP] We give our Golfer son-in-law his favorite Golf magazine for his Birthday, and so appreciate the heads up we get from Amazon when it is<br />time to re-new.Not only do we get a great price, but we do not even have to think about when to re-order. Doesn't get any better than this !<br /><br />Norma C.<br />Florida [SEP] I'm not a magazine person.  I read very little in the way of magazines and don't subscribe to a single one, but I love reading Golf Digest.  I have found many of the instructional articles, especially by the professionals (such as Tiger Woods) who write for the publication, to be very helpful and have tried to implement the techniques they've taught into my game.  I have gotten many ideas for practice drills in the magazine as well, which has also helped me.<br /><br />Golf Digest is about more than just the technicals of the game, however.  It is about the lifestyle of golf.  I love reading the articles on course design (Jack Nicklaus's are great) and enjoy the previews of the majors.  I found the equipment reviews (the ""Hot List"") very helpful when shopping for a new putter and when trying various golf balls, and I love the articles profiling and ranking different golf courses around the country and around the world.<br /><br />Golf Digest is one of the few magazines I can avidly read and actually enjoy--all without feeling that I'm wasting my time.  The magazine is also quite bulky considering the reasonable price. [SEP] A gift for my dad who is an avid golfer. He loved it and it was a gift that he received throughout the year. [SEP] OK [SEP] Over the many years that I have subscribed to Golf Digest, I've come across extremely useful information from world class teachers and the top players that has improved my game. In addition to appreciating the superb teaching article, I always look forward to the new product editions. Equally informative and entertaining are the various feature article and interviews. Golf Digest is simply the best golf magazine! [SEP] The equipment issue is very helpful if you are looking for new gear.  There are some good tips and interesting articles but really every issue seemed a lot like the last.

User Reviews:
If you love fashion, you need to get Vogue.  Vogue will familiarize you with designers, classic style and the fancy-schmancy side of fashion that most other magazines will not get as deep into.  However, most of what is in Vogue is way out of the average person's reach.  I, for one, could very likely not afford one thing that has ever been in a single copy of Vogue.  However, for whatever reason, the Vogue empire continues to publish this fashion tome and sell the subs for a VERY low price (usually $12 for 12 issues).  Now THAT I can afford.  It is an unbeatable deal.  Will you glean anything from it?  Yes.  You will see how the other side lives and you will see some really wonderful photography and fashion at its best.  Is it practical?  Not really but it is fun and well worth the very low price. [SEP] awesome price!!!  awesome product!!! fast delivery!!! who could ask for more???  thanks so much!  God bless you!!  :) [SEP] Perfection. [SEP] I had purchase 3 different magazines on Amazon and was happy to receive my subscription for Vogue timely.  I still have not seen my other 2 magazine subscription from Travel & Leisure or Marie Claire [SEP] When you get a copy of the American Vogue, the first 5 pages at least are full page ads for fashion, fragrance, or whatever else. The table of contents is typically 1-2 pages. Once you start flipping through the magazine, you find the average length of an article is 1/2 to 1 page long. It's difficult to discern the fashion photo shoots that are part of the actual magazine content from the articles themselves. The fashion tips and photo shoots are not based on any real style insight but rather on who has bought sponsorship in the magazine. If you really want to read this magazine, I suggest you flip through it at the library or while waiting for an appointment at some office that has a subscription. It will take you less than 30 minutes to read the entire magazine from cover to cover and the only thing you'll be left with is knowing that is 30 minutes of your life you are never going to get back. [SEP] After getting tired of paying newsstand prices for my fashion-obsessed daughter, I bit the bullet and bought her a subscription to Vogue. It was like she had died and gone to heaven! She pores over each issue, and her favorite looks are currently papering her wall. [SEP] In one year's time, I never received several of the issues.  I believe it was two issues that just never showed up.  Not sure whose fault that is, but it was annoying.<br /><br />I knew I was moving soon and decided instead of renewing, I would just start a new subscription at my new address.  As the subscription ran out, I was mortified to start receiving debt-collection style renewal notices in the mail.  Big red letters with words like ""Past Due"" were stamped on the outside of the envelope.  I was shocked that a magazine that features high-end fashion would stoop to such cheap, trashy methods of getting renewals.  Though I enjoy the magazine and love the photo shoots, those notices really turned me off and I decided not to start up a subscription. [SEP] Great fashion!  Magazine has gorgeous pics.  Great articles that cover all topics.  Love using this magazine to re-create the high fashion at budget cost. [SEP] Vogue magazine has been around along time. I've been ordering the magazine since I was 18 years old which is almost 30 years to keep up on trends and the latest designer styles. Except for the 90's the magazine has always been on the top of it's game as far as fashion.  Just renewed another year. I also receive other fashion magazines but Vogue is the only one that I have renewed continuously. [SEP] Have been getting magazine for my daughter for the past twenty years because she really enjoys it.","Title: Vogue Print Magazine

User Reviews:
Coastal Living is a professionally- made magazine with lots of enticing photographs, personal stories, and general advice on making the most out of life on the coast. The emphasis in Coastal Living is on waterfront property and the events and entertainment that often take place in cities with a large coastal area.<br /><br />Much of what you read in Coastal Living pertains to better- known waterfront areas in the United States. Such popular destinations as Boston, Miami, New York, Long Island, California, Cape Cod, South Padre Island, and other tourist- oriented places comprise a large portion of the featured articles in this magazine. Many of these places (like New York City) have very expensive waterfront property than can often be next to impossible to buy. But these areas also include lots of tourist activities, which is why they are so frequently highlighted in this magazine.<br /><br />Besides the well- known destinations, Coastal Living also includes a good number of featured articles on lesser- known places. Many of these lack the fast- pace and the extensive nightlife of the more popular destinations, but they also offer better deals on property and an opportunity to get away from the chaos of the larger cities. Such places as the Delaware coast, Michigan, Ohio's Lake Erie coast, and others are often very quaint and interesting. Also, they offer property that is far more reasonable in price and is often within the affordability range for many buyers.<br /><br />Much of the properties you see and read about in Coastal Living are quite expensive. But remember- the majority of the homes are on major coastlines, so you can't expect to find them for selling for a low cost. These are high- demand, low supply properties and they vary greatly in price, but they are all expensive. In a popular area, these homes can sell up to the tens of millions of dollars. But in less popular areas, you can sometimes find some bargain prices on waterfront property. For example, Coastal Living has highlighted many Great Lakes properties that are priced very close to the overall U.S. average. They are not as cheap as most areas of the inner cities, no. But they are priced within the reach of many families.<br /><br />The emphasis in Coastal Living seems to be on properties- both main residences and vacation properties that are adjacent to a major coastline. But there are other items promoted for sale besides property. And much of this other merchandise is also quite costly. In the ""Currents"" section, for example, it is common to find things like lawn furniture, cufflinks, fancy pitchers, and other things selling for many times the usual price. Most of it is intended for those who want a little bit more and are willing (and able) to pay the price.<br /><br />Coastal Living is a personal magazine. Most of the stories involve families and couples who enjoy the coast. They share with the reader such things as how they keep their homes protected from the sea, what they do for entertainment, how they like to decorate, and why living on the coast means so much to them. Photos of families and couples often grace the pages of these types of articles, giving them a friendly, domestic feel.<br /><br />Most of what you will find in Coastal Living relates to the United States coast. There is only an occasional article about other coastal areas, like those of Mexico, the Caribbean, and other places. True, you will sometimes find an article about Hawaii or Alaska. But for the most part, Coastal Living tries to keep its journalism concentrated on places that lie within close proximity to the majority of Americans.<br /><br />Overall, Coastal Living is a very good magazine for people who enjoy vacationing on the coast, finding entertainment on the coast and, of course, living on the coast. The photography and presentation are excellent and it's interesting to read about the big- city life on the coast as well as some of the more ""unknown"" destinations. It provides great reading and a useful reference for people who already live on the coast or who are interested in purchasing waterfront property. [SEP] good travel ideas and recipes. [SEP] Lovely photos, makes me wish I was there.  Nice articles about artists.  Always like to see the beach house decorating. [SEP] Love this magazine not only for the decor but also for the recipes.

User Reviews:
This is a great magazine, very informative and helpful when looking to buy items. While I don't always pick their choice, it helps to avoid lesser rated items/brands that I might have been tempted to buy. [SEP] If you buy stuff CR is an indispensable resource.  It's not cheap but you'll make it back on whatever your first purchase is.<br />The problem today is that virtually all internet reviews are biased or outright ghosted by a manufacturer.  I don't even trust CNet anymore.<br />Supporting CR isn't just good for me...I consider them a vital public service. [SEP] Not how I remembered this magazine. Didn't care for it. [SEP] Not like it used to be [SEP] LOVE this magazine! [SEP] Subsequent to my review (below), I was notified that CR was charging me for digital access to their website.  I only subscribed to the magazine.  CR's notice also reminded me that they continue renewing that service automatically unless I intervene.  I canceled such service in the past because I have a problem with auto renewal.  I feel no less kindly to it now.  I've now canceled my sub to the zine, and probably have to hack through customer service to prevent charges to my card.  Doesn't change my previous critique:<br />I thought I'd try the K version of CR, and essentially I like it.  But CR doesn't do well with the conversion of print to e-text.  They don't bother prepping for the e-version is my guess:  they just throw it out there, warts and all.  The read has problems with percentage figures, which for CR is a hindrance.  Words with ""ff"" (e.g., ""offer"") have a problem:  the ff becomes a period.  Other little glitches in text conversion are annoying.  The index does not follow the section being read:  it's stuck wherever you looked at it last, I think, so you have to go looking for where you are; even the local newspaper (which screws up a lot) got that one right.  I'm reading a zine purporting to be experts on products, and theirs has flaws suggesting they've never actually read the output.  Quality control experts, improve thyselves. [SEP] If you like to research before you buy, this is the place to do just that. Plus, with your subscription you can go online at CR and look up by specific product!! Would recommend highly!! [SEP] Great magazine. Easy renewal process! [SEP] How does anyone live without consumer reports? If you read product reviews before a minor purchase, you should read CR before a major one - appliances, TVs, cars, health care plans, IRAs, restaurants, tires - this is an indispensable source of information that no consumer should be without. [SEP] Consumer Reports has been around for years and is one of the best sources not only of product reviews, but also of guidelines for purchasing products.  I don't always end up buying the models they recommend (sometimes newer ones have been released) but I always feel as if I am a better, more intelligent consumer after reading their articles.","Consumer Reports is a highly regarded magazine that serves as an invaluable resource for consumers looking to make informed purchasing decisions. While some users find it to be a vital public service and a must-have for researching products before making major purchases, others have encountered issues with the digital access subscription model and the e-text conversion quality.

[SEP] One of the few magazines that are worth getting a subscription for [SEP] I love this magazine. Received my first issue sooner than expected. Worth every penny spent. [SEP] BEAUTIFUL MAGAZINE.  ONE OF MY FAVORITES FOR YEARS.  PRINTED ON QUALITY PAPER WITH CRISP IMAGES! [SEP] This is my favorite magazine by far chock full of details and a good read [SEP] I love my Victoria subscription! I had tried for years to resubscribe but hadn't had any luck - until now. Victoria is like traveling back in time. The articles and features make me feel as if I am going back home and being welcomed by old friends. The Writer-In-Residence and Artist-in-Residence essays are my favorite features (I was a subscriber when Tasha Tudor was the Artist-in-Residence and Madeleine L'Engle was the Writer-in-Residence). [SEP] This was supposed to be a gift for my daughter as an extension of her existing subscription. I just got her first magazine. [SEP] I had dropped my subscription to Victoria for a few years (can't remember why) and am very happy that I've now renewed it.  So many beautiful pictures.  A retreat into a magical world without nasty politics or sadness.  A magazine to be enjoyed with a cuppa tea or glass of wine.  Recommend it to anyone looking for quiet inspiration, although perhaps on a smaller scale than what we see in these pictures. [SEP] Love this magazine. Gave 4 stars because there's too many pages used for advertising rather than actual content/pictures. Also, you only get 6 magazines per year. I remember when these were not the case. Regardless, the quality has not gone down, just the amount of content.","Title: Victoria

User Reviews:
I was interested in checking out [[ASIN:B000LXS9Q8 Marie Claire (2-year)]] after watching the TV show ""Project Runway.""<br />Imagine my suprise when I found a two year subscription on sale for only $7! What a deal!<br />The magazine is chock full of fashion, both affordable and haute couture.<br />I really like the fact that so many prices are listed for the various items shown in the magazine.<br />Two thumbs up! [SEP] Love the magazine, love the fashions, love the accessories, love the make-up, love the articles about celebrities, models, fashionista's, etc. I really look forward to the next issue arriving. [SEP] I had ordered Marie Claire with Amazon on 11/08/09 and still have not received my subscription.  I am having second thoughts in ordering magazines with Amazon again [SEP] I purchased this magazine just before Christmas for $5 for a 2 year subscription.  Honestly, I had never even seen a copy of Marie Claire before it showed up on my door, and I didn't have high expectations (especially considering the price).<br /><br />I have to say that I'm very happy with the magazine overall.  The demographic is probably best described as women from 20-35 who are career driven and don't have children.  I say this because there really isn't much ""family stuff"", moreso things on dating and articleds for single working women.  It also isn't really for a young ""teenage"" demographic.<br /><br />There is also surprisingly a lot of substance to this magazine for the price.  There are a lot of longer articles and most of them are fairly well written and intersting - worth reading at the very least.<br /><br />My only gripe about the magazine is that the fashion is a bit pricy.  Most of the shirts/pants/dresses they show as being in style are listed as costing around $800.  Not exactly sure who can afford that.  On the other hand, it's not like I ever buy the clothes I see in magazines anyway.<br /><br />Another thing that people said is that they never received any of the magazines.  Well, I placed the order at the end of November and my first issue arrived early January so as long as you put the information in correctly it should promptly arrive at your door.<br /><br />This magazine gets 5 stars from me based on price and the fact that I was impressed by the magazines overall content. [SEP] This magazine is a great tool for affordable women's fashion. There is also great articles throughout the magazine. Always delivers great reads. [SEP] Still waiting for my first magazine....  It looks like a good read and has informative articles - can't wait for my first magazine! [SEP] This is NOT just a fashion magazine. I became interested in it due to ""Project Runway"". Now I cannot live without it. And I am young 52 so that tells you this magazine is great for women of all ages. [SEP] Great fashion tips [SEP] I'm glad I ordered Marie Claire while it was just $5.00 for two years. Because of that, reading the first issue wasn't as painful as it could have been. It was still definitely painful, though.<br /><br />Wow, this magazine is full of ads. Every other page - and in some places every page for five pages! There isn't much substance to the magazine and it literally took me all of ten minutes to finish ""reading"" the whole thing. No useful articles, nothing but ads and pictures of frightening looking and rather gaunt women. Yes, fashion magazines are full of those...but some of these women looked just sick! It pained me to look at them. Toward the front of the magazine, there is one shot of three models in the middle of a page and they literally look like aliens. So thin and starving their heads look two times too big. Poor girls. That being the only thing that stuck out in a decent sized magazine...that's pathetic. [SEP] I started reading this magazine to follow Project Runway and considered giving it up when the series completed but discovered I had become somewhat addicted.  I am not too much into fashion but there are always lots of helpful articles and then there are also the unexpected ones that are deep and cover unusual issues.  I share my copies with the younger crowd (I'm a grandmother) and they love it.","""Marie Claire is a print magazine that offers a mix of affordable and haute couture fashion, along with articles covering topics like celebrities, models, and fashion trends.

User Reviews:
One of the top ten woodworking magazines around.I loved it, look forward to each issue. Almost as good as Handyman. [SEP] It's ok. Mainly ads as another person said - and a lot of those are for CNC machines, etc. that a home woodworker probably isn't purchasing. The first issue came - back cover torn and some of the pages stuck together - why???... Not much content. It better improve or I won't be renewing. I much prefer The Family Handyman if anyone wants a suggestion for a magazine for someone with similar interests. [SEP] great magazine and tips [SEP] All of these woodworking magazines, like many other types of magazines, seem to be primarily advertisements.  I think this one is the best of the bunch, but there are still a lot of advertisements.  This one seems to have practical ideas compared to projects that are so far out as to be unusable for most people.  So, if looking for a gift for a woodworking person, I find this one the better choice, but it is a bit marginal. [SEP] I got a papercut. Ironic [SEP] PW has a host of good articles along with excellent picture that help inspire me in the shop. I really look forward to that treat in the mail. [SEP] This is one of my favorite woodworking magazines, as it blends new products and ideas with practical tips and explanations.  It does a good job of walking the line and being neither geared to complete novices, or to master woodworkers.  Of all the woodworking magazines, this is the one I keep coming back to, and am most likely to save issues of. [SEP] Just didn't find contents useful.  Went through it once and never have used it again.  Mostly found what I wasn't missing rather than what I could use [SEP] its ok [SEP] I agree with the other reviewers that there are too many advertisements when compared to the actual amount of content. However, what stood out to me is how the writers seem to have a creepy obsession for detailing the gender, race, and nationality of the people featured in the articles. Believe me when I say that I really wanted to give this one a chance, but the pervasiveness of this practice reads like the publisher is acting out some kind of odd fetish.

I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THEIR REVIEWS AND THEY HAVE LED ME TO ARTISTS I MIGHT NEVER HAD FOUND OTHERWISE. [SEP] An Anti-American Subversive Rag run by the feeble-minded. [SEP] Bad liberal junk magazine worthy of grocery store tabloid [SEP] includes lots interesting articles and music news. I don't read magazines enough so I didn't continue to subscription but like the magazine. [SEP] I was a teenager when magazines like Rolling Stone and Creme first hit the stands.  They were solely about the music, the musicians and the new releases.<br />As a young adult I bought a subscription that continued on for some 30 years more or less.  I used to love and avidly read the quality reviews of the new releases and even cut them out and stuck them with the album or CD case.<br />The articles were usually always interesting and the interviews were insightful and well written.<br /><br />Things changed with the coming of rap and electronic music; things changed with a changing political structure and society in general , and where I used to devour each issue from cover to cover I was then finished with many of the issues in the space of a half hour or less.<br />Long, drawn out articles on politics and un-music related concerns became the order of the day and the magazine simply lost its mojo. Then again, so has much of the current state of music and the current performers who may be able to sing but have no idea what a real instrument is.  They may be good on their computer's music software and know auto tune inside and out......but who cares.<br />I long for the day when real rock and roll comes alive again.<br />When that happens, maybe Rolling Stone will, once more, find a heart.<br /><br />Thanks for allowing me to share my thoughts. [SEP] Ok [SEP] Rolling Stone magazine has fallen way below its reputation of year's past in regards to quality.  Not only did they downside the magazine but it also has affected their content. 70-80 pgs. per magazine is absurd, they are a shadow of themselves. The political articles by Matt Taibbi are the only thing worth reading, not so much for music & entertainment anymore. [SEP] I've been getting this magazine for many many years and still find it interesting. The articles and reviews are always informative and have helped me discover many new bands that I enjoy. [SEP] Too much extreme leftist politics and too little music. [SEP] I have loved this magazine for decades,  even when it was twice as large and on newsprint.  As a senior citizen I still love it.

Great [SEP] I'm a businesswoman who strives to earn the respect of all my peers. Do we see images of men with shirts cut that low on the front of a business magazine?

59,"Title: Popular Science    Print Magazine

User Reviews:
Popular Science is a magazine I have been reading on and off for more than twenty years and it ranks as a science magazine for the masses. As most readers will tell you, Popular Science is a beginner's science publication and is generally intended for those who are curious about science and want to gain a better understanding of science and technology.<br /><br />Popular Science is more about technology than science and this is evident from the departments and most of the featured articles. Yes, Popular Science does include articles about atoms, chemicals, outer space, physics, etc., but the majority of the articles are about modern technology and its uses and applications. The technology articles are dedicated to subjects such as new vehicles, environmental trends, electronic devices, and more. Articles like these might seem a little out of scope, but one has to remember that the first word in the title of the magazine is Popular. Technology is huge, so it makes sense that the magazine would dedicate such a large percentage of its articles to high tech.<br /><br />The writing in Popular Science is very good, but as I said before, this magazine is intended more as a beginner's guide to science and technology. This means the articles will be perfectly fine for those with limited science and technology knowledge.  For those with a more advanced scientific mind, some of the articles may be too elementary. However, every issue can be counted on for at least a couple of in-depth, intellectual articles. Also, one needs to keep in mind that the articles are generally short and cover only a page or two. This is nice for those with shorter attention spans and for those who want to soak up as many facts about as many different things as possible.<br /><br />Learning more about science and technology is certainly a good idea and Popular Science is a good choice of reading material for those who are scientifically curious, want to improve their science knowledge level, and want to learn about the latest technology. The magazine could prove to be a little too simplistic for those with a working or educational background in science, but for everyone else, Popular Science presents a good means to keep up with the latest in science and high tech with writing that is clear and intelligent without going over the top. [SEP] Keeps you up to date on things of all nature [SEP] I have always been a fan of Popular Science.<br /><br />I find that it always comes on time and is filled with interesting things.<br /><br />However, I would prefer to see at least 1/2 as many ads as now currently plague its pages. [SEP] The perfect magazine for any science lover.<br />Every issue is great. [SEP] Magazine has been getting thinner and thinner through the years.  The articles are well written but few and far between on piquing my interest.  Not a magazine subscription I will keep up in the future. [SEP] nice articles, diverse topics... great for teens too [SEP] Excellent magazine with lots of interesting and relevant articles on scientific matters without being too technical and yet not being a &#34;dumbed-down&#34; glossy.<br /><br />What's refreshing too is to see that the magazine has a fairly high number of articles compared to the advertising - so many magazines nowadays are swamped with so much advertising that it's hard to find the actual text of the magazine, not so with Popular Science.  Good stuff. [SEP] This magazine has some interesting things in it, but each issue is very, very short/small... there isn't much to it. [SEP] this is the best most informative magazine out there. my wife reads it before me she is thrilled with most arthcles i have to beat her to the mail box.popular machanices is also good. [SEP] I'm not a magazine guy.. really. That said, I feel that if you're a 'guy's-guy' and you like gadgets, airplanes, cars, computers and whatever else is out or coming out.. this magazine is the way to go and you won't be dissapointed. I find that if I'm sitting down (figure it out) and start reading.. I can't put it down and then I end up taking it away and reading through page after page.. until it's finished. This magazine is really awesome.. I really mean that guys and gals into this stuff will NOT be dissapointed!!!<br /><br />Get this Amazon has a GREAT price..<br /><br />Gerard Haughey","""Popular Science is a widely recognized print magazine that caters to a broad audience interested in science and technology.

Discover packs a lot of understandable and rather advanced topics into an interesting fly-over mag. It's overall quality as source is improving with time. [SEP] Great magazine, we've been a subscriber for years. [SEP] as expected!!!! [SEP] So erratic, I hate the 'politically correct' articles... some issues I discard without reading, but others are wonderful. [SEP] I say Discover is a step above Popular Science in what it delivers on the science. [SEP] Good, no frills science for the great unwashed. [SEP] I was a long-time subscriber of Discover, but recently let me subscription run out. The magazine is changed for the worst since the editor changed from Corey S. Powell. Seems like ads have taken over the magazine. The quality of the writing has decreased, as well as the scope of the content. I would previously finish reading cover to cover and have many ideas I wanted to explore further based on the content. Reminds me more of Popular Science now and not worth the subscription fee. I've switched over to Smithsonian, and though not all the articles are science-based, it does give me a lot to explore in a format similar to what Discover used to be. [SEP] Discover claims they didn't receive my add-on subscription and I can't find a way to get Amazon (who got the money) to do anything to fix the problem. I have had two other subscriptions go ok but not this one. If you click on the problem link it just sends an email to the publisher no way it seems to get a Amazon person involved.

User Reviews:
The top 4 biz mags in rank order from my perspective are the new Bloomberg BW, Forbes, Economist, and Fortune.<br /><br />Forbes is fringier in its offerings. Forbes delivers a variety of unique perspectives not found elsewhere and is kind of like a monthly WSJ in editorials and opinion. Of the top four I referenced, Fortune vs Forbes is perhaps the most commonly considered in competition. The winner is a no-brainer - I'll reach for Forbes over Fortune every time.<br /><br />Amazon has come far in its mag offerings from a pricing standpoint. The subscription manager service that Amazon offers resolves expirations and earlier renewal phishing expeditions by publishers. [SEP] Not my favorite business mag but when I get the $10 offers in the mail sometimes I bite. As someone else said its not very good at having insight but more a whos who type of mag.  Its more entertaining  more than educational [SEP] This review is on the magazine Forbes and not the Amazon subscription or subscription process.<br /><br />Forbes is a &#34;to the point&#34; magazine.  I appreciate that.  The articles a short, concise and not lacking in information.  While I also read a few other financial magazines, Forbes is the one I will go back to and grab to reread a particular point about a particular issue.<br /><br />This magazine, while full of ads like the others, offers a great deal of insight between the covers.  Honestly, if I were to be asked to specify just one financial magazine to read, Forbes would be my answer. [SEP] The very best Financial Magazine.  Except for the Wall Street Journal the Very Best Financial publication! [SEP] One of the best magazines to find out about people tat make the world run. Every executive should read it.<br /><br />AJMV [SEP] I purchased Forbes magazine from a mail solicitation.  The price was very good, so I signed up for a 2 year subscription.  Once it started I kept waiting for some sort of substance to show up in the articles.  The Steve Forbes editorial is about the only decent article in the magazine.  Everything else is a glorified advertisement for those who have a lot of discretionary money. I can't wait for the subscription to expire.  When I get a Forbes magazine now it basically goes straight to the recycle bin.  If you like this type of magazine, then you'll like this one. [SEP] Forbes is by far the easiest to read for a non-specialist like me (I am a writer) and therefore essential reading for those of us who want to know what is going on in the business world who don't know all the endless jargon that the more specialist magazines tend to use. This is my magazine of choice when I spend time in the USA writing books (which includes the forbes.com bookclub book CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE, Zondervan, 2003) - that book club being another benefit of a subscription [SEP] I've been a Forbes subscriber for years. I scan each page of every issue and read many of the articles and columns--something I don't do with most of the other magazines I receive. You don't have to be Bill Gates or Warren Buffet to find information that will help you run your business or manage your investments. The articles are well-written and to the point, and the magazine is a pleasure to read.

User Reviews:
This is one magazine I have wondered about for some time.  My first issue was a very pleasant surprise.  While the preponderance of ads put me off when I flipped through it, the articles erased my idea that this was just another sales vehicle.  I thoroughly enjoyed the article on George Bush which was well written and very informative.  This is one subscription I will keep and the ads are pretty if nothing else. [SEP] Only magazine I actually read and not much more you can say - best articles you'll find in any woman's magazine. I can't remember if it's the fashion I got it for or the articles.. both give me just the right amount of serious and whimsy. [SEP] Vanity Fair is one of the best magazines.  The articles are well-researched and of interest to most I know who also read it. [SEP] This is such a great magazine. It takes me forever to get through an issue, because the writing is so good. I read almost everything. [SEP] I have mixed feelings about this magazine. I purchased a subscription because I wanted to read the cover stories several times when I saw it on a magazine rack, not really knowing much about the magazine. Well, the cover stories are great, in fact, there are always several long, in depth feature articles that are wonderful. However, too much society fluff that I don't care the slightest about. Worst though, is the actual magazine--the print size is miniscule!! Very difficult to read, even with the bifocals on! Also, too many perfume inserts. [SEP] VF covers relevant and interesting topics about people.  Just the right mix of glamour and intelligence. [SEP] I have wanted a subscription to this magazine for many years.  The Amazon price is unbeatable!  Plus I waited until I needed it added on to another product to qualify for free shipping.  It arrived in less time than stated, and started with the current month. [SEP] This magazine is full of great up-scale products for women, fashion advice, and great articles. It makes for an entertaining read. [SEP] Wonderful adult magazine, excellent political articles, intensive biographies plus all the latest glitz & celebs.  Always very, very topical even in summer when most publications tend to go to sleep. [SEP] I love Vanity Fair, but after paying for the subscription, I received the current issue that had been on the stands 2 weeks, and I already had it.  Then on Sept. 11, I got an old issue that was on the stands in July.  I have yet to receive the current issue that I see on newstands. So basically, I have yet to receive a current issue and wonder if I ever will.  By the looks of the old magazine they sent me, I am getting the returns from the news outlets, not current publications.  Big disappointment. The magazine is great, but not the service.","""Vanity Fair is a print magazine known for its mix of glamour and intelligence, featuring well-researched articles on a variety of topics.

User Reviews:
Smart Money is a solid magazine about business and finance and I have been reading it on and off again for the past five years. This magazine is a little bit big business and a little bit personal finance, combining together the features of a business magazine with that of an investment publication.<br /><br />One of the main things I like about Smart Money is the fact that it includes so many different articles each month. There are only a few regular departments in this magazine. The majority of the pages include featured articles and short articles that change from month to month. These articles can cover a wide range of topics from ways to cut your electric bill to the latest regulations in the insurance industry.<br /><br />Smart Money is an intelligent magazine and its articles are often a little more advanced than those of other financial publications. They don't reach a level that is too advanced to make them incapable of understanding, and that is good. But they are certainly intended for the savvier investor who already knows the ropes and wants some more specific, intermediate to advanced advice on personal finance and corporate happenings.<br /><br />Overall, I rank Smart Money as a very good personal finance magazine and it is one I will continue to read when I get the chance. It is like a combination of Fortune and Money magazines and its timely articles are often very interesting and helpful. Whether it's an article on reducing your cell phone bill or an article about the profit picture in the oil business, Smart Money is certain to inform and enlighten. [SEP] I ordered this magazine from Amazon and this is the first time I am disappointed for a purchase from Amazon. The magazine was delivered to me for a couple of months and then it just stopped! For the couple of months it was delivered, it was delivered late. And they take 6 weeks to process your subscription! Thats crazy...<br /><br />I would not blame Amazon though for this, its the company Hearst delivering this.. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know. [SEP] So far so good. It has some very interesting articles and some tips that I will definitely use.<br />Im pleased that I ordered it. [SEP] Enjoyed reading the magazine but after a year didn't find the articles too helpful. [SEP] hmm gave some good advice [SEP] Simply the best -- this magazine is very well laid out- not busy like Money seems to be, has some intermediate technical analysis, covers a great range of financial issues including new stock pics (performance of which which they track over time), mutual funds, financial managers/discount and full service broker comparisons, bonds, tax and retirement issues, travel, just the right amount (minimal) of tech product reviews, and a monthly car review/comparison.<br />I appreciate the focus on bargain hunting, both in stocks and the other areas mentioned above. These guys are not stock pumpers, but value seekers! [SEP] I subscribed to this magazine based upon multiple sources recommending it.  I had been buying it on the newstand so I know it is a useful mag.  Amazon, however, it not the place to order magazines.  Once you order you cannot cancel the order.  Amazon refers you to the publisher (and good luck finding a source for that contact that doesn't require snail mail).<br /><br />As of middle of May still not magazine in the mail...so now I am not even sure the subscription was processed.  If the direct from publisher deal costs a couple of dollars more it is will worth it to avoid the hassle of using Amazon as the middle man.  I was shocked because the customer service I normally receive from Amazon is excellent. [SEP] This magazine will no longer be published in a print edition after 08/2012. Online content only.<br />Glad I just renewed my subscription!! [SEP] I've subscribed to Smart Money for the last three years. Just received an ""Important SUBSCRIBER Notice"" advising me that they were automatically extending my subscription into the future ad nauseum. ""No more renewals to send back. No postage to pay. No more paperwork -- we take care of all the deatails for you by remewing your subscription automatically each year unless you tell us to stop.""<br /><br />Needless to say, I've notified them to stop. I wish I had never subscribed.<br /><br />It's worth noting that if you subscribe either through amazon or by using a mail-in card asking to be billed, the magazine will not have your credit card number to bill.

One of the best magazines available - variety of well-written, interesting articles in every issue. I appreciate the ability of the publication to provide well-crafted features that balance a subtle tone of not taking themselves too seriously or being overly pretentious while still being interesting and informative. [SEP] Great writing, topics and photos. [SEP] Wow! What an incredible disappointment. I have subscribed to this magazine in years past and it is evident that any and all staff who had a shred of good taste have left the publication. It is lacking all grace and good taste.

Once they get you in the auto-renewal program, it costs more, because they think you won't bother to cancel.  I just canceled mine and will just renew it myself every year, because then I can look for a good price!

Gift for my daughter -she loves it! [SEP] This magazine is not written for a homesteader, gardener or farmer.  It's written for people with more money than sense who feel like they ""could"" do any of the above.  Mostly I'm distressed by the complete lack of knowledge on the part of their writers.  I'm hoping it's that, the only other reason you'd deliberately spread false information would be pretty malicious.<br /><br />Overall a pass if you're looking for anything other than entertainment.

User Reviews:
I have several magazines that I consult for my reading enjoyment and/or enlightenment. With most of them, I thumb through and focus only on articles that seem interesting, but there are a few magazines that seem to hit the mark so consistently that I read the almost the entire issue month after month. One good example of the latter is Archaeology Magazine.<br /><br />What sets this magazine apart from most others is the content itself. Yes, there are some cool illustrations but where Archaeology Magazine shines is with the articles themselves. They are packed full of fascinating information and they enrich your knowledge of history. And I don’t mean refresh your knowledge- I mean enrich, because much of what you read here is going to involve historical facts you likely never heard before. I come away from every issue learning something brand new about a specific era in world history and the cultures that lived and thrived during that time.<br /><br />Archaeology Magazine has very few advertisements. Most of them are clustered at the end of each issue, so you get uninterrupted reading from start to finish. Another thing I love is that most of the articles are not excessively long. Some are only a half- page or less. At most, they might cover four pages tops. I like this, because I’m the type who may not want to commit to a long, say, 10 page magazine article. I read some magazine with long articles like this and the moment I see that it’s going to be this long- and I always check before I start reading- I often skip the article completely.<br /><br />Yet another reason to love Archaeology Magazine is the quality of the writing.

I was very impressed.Great writing and a nice variety of subject matter covered in the 1 issue I received.<br /><br />I'll probably reorder at some point but I have to get through a few more books:) [SEP] I'm not an archaeologist. If I was born redundantly wealthy I think that I might have been one.<br /><br />Archaeology is my ""stop everything and read it on the day it arrives"" magazine. I've been a subscriber for years. I read EVERY article. As a reader of archaeology and paleontology tomes, this magazine is the adjunct to my selections of books to read. My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.<br /><br />During a cross country moving event 7 years ago, I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology, not a telemarketer for sure, called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months. If archaeology is among your interests, you would entertain your fancies with a subscription. [SEP] Not much better than simply finding a blog on the internet. Beautiful pictures, but the articles are much too brief. It's sort of the &#34;readers digest&#34; of archaeology, I think.

(...)&quot;The New Yorker&quot; does set the standard. I can't agree with every idea, and not every standard they set is worth chasing. However, the sum of this magazine, helped founded by the great wit Dorothy Parker, is a solid thinking, literary, humorous magazine.<br />I won't belabor my review analyzing &quot;The New Yorker&quot; to death, but give it a shot. Read it, and be a better rounded, better thinking person as a result.<br />I fully recommend &quot;The New Yorker.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl [SEP] purchased as a gift, they are really happy with it. [SEP] This magazine has been my dads favorite since I as a kid. He cuts the jokes he likes out and mails them to my brother and I. This makes Father's Day gift giving a cinch. [SEP] I miss my subway stop when reading the New Yorker! [SEP] If you like really good writing this is the magazine to get.  The articles are informative and beautifully written.  I don't live in NY so I skip the local happenings, but the rest is worth every penny - especially the cartoons.  It is a great magazine. [SEP] Enjoyed the plot and conclusion. [SEP] Hard to get rid of.  I would not recommend this magazine to anyone.  First, they come WAY too often (every week).  Next, almost impossible to can subscription.  I found out they were doing automatic renewals on my credit card (WHICH I DID NOT AUTHORIZE) and even after writing a letter cancelling renewal and also writing CANCEL on a renewal notice and mailing back to them.  To me, this is FRAUD !  I had to cancel my card to get them to quit USING it ! [SEP] The New Yorker has made it's way to our kitchen table since I was tall enough to see over the edge of the table.  My Mom was an avid reader and now I buy the magazine, cause she would have wanted it that way.<br /><br />I like it for the cartoons and I'm absolutely naive when it comes to politics, so I need this magazine to get some idea of what is going on.<br /><br />With all the Blogging and other nonsense, I feel secure that the New Yorker does diligent fact checking before it prints something, so I rely on it where I won't rely on news printed on the internet.<br /><br />Regards, Lara [SEP] I have several criticisms of the New Yorker:<br />1) Editorials--It's like reading Pravda. Tell me the title and I can tell you what will be written. In brief, EVERYTHING Bush--Evil terrible. EVERYTHING Obama--Great.<br />2) Snob articles--Who wants to read puff pieces about Nora Ephron and her buddies?<br />3) Seymour Hersch--He is accurate maybe 50% of the time. In many cases things he wrote were proven to be wrong and we never get a followup or correction. [SEP] I have taken this magazine for about 2 years now, and personally, I enjoy it quite a bit. I am not a native of the New York area, nor have I any affiliations with the fine city. Personally I find the articles to be so well written in the New Yorker it is hard to put down. For me this means the first section of the paper is under appreciated, as its all about New York City, gossip and much more. The articles are of a wide varity of topics and often bring up points that may have had rolling around in your conscious but have never let them bubble up to the top. Fascinating articles can range from politics, famous lives of famous peoples, religious societies, and so much more.<br />This magazine is great if you are a reader. Articles are wordy, and worthwhile. This isn't something your going to be reading just the highlights through. I hardly find myself able to finish a magazine before the next one comes.

User Reviews:
Wired is a semi- interesting magazine that blends together articles about technology with those on politics, culture, and more. This magazine is aimed at a diverse audience but it generally caters to those who are technology savvy and like to keep up with the latest world events.<br /><br />Wired dedicates most of its pages to the discussion of electronics and other technology and computer nerds form a large percentage of the magazine's core subscribers. Articles about digital cameras, high definition televisions, internet marketing, and other like topics can be found in every issue. These articles often present unique angles on common problems and concerns in the world of high tech.<br /><br />What makes Wired interesting is the fact that it includes other articles on other subjects- topics that one normally would not associate with a technology magazine. It is common to find articles about popular culture, politics, and other topics and they sometimes seem out of place. One minute you're reading an article about PDA's and the next minute you're reading an article about the war against Iraq. It's a little weird but it also makes for a nice change of pace as you read.<br /><br />Another interesting fact with Wired is that it changes its authors more frequently than other magazines. The magazine has a few regulars but it likes to shuffle the writers around each month. This can be good and it can result in articles that present new and different perspectives each month. But it also means that the magazine is a little uneven and can sometimes include articles that do not communicate the way they should. I can recall reading several articles that left me scratching my head, wondering why the editor didn't make additional changes so that the articles were clearer.<br /><br />The departments in Wired cover a large percentage of the space in every issue and they exceed the total length of many other magazines' department sections. The departments (with the exception of one) occupy the first two- thirds of each issue. The monthly featured articles are found near the end of each issue. This layout is different from other magazines that mix the departments and monthly features together. With Wired, the departments and featured articles are kept separate.<br /><br />Overall, I like Wired as a whole and the political articles rank as my favorite part of each issue. The magazine jumps around from topic to topic and the authors change more frequently than other magazines; two facts that could make Wired a little too scattered for certain readers. Some of the articles are not the best written I have ever seen but Wired is still a good enough magazine to recommend. It keeps readers current on technology, politics, business, and entertainment with a reputation for being modern and hip. [SEP] Best popular mag in publication. It's a diabolically entertaining techie/consumer delight. From the paper gauge to the leading edge of print and type that are engineered to deliver the articles, there is simply no other mag that delivers a higher level of eye-popping &#34;Wow!&#34; month after month.<br /><br />March 2018 update: It died. They killed it. It was going so good. Then the mag took political sides and conspiracy. [SEP] Literally the worst publication I've ever read. Over 75% of the magazine is filled with full page ads. [SEP] What can I say.. Wired is a fantastic magazine.  Entertaining, informative articles.  It is one of the few magazines that BOTH my husband and I really enjoy.  It was delivered sooner than I expected since actual magazines ( that you get in the mail) usually take a long while to get your subscription started and out to you in your mailbox.  My husband and I both look forward to receiving and reading every issue of this magazine.  I am a news junkie and a pop culture fanatic, so I consider myself pretty current on most subjects,  it I always learn at least one (and often a few) new thing(s) in each issue. [SEP] The ""Wired"" magazine is the cheap and easy way to be a nerd without really being one. It is a techie magazine for everyone (including techies). It features happening people and happening things in the technology world. It also writes it in a way that is cool and hip. And for purveyors of unique print matter, this stands out for its production quality. Its glitzy yet understated if you know what I mean.<br />Content is not just about gadgets but all things technology. For purveyors of pure science, PopSci magazine is better. But for vignettes like approach to happening things, Wired works really well.<br />And for $10, you cant really complain. [SEP] To me, this seems a little ladish. I was looking for something that was based on technology. This was not, instead going on about start up companies and other rubbish. Have revcieved 2 copies so far and I can not say that I enjoyed a full story in either of them. Have 10 more copies to go, so maybe there will still be a couple of rabbits in the hat, but really do not think I will be re-ordering this drivil. [SEP] At 5 USD per year, and with a free trial, you won't miss much. I got the print version 12 years ago and it was a stellar magazine. Nowadays, most reviews seem to beg to differ. I say go ahead and try it. As for me, I stay informed about the Tech industry through Google and Youtube anymore. [SEP] I have been subscribing to Wired for little over a year now, and continue to be impressed by the wide range of interesting articles within the magazine.<br /><br />The latest issue I received yesterday contained a CD with 12 new songs from artists such as the Beastie Boys, produced under a radical new copyright licence. Wired is fighting for free music, and the right to copy and share, and created a licence which allows Wired subscribers the right to share and copy the CD enclosed. The CD alone is worth the cost of a years subscription ~ so an awesome bonus!<br /><br />Every issue holds something new - I love the way Wired is so far ahead on the technology front - reading the magazine ensures I am kept well up to date on all the latest electronic releases. Wired helps to keep me on top of the information and technology out there that is available to me - and the improvements being made to perform tasks such as surgical operations, immigration etc...<br /><br />On the smaller front, Wired contains reviews on new and upcoming computer games, and also provides articles and information on historical gaming such as space invaders.<br /><br />Overall, Wired is an educational, interesting, worthwhile read - I definitely recommend this magazine to anyone interesting in technology and how it is shaping our future. [SEP] I would not know if I enjoyed my subscription because I NEVER RECEIVED IT. not one copy. now they want me to re-subscribe. UH...NO...thank you. [SEP] I purchased this magazine for my son ( a 14 yr old science mind).  He loves it!  He educates me after reading each issue.  It is difficult to find magazines to enhance or go beyond classroom instruction.  When this one arrives, we do not see him for hours.  I bought Wired for him a year ago and will happily keep renewing his subscription.<br /><br />It would make a great gift.<br /><br />It is now April 13, 2008; this magazine is still going strong in our house.  I still highly recommend this magazine.<br /><br />It is now March 24, 2009; several years have passed and we still are still enjoying this magazine!","Title: Wired Print Magazine

With a focus on friends and family, gardening, interior design, building, family matters, flood, good health and shopping, you can't go wrong!<br /><br />I like the ""Yours for the Asking"" section where you can send away a postcard for more information instead of contacting each company.<br /><br />For mom's, the ""kids project"" section will be amusing and your kids will love the ideas.<br /><br />The cartoons are also cute and I had to laugh at the one that said: ""Of course I love you. Didn't you get my fax?""<br /><br />Something about the pictures in this magazine always remind me of a bright sunny day. The open kitchens and lush gardens are just a treat to see.<br /><br />The recipe section really has a personality all of its own. The ""Petite Caramel Apple"" recipe they had in the September 2001 issue was so adorable!<br /><br />I look forward to every issue!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review [SEP] Great value.  Magazine arrives promptly and is used in my office waiting room.  A great magazine for women of any age [SEP] I used to love this magazine for the decorating ideas, but have since canceled my subscription.  There is nothing but advertising for RX drugs on what seems like every other page.  Some of the ads are 2 - 3 full pages! I understand that advertising pays for the magazine, but they have gone overboard.  I used to check out their website as well and it's the worst.  Pop us ads for magazine subscriptions everywhere to the point that it's super annoying.  Bottom line is that this magazine has no meat in it anymore.  It's fat with advertising overkill, so just beware. [SEP] Great magazine at a great price lots of inspiration for do it yourself enthusiasts! Delivery was timely will order again if the price is right [SEP] When I was in my 20's I do not think these magazine would have been for me.  But now that I am a home owner with a family I love to look through it!  I guess different things are exciting now:)  What I like about the magazine is that it has a lot of areas they cover, from recipes, to crafting, to everything for the home.  It is not quite Martha Stuart fancy,more like ""the real woman's Martha Stuart!).<br />[[ASIN:B0019HBVFQ Voice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Set]] [SEP] gift... [SEP] When a magazine has very low cost to get started that should be a red flag! These magazines are mostly ALL advertisements! I went through and tore out all the pages that had advertisements on both sides and it took out about 3/4 of the magazine! And the rest of those pages had advertisements on one page or half the page. Big rip off and I have since switched magazines! [SEP] good old standby though the current issues have way too many recipes [SEP] I remember looking at this magazine when my grandmother subscribed to it many years ago. It was really interesting and high quality. Although the content is still fairly good, the magazine is now very thin, and includes much less information that is worth reading. I also noticed that over the course of my two year subscription, the physical quality was also quickly slipping. The color layers didn't match up, so that some of the pages were not readable. Some of the pages were cut improperly so that parts of articles were missing. This occured several times through the year. I still think that it is a good magazine to buy from the magazine rack if the issue looks interesting that month, but I won't spend my money on another subscription this year. [SEP] Love to read the articles and recipes!  Loved to read mom's subscription growing up and now I've given it to my daughters.

My 15 year old has been really into this magazine for two years. He reads and performs at a college level and finds all of the articles very interesting. We were very happy to get him a new subscription and the first one arrived after only 2-3 weeks. [SEP] This comes complete with words and print, can you believe it printed words. What will they come up with next moving pictures? This is Popular Science, it has it all. [SEP] I have always enjoyed popular science.  I hadn't considered Amazon for magazine subscriptions before, but it's so much easier and reliable than the traditional means.  You can update, renew, and cancel all from your account in Amazon.  Definitely easy and the way to go! [SEP] I love this mag. I have a collection of 1940-50's issues. I built science fair projects (and won!) from its pages as a kid. A 21st century kid has the same opportunity to experiment with stuff on the cheap with Pop-Sci as the mind fertilizer ... a national treasure still. [SEP] Great to deal with a great product!

User Reviews:
Food and Wine is a pretty good magazine for those who enjoy the finer things in life when it comes to unusual cuisine and expensive fermented beverages. This publication is usually very long- over 250 pages- and its packed full of recipes, travel excursions to wine growing regions, and general facts about different varieties of wine and where to find them.<br /><br />One thing about this magazine that surprised me at first is the emphasis on the food. I know the magazine is titled ""Food and Wine"", but my initial impression was that this would be a magazine devoted entirely to wine with occasional mention of the foods that go with wine. It isn't like that at all. The food sections and the recipes are just as important as the featured wines. Recipes are so frequent, in fact, that the magazine even has an index located near the front with all the recipes listed by food type, showing the page number to turn to for the recipe.<br /><br />Besides the frequent talk about food and wine, this magazine is also dedicated to entertaining. I have heard it suggested that this magazine should change its name to ""Food, Wine, and Entertainment"". It would make sense, because conviviality and high- class partying are certainly an important component of this magazine.<br /><br />There is one thing about Food and Wine that I wish was different. I appreciate the factual information and I like the personal touch that you find in some of the stories about winery owners, chefs, and the like. But I think Food and Wine gets a little too sidetracked from time to time in its reporting. For example, it is common to find stories that talk about subjects like home decorating. This would be fine in a magazine about home design, but I don't think it belongs in a magazine like this.<br /><br />Overall, this is still a good publication. Lovers of great eats and fine drinks will enjoy it the most. It's worth taking a look, if nothing else, just for the recipes. Even if you're not a frequent imbiber of the fruit of the vine, there is still something of interest to be found in the pages of this magazine. [SEP] While I would hardly call myself a wine connoisseur, I do enjoy this magazine for the articles and recipes.<br /><br />The Columns in the September 2002 issue include:<br /><br />From the Editor - an always inspirational look at what is happening in the food world by Dana Cowin<br /><br />""Fashions in food do come and go, and that's okay. Food should involve a sense of discovery. There's excitement in trying a new ingredient or visiting a new culinary destination."" -Dana Cowin<br /><br />Contributors<br />Letters<br />Web Chat - with Joyce Jue<br /><br />How do I cure my new wok?<br />What are some important wok rules?<br />Should I stir-fry all of my ingredients at once, or cook meat separately?<br />What kind of soy sauce should I use?<br /><br />Pairing of the Month<br />News & Notes<br />Home<br />Travel - an article about Mexico<br />Restaurants - The best new places to eat in Paris<br />Master Cook<br />Entertaining<br />Well-Being<br />Kitchens - the newest gadgets and kitchenware<br />Wine Matters<br />Wine Guide<br />Fast - Basil Chicken Curry with Coconut Rice<br />Directory<br /><br />Last Bite - Plum Tart<br /><br />The recipes are ranked according to ""fast,"" ""healthy,"" and ""make ahead."" They include soups and starters, salads and vegetables, pasta and rice, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and desserts.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review [SEP] Another great magazine.  I love reading it and the recipes that are in it. [SEP] I love this publication [SEP] Great magazine - recipes, writing, and ads. [SEP] It’s about food.  It’s about wine. It’s about food and wine, sometimes together and sometimes not. It’s pro food and pro wine. It’s glossy with lotsa pictures of food and wine. [SEP] I have not recieved one magazine as yet.  How much longer does it take to get a magazine,  I was hoping to get it before Christmas. [SEP] This is a magazine I look for. It is fun to read whether you make any recipes or not; you can't help but learn about a lot of related food products and techniques. I always go right to the best 10 products of the month. I don't drink wine but it make no difference so don't get hung up on that feature.<br />Recipes and tastes are mainly sophisticated and &#34;edgey&#34; and will introduce you to many new items in you food inventory. Kinda nice to not only know what things are but how to use them.<br />I'd give this magazine an A+ if I were a teacher assigning grades. Wish it came out twice monthly!<br />Jim in So Calif [SEP] I was devastated when Gourmet was suddenly put to bed. It was my favorite magazine of all time. The combination of information, presentation, human interest stories and wit  was unparalleled-- in my opinion. With a year and half of my subscription left, they started sending me Bon Apetit as a replacement. Bon Apetit sucks! I can leaf through the whole thing in 10 minutes, not feel the need to linger or stop at any page...it's uninspired and dull. Again, my opinion, of course.<br /><br />Food and Wine just started coming (I think it was a holiday gift) and it's filled the void somewhat. I'd say it is a solid 4 where Gourmet was a solid 5 and Bon Apetit is a 2.<br /><br />Food and Wine has a lot of interesting recipes and articles. It's got some foodie interest stories and lots of pretty pictures that make you hungry. I wish their fonts were prettier but the layout is well organized and  functional. I notice a trend toward health consciousness, which I like.<br /><br />I've also tried Saveur and was not that enthused. And the food network magazine is the PEOPLE magazine of food, not for reading articles but just skimming through pics. After careful consideration, I think F&W is the best food mag left on the market. [SEP] Great reference and good recipes.  I'm already getting renewal notices.","Food & Wine is a print magazine that caters to culinary enthusiasts seeking the finest recipes, wine pairings, and entertaining ideas.

User Reviews:
I really enjoyed Self magazine for many years.  For what ever reason, I think the magazine is great for younger women. It is positive and motivating.  All issues concerning body health and images are touched in this magazine.  I probably have grown out of the magazine since I am older now, but it really was great to get for years as I got to know myself as a woman and became confident in who I was.<br />[[ASIN:B000297VQA Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath]] [SEP] I first became a SELF reader after its sister magazine, WOMEN'S SPORT AND FITNESS, went out of print. Initially, I was a little uneasy with the switch, but I have come to love this publication.<br />I have read many fitness and health magazines, yet this is the one I look forward to every month. There are many different sections, and they are all inspirational yet practical. The beauty handbook offers tips such as how to get a certain look for less money. The health section explains, in plain English, various studies, health information, and recent developments. The fitness section offers easy-to-do, relatively short and simple workouts that are effective. The nutrition part gives readers easy, tasty, and healthy recipes to follow.<br />Unlike many magazines, SELF is not depressing to read. I have never felt negatively about my body or image after reading it. I feel energized, motivated, and inspired. Try it -- and experience the power of yourself. [SEP] I tend to favor Self magazine over the rest of the fitness magazines out right now.  One reason is the variety.  I love that Self doesn't just focus on physical fitness but also on your mental, emotional and inner fitness.  I have had a self subscription for a little over 5 years and still am happy with the quality.<br /><br /> I will say though if they keep turning it into a magazine about actresses (which my last 4 issues have been) then I will discontinue my subscription.  As I already subscribe to those magazines already and I want my fitness magazines to be about fitness.<br /><br />**Also a warning I get almost all my issues the month after they have came out!  This is new as they used to be one to two months early!** [SEP] Great magazine. Good workouts and recipies. [SEP] At last a fitness magazine for real people.  I love how this magazine covers many different topics, and often does so in a very realistic way.  To me, magazines like Cosmo and Glamour really don't represent real life.  Nor do they have pictures of real women in the magazine.<br /><br />I like this magazine for inspirational stories about women who got into shape.  Their health articles extend past the symptoms, and often have suggestions on prevention.  Their articles on nutrition are good, and once again realistic.  This magazine doesn't make you feel like you have to be a size 0, but rather small changes go make a difference. [SEP] I got this magazine because I was reading it one time in a waiting room and loved it. They usually repeat the same work out stuff but they tend to have great and easy recipes. [SEP] The real life story it has is a little gruesome, (with pics of woman who lost her breast to dieting, bloody and sewed up nipples.... eek!)<br /><br />I like something more inspiring. There's a few, (very few) fitness stuff and the fashion pics--can't really wear that in public, looks better on the runway. [SEP] I subscribed to Self because I wanted encouraging tips on health and fitness.  Over two years of subscribing, I'm convinced that this magazine is encouraging... just not in a healthy way.  This magazine promotes having internet flings, three-way sexual relations, and (this is the one article that really irritated me) how one woman discovered her happiness by having an affair.  Now, I'm not saying this sort of thing doesn't happen in the world, but I sure do not support it and do not want to spend my hard earned money to read about women who need psychological help or a better moral compass.  Does media follow society or does society fuel the media?  I think it's definitely both... but I know a good way to rectify it.  Stop producing garbage articles and telling youth and women in their 20s-30s that they can discover their sexual ""health"" by having multiple partners, affairs, and internet sex.  I'm incredibly disappointed with this magazine. [SEP] It is great magazine with relatable articles that are of interest to all ages.  Great as a gift to a parent or girlfriend. [SEP] Great articles on women's health issues.  Very up-to-date and helpful information.  Easy to follow workout programs.  Great tips on make-up and fashion.  I actually read every magazine from cover-to-cover.  I really like the low-fat recipes they have.  Every edition of this magazine seems to have an exercise program which is very helpful.  Most of the exercises are simple and easy to learn.  I have tried several of them (i.e. upper body and abs) and have seen results in a just a few weeks.

This is the best cooking magazine out there. [SEP] I find great ideas here. [SEP] I take almost every cooking magazine published and the way I manage the magnitude of publications is to tear out the recipes that I like and toss what's left. After receiving my first 3 Fine Cooking magazines, I noticed that I was tearing nearly every page out of the magazines, it was then that I decided that tearing pages out of Fine Cooking was a waste of time, that I needed to keep that magazine in tact. I treasure each issue. [SEP] Another great cooking mag. FC features a 'how to' in most issues and I love those. Most of the recipes are outstanding. Also makes a good gift. [SEP] Have been wanting this magazine for sometime! [SEP] My daughter loves it [SEP] I was very delighted to discover the Fine Cooking August/September issue feature on potato salad. While I have been honing my culinary talents in some areas (like homemade cinnamon rolls or waffles on occasion), I had not made a homemade potato salad in years. I think this issue of the publication has the best article on potato salad I have ever read, and I just made the best potato salad I've ever made. I used Hellman's real mayonnaise mixed with Greek yogurt over nicely boiled and cubed Yukon Gold potatoes to which some salt, black pepper and red wine vinegar had been added. I mixed in fresh chives, radishes, and celery as well as some Spanish capers. One recipe called for boiling the potatoes in white rice wine, but I didn't have any. I topped the mixture with paprika. I didn't use eggs, but the potatoes were delicious without them.<br /><br />What I loved about the feature was the fantastic layout of the article which clarified the two broad types of potato salads and the host of ingredients that can be added. Everyone should have this article.<br /><br />I can't wait to try the apricot slab bread featured on the cover, as well as the blackberry turnovers in the pastry feature inside.

Awesome selection [SEP] great [SEP] I used to love this magazine for their honest and impartial interviews, articles, and critiques.  Times have changed. It's a big fan magazine.

I received my renewal notice from EW and wasn't sure I wanted to renew.  Amazon's price was a bargin.

I've read it before and enjoyed it. [SEP] I live EW and have been getting it for years. I only wish the offered digital only. I read it on my iPad and give the paper copy to a friend.

The fact that I renewed it once again says I must enjoy reading it.  What is inside is all about the things we Americans do to entertain ourselves.  It not only reviews movies but also TV programs, music, books,etc..  It goes inside and behind the scenes in articles about the industry of entertainment.  True, it is neither earth-saving nor intellectually challenging, but then I believe that is why I enjoy it.  There are more than enough of those kinds of publications.  This one is for those of us who have a love of good movies and TV programming and like to have a place to read reviews<br />that will give us some direction in this regard. And sometimes you just want to pick up something to read that is enjoyable but not too involving. It has well-written articles that I have found to be accurate for the most part.

Just received my first issue.  I like the layout, colorful and easy to read.  There are recipes for the conservative cook and also adventures for the cook who likes to try new things.  I am already looking forward to the next issue. [SEP] The magazine is very educational as well as great menus that are very easy to follow. Would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys food with prep that is easy and ending result is delicious!!! [SEP] I learn so much from the magazine. New tips, new recipes, and we have great food quickly for dinner. [SEP] Love it! I read the articles, the recipes, everything. Definitely suggests delicious meals at home cooks can complete. [SEP] Just read my first issue and love it, new ideas and can't wait to make the new recipes. [SEP] This magazine is packaged very well for the casual reader. I would term it more as a Food Network Magazine than a recipe digest as some people might expect it to be. Yes, there are some recipes but its more about cooking tools (pretty expensive ones at that), fancy gear, insight into Food Network chefs, book promotions and then a few recipes.<br />Don't take me wrong, I like it but it is definitely not for the recipes it packs.<br />And for the rare vegetarian chef/cooking enthusiast out there, not your kind of book. [SEP] new and fast and best no auto renew. these make really good gifts for friends and for family. Thank you. [SEP] I order this every year for my best friend. I skipped one year and she quickly asked me to renew it for her. She loves to cook. [SEP] GOOD [SEP] Heck, at the moment it's my favorite magazine of any genre!  I really like the way the magazine is laid out - they have multiple sections for different types of cooking.  Most notably, to me, they have a Weeknight Cooking section and a Weekend Cooking section.  It should be fairly obvious, but the recipes in the weeknight cooking section are pretty fast and simple, and generally fairly inexpensive to prepare, whereas the weekend cooking recipes are a bit more involved/expensive/suitable for company.  This magazine is great for people who like to cook different types of food.  They not only include recipes inspired from around the world but have a nice balance of healthy/indulgent and fast/extravagant in the magazine.  Basically the magazine's got a little bit of everything, which I think is great because you can get everything in one location.  AND the recipes are great - one thing food network chefs are good at is creating recipes that actually have taste.<br /><br />Some other reviews complain about there not being a great number of recipes in each issue - they seem to average between 120 and 125 recipes each.  Since you get a new issue every month (or two), I can't help but wonder how many those people think they need from one source to get them through the month.  Personally I like the balance between recipes and other food-related content, and I got some great ideas for presents for Father's Day!","The Food Network Magazine is a vibrant and educational print magazine that caters to a wide range of cooking enthusiasts.

Great magazine.  Lots of good recipes that are easy and Yum.

The recipe cards all have shopping lists on the back, so you can grab the cards and head to the grocery store. There is also a handy recipe index organized by categories at the end of the magazine.<br /><br />The Kids recipe section encourages young cooks to participate in family meals. This issue had a recipe for a delicious tuna salad with roasted red pepper and grape tomatoes. Just for Kids tips give ideas for how to juice a lemon and there are cute kid comments about the recipes.<br /><br />Everyday with Rachael Ray embraces life and does it with a realistic flair. In the June/July issue, ideas for picnics include shopping lists and recipes for Melon Skewers with Orange-Lime Marinade. Roy Yamaguchi cooks at home with his family and offers recipes like Miso Cod with Buttered Mushrooms.<br /><br />What I like most about this magazine is the realistic recipes complete with everyone cooking and enjoying life. The pictures are spontaneous and the series of pictures for the Ice Cream Cake are step-by-step heaven. Just when you think this magazine has everything you could wish for, an Everyday Menu Planner appears to give recipes and shopping lists. Grilled Shrimp with Cucumber Salad and Smoked Turkey Panini are must-have recipes for the summer. Peaches resting on a marshmallow meringue are perfect for dessert after the Baby Back Ribs with Jammy Glaze.<br /><br />This is a magazine about cooks, chefs and Rachael's recipes. The ""Ask Rachael"" section gives you a chance to send in e-mails to ask Rachael about her life or to have your foodie question answered in the magazine. She also has decorating advice so now you know what to do with the shells you collected at the beach (or you could find them at Pier 1).<br /><br />What is the best feature in this magazine besides the recipes? ""What is in the refrigerator of your favorite Celeb?"" I'm always intrigued.<br /><br />If you collect cookbooks, there are many featured in this inspired magazine. The advertising doesn't seem to overtake the pages and is subtly blended in so it feels very natural and interesting.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review [SEP] Great Price - Love Rachael's Mag! [SEP] I can't stand Rachael Ray. Sorry. I got the magazine subscription from a friend as a gag gift. And it was a gag gift. The recipes all sounded horrible, or, the ones I tried, turned out horrible. You want a good food magazine, go with Taste of Home. and stop wasting your money on this poser. [SEP] I love this magazine because of the way it is put together. The page of favorite things is fun to look at and the dog recipe is one my dog looks forward to each month. [SEP] Didn't get as much out of the first issue as I had hoped to.  We'll see what future issue offer. [SEP] Even I (husband with very basic cooking skills at best) have pulled a recipe or two out of it.  Wife and mother-in-law really like it though, read it pretty much cover to cover soon as it gets here.  Nothing else to say really, just thought I'd give it props. [SEP] Company was great to cancel our subscription, but this was short on engaging content and long on useless ads [SEP] This magazine has a lot of ads but without them, how could the magazine survive? I like the balance of recipes and tips. As well as a look at new foods in the stores and different places to eat around the USA and world. Wish her recipes had easier to get ingredients and not specialty ones. Too much goes to waste otherwise. [SEP] I love two things about this magazine AND her show- every recipe I have tried has TASTED great and you do not have to be a chef to cook them. I have a busy life but like to cook delicious meals for my family and these recipes enable me to do just that. A caveat- if I get stumped I go to the Rachael Ray site and sometimes I can see someone cooking the same recipe or get tips. The organization of the magazine is brilliant- a recipe index complete with pictures gives the magazine a current and relevant feel in the age of iPads and instant viewing. The only criticism is that for those trying to cook healthy- nutritional information likes calories, fiber and fat content are woefully absent.","""Rachael Ray Every Day Print Magazine is a delightful culinary publication that offers a wide array of easy and delicious recipes.

User Reviews:
I like the magazines just fine. I use them to cut out pictures  that I like, to be used for collages. [SEP] I have had a Bazaar subscription for almost five years, and I am really disappointed in the magazine now. I used to read Vogue instead, but stopped because it was all ads and maybe 5 or 6 real articles (more than a page long) and now Bazaar is the same way. I cancelled my subscription a few months ago, but I am still getting issues since it hasn't run out yet (I prepaid). I still flickr through it since I am getting the magazine. In the most recent issue (March 2014) I had to flip through literally a half inch of ads (literally half the magazine) before I finally came to a full page of text. Every single page was an ad, except for the table of contents and the Editor's letter. I looked through the whole magazine and hardly any articles were more than a page long. The fashion articles were barely more than pictures with captions. I feel I deserve more for my money.<br /><br />About a year or so ago they revamped the whole magazine, changing layouts and stuff. I thought that the most dramatic change was going to be the ridiculous circles of text (they were cute at first in only a couple of articles here and there but now it's just annoying) as time goes on I have realized that they are putting more and more ads in the magazine as well.<br /><br />I know ads are how the magazine makes its money. I get that. I'd be fine if they were still putting out good articles with the ads, or at least spacing them out evenly between the ads. But the ads are now taking the place of the articles. What do the writers do all day? They sure as heck aren't creating content for the magazine. Bazaar has bloggers and an Instagram and a Twitter and so on and so forth. Why even read the magazine? You can go look on their website.<br /><br />This magazine is a waste of money. I'd rather read a fashion blog to find out what's in style since I know I'll get to actually READ something, not just look at a picture book for an hour. [SEP] Too many Ads  will not purchase again! [SEP] Good [SEP] It has become extremely political & biased.  I used to love the new makeup & fashion information.  That has now become secondary.  I regret renewing this magazine. [SEP] Of you really enjoy fashion. Then you will enjoy this magazine. I have for many years. [SEP] First, editorially, it has gone to the dogs. Junk articles written to teen level with too many ads.<br />Second, was to receive digital and print versions and after three months and many emails to Amazon cs, have yet to receive digital edition [SEP] Happy to purchase the 1 year subscription for such a great price! Looking forward to my reading nook with my favorite magazine! Reading it online just doesn't have the same feel as a hard copy :) [SEP] Yes [SEP] The clean, color-themed pages are easy on the eyes.  The Lists, Chic on the Street, Gift Guide, Work the Look, Extras accessories, and Fabulous at Every Age are all artistically presented and united by colors, metals, and gems.  Although I don't like most of the individual pieces, I thoroughly enjoy looking at the way Harper's talented staff juxtapose and arrange them so delightfully. The Beauty section names reasonably priced skin and hair products as well as new spa and exercise ideas for health.<br /><br />I find Vogue's ugly and decadent look in editorial and advertising pages repulsive and boring, with only occasional great photos. W wallows in kinky deviance. Lucky features inelegant, garish clothes that look like like a catalog of what clothing manufacturers have sent to be photographed.<br /><br />Uniquely, Harper's Bazaar is a delightful monthly guide to current fashion.  Thank you, Harper's!<br /><br />Edit: Over the last couple of years,Bazaar has morphed into another boring and depraved catalog like the others. This month's tip for twenty year olds: Take a walk on the wild side with inky tones and bondage details. So non-empowering for women...disgusting. I definitely won't be renewing.<br />Edit: December 2020 with a long subscription:  men in women's clothing, a puff piece on Planned Parenthood, which kills more unborn children than anyone else.

The only con I can think of is that the Halloween and other specialty issues are not included with the subscription, but considering they are usually $9.99+ an issue, I guess that is to be expected. (Although I do think I would pay more for my subscription to ensure I received all Martha Living type &#34;speciality&#34; issues as well, just a thought.)<br /><br />I love the crafts, the recipes, and the gardening advice. Highly recommended magazine! [SEP] This magazine leaves much to be desired. While once it was a gold standard now it’s just below average. Sadly enough, most times my wife and I will read aloud and laugh at these ridiculous recipes which sound disgusting and really, just out of touch.<br />After the last two years it’s more of a flip-through than a read-through. Magazines must be tough in the 21st century but I wish this one felt heartier. At least then it would make the ads more justifiable. [SEP] My first magazine, the March issue. Thin magazine, lots of advertisements, not what I ever, ever, expected from Martha Stewart. I honestly thought it was going to be a beefy magazine, but it was unusually flimsy. I am hoping the next issue will improve. I just expected something more substantial, but I know times are changing. Colorful, easy-to-read. It arrived in plastic, unbent and in perfect condition<br /><br />UPDATE: Issues have gradually increased in thickness and information.
