5.0,1627391044559,Great for at home use and so easy to use!,This is perfect for my between salon visits. I have been using this now twice a week for over a month and I absolutely love it! My skin looks amazing and feels super smooth and silky. This is also super easy to use (just follow instructions). I can see already that I will begin expanding the time between visits which will definitely help me save money in the long run. Highly recommend!,6,8
5.0,1621184430697,A little goes a long way!,"This is a really nice moisturizing lotion. It goes on lightly and is readily absorbed into my skin. My skin feels amazingly softer and smoother and allows for a nice base for my makeup to be applied over. You only need a small pea sized amount to cover your entire face and neck. Highly recommend for all skin types, ages and for women as well as men.",6,11
3.0,1619737501209,Just ok,"I try to get Keratin treatments every 3 months, but honestly it has been getting costly. So, when I saw this I was excited to try it. I found it difficult to use and almost impossible to get to saturate the back of my hair and straight iron it the way they do in the salon. Front and sides were ok, but I couldn't maneuver the back to get it straight. Then I saw the ingredients after the first time and saw it contained formaldehyde and that was the last time I used the actual treatment. I did, however, use the shampoo and conditioner (and I still am). I wish they sold the S&C separate because I really did like it and I am always in the market for a good hair wash which won't strip my hair between treatments. I will resume my regular treatments at my salon.",6,12
5.0,1617904219785,Good quality hair brush!,"Really nice small brush. Made well, nice wood made with boar bristle, my son absolutely loves this. It brushes his hair well and keeps him looking his best. This compact size makes it nice to keep in the center console of his car or to take on vacation with him. Highly recommend!",6,13
5.0,1613319236253,Great refreshing skin care routine!,"I had never tried anything for my skin consisting of pomegranate, so I was anxious to try this. It actually is an entire skin care regimine containing a cleanser, a toner, a facial cream, an eye cream and overall moisurizers. I actually was quite surprised how well this worked from start to finish. It was nice having an entire skin care routine in one package (instead of me working with various separate products. Fragrance is light and smells almost apple-like (but very light). I particularly like the cleanser and the toner. It also comes in a beautiful gift box so this would make a wonderful gift for someone. I bought another for my mother-in-law and plan to give it to her when we visit next month. Highly recommend!",6,14
3.0,1607339460872,Didn't do much and difficult to place and maintain on your face,"When I saw this, I was thrilled to be able to try it. I have suffered from bags and dark circles under my eyes for years now. I have been 'using' this for almost three weeks and I am not happy with it. First, it's almost impossible for me to keep it in place under my eyes. They come wet out of the packet and I was unsure what side was supposed to be placed on my skin. They do not stay in place and I found them falling off easily. Of course, maybe it was me or my skin, so please don't just rely on my review (read others). I will not be reordering.",6,15
5.0,1598212476613,"Quality hair iron, works perfectly to straighten my hair!","This is a great hair straightener. Heats up quickly and evenly, makes it easy to take the curl out of my naturally wavy hair. It fits easily in my hand and maneuvers around the front and back of my head easily. Does not heat up my countertop (keeps the heat on the iron). I love this pink, too, it matches my decor perfectly. I highly recommend this Bellezza styler.",6,16
5.0,1596473351088,Great all natural ear swabs!,"I really like these ear swabs. First they come in a large, handy box and are easy to store (will last a long time). Second, they are all organic and good for the environment. Third, they are strong and don't fall apart very easily. I highly recommend these over Q-Tips (which I have used for years).",6,17
5.0,1593352422858,Wonderful overnight cream!,"To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.",6,18
5.0,1547589843451,This really works!,"At first when I saw this, I wasn't sure what this. I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!",6,19
5.0,1547589356557,Nice manicure set for men or women,"This a really cute kit which would make for a great gift for someone. It is in a little leather like pouch and has everything you need to give yourself a quality manicure. The nail clipper is a perfect size and works just as well on a women or man's nails. The file is nice as well (although I still prefer to use emory boards on mine). I actually bought another one of these to give to my son as a stocking stuffer this last Christmas for him to use at college. Just a nice, quality made kit at a reasonable price.",6,20
4.0,1663163956007,Hydrating!,"This lip butter is pretty much a lip gloss. I haven't noticed any lip plumping action, but it is hydrating. It smells wonderful! There's a slight pinkish tinge to it, but it's sheer and not very prominent. It doesn't last very long and does transfer.",33,68
5.0,1660417831321,Luxurious!,"I am enjoying this face cream. I find it to be luxurious. It's nice and creamy. The glass jar is very nice. It smells wonderful. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I've been using it at nighttime because it is a heavier cream. I haven't noticed any miraculous results, but I am a regular user of anti-aging products, so I like to think that this is just continuing what's already going on.",33,69
4.0,1660417672640,Good Way to Use a Face Oil,"This is a good way to use a face oil. Normally I skip facial oils because I don't like the way they feel on my face. This one is mixed with a cream, so it doesn't leave your face feeling greasy or oily after applying it. It has a pleasant scent. It isn't sticky though it does leave behind a little tackiness, but that disappears quickly. I'm not really sure what it's supposed to do. I like it. It's definitely hydrating. I do think the descriptions are pretty vague. It doesn't bother my sensitive skin, which is always a plus.",33,70
4.0,1644349248608,Small Bottle,"I'm in my mid-fifties and I have been using creams targeted to the neck and chest area for a few years now. I have definitely seem some improvement in the texture of that skin. This bottle is very small. It's a lotion consistency and it has a light pleasant scent. It doesn't leave my hands feeling sticky, but the bottle is sticky. I have washed it at least once and it remains sticky. It absorbs quickly. I can't tell if it's doing it's job as I haven't seen any noticeable changes, but it isn't hurting anything either.",33,71
4.0,1629410931015,Creamy!,"This night cream has a good, thick consistency. It's definitely a cream and not like a balm. It has a strong scent to it. It smells like a flowery perfume. It smells nice, but it is strong. If you are sensitive to smells, this may not be for you. I don't have any problems with it, though I do prefer citrus scents over flowers, but that's just a personal preference. It doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy. It absorbs pretty well.",33,72
5.0,1628462041411,Leaves Skin Feeling Soft!,"I really like this face oil by Dose of Colors. It is fragrance free, but it has a light, pleasant smell to it. It does feel a bit oily, but that goes away after several minutes. I'm only using this at nighttime, because it's too heavy for daytime use in my opinion. It doesn't annoy my sensitive skin. It leaves my skin feeling super soft!",33,73
4.0,1623188037011,Pleasant Scent,"This perfume by Shakira has a pleasant scent. I can detect sweet and spicy notes in it. It is not very strong, which is good. It definitely fades over the course of the day, but I can still detect light whiffs at the end of the day. The bottle is attractive, but the cap or lid is way too plain. You have the sexy body shaped bottle and then there's a little clear plastic lid that has not aesthetics at all. If you could be the lid to anything and doesn't stand out at all.",33,75
4.0,1610133666100,Refreshing!,"I like wearing eye masks such as these. They are refreshing and energizing. I store them in my small beauty refrigerator which makes them even more enjoyable. After wearing them, I felt ready to take on the world! It comes with a little spatula so you can take them out of the jar without touching them. It felt like they were slipping as I wore them, but when I went to the bathroom to remove them, they were still in place where I left them. One thing I like about this type of eye mask is that it's easy to go about your day while wearing them. I didn't have any issues with sensitivity thankfully. My eyes are super sensitive.",33,77
4.0,1607744901734,My First Scrunchie!,"This is my first scrunchie. I have not had my hair cut in about 9 months because of the pandemic, so my hair has gotten longer than I've worn it in years! I'm in my early 50's and it's a little below my shoulders now. My hair is thick and coarse. It's long enough to wear in a messy bun for the first time in years! The scrunchie is easy to use and holds up my thick hair pretty well. I don't have to readjust it because it's falling. You can feel the coils inside the fabric. I find it fascinating how it works. When I take it off, it shrinks up again. I like it!",33,78
4.0,1605885919061,Great for Travel!,"I recently took the Pinrose fragrance quiz on their website and this was the scent that was recommended for me. It's okay. I don't dislike it. I definitely don't love it. It's a musky floral scent. Floral scented fragrances are not my favorites. I prefer either fruity or sweet. This supposedly has peach notes in it, but I don't detect them. Fragrance is a very personal thing and it can smell differently depending on your body chemistry. I do like the concept of the petals. They're basically scented towelettes. They are fairly dry so you're not dripping in scent. I'm planning on putting some of these in my daughter's Christmas stocking. These are also great for travel!",33,79
4.0,1605814409168,Fun Way to Try Out a New Scent,"These Pinrose Gilded Fox petals are a fun way to try out a new scent! The box comes with 12 packets. Each packet has a fragrance infused towelette. They aren't too wet, but you are able to rub or wipe them on your pulse points or wherever and transfer the scent to your body. This one has a very interesting smell. At first I didn't detect the chocolate, so it's a bit subtle. The smell is a powdery sweetness with a hint of chocolate. I threw away the wipe in my office trash can and caught pleasant whiffs of it throughout the day. Since the box comes with so many, I plan to put some in my daughter's Christmas stocking so she can try them out. They would also be great for traveling.",33,79
4.0,1597942744359,A Bit Oily,"I am in my early fifties and my morning skincare routine calls for Vitamin C serum. This doesn't smell like most other Vitamin C serums that I have used. It has a neutral scent that doesn't linger. The serum consistency is thick, but runny. It's a bit oily and doesn't absorb quickly. My skin can be sensitive at times, but I didn't have any problems with this. Overall, I like it, but I don't love it.",33,81
4.0,1597526701753,Good Variety of Travel Size Skincare Products,"It's difficult to find some targeted skincare products in travel sizes. I can usually find cleansers and moisturizers, but serums and eye creams are not so easy to track down. This travel set comes with a foaming cleanser, an eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer as well as a beauty spritz. I wasn't sure what the spritz was for, so I sprayed it on my face after washing it, kind of like a toner, but later I discovered that it's more of a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel. They're small and should last up to a week, I'm guessing. The individual products seem to be fine. I've used the foaming cleanser before, but the other items were all new to me. The scents were light and floral. None of the products were irritating. I have sensitive eyes and skin and nothing bothered them. I do think the kit is a bit pricey, but that's not affecting my review.",33,82
4.0,1593043740906,Comfortable Head Band,"I work at home, so I can't get by without wearing a face mask for a good part of the day, but I do wear one if I am going out. I have had issues with some masks not staying over my ears. This is a good way to utilize those masks. The  headband is comfortable and light weight. It has some stretch to it. The buttons are a little loose, so I tightened them before I wore the headband out in public. I found that I had to pay attention to how I was putting it on my head so the buttons were even, otherwise my mask was crooked. It's definitely a helpful item.",33,84
4.0,1591977214185,Good Hand Sanitizer!,"For a new (or at least new to me) brand of hand sanitizer, I am pleased with it. I like the pump dispenser which is easy to use. The bottles are a good size. While you can detect the smell of the alcohol, it's not too strong or overpowering like some can be.  With so many new brands out there these day, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.",33,85
4.0,1588865592842,Leaves Skin Feeling Soft,"I am in my early fifties. I found a multi-step skincare routine a few years ago and I follow it pretty regularly. The final step for both the morning and evening is face oil. For the longest time, I skipped that step because I didn't want my face feeling oily. Plus, it just seemed that it would clog pores and lead to acne. I recently tried a different face oil and found it wasn't a bad step at all. This oil has a nice, essential oil smell to it. The only ingredient that I can detect by smell is the lavender. It's not overpowering, but it is noticeable. The oil absorbs quicker when it's applied to dry skin. I tried it out on the back of my hand and it absorbed nearly right away. When used as the final step in my skincare routine, it took much longer to absorb. It leaves my skin feeling really soft! I haven't had any problems since using it. I personally only use it at nighttime because I don't want my skin looking oily, even for a little while, during the day.",33,86
4.0,1585261263214,Light Weight,"This is a light weight serum. It has a runny, liquidy consistency that's non-greasy. It doesn't leave behind any stickiness or tackiness. There is no scent to it either. It absorbs really fast and immediately hydrates your skin. It leaves a smooth finish. It's non-irritating and doesn't annoy my sensitive skin.",33,87
4.0,1583932042329,Soft,"I wear headbands like this in the evening when washing my face and following my skincare routine. These headbands are very soft. I found these to be a little small, but they do stretch enough to accommodate my large head. I have just had other headbands that were a little larger and didn't require being stretched to the max just to fit. I like the variety of colors and have shared these with my eighteen year old daughter. One thing that I do like is that the bow doesn't get off centered as easily as my old one. My old one has to be adjusted every time I put it on. This one seems to be just fine.",33,88
3.0,1582999036646,Not The Right Target Audience,"I guess I'm not the right target audience for this Vitamin C/Retinol Moisturizer. I'm in my early fifties. Both of those ingredients are part of my daily skincare routine, so I thought it would be perfect for me. I did not see the recommended for ages 20-30s before ordering. It has a light, barely noticeable citrus smell to it. It absorbs really quickly but in doing so, I found it to be over drying on my mature skin. Other than that issue, I didn't have any other problems with my sensitive skin. Luckily, I have an eighteen year old daughter so I will pass it along to her to use.",33,89
4.0,1581772960365,Nice Fruity Scent,"This serum is more the consistency of a lotion than serums that I have used in the past. It has a nice fruity smell. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. The serum absorbs quickly and isn't tacky or sticky. I am in my early fifties and use an assortment of anti-aging products daily. I haven't seen any new miraculous results with this, but it does moisturize. As a regular user of such products, I really don't think I would see anything new from them, but rather a continuation of what I have already started to achieve.",33,90
4.0,1580742144072,Non-Greasy,"I apply body lotion every morning and night. This one is a thinner lotion than some, but it absorbs quickly. My skin just drinks it up! It's non-greasy and has a light, pleasant scent to it. The bottle is a little oddly shaped. It's thin and flat which makes it a little difficult to grip in my opinion.",33,91
5.0,1578928089878,Gentle!,"This goat milk cleanser is very gentle. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate or annoy my skin at all. It has a pump dispenser that works nicely. It's thick, like a lotion consistency. The cleanser doesn't lather or foam. I haven't been able to notice any scent, good or bad. It doesn't dry out my skin. I'm very pleased with it.",33,94
5.0,1577024355925,Moisturizing,"'Tis the season for dry hands! I go through a lot of hand creams in the winter months. This lotion is not too thick, but it's not runny either. It absorbs nicely and doesn't leave behind any greasiness. It has a light, fruity scent that's not overpowering. In fact, I found it to be barely noticeable. It is very moisturizing and leaves my hands soft. I would order this again.",33,95
4.0,1562550265320,Leaves Teeth Clean,"I've used sonic toothbrushes before. I like the pink color of this. It comes with a travel case and extra brush heads. There are several different speeds/settings that you can use. As far as I can tell, there isn't a timer on it which would be nice. The bristles are pretty firm. I'm guessing maybe they are a medium. It does a good job of leaving my teeth clean.",33,96
3.0,1550588697518,Doesn't Irritate My Skin,"I am in my early 50's and have been a regular user of anti-aging products for the past several years. This serum comes in a glass bottle and has a dropper applicator. It takes about half of the dropper to cover my face. It has a tacky (but not sticky) feel to it which remains for a while even after it has absorbed into the skin. The microbeads have to be crushed or else you have little white beads on your face. It's not difficult to break the beads. I just press on them and they rub into the skin. After applying the serum, my face was really dry. I have been using this at night. I have a multi-step skin care routine so I followed this with my nighttime moisturizer, then retinol, and some face oil. The serum doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. There is a mild scent, but nothing that I could recognize. Overall, it's okay. I haven't noticed any tightening or improvements in my skin. However, as a regular user of anti-aging products, I wasn't expecting anything new.",33,97
4.0,1548092773968,Easy to Use!,"My husband started a business recently and was looking at options for his bookkeeping. He knew that he wanted to use QuickBooks from his previous experience. Originally he was going to use the web based version, but since this comes with a year of enhanced payroll, he decided to go with this. He consulted with an accountant in getting it set up for his company's needs. He did have to contact customer support to help him get the enhanced payroll feature working. For some reason, it had the number 1234567 prefilled and he couldn't change it without customer support. So far it has been easy to use and has done everything he's needed it to do.",33,98
5.0,1545303800417,Great Quality,"I have been using jade rollers for the past few months. This is my third one. The first one that I bought was much larger than this and I found it to be a bit awkward at times. Plus the end that rolls around the eyes was a static piece, not a roller. Then I tried a smaller one more recently. It was fine, until the eye roller piece broke off. The metal piece that holds it in never felt really sturdy and when it broke, I wasn't really surprised. This one is the nicest one I've tried. It's a great quality and very sturdy. The size is perfect. The directions say to chill it in the refrigerator, but I have found that it's usually cold enough just leaving it out on my bathroom counter. I use it primarily to help my serums and creams absorb into my skin better. This comes with another tool, a Gua Sha, which I was unfamiliar with. They both were in a nice drawstring bag and would be perfect for gift giving.",33,19
5.0,1544236907167,Impressive!,"I have one of the original Makeup Erasers and to be honest, I can't tell the difference between these cloths or the original one. Well, that's not entirely true, I can tell the difference. These have a hanging loop and the name brand ones don't! Side by side, they are identical. These are just as soft. They do an impressive job of removing makeup, especially mascara. They are gently on my skin. These come in a set of 2, plus the set is half the price of the original. I will be ordering some of these for the girls in my life!",33,100
4.0,1541942181487,Nice Variety of Colors,"My daughter received a UV Light Manicure Light last year for Christmas from her aunt. It came with a couple of colors, but she is thrilled to have this nice variety of colors now. The quality of the nail polish is comparable to other gel nail polishes that we have bought. It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To solve this, we put a drop of nail polish on the back of each bottle. The polish wouldn't dry without the LED light, which we realized after 5 hours of waiting. So we took a piece of clear tape and covered the polish drop. So now she can easily identify the right bottle without having to open each one.",33,101
5.0,1618934798418,Works great,Great shampoo and conditioner set. Smells great and leaves hair feeling clean and soft. I like this brand and have used it in the past. Seems to be great quality.,48,131
5.0,1617909095488,Work well for light hold,This is much faster and less messy than using the cream. Quick any easy. Not the longest hold but good for a few hours. Not much of any smell to it which is probably better. Some of these wax's are way too fragrant.,48,132
5.0,1616954539796,Works great,Great soap with mild natural scent. Works great on my sensitive skin. Leaves it soft and clean and doesn’t dry it out.,48,133
5.0,1616457223039,Works great,Great quality soap! So many good ingredients that are good for skin and hydrating not drying. Smells great and skin feels clean and soft after. Highly recommend.,48,134
4.0,1615701950469,Prefer fingers,These are so popular and I was excited to try but I don’t feel like it did it for me. It was hard to get down to my scalp and move around. Felt much easier to just use my fingers. Maybe I need to practice more of try a different massager. They seem well made though and look just like the picture.,48,135
5.0,1609182507469,Small but Works great,Tiny waver that works great to make smaller sized waves. Heats quickly and makes waves quickly. Only took a few minutes to do all of my daughters hair.  I only do a top layer of hair and around the face. Find that it looks less poofy this way. Seems well made and good quality.,48,137
5.0,1608753663995,Fun Wig,Our girls love to play with this wig. Easy to put on and comes with a wig cap. Looks real.,48,138
3.0,1606878884208,Don’t grab well,"These look like nice tweezers, similar in look to tweezerman tweezers but for some reason they don’t grip hairs very well and are very annoying for me. They seem to match up perfectly at the end so not sure why they don’t grab well. Will use as backups or keep in purse or car.",48,139
5.0,1606103453308,Great oils,Great set of oils that are great to use as is or when making other products. I used the coconut oil in a roller ball with some tea tree and clove oil for a rash and it works great. They are both have no scent.,48,140
5.0,1604762653089,Works great,Great set of hair items. Would make a nice gift. Works as described. The material is extremely plush and soft and feels luxurious to wear.,48,141
4.0,1598591443230,Works well,Decent shampoo. I used it alone without conditioner so I could see how it worked and it seemed to clean my hair well and leave it manageable. The scent is ok as well. While I didn’t notice anything negative there wasn’t anything that stood out to me to buy it again.,48,142
5.0,1594848248797,Works great,I have been wanting to try these food peels. I was nervous to try but after reading some of the other reviews I finally did and am glad I did. Followed directions and my feet started to peel the next day. No bad reactions or problems. I didn’t use the included tool. Soaking your feet each day helps with the peeling process.,48,143
5.0,1593321721590,Great polishes,"Great set of nail polishes. My daughter and granddaughter both liked them and thought they were great quality. Nice colors, go on smooth and dry quick. Don’t chip easily and Last as long as other quality polishes.",48,144
4.0,1585080133476,Gel sunscreen,"Interesting sunscreen. Has a clear gel  consistency, goes and smooth and easily. Rubs in great and dries quickly, smells first of running alcohol and then berry. Seems to be effective in preventing sunburns.",48,145
4.0,1556652791507,Works great,"This is a nice cordless, travel size waterpik. It has good power for not being a regular waterpik. Some other cordless ones I’ve tried haven’t had the same power. This comes with a variety of tips. Is easy to fill and use. Has different settings and power levels. Charges via a usb cable.",48,146
4.0,1551117781592,Works well,Works well. Pain free. Easy to use. Requires 1 AA battery which is not included.,48,147
4.0,1544671363612,Works well to straighten,"This flat iron works well to straighten hair, but I couldn't get it to curl very well like other straighteners I have. It is easy to use and the red light on the dial turns green when it is ready which is nice.",48,149
4.0,1544671031249,Works well,"Clippers work well. I prefer to use them without the plastic catcher that is attached, but it easily comes off. Nice travel case that includes a nail file. Clippers are very sharp and cut efficiently and smoothly.",48,20
5.0,1544238606316,Great shampoo,"From my daughter: I usually buy Dove, Pantene or Tresemme shampoo. I haven't tried this particular tresemme before, but I really like it. It works great like the other varieties I have tried. This particular one smells like coconut, but not overly artificial or perfume-y. The shampoo works great, leaves hair clean, but not dried out and the conditioner works perfectly leaving hair soft and manageable but not greasy and weighed down.",48,150
4.0,1654314287951,Typical thin and slinky silk scrunchies,"There are six silk scrunchies in this package in different basic colors. They are thin and slinky and are typical of what I expect of silk holders.<br /><br />These hold my hair well but as is expected of silk, can easily slide out. These are best on long hair because the potential to slide off is not as great. I personally prefer velvet scrunchies to these silk ones because they are ""beefier"" looking. However, for those who want the elegance of silk, then this delivers.<br /><br />The current price of $20.79 ($25.99 minus 20%) comes to $3.47 per band which is competitively priced for 100% Mulberry silk items like these.",83,187
3.0,1653607216628,The cream is blue but goes on clear; it is very hydrating; looks like ½ a jar,"The photo on Amazon must be wrong. This cream is blue and not white. I hate colored creams. However, this goes on clear and was so super hydrating to my face, that I did not mark it down for the color. Note that the box it came in was all smashed and it was almost double the size of the jar. They could have fit almost two jars of this in the box. In addition, the cream in the jar looks half full.<br /><br />I love the results but not the packaging or the color or the jar being half full.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 for 1.69 fluid ounces is competitive. NOTE THE SIZING (.05 fluid ounces) SPECIFIED ON AMAZON is wrong too.",83,188
3.0,1650921998863,Good detangling comb for the right pet; handle could be thicker; my cats hate this - 2.5 stars,"I love the tines on this long and short detangling comb.The only thing I do not like is the thin handle. I would have preferred a thick silicone handle so that I could get a better grip. The tines are strong and the spacing allows it to work very well BUT there are issues. <br /><br />I have three long-haired cats and unfortunately, my cats do no like this as it really pulls at their hair. Therefore, I have mixed feelings about this comb. On one hand, it detangles and gets out a lot of hair but on the other, my cats want to bite me when using it. I love how it works but not their response.",83,190
3.0,1647381362768,Light-weight cream that is a bit tacky to start; slightly moisturizing once absorbed; scentless,"This comes in a one gallon jug. There are two negatives to me. First, the biggest negative is that it takes work to dispense the lotion. Second, this lightweight lotion goes on tacky and takes a few minutes to absorb. Once absorbed, however, it is lightly moisturizing and it leaves my skin soft.<br /><br />This is vegan per the bottle and the lotion is scentless. My favorite lotion is [[ASIN:B09HYPWMKG Ginger Lily Farms Pure Morocco Argan Oil Butter Lotion]]. That is perfect for a massage as well. It has a fragrance and is cruelty-free but not vegan.<br /><br />This is decent but the initial tackiness I dislike. The current price of $54.99 for 128 ounces comes to $.43 per ounce, which is almost double the price of the lotion I love.",83,191
3.0,1647121848816,Great medium-density blenders; flat angle is perfect for smooth applications; bad pricing on pkg,"This is a nice set of five individually wrapped pink-colored blending sponges all with an angled side. I love the sponges as they are of medium-density.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is great for smooth applications. They feel good in my hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. Since these are of medium density, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy. I also love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These would have been perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer because each comes in their own package EXCEPT for the negative issue I mention below.<br /><br />There is one big negative, however. Each package is marked with a price of $1.55 each. Unfortunately, at the current price of $9.95, it comes to $1.99 per sponge which is $.44 cents more than the price marked. Therefore, I cannot recommend these if they are being used for resale or as stocking stuffers or Easter basket gifts because the price is actually more than it says on the package.",83,193
4.0,1638840554514,Beautiful compact mirror w/high-gloss shine; nice tray; okay case all w/an inspirational verse,"This is a nice set. It contains a beautiful compact mirror with regular and close-up mirrors on the inside. Both mirrors are small but functional. It is fashioned like a pocket watch. The clasp is solid and the finish is high-gloss like the interior mirror itself.<br /><br />The saying (see below) on the outside of both sides of the mirror is inspirational. It says ""Beautiful girl you can do amazing things.""<br /><br />There is also a small dish for jewelry and a very cheap make-up case all with the same inspirational verse.<br /><br />In summary, this is a nice gift set. The current price of $20.89 ($21.99 minus 5%) is competitive.",83,194
5.0,1634340599912,I love these dense blenders & their flat angle which is perfect for smooth applications,"This is a nice set of 10 colored blending sponges all with an angled side. I love the sponges as they are dense.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is great for smooth applications. They feel good in my hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. Since these are dense, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These are also perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />At the current price of $8.49 ($9.99 minus 15%) these are a reasonable $.85 per sponge.",83,196
3.0,1631367075148,Cute MOM gift but not as fragrant or impressive as I expected,"[[VIDEOID:f77804a8088c40dfbef6fdcfacf8b15a]] There are three individually wrapped bath bombs in this set along with one bar of hand soap and a package of dried rose petals. In total there are five items. The bath bombs spell MOM with the heart substituting for the letter O.<br /><br />The outside packaging looks giftable but the inside is just an ordinary uninspiring throw-away box. The fragrance of the bombs and soap is hardly noticeable. It has a whisper of rose aroma and I detect no lavender at all. I did try the letter M bomb in a hand bath and it dissolved in 5 minutes in lukewarm water and a nice foam of suds lasted about 10 minutes. The results initially felt moisturizing because my hands felt a little oily after the hand bath; however, eventually I needed to moisturize my hands with lotion.<br /><br />With regard to the dried petals, one has to like something like that in their bath because it requires straining the water so that they don't go down the drain. For me, I would never use petals in a bath, so keep the recipient in mind when ordering this.<br /><br />The bar of soap is the only item that would be used by most people.<br /><br />One thing I love is that the color of the dissolved bomb did not adhere to my skin, my hand bath, or my towel. That is not always the case with bath bombs today.<br /><br />The current price of $9.74 ($12.99 minus 25%) comes to $1.95 per item which is reasonable.",83,198
4.0,1625006698955,Fragrance is subtle but lovely and floral; just enough to freshen up an area or relax to,"This is a nice room freshener. The fragrance is subtle but lovely and floral. Some fragrances give me a headache if they are too strong but this one does not. I love spraying this in my bedroom. It is also a great fragrance to relax with before falling asleep--no dangerous scented candle needed. It does not help promote sleep for me but it is soothing to my senses. The aroma does not last long--about 15 minutes. I happen to like fragrance, so I do like this linen spray.",83,204
4.0,1624659702420,Very functional basic brush set; wish handles were longer; love the bristle color,"There are 9  soft non-shedding make-up brushes in this set. This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />Each brush comes individually packaged. In fact it is over packaged. The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel good against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. I do wish the handles were a tad longer. Nevertheless, the current price of $8.99 is an super reasonable for this set as it comes to $1 per brush.<br /><br />This is a perfect set for the young teenager starting out on her make-up journey.",83,205
3.0,1624399417259,PU case really smells; brushes are okay; two brush heads frayed,"There are 14 brushes in this set. There are brushes for foundation, blush, eyeshadow, eye blending (fan brush), etc. In fact, there are more brushes than I needed. <br /><br />The one unique brush in this set (see photo) is the one that looks like a paint brush. This is perfect for cheek highlighting.<br /><br />The bristles are relatively soft but not as soft as I expected. They feel pretty good against my skin but not great. Also, the heads have a slight odor. The PU brush case has a tremendous chemical odor and needs to be aired out a while.<br /><br />This is a bargain basement travel set for someone who is starting their make-up journey. The current price of $11.19 comes to $.80 cents per brush. In this case one gets what they pay for; it's a marginal price for a marginal quality set that is functional. ",83,206
4.0,1624274497670,Wafer-thin portable soap; dissolves instantly; good lather; fragrance does not come thru on hands,"There are three packages of wafer thin sheets of soap in 80 sheets each pack. The wafers are attached in the center but pull apart easily. There is also a sliding top tin supplied that will hole 80 sheets. Be careful not to get them wet as even a drop of water causes them to dissolve. When I washed my hands with one sheet, it created a nice lather and left my hands clean. I do not feel that it was moisturizing as claimed. Also, even though there are three wonderful fragrances (lavender & aloe, bergamot & ylang ylang, and jasmine & patchouli) that smell great as a whole 80 sheets, that fragrance does not come through on the hands because the soap is too thin to leave any fragrance behind.<br /><br />The current price of $13.95 comes to $.06 cents per sheet. I consider these perfect for when using a public restroom that has water but no soap. It is also great for camping or any place where portability is paramount without carrying a full wet bar of soap in a container.",83,207
5.0,1623796829059,12 supremely soft non-shedding make-up brushes with cleaner/holder,"There are 12  supremely soft non-shedding make-up brushes in this set with a silicone brush head cleanerbrush that doubles as a mini-brush holder. This is a gorgeous set that contains a brush for most uses. There is no fan, eyebrow, or lip brush, however.<br /><br />This is an attractive brush set in matte black. Unfortunately, the color of the silicone cleaner cannot be chosen. I thought I was going to get purple to match with my purple bathroom and I received a pink one.  <br /><br />The bristles are velvety soft and they do not fall out, which is great. Their soft bristles feel fantastic against my skin and work like many other brushes I tried previously. I particularly LOVE the large blush/foundation brush. The only thing to note is that because the bristles are super soft, these brushes are more suited for powder applications than cream or liquid.<br /><br />The current price of $19.99 is reasonable for this quality set as it comes to $1.67 per brush or $1.54 per item if counting the silicone cleaner.",83,208
4.0,1623116811042,Lightweight moisturizer that mildly moisturized my body; good for the summer - 3.5 stars,"There are four individually packaged 2.53 fluid ounce tubes of moisturizer in this set. They are all the same tubes. This moisturizer is lightweight and is mildly hydrating. It absorbs quickly and is a good product to use in the summer. I also like the fresh cucumber-like aroma.  I did, however, expect this to be more hydrating than it is. It is a decent cream but not excellent.<br /><br />The current price of $15.00 comes to a reasonably priced $3.75 per tube.",83,211
3.0,1620424267961,Nice set of 7 iridescent scrunchies; material can be slippery on hair,"There are six blush-colored scrunchies and one white scrunchie. The material is a bit slick so there is a chance these will slip out of the hair. I have medium length hair in the back and they did slip out easily if I pulled on them. I do feel these are elegant and super attractive. If the bride and bridesmaids all have long hair, then these are a good option. I have no idea what these will be priced at but anything more than $10.50 (which would be 1.50 each) is too much.",83,220
3.0,1619563023776,Beautifully engraved comb; tines are a bit thick making this a bit difficult to comb with,"This comb is just beautiful and the quality is exceptional. It is also hefty. As a statement piece it gets 5 stars. However, I find it difficult to comb through my hair using this. I have short-to-medium-length fine curly hair and the tines are so thick on this, that it makes it difficult to pull the comb through my hair. If I had an easier time of it, this would have gotten 5 stars.<br /><br />The current price of $6.98 is reasonable for this.",83,222
4.0,1618184630323,Beautiful shower cap that fits perfectly on my head but bow doesn’t look good on me,"I love this shower cap. It is very attractive and the black and white colors just pop. I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and take a size small in a cap. This fits me perfectly and there is a little more room for more hair if I had it. This is comfortable and does keep my hair dry in the shower. Unfortunately, I hate the way the bow looks on me.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 is on the high side of competitively priced.",83,223
5.0,1617844602299,"Gorgeous, soft quality headbands that feel great on– LOVE THEM",There are two quality headbands in this set. The headbands are SUPER SOFT that I just want to feel them all day. They look great on and I love the design.<br /><br />I have short to medium-length fine curly hair and these work for me and are even better for someone with long hair. I actually put them over my ears so that they stay put. I have to do that with every headband I use.<br /><br />The current price of $3.99 is a reasonable $2 per band.,83,224
5.0,1617487527934,Large oval brush that is good for apply blush; comes w/a cinch pouch,"This is a large oval brush that comes with a cinch pouch. The handle has a good grip due to the silicone ""sleeve."" <br /><br />The bristles are soft and feel great against my face. Initially, there were just a few bristles that fell out but that seems to have stabilized. I use brushes like these to apply blush. The brush head is quite large and usable only for larger jobs.<br /><br />The current price of $4.99 is excellent for this in my opinion and one of the reasons I rated this 5 stars instead of 4 stars.",83,225
5.0,1617407475594,Excellent make-up brushes; beveled handles provide a good grip,"There are 10 brushes in total and a carry pouch. I really love these brushes. The geometric shape of the handles provide a good surface area for gripping each brush during application. The bristles are soft and they do not fall out of the brush. They feel great against my skin.<br /><br />Based on the Amazon site, these are the brushes in the set. Note that I cropped a photo of the brushes from the site and attached it to my review, so that one can see each brush's use.<br /><br />- powder brush<br />- blush brush<br />- angled contour brush<br />- foundation brush<br />- nasal shadow brush<br />- big eyeshadow brush<br />- small eyeshadow brush<br />- blending brush<br />- eyebrow brush<br />- lip brush<br /><br />In summary, I love that it has more smaller brushes than larger one because they are better for detail/precision applications. The current price of $15.19 ($18.99 minus 20%) comes to $1.27 per brush which I consider reasonable. I also love the color of these brushes as they match my pink bathroom.",83,226
3.0,1614796759758,Only the lavender is pleasing to my senses; second candle is headache producing,"I got the lavender and balsam fir set of soy candles. Each one comes in an 8 ounce tin. The balsam fir is headache producing to me and I hate it. However, the lavender is very nice and a faint lavender scent dissipates throughout my small kitchen when I am burning the candle.<br /><br />Each candle is $20 each at the current price of $39.99. Although they are made with essential oils, I still think that is too much for the set. Unfortunately, only one candle is agreeable to me.",83,229
4.0,1614292707452,Simple headbands that loosely grip my head;wish there were more color variety,"There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink, purple, and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red, black, and brown in this set. However, this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.<br /><br />I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.<br /><br />The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.",83,230
5.0,1614036953464,Exceptionally well-made and beautiful pocket sized brush,"This is an exceptionally well-made and beautiful brush in a travel size. The brush and handle are small, so this brush is not as easy to grasp as one that is full sized. However, It detangles and brushes through my curls with ease. I also did not experience the typical loss of bristles I usually do with a boar bristle brush. Most animal hair brushes seem to shed for a while and then stop shedding. So far I have not had that problem.<br /><br />I actually cannot believe this is priced at $7.29 because most boar bristles brushes of this size are in the $28 to $30 range. The price, coupled with the style, finish, and functionality of this hairbrush is outstanding in my opinion.",83,13
3.0,1611965730476,I love this iron but it does not come with gloves as specified,"This flat iron comes with two strange looking hair clips and a carry pouch. However, gloves were not included in the package as I had expected. It is for this reason I lowered my rating. It is deceiving to the customer to purchase an item thinking it comes with gloves when it does not.<br /><br />The controls are in the center of the iron, so I had to be careful not to burn my fingers. To turn the unit on or off, I just held down the power button for three seconds. To go to the next temperature, I just pressed the on/off button quickly. This flat iron heats rapidly. The temperature selections available go from 300 to 450. I used it at 350 degrees to straighten my hair and I was able to do this relatively quickly as I have short curly hair. Also, there was no frizz after I was done. <br /><br />The clips provided are strange looking as can be seen from the photo. They work good enough to hold some of my hair but I particularly do not care for the design.<br /><br />The soft sided cinch pouch is nice and holds both the iron and the clips.<br /><br />In summary, this is a gorgeous iron. I love how the ""blades"" come together and there is no space in-between like some other irons I tried. Also, the current price of $25.91 ($32.39 minus 20%) is very reasonable for this. The Amazon site says ""DUAL VOLTAGE AND COMPLETE ACCESSORIES ..... Equipped with 1x storage bag, 2x hair clips, and 1x Gloves."" Well it was missing the last item. Had it come with the gloves, I would have rated this 4 stars.",83,233
5.0,1611360452090,"Excellent empty glass bottle set perfect for hair coloring, essential oil sprays, etc.","There are two amber glass spray bottles in this set. In addition, four black labels, one stainless steel funnel, one glass eye dropper, one white marker, and two standard black caps are included. It is important to go through all the packaging in order to find these items as I almost missed a few. Note that these are packaged exceptionally well in double bubble wrap sleeves for each bottle.<br /><br />These are perfect for hair solutions, water, window cleaner, vinegar, etc., etc., etc. The spray nozzles, with a turn of the front dial, dispense a wonderful mist spray or a fine stream just like many store bought spray products. Each bottle holds 16 ounces of liquid. The amber color of the glass helps protect light sensitive products. <br /><br />The current price of $18.98 is competitive but somewhat pricey for this set as it comes to $9.50 per bottle not counting the added incidentals.  Their [[ASIN:B08HGZXLP6 four-pack of bottles]] is about $1 cheaper per bottle.",83,234
4.0,1611183336145,Super soft back brush that lathers reasonably well & cleans well but is not exfoliating,"I have tried many different back brushes including this really good [[ASIN:B08HR2GBHC Kozis brush]] and the buff puff type that lather copiously. However, this one's bristles differ substantially. They are very fine and as soft as a cat's fur.  The soap lathers reasonably well on the bristles and the brush feels great against my skin. It is solidly built. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the title says this is exfoliating and I do not consider that an attribute of this brush. The bristles are too soft to exfoliate. However, it cleans well and feels great to use. I consider it 5 stars for that purpose.  The current price of $16.99 is on the pricey side but I have no similar brush of this bristle style to compare it to. It is certainly not competitively priced with other back brushes which are about $7 cheaper.",83,235

2.0,1610417575774,Narrow headbands that are not sturdy enough to keep the masks tight to the face,"There are six (6) velvet headbands with buttons in this set. Each headband is narrow at only 8-3/4"" wide and certainly not as wide as pictured on the Amazon site. Also, there are buttons on each side of the ear area. When I attach my mask to these buttons, my face mask is no longer tight to my face because the slinky velvet material moves and does not stay in place.<br /><br />Overall, I do not like these at all. They will suffice as headbands only and not for mask attachment. The current price of $11.99 comes to $2 per band but I do not feel they are worth that price at all.",83,237
4.0,1610322554727,Creamy texture; nice fragrance; takes a while to absorb but is hydrating – 3.5 stars,"I am not sure what a balancing cream is supposed to be. Nevertheless, I applied this to my face and neck (avoiding the eye area). I like the creamy texture and the fragrance is decent. The aroma reminds me a little bit of St. Joseph's aspirin. It did take about ten minutes to absorb fully, but once it did my face and neck felt incredibly hydrated.<br /><br />Note that there are no English instructions on the jar or the box except for the words ""balancing cream."" This is made in Korea and it is written in Korean. If it were not for the Amazon label, no one would know that this is a hydrating face and neck cream. Also, there is no mention of how many ounces this is but I suspect it is about 4 ounces based on the price per ounce listed on Amazon.  The current price of $22.65 is pricey but competitive for this cream. I like it but not enough to order it again.",83,238
4.0,1610062915805,Surprisingly this works well to remove my cream eye make-up,"I tried many different make-up remover products and have always been disappointed because they never remove what they say it will remove and I have to use a ton of solution or wipes. However, these surprisingly work. I used this to remove cream eyeshadow and it did a wonderful job. In addition, my lids felt moisturized. Note each cloth is infused with Vitamin E and Aloe.<br /><br />There are 10 (I received 11) individually wrapped disposable cloths in each package. They come loosely packaged in an envelope, so I have to put them in a zip lock bag to store.<br /><br />At the current price of 9.50 ($10 minus 5%), it comes to $.95 cents per remover cloth. I certainly would not make a steady diet of these since they are expensive, but they are perfect for that once-in-awhile situation where one needs to remove their make-up without soap and water. ",83,239
4.0,1609849628351,Nice body brushes with interesting design,"There are two body brushes in this package (pastel blue and quartz pink). Each one has a silicone sleeve into which a soft sponge has been inserted. The sleeve has a loop for hanging, nubbs on one side for scrubbing, and various small ridges on the other side for light scrubbing.<br /><br />I used the pink one in my pink bathroom; it matches perfectly. I showered with it and it holds the suds well. I personally like the nubbed side because it is like getting a massage while washing. My favorite bath ""sponge"" is actually a body puff (those with the netting material) because they lather up well. This ""brush"" is now my second favorite. If the suds were prolific with this ""brush"" like the body puffs produce, I would have loved this more than my puffs.<br /><br />The current price of $12.59 ($13.99 minus 10%) is on the pricey side of competitive for this as it comes to $6.30 per body brush.",83,240
2.0,1609804845102,"Vegetal, messy flower balls; not sure why anyone would use this for anything but tea","I thought these were bath bombs when I ordered them. However, that is not what this is at all. There are 10 tiny balls of compressed flowers wrapped in various colored foils. They can be used as a tea, which is what I use them for, or they can be put in a bath. I have no idea how anyone would use this for baking as per the Amazon title.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all but the purple and red balls have a purely vegetal scent. The purple and red smell flowery. I have used tea balls before and never cared for them but did like how most stayed together. However, these balls expand into many little flower particles that float in the water. If one were to put this in a bath, it would clog the drain unless the flower debris was scooped out with a skimmer.  I used the blue ball to brew into a tea and it was tasteless. I also had to use a strainer and remove the lid on my pot to keep the spout from clogging.<br /><br />Besides the mess and lackluster flavor, there are absolutely no brewing instructions, no information on what tea ball is what flower.  The Amazon site has a list of the flower and the balls but does not show the foil color. It is almost impossible to reconcile that list with what is in front of me.<br /><br />Shame on the vendor for not creating an insert or package label that says what is inside and which tea ball is what flower. I personally do not care for this at all and will probably throw this in the garbage.<br /><br />This is not worth it to me at any price. It is certainly not a bath bomb, I can't see how it can be used for baking, and as a tea it is tasteless and messy. There is no fragrance, so its use as a bath bomb would be for romantic or ambiance purposes only.<br /><br />At the current price of $9.88 for 10 balls it comes to almost $1 per tea ball.",83,241
3.0,1608329596770,Very nice clip & hair tie set but clipswill break easily,"This is a very nice set of 6 clips, 10 hair ties, and a case. The clips are strong and do hold a generous amount of hair. I like the non-slippery feeling of the clip itself. The ties are ordinary but still functional. The reason I rated this 3 stars is because I also ordered this same set with the blue clips and tan ties. One of the clips in that order broke immediately which tells me these won't last.<br /><br />The current price of $7.19 is reasonable for this set but just be aware that the clips will break easily because the plastic is not that strong. ",83,242
3.0,1608329372192,Very nice clip & hair tie set but clips will break easily; one broke immediately out of the package,"This is a very nice set of 6 clips, 10 hair ties, and a case. I particularly love the blue clips. Unfortunately, the first blue one I tried broke immediately as can be seen in the photo. At least I have one blue left. The clips are strong and do  hold a generous amount of hair. I like the non-slippery feeling of the clip itself. The ties are ordinary but still functional.<br /><br />The current price of $7.99 is reasonable for this set but just be aware that the clips will break easily because the plastic is not that strong.

3.0,1606592309440,"Tiny keychain bottles good for hand lotion, sunscreen, hand sanitizer, etc.; too $$$","There are four tiny colorful squeeze bottles in this package that are easy to fill and easy to dispense. I like that they are portable and can hang on a keychain. These can be used for hand lotion, sunscreen, hand sanitizer, etc. However, the caps do open easily so it is possible the contents will be squeezed out inside a purse if there is a lot of movement. Secondly, the current price of $12.99 is way too expensive for what this is. I would not expect this to be priced at more than $6.",83,245

One has a flat side for a smoother application. The pointed ends are good for more precision. They feel good in the hands and blend well and also wash well with soap. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges.,83,249
2.0,1599882609367,Has a spicy aroma; leaves my hair nourished and enhanced my curls (see update),"This shampoo and conditioner travel-size duo (2 ounces each bottle) has a spicy aroma that is neither pleasant nor offensive but not my favorite smell.  The shampoo produces a medium lather and cleans well. The conditioner is creamy and conditions well. When my hair dried, it had a sheen to it and was well nourished and my curls were enhanced.<br /><br />The current price of $14 for this set is expensive. If this had an intoxicating fragrance I liked and was more reasonably priced, I would have loved it. However, this is not a set I would buy at this price.<br /><br />Note that I get about four uses to this set for my short to medium hair.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/22/20 - This only lasted me three uses. However, I had such trouble getting both the remaining shampoo and conditioner (particularly the conditioner) out of the bottle. They need to change this to a squeeze tube. I actually had to fill the bottle with water several times to dislodge the remaining ingredients. Also, the conditioner makes the floor of the shower or tub very slippery (almost as if I put Pledge on a floor).  Based on this, I lowered my ranking from 4 to 2 stars.",83,250

However, the gritty surface on mine started to wear off after a few swipes of my nails over the board. Emery boards in general do not last long; however, the size and thickness coupled with the limited longevity makes me not like these. They do file the nails but they do not last.",83,252
4.0,1584497096251,Lightly moisturizing; has a wonderful rose fragrance; left my face silky,"Surprisingly, I really like this mask. I already tried their [[ASIN:B07VQY9ZP2 WeeklyPoint Cosmetic Saffron mask sheet]] and found it to be very messy and just okay. This one is less messy.<br /><br />There are ten individually wrapped masks in this package. The instructions are in broken English but still easy to understand. I applied this mask to my clean face -- there are holes for eyes, nose, and mouth. It was somewhat wet but not dripping wet as their other mask. I prefer less solution, so this was perfect. I let it stay on for exactly 20 minutes and then removed the mask and wiped off the excess. My face felt moisturized and silky. I reveled in the soft rose fragrance the entire time.  However, the claims that it brightens the skin and protects them from wrinkles is unfounded in my opinion. On the other hand, the rose fragrance is calming and wonderful and the moisturizing effect is silky and these are my two favorite traits of this moisturizing sheet.<br /><br /> ",83,253
1.0,1582858335913,Flexible plastic garbage with pick ends like scaled down hammer claws,"This pick is absolutely terrible.

1.0,1581997877865,I'm FURIOUS - shampoo bottle DOES NOT OPEN; conditioner is nice,"This comes as a set and no matter what I do, the shampoo bottle will not open. This absolutely infuriates me. I was able to open the conditioner.  I removed plastic seal on the top of both bottles and turned as specified on the bottle. I spent 10 minutes trying to open the shampoo. Unless I take a hammer and chisel to it or an exacto knife, I can't use the shampoo.<br /><br />The conditioner is nice and has a subtle fresh aroma but without the pair, this is zero stars to me when I cannot get to the product.",83,255
4.0,1581257263753,Versatile set of four combs that look and feel like plastic,"This is a nice set of combs--one wide-tooth and one sort of fine-tooth with two regularly-spaced ones. I know others mentioned that they found the combs to be sharp on the edges when combing. The one wide-tooth comb has blunted tines but the other three have pointed tines. However, those pointed tine ones were not sharp on my scalp. I have short to medium fine curly hair and these passed through my hair easily (wet or dry) and I did not feel scratched. I actually like the points massaging my scalp because on the combs I received, they were not super sharp.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot tell if this set is wooden as it claims. It is possible they are wooden but because they are highly polished, they feel and look like plastic. I attend craft shows and it is possible to get a plastic feel and look to wood, so unless I broke one of the combs in half (which I am unwilling to do), I cannot tell. I still think the current price of $9.99 is reasonable even they are plastic.",83,256
4.0,1580949934338,Nine cloth-covered headbands in muted 60’s type colors/styles,"These headbands remind of Woodstock and the 60's. They are headbands the flower children would wear. The colors are muted but are perfect for casual wear. The black bands (one beaded and one not) are suitable for both business and casual attire.<br /><br />These are about two inches wide and do feel relatively comfortable on. Note that the beaded bands are a bit bouffanty due to the thickness of the cloth with the extra height of the beads. Unfortunately, these are not my style. If one is in the market for this type of accessory, they are fully functional with a little bit of statement. The cloth is wrapped securely around the outer edge of the band and appears they will last a while. The current price of $16.99 is reasonable for this set.",83,257
4.0,1556243557316,Relatively strong water flosser but reservoir is attached which makes drying it nearly impossible,"I have used various countertop water flossers in the past such as the countertop WaterPik and the [[ASIN:B07HRNGS3Q Truwell Handheld Water Flosser]].  I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br /><br />I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br /><br />The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br /><br />In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.",83,146
5.0,1548208863985,"These sponges are great for blending & highlighting, particularly with creams","I purchased these type sponges before and I find them great to work with. I like to use the flat end to blend and the pointed end to highlight around the eyes or cheeks. I do find liquid foundation sink in a bit so I use these mostly with creams and some powders. Overall, these are just as good as the sponges from several other vendors I have tried in the past and these are competitively priced at the current price of $10.99 for four. I also love the four color variety.",83,258
4.0,1545955740686,Vibrant mostly shimmery colors more for women with a darker complexion,"I wish I could wear these colors but most of them are too deeply hued for my fair complexion. I tried several of the colors and many make my eyes look swollen and puffy as if I had an eye infection. If I had olive or brown skin, I think these colors would look awesome. The only colors I was able to wear in this pallet are the pearl, volcano, bronze, sunset, 24k, and ash. I absolutely love the shimmer on many of these. I like that the ""compact pallet holder"" has a magnetic closure. Eye applicators have to be purchased separately.  Despite this, I think $7.88 is a great price for this selection. The colors that I did apply stayed put all day.<br /><br />The 15 colors starting from top row left to right and working down are:<br />- copper<br />- cinnamond<br />- pearl<br />- golden<br />- bronze<br />- volcano<br />- sunset<br />- pumpkin<br />- 24k<br />- moch<br />- fleshy<br />- mermaid<br />- rose<br />- ash<br />- ginger",83,259
3.0,1545265199508,This flat iron gave me mild straightening results; plates have too much space between them,"[[VIDEOID:e487d57bdd82c5405085efb372c8fecd]]<br />This straightener is a nice metallic black and comes with a thin storage sleeve. There is a tiny instruction pamphlet included.<br /><br />The flat iron feels good in my hands. I like that the cord swivels at the base so that it does not tangle.<br /><br />This did an okay job on my hair. I have fine medium length hair and this mostly relaxed my curls so that my hair was more wavy that fully flat. I set the temperature to 300 for fine hair. I also tried 350.<br /><br />There are several things that make this iron just okay for me. First, it is weird to have the temperature controls between the flat iron blades. There is a constant temperature key and also temperature plus and minus keys, in case the constant temperature key is not set.<br /><br />The power button should be pressed to start setting the temperature and then when the LCD stops flashing, it has reached that temperature. Then the power button has to be pressed again so that the light in the middle of the plate lights up.<br /><br />The plates have some space between them and they are offset a bit from each other which is the biggest annoyance to me. I guess this is why it straightened my hair only so much. This is not a bad flat iron but it is not perfect either.",83,260
1.0,1533246198393,"Cheap, flimsy, cosmetic bag that has limited hanging options and is not worth consideration in my opinion","I am sorry I ordered this bag and am very disappointed. It's cheap, flimsy, and holds light items. Items have a tendency of tilting outward in the pockets depending on the size of the item and are at risk of falling out. The detachable clear plastic tote at the bottom is a nice touch, but that is about it. The zippers are sticky.<br /><br />In my opinion this cosmetic / travel organizer will not last at all. My biggest complaint is the hook for hanging. It is not a full-size hanger hook so there are a limited number of places to hang this. It can be hung on a wire shelf with holes (like a shower caddy or closet with wire inserts) but it does not hang on a shower rod or on a closet rod or any rod much thicker than a finger.<br /><br />This cosmetic bag is not even worth consideration in my opinion.",83,261
4.0,1457053429000,LumaRx facial cleaning brush is like a Sonicare ElectricToothbrush for the face,"After moistening my face and the brush heads with water, I tested the sensitive and normal heads with both soap and [[ASIN:B01648QDS4 L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Facial Cream Cleanser, 5 Fluid Ounce]] and the massaging head with water alone. After a one-minute &#34;application&#34; with any one of the brushes, I love how smooth and clean this makes my face feel.<br /><br />The packages includes:<br /><br />- three brush heads (sensitive, normal, and massage) and their covers which have air vents to hasten drying<br />- one charging base with power cord<br />- one brush wand that operates at 3 speed levels<br />- one white plastic zippered travel case<br />- one instruction pamphlet<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The wand contains a rechargeable battery that last for 30 uses. The first charge takes up to six hours.  It also has a 30 minute fast-charge feature that will provide 4-5 uses. By the way, I love the charging light on the base; it has a &#34;cool&#34; factor to it.<br /><br />- There's a one minute timer that has what I call a &#34;tripacer&#34; (like Sonicare's quadpacer) timer built in for each of the three zones of the face. These zones are the T zone, left side, and right side. What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.<br /><br />- None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive. The rotating and vibrating brush heads were as gentle as could be and I have sensitive skin.<br /><br />- The wand with brush can be used in the shower as long as it's not fully submerged in water.<br /><br />- This can be used to remove cosmetics.<br /><br />- The unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Although these brushes remove make-up effectively, I personally only like to use this on the days I do not wear makeup. The reason is that the eye area has to be avoided. I use eye makeup so I wind up washing my entire face with my hands instead as it does not make sense to me to use a brush on only part of my face.<br /><br />- There are a lot of don'ts in the manual like don't submerge in water, don't use around the eyes, don't use if you are taking steroid-based medication, don't operate outdoors or where there are aerosol products or oxygen being administered, etc.<br /><br />- If used daily at no more than the maximum two times per day, the brush heads need to be replaced  every three months. The Massaging head (since it doesn't not have bristles) can be replaced every six months. This can get expensive. I contacted the company for the replacement price and they said they would let me know when it's orderable on Amazon. I will update the comments section of this review with that information when I receive it.<br /><br />- The battery on this unit is NOT replaceable as per the email from them which I posted in the comments section of this review.<br /><br />At first I questioned why would I need such a facial cleansing tool. After using this, however, I realized that I love how it makes my face feel so clean and smooth. This is not a tool I would use more than twice per week since I really hate using this to remove makeup, however, it's so gentle on my skin that I look forward to the cleansing action, mildly exfoliating properties, and the light massage it provides me all without the use of a chemical masque.",83,263

Some are slightly unexpected in a skincare product. The texture is lightweight and easily absorbed. It doesn't just sit on top of the skin. Your skin will feel softer immediately and you'll see more improvements over time. Dr. Denese is a trusted brand when it comes to care for aging skin. Whether you're trying to slow the clock or reverse it a little, this serum should be part of your daily skincare routine. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",111,317
5.0,1596927321037,Very Useful,I like to keep extra spray bottles on hand. They're useful for so many purposes. I like to put all of my liquid hair products in them because it's much easier to use a trigger sprayer than a pump when your hands are wet. You can also use them for cleaning products or fabric sprays. This set is a good buy.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

5.0,1595783032290,Doesn't Leave Skin Sticky,I use lots of sheet masks. Most leave your skin a little sticky when the serum dries. This mask works differently. The sheet locks the moisture in and doesn't leave a sticky residue. It's a great hydration and brightening mask. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,111,319
5.0,1595609922802,Special Care Mask,"I really like that this mask includes special patches for the eyes and smile lines. If you're over 30, you'll appreciate the extra help. You apply the patches first, the the sheet mask. I keep all of my sheet masks in the refrigerator. You'll appreciate the cooling and anti-inflammatory effect if you do so with this mask.

5.0,1593625097634,Lightweight and Creamy,"I really like this moisturizer. It's lightweight and creamy. It has a light cucumber scent that I find refreshing. It's a powerhouse at deeply hydrating parched skin. It also locks in moisture to keep skin looking fresh. It contains botanicals that soothe irritated or inflamed skin. It's ideal for those with acne, rosacea or eczema. You can use it as both a day and night cream. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",111,323
5.0,1593187544786,Two Powerful Ingredients,"If you're over 35, this serum is a must. It contains two powerful skin-saving ingredients. Vitamin C keeps skin bright and radiant. It protects skin from UV damage. It boosts collagen production and helps fade dark spots quickly. Hyaluronic acid helps your skin draw moisture from the environment. It reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It's hard to find a high quality organic serum like this. I highly recommend this serum and the brand.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",111,324
5.0,1583172004166,New Favorite!!,"Every mascara claims to be new and different. This one actually lives up to the hype. The fibers have a novel shape that really makes your lashes POP. If you're not a fan of falsies, this is a great alternative. The formula isn't waterproof, so keep that in mind. I HIGHLY recommend this product.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",111,329
5.0,1582569041506,Top Notch,Native makes some of the best natural deodorants on the market. They're just as effective as the drugstore brands. I like this set because you get three different scents. My favorite is the peony. The scents are all fresh and light. They won't clash with other fragrances you wear. This set is perfect for gifting. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,111,330
5.0,1581974143974,Good Hydration,"This moisturizer is ideal for most skin types. It is fairly lightweight and provides deep hydration. It's especially good for sensitive or reactive skin.

I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",111,332
5.0,1580765754206,Very Hydrating,Hyaluronic acid is really one of the best skincare ingredients to use for hydrated skin. It keeps skin looking dewy and plump.

5.0,1578165361970,Smells Fantastic!!,"Sweet orange is one of my favorite essential oils. It immediately makes me feel energized and refreshed. This body wash is the perfect way to start your day. The scent will perk you up and get you moving. The formula is very moisturizing and won't strip your skin. The fragrance is unisex, so it would make a good gift for women and men.

5.0,1577225566969,Effective Mask,"If you're reading this review, you probably already know the anti-aging benefits of collagen. This mask has a high-potency form of collagen along with a special delivery system to help firm your skin. The mask is in two parts, so you can get a better fit than a regular sheet mask. I can't say it performs miracles, but it's definitely worth a try.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",111,337
5.0,1577144708939,Gentle & Natural,I'm trying to do a better job with paying as much attention to the ingredients in my skincare as those in my food. This is a great natural cleanser. It's very gentle and is good for sensitive skin. The lactic acid hydrates and gently exfoliates over time. You won't need a science degree to understand the majority of the ingredients. This is a great clean beauty cleanser that I highly recommend.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,111,94
5.0,1576781162840,Thick & Creamy,A good hand cream is essential. This one is excellent. It is thick and creamy. It's very moisturizing and is packed with skin-loving botanicals.

I especially love using it after I’ve cleansed my skin and applied moisturizer, right before I start putting on my makeup. It instantly helps depuff my skin, and it seems to enhance the smooth coverage of every cream and foundation I use immediately afterwards. It has definitely become part of my daily skincare routine, and the aluminum alloy rollers are super smooth and manage to apply the perfect amount of weighted pressure!",137,373

This boxed set is ready for gifting and even comes with a blank card that can be easily personalized to some lucky recipient. I think this grouped assortment offers a nice variety of different and relaxing products that most customers would enjoy!",137,374
5.0,1634788179197,These Masks Leave My Hair So Smooth and Shiny! 👩🏼,"I’ve used many Korean face masks before but never a hair mask specifically! I love that the treatments come packaged in individual pouches (which makes them perfect for travel), and I like that they come as a boxed set. After shampooing my hair and brushing it straight, it tucks easily into one of these pre-filled bags, and it’s simple enough to squish and massage the conditioning product around. I usually keep one on for a couple of hours, and it seems like the body heat associated with activity and movement helps the essence really penetrate every strand.<br /><br />The attached straps are easy to affix and release, and the product washes out smoothly enough and manages to leave my hair super shiny too! I love that this formula contains a blend of kernel oil, fermented yeast extract, and soybean seeds because they mix nicely with all of the floral notes and botanical aromas! These deep-conditioning treatments seem to work wonders for my color-treated and often heat-styled hair!",137,375

Each one is easy enough to wash, and they come in a wide range of attractive colors, so I usually leave a couple in my car for unexpected hikes and impromptu workout sessions. They’re also great for holding my hair back during morning and evening skincare sessions, so I’d gladly recommend this multicolored variety pack to others!",137,376
5.0,1632284565449,Such a Brightly Patterned Variety! 🌾🌻,"This multicolored variety pack of headbands is so eye-catching, and the entire set has been quite affordably priced! Each headband is lightweight, adorably designed, and universally sized, and the elastic portions along the back feel reliable and secure. The decorative plastic buttons on each side can sustain some pull, so I believe that they’re there to optionally provide a resting place for the ear loops of face masks. Regardless, I think all of the patterns are vivid and cute, so I’d gladly recommend these boho hair accessories to others!",137,381
5.0,1630730370399,Tea Tree Cleanliness That’s Perfectly Sized! 🌳,"This hand soap provides an effective and hygienic sense of all-natural clean! While I don’t readily detect a heady scent of lavender oil, I will say that an earthy tea tree scent is freshly omnipresent. I love that this is a vegan, cruelty-free product that’s been consciously sourced, packaged, and produced, and the included pump dispenser seems to be quite sturdy and reliable. I appreciate that the bottle arrived with a secure safety seal in place, and I definitely didn’t have any product leak out during shipment. There’s also an expiration date handily provided on the bottle’s base.<br /><br />This slippery, soapy gel solution creates a visible sudsing effect, and it feels quite hydrating overall! It rinses away cleanly and leaves my family’s hands feeling nice and soft every time. I love using essential oils to help provide a renewed sense of revitalization and freshness around my home, so I’m gladly adding this Canadian hand wash to my daily cleansing arsenal.",137,384
5.0,1629054964948,"Soft, Lightweight, Nice to Have on Hand! 🛁","This ivory-colored bath mitt comes packaged in a resealable pink pouch, and it’s super lightweight! The packaging says it is 100% natural silk, but it does look and feel more like a linen/cotton fabric. Regardless, it’s soft enough to be gentle, but just textured enough to provide some noticeable friction for exfoliation! It fits comfortably over my hand, and it’s simple enough to grip and hold and air dry after each use. It can be used alone with warm water, but I’ve used it in combination with several body scrubs and it further works to enhance the gritty benefits of all of my exfoliating sugar and salt concoctions. I’d recommend this natural glove for all skin types, and it can be used in conjunction with bath OR shower time. I’d realistically pay $12-$15 for it, but I’m pleased with its overall performance!",137,387
5.0,1626758945482,Pale Pink Perfection! 🌸,"I love this skincare set! The pale pink rose quartz hue is such a pretty shade, and the paired duo arrives safely nestled within a cushioned pillow of foam cutouts. The dual-ended roller exhibits smooth and silent movement, and the gua sha stone is perfectly sized and comfortable to hold!

5.0,1623105219553,Hydrating and Delightfully Scented Bits of Eye Gold! 🤩,"This boxed set of smooth, golden eye mask pairs is totally fabulous! Each pair comes individually packaged, making this collected group of beauty accessories excellent swag-bag additions or party favor gifts! The included serum feels incredibly hydrating and smells absolutely divine. I’ve used several different brands of similar eye masks, and these are noticeably thicker and more substantial than every other pair I’ve tried! Even at room temperature, they instantly provide a cooling sensation when applied to the face. They adhere well to skin, but due to their weight and size, they do have a slight tendency to slip downward with gravity. For that reason, I suggest lying flat or reclining while wearing them, so that they stay as close to the lower lash line as possible. Each package still contains some extra serum after the eye masks are removed, so I massage that residual liquid onto my neck for added moisture potential. The combination of hyaluronic acid, collagen, and 24k nanogold particles leaves my under eye area feeling incredibly hydrated and refreshed. Consistent use of this product helps combat fine lines, puffiness, and dark circles over time, so I’m thrilled the whole set is so affordable! I couldn’t be more pleased with this product.",137,392

4.0,1678571121367,Good...But Not My Favorite,"Despite having a thick-ish, creamy consistency, the conditioner not only dispenses without issue, its also easy to work into/rinse from hair. Does a nice job of protecting color while detangling and softening. However, I don't really notice any added shine or volume.<br /><br /> I'm beyond thrilled to say it has the unique Moroccanoil product scent that not only smells lovely but actually lasts for a decent amount of time; a rarity with my hair!<br /><br />I love Moroccanoil products and while I do like this, its not my favorite in the line.  I have no plans to purchase this in the future, I'll stick with their hydrating conditioner.<br /><br />Overall score is 3.5 stars",154,425

I can't say that I experienced a change in my aging skin but I also haven't been using it very long. There is a nice scent that is pretty much gone once the product has been rinsed off.<br /><br />I  have dry, sensitive skin and have no issues using this.",154,426

The price is on the high side but worth it.",154,69

Easy to apply-a little goes a long way. Absorption is fast and does not leave a greasy/stick feel behind.  Instantly hydrates and soothes the red patches of inflammation that plagues my skin.<br /><br />The cream itself if a light blue-ish/grey-ish color but don't worry, it doesn't discolor skin. There is a  bit of a scent that I find to be medicinal though it fades quickly.<br /><br />I do not know if it occurred during shipping (the product shifted) or if its normal but my jar seemed to be missing some cream (see photo).

I've not found many products that are able to do this to my skin but XXI does!<br /><br />I have dry , sensitive skin and have no issues with this cream<br /><br />XXI works. It works VERY well and some results like soft, smooth skin occur immediately after use.  Results are long lasting.  XXI recommends using this in the morning and at night. I use it once a day in the morning.  A very small amount is sufficient to cover my face.  Because it works so well and delivers great results and only a small amount is needed per use, I do believe the price is reasonable. However, if you find this isn't right for you, XXI offers a 30 day satisfaction guarantee. I absolutely recommend XXI Bio-Pure lotion.",154,171

Better than an electric razor"".<br /><br />That's the first thing my husband had to say after he tested SUPRENT's  Matrix Cutter Head travel kit razor for the first time.  And what a kit this is. A razor handle, 2-blade refills (each with the first of its kind 6 ultra-thin blades total!), a dock to hold the razor and a bottle of shaving foam are included.<br /><br />The handle is sleek and heavy but easy and comfortable to hold.  The head doesn't pivot  but it doesn't need to thanks to the 38.5 degree shaving angle. It glides perfectly along the jaw line and chin areas without missing a spot.<br /><br />The base is heavy-ish and holds the razor well. Doesn't tip or wobble.<br /><br />He's not a fan of the shaving foam. Says he must 'really rub it in' in order for it to foam.  He used it once and switched back to his regular brand.<br /><br />Suprent has really come out with an awesome razor kit. The presentation is gorgeous and the product works exceptionally well.

4.0,1630284777853,Deeply and Gently Cleans Pores,"I love how easily and quickly  Tinazana's Pineapple Deep Cleanser becomes a creamy lather that feels really nice on my face.  A very small amount of the cleanser does a great job of deeply cleaning pores and removing dead skin cells. My face feels fresh and clean after cleansing. But it does dry out my skin a bit.  Because I follow up using toner and moisturizer, this isn't a huge deal for me and doesn't prevent me from continuing to use Tinazana cleanser.  There is a light, faint, fresh scent that I enjoy. Surprisingly, it doesn't smell like pineapple to me.  It also doesn't last; when I rinse the cleanser off, I can no longer detect the scent at all.<br /><br />Due to skin sensitivity issues, I sometimes have issues with citrus based products. I know pineapple technically isn't a citrus fruit but I was a bit concerned it might be too harsh on my skin. Its not. No burning or itching at all.<br /><br />I like this cleanser a lot. Does a great job, even with drying my skin a bit.  The price is reasonable. This is a cleanser I will continue to use and I recommend it.<br /><br />My overall rating is 4.5 stars.",154,428

Since it was very warm outside the day I ordered and with summer rapidly approaching, I chose Cucumber + Aloe.<br /><br />Perfect choice!<br /><br />This is a 2 pack of 24.5oz Hask Cucumber + Aloe Body wash. The scent is delicious- light , crisp and not at all overwhelming. The bottle's pump dispenses easily as well as a  good amount of body wash. It lathers quickly and does a great job of cleansing skin.  I also use it while shaving my legs and it works well.  When I step out of the bathtub my skin feels wonderful and I feel nice and relaxed.

If you've never experienced a boar bristle brush, I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. You can't be the price and the results will be worth it!

With regards to masks, I've tried some that have worked well, some that caused my skin to burn and some that caused my already dry skin to become even drier.  It makes me SO happy to report that I do not experience any negative issues with HUXLEY Secret of the Sahara Clay mask.  I would have been crushed if I had experienced a negative reaction because this really is one heck of a clay mask!<br /><br />Huxley is a nice, gentle mask. But don't let that fool you, it may be gentle but it does a heck of an exceptional job!  It applies nice and easy.  I let it sit on my skin for 10 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water, right before its nearly dry.  It exfoliates well leaving my skin soft, smooth , a bit brighter and healthy. Dead skin cells are washed away.  My skin literally feels GOOD after using Huxley.  This mask does have a light scent but it doesn't last long. It is recommended Huxley be used 1-3 times a week. I use it twice a week though I could probably get away with using it only a week because the results Huxley delivers are long lasting.<br /><br />I'm so relieved I will be able to continue to use this mask on my skin. Silly as it may sound  I kind of feel like I'm pampering myself when I use it-it makes my skin feel that GOOD!

I love the consistency of this cream. Its a nice, light gel.  It doesn't take much cream at all to cover my face. It applies/spreads so easily on skin.  The first time I used it, I was concerned that it was going to be sticky.  Fortunately, that's not the case.  It absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft and smooth immediately.  I can not only see it but I can feel how it hydrates my skin as well. My skin is normally extremely sensitive and very dry.  The hydration really makes my skin feel great.  I apply the cream at night before bed and enjoy the results in the morning when I awaken.  Lavender is one of my favorite scents.  But I just do not care much for the scent of this cream.  I will not deduct a star from my rating due to the scent...the scent doesn't last long at all.  I don't think its fair to penalize the cream for a scent that doesn't last long.  I have no negative reactions to MU TENUTO. It works and feels great on my sensitive skin.  For those interested in packaging, the jar is glass-nice and heavy with music notes all around it. And here's a neat feature...if you scan the QR code on the package, a snippet of classic music will play on your Smart phone! That's pretty neat.<br /><br />I love what MU  TENUTO does for my skin and works with the very first use!  I find the price reasonable.  This is an excellent cream-it takes wonderful care of my dry, sensitive skin. Definitely recommended!",154,431
5.0,1610765636781,I LOVE What Easydew Does For My Skin!,"Should I start my review by telling you how incredibly creamy Easydew Daily face wash is? How it  makes my skin feel great as I'm washing with Easydew and even better after I've rinsed it off? How much I love the scent?<br /><br />Don't worry, I'll tell you everything! This is  my first ever Easydew product. In fact, prior to seeing this face wash in my VINE offers, I'd never even heard of Easydew brand products.  I'm so happy I ordered it.<br /><br />A nice, thin line of the wash dispenses from the tube.  (The tube is very sturdy and durable, for those interested in packaging) Now, the wash starts out like a kind of lotion but it lathers quickly and easily into a light, whipped foam. ( A dime size amount is all I need to sufficiently cover my face/forehead.  ) The whipped foam is SO creamy and it just feels so darn good as I apply it and when its on my face.  IDK if its possible but I swear I can feel it cleaning, hydrating and moisturizing my skin pretty much immediately.  After I rinse with lukewarm water and pat my skin dry with a towel, my skin is soft, smooth, clean and has  a bit of a glow.  It looks and feels so good and healthy. It feels fresh.  And it feels that way long after I've used Easydew.  Easydew leaves my skin feeling like it did when I was younger-before I used makeup, before I spent too much time in the sun unprotected.  It feels revived and I just love that feeling!  Everything about this daily wash is perfect in my book.  It works great and makes my skin look/feel great. The ingredients and what they do for skin is impressive. (I recommend taking a minute to read the info above regarding the ingredients!)  The scent is wonderful (though it vanishes VERY quickly).  And I have no issues using it on my dry, very sensitive skin.  The price is more than reasonable, especially with the results the wash brings and the fact only a small amount is needed when I wash my face.  Easydew is officially  a part of my daily skin care  routine now.  I absolutely recommend Easydew!",154,433
5.0,1607202914733,SO Many Uses For Both Oils! I LOVE Them!,"I am finding SO many uses for Shiny Leaf's coconut and sweet almond oil! I do have some experience with coconut oil but this is my first time using sweet almond oil.  Thanks the labels on the bottles, reviews and internet searches, I'm finding SO many ways to use these oils...sometimes together, sometimes individually.<br /><br />Because I have terribly dry, sensitive skin, my main goal was to see how one or both oils could help protect my skin, especially now that winter has arrived and my skin is REALLY taking a beating.  Both oils work well to hydrate and moisturize, so I mixed a few ounces of each in a mist bottle. After I bathe, I mist  a combo of the oils over my skin to help hydrate and moisturize. The oils absorb quickly and do not leave an oily/greasy look OR feel to my skin.  I'm already seeing a decrease in my dry skin/itchy red patches of skin. I experience NO discomfort whatsoever when misting these oils onto my sensitive skin.  Both oils also work wonders on hair by moisturizing, hydrating, improving hair texture/strength, stimulate hair growth /thicken hair, and nourish the scalp to prevent dry, itchy flakes. In addition to using my combo of oils after bathing, I also give my hair a spray or two with the mister and sure enough, I'm seeing less hair in the drain and on my hairbrush after brushing. My hair is soft, smooth and shiny WITHOUT looking or feeling oily/greasy from the oil combo.<br /><br />I use the coconut oil (alone) to help remove makeup, under and around my eyes to soften and reduce fine lines, I rub a small amount into my scalp (as does my husband) to help stimulate hair growth, on the kid's faces after their baths to soften (especially in cold weather!), on my nail beds every couple of days and a light amount on any patches of eczema/red skin.  (It relieves the itching/burning and redness from eczema quickly!)<br /><br />I use the sweet almond oil (alone) on  dark circles under my eyes, a SMALL amount on split ends in my hair, a drop on chapped lips, I'm just starting to tinker with it for aromatherapy purposes.  I recently learned that it can help fade scars so I've begun to rub some sweet almond oil into a scar on my finger to see what happens. If it helps, I'll then move on to a small facial scar I have. I'm also trying something on my own; just started doing this a few days ago.  I get nosebleeds every single day, at least once a day, throughout the winter when the heat is on in the house. This started when I was 2 years old, I'm now 49 so I've experienced this my entire life.  I now rub a small amount of sweet almond oil under my nostrils before bed.  Since starting this, I continue to have nosebleeds. Yesterday, I had only one and it involved just a few drops of blood. I didn't whip through numerous tissues like normal.  ONE tissue took care of it. (that's huge for me!) I have NO clue if its just a coincidence or if the sweet almond oil is helping in any way but I'm going to continue using it.<br /><br />These oils are phenomenal! Both bottles are 16oz.  I love the fact that they have normal caps on them but pumps for each bottle are included as well.  The liquid of each is thinner oil than I expected, which I prefer.  Both absorb quickly. Neither has a scent.  I've found SO many uses for these oils, I can't wait to discover more. ( I'm SO happy with these oils, I recently purchased Shiny Leaf's biotin hair conditioner and cannot wait to try it! ) I find the price to be incredibly reasonable, especially since you're getting TWO bottles of oils! HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />*FYI...the mist bottle on the end in my photo is NOT included! I used one of my  own mist bottles to combine both oils.  You will get both bottles AND pumps that you see in my photo, NOT the mist sprayer!",154,140
2.0,1606338770516,Not The Right Mud Mask For Me,"The directions on the tube of FRESHME's mud mask (pelargonium graveolens) state  those with sensitive skin should use the mud mask once a week. Because I have  sensitive skin that's precisely what  I did.  I also followed the directions that state the mask should be used after bathing or after warming the skin with a towel for 5 minutes.  Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a  difference after using this mud mask.  Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face.  In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all.  After I rinse it off (it rinses without issue), my skin feels clean but a bit dry. I cannot detect any change to my pores.  This just isn't the mud mask for me. I've discontinued using it and will be giving the rest to my niece over the holidays. My review will be updated if she has better results than I.<br /><br />--photo #1-taken right after I put some mask on my hand<br />--photo#2-taken after mask sat on my hand for 15 minutes (doesn't dry entirely)",154,434
4.0,1605613110667,Patches Work Well...Not a Huge Fan of the Roller,"Somehow, I managed to dodge dark circles under my eyes for most of my life...until a few years ago. Now, they're the 'norm' for me.  Same for puffy eyes. FRLEDM's 24K gold under eyes patches help tackle both issues and do so quickly. I keep the patches in the fridge-I get better results when they're cold and it feels good as well.  I wear the patches in the morning for about 15 minutes and I'm good to go.  It did take multiple uses before the results were obvious but that's to be expected.  I like many of the ingredients in the patches, including: collagen, hyaluronic acid (HUGE fan!), and aloe, to name a few.  I'm not a  fan of the roller, unfortunately.  I just do not care for the way it feels on skin...its not smooth and gentle, more like tugging and pulling.  I will be passing it along to my mom who is anxious to try it.<br /><br />While I'm not a fan of the roller, I am a fan of the patches and am pleased with the results they provide.  I will continue to use the patches and definitely recommend them. I hate to say that I don't recommend the roller just because I don't like the way it feels so I will just say  its not for me.",154,15

I ordered this cream to help moisturize his dry skin as well as  reduce his fine lines as he approaches the 'big 5-0'.  He's not yet noticed a reduction to his fine lines though he hasn't been using the lotion very long but he is pleased with the job its doing to help moisturize his skin.  His skin isn't nearly as dry as it had been so he is experiencing some much needed relief.  He is a fan of the scent and he's happy that the lotion doesn't cause his skin to look or feel oily/greasy.  He's definitely satisfied with this cream and the results he is receiving thus far.,154,435
5.0,1601706559533,"Softens, Smooths and Soothes Skin","I ordered LA LA Leaf Guayaquil hemp lotion for my husband . While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time  he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing  (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy.  lol.  While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn't cause my skin to look or feel oily or greasy. Let me tell you, the hemp oil, rose flower water white bark extract , aloe (a fave of mine) ingredients do a heck of a job softening and smoothing my hands after I apply LA LA Leaf. I'm already planning on using extra LA LA Leaf in the winter when my hands get the dreaded deep, extremely painful cracks due to cold weather. I noticed in the info provided above, this lotion can be used after spending time in the sun. Because my skin is so terribly sensitive and dry, I do believe I will use LA LA Leaf after spending time outside in the sun when the weather gets warmer. Regardless of where you use LA LA Leaf on your body, its going to leave you with soft, smooth skin and will do so quickly.  I do believe LA LA Leaf is worth the cost. It doesn't take much lotion to cover the skin (in the areas we are using it on) so this tube is going to last us a decent amount of time. I have every intention of continuing to use/buy LA LA Leaf. It's wonderful",154,436
3.0,1601115486588,Same Results as Dunking in a Bowl of Water,"If you're a dog owner, its practically guaranteed at some point, you will have to deal with your dog having dirty, muddy paws. Happens often with our bichon Mac. (Naturally, it recently happened right after I cleaned and mopped the house! lol)  I ordered the Mr. Ros automatic cleaner for small/medium dogs. Its very sturdy and durable, not at all flimsy.  Its roughly 8""tall  and has a removable mat with silicone bristles in the interior which is easily removable for cleaning purposes.  The bristles are very soft and not at all hard or sharp. It arrived already charged. A USB cord is included. To operate, simply add water to the washer-(2-3 cups per instructions) Liquid soap may be added as well. (I didn't use soap) Turn the washer on-it does make noise though its  not terribly loud at all-and place the dog's paw in the washer for 1-2 minutes. Dry each paw with a towel after cleaning. Mac wasn't thrilled throughout the cleaning process but he also wasn't really scared by it. My husband started to pour out the dirty water before I could stop him so you won't see much,  but you can see in my photo the water is discolored a bit following the cleaning.  If a wet towel isn't enough to clean Mac's muddy/dirty paws, my regular cleaning method is to put some lukewarm water in a small bowl , dunk each paw one at a time and use my hand to remove the dirt from his fur while submerged. Quite honestly, I really don't see much of a difference between that cleaning method and the Dr. Ros paw washer. Perhaps results vary depending on the breed of dog but for our bichon, I really don't see a  difference.",154,437

I have dry, sensitive skin but its not oily. My husband has oily skin. I have fine lines and wrinkles on my face. My husband does not.  Because Follain moisturizer promises to combat oily skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles and is a clean, vegan product, I ordered it to find out if it could help the both of us with our skin issues.  I'm happy to tell you that it has helped the both of us.  The moisturizer is a bit thinner than I'm used to. I don't say that in a bad way because its not at all bad.  One pump of the canister delivers enough moisturizer to cover my facial skin. Its very lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a look or feel of oily/greasy skin. It provides immediate hydration and does a nice job of softening my skin. I am VERY happy to say I absolutely have a noticeable reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. They don't go away entirely, but there is a definite reduction in size and appearance. ( I can't tell you how much I needed to experience this right now as my 49th bday is this week...that means 5-0 isn't far behind and I'm kind of starting to freak about it! )  My husband also tried this for his oily skin with impressive results.  Follain controls his oily skin and prevents the shiny, damp look that comes with oily skin thanks to the mattifying benefit of this moisturizer.  We both use it as needed and not even on a daily basis.  Follain works and it works well. We're both very pleased and grateful for the results!",154,438

5.0,1594613631750,Never Knew My Feet Could Be So Soft!,"My feet are so horribly dry and cracked,  they look like funky fish scales.  I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help.  The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion. It did not cause burning/itching, etc.  When the time was up, I removed the socks and cleaned my feet.<br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />Day 1 (the day after I did the treatment)-nothing<br /><br />Day 2-VERY light peeling-more like little 'threads' of skin<br /><br />Day 3-Actual peeling -I was pulling some decent pieces of skin off of both feet<br /><br />Day 4-WOW...BIG pieces of peeling skin!

Those are my trouble areas. Calluses are very thick and cracked on my heels.  (a million times worse during winter months!) I DID have some progress on my heels but nowhere near the rest of my feet.  I used the scraper (? not sure if that's what it's called) and made a bit of progress.  I wish now that i had wiped some of the lotion directly on my heels when I wore the socks.  When I do my next treatment, I will absolutely rub some lotion directly on my heels when I start.  I'm impressed and thrilled with the results.  Its flip flop season and my feet aren't always pretty to look at.  This foot peel really helped.  I absolutely recommend Monikahair foot peel if your feet are dry and cracked.

5.0,1594605653363,Took Care of My Brassy Hair the First Time I Used It!,"A few weeks ago, I tried a different brand of purple conditioner. This was the first time I'd ever used any purple conditioner on my blond hair. After using the other brand, I noticed a subtle change to the brassiness in my hair. While I was satisfied with the results, I also assumed it had done all it could do for my hair.  Tonight, I tried WELLUTION Purple Hair Mask (for blonds).  The mask is easy to apply and it distributes nice  and even on my hair. My hair is thick and shoulder length. It didn't take much mask to cover all of my hair. ( I did put extra mask on my roots/scalp area because I do dye my roots) I let the mask sit on my hair for 10 minutes.  It has a nice scent to it that I very much like. I had no issues rinsing the mask from my hair. It rinsed out without issue. It did not cause my hair to look/feel oily or greasy. I was able to comb it without issue and let it air dry.  When my hair was completely dry it looked and felt nice and soft. My natural waves were present without flyaways.  But...I also noticed my hair was FAR less brassy than it had been.  The change was not subtle the way it was with the first brand I'd tried weeks ago.  This was very noticeable. To say that I""m pleased with this mask is an understatement. Its wonderful.  And I WILL continue to use it as needed.  Blonds, if you're dealing with brassy hair, give this mask a try. I hope it works for you as well as it did for me.",154,439

My grandma is sensitive to powerful scents and she didn't turn her nose up at it so there's that. It is a decent thickness (not too runny or too thick), it absorbed relatively quickly and it makes my skin feel soft. The packaging is over the top, in a bad way. As a eco-minded person, the amount of packaging used was just ridiculous and unnecessary, IMO. My experience doesn't justify the price.. for the amounts you get and the average results are not equal to the price paid.

I have liked them all, and there are some products that I have repurchased (love their aminos face wash). I remember really liking this night cream, and so when it came up as an option to try, I thought maybe it was another version, but no it is the same. I think the change has been in the company. They were entirely a Chinese brand, and now I see USA labeling- but I think it is still a Chinese beauty product. Same stuff that I know and love. Same press down dispenser container.

While I dont rate on price, I am pleased at its effectiveness and how it is half the price of similar items I have used.<br /><br />Safe, effective moisturizing product with promising ingredients. I am used to using several of these ingredients, and I must stress that it is important to use SPF when using anything with retinol. I saw that this has quite a list of ingredients that I am not totally familiar with, so I went through each one and looked them up. I included a short description of each (and included EWG rating for those that like that sort of information). You will note that most all have a very GOOD rating of 1 or 2. The only ingredient that has a higher number (bad) is for the retinol- and that is because of the degree to which retinol/vitamin A, by nature can absorb into the skin (toxicity) and how our skin is more sensitive to UV rays. So again, wear your SPF when using any retinol based products.<br /><br />--GoMay is a Chinese (turned USA) beauty company and from everything I have used, the products have been impressive in formulation and the thought and safety put into creating it.<br /><br />--Awesome, attractive container.

I didnt realize how much other mascaras left behind, once I did my usual face wash (oil cleanse to start, then follow up with water based), and the mascara began to break down right away. Very pleased with that.<br /><br />This SkyHigh mascara is actually lengthening. I have basic lashes, and I dont expect anything magical from mascara. But this is noticeable on my lashes, and as I was swiping it on I could see the lashes looking elongated. Not clumpy (that's good or bad depending on the look you are going for). This has more natural look. I haven't noticed any flaking, definitely no smudging. My eyes are easily irritated by makeup, and this mascara doesnt seem to bother me. I can wear it on both upper and lower lashes.<br /><br />At a budget friendly price ($5 for 1, or $7 for pack of 2), it is worth trying. I would consider it again at this price. Another cheapie I really like is Essence, which has both waterproof and non waterproof options: https://www.amazon.com/essence-Princess-Effect-Mascara-Cruelty/dp/B00T0C9XRK",359,703

It says it fits up to 24"" head, and mine measures 23.5"". Then I have loads of hair- semi thick, nearly waist length. It all fits! Yet isn't a big bulbous excess of material either. But I am definitely pushing max space available (again, I have a large head).<br /><br />I simply dont wash my hair every day, but I do hop in the shower. I dont notice my hair getting wet at all, but I dont put my head in the water even with this on. I have a spray nozzle for washing and rinsing, so I guess I am able to control where the water reaches better.<br /><br />The fit is surprisingly good. The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is reasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I really was skeptical, but am glad I went ahead and got this. I have some cute shower caps, but none as nice as this. The little bow on top makes me feel like I went back in time to the 50s or something. Adorbs!<br /><br />I dont use it for keeping my hair out of face for make up or skin care, but it would certainly do well for that too. Also, if I had pool.. while it isnt a pool cap, if I just wanted something to help keep excess water off my hair while casually wading in a pool, this very well could work for that too.",359,223

I do like both. I tend to like cushion over liquid, but both of these are fantastic. I really like how these feel, and despite being a  little warm on my cool skin, the make up looks good on the skin. Doesn't settle into every nook and cranny, nor dry flakes.<br />My skin is 40+ so this is something I look for in make up.<br /><br />The primer is fantastic. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. Use less than you think you need lest you want a more oily look to seep through. I find that primers like this are great for dry skin, and for more dry feeling foundations.. but their foundations arent drying. So less is more with their primer.<br /><br />The formula for the liquid foundation really impresses me. Staying power is good. Skin feels comfortable. Skin looks healthy. I can touch my skin after and it doesn't feel like there is make up on. Provides really good coverage with a little bit yet doesn't look cakey and fake. Can be built up. I would recommend this over dermablend, personally. All my redness disappears (from Type 1 Rosacea). To provide a more sheer wash, just change up your application- use a damp sponge to put it on, or use a damp sponge as last step to blend it in and lighten it up.<br /><br />I really think it is worth the try. I wasn't even going to try this, but since they provided so much information in their product description it really piqued my interest. If you need coverage with a natural look.. try this!",359,704
4.0,1623515969971,"creamy semi matte finish, bold, bright pop of color, fades w/ drink & food, smudges","Not shiny, not matte, somewhere in between. They call it semi-matte, and I agree. But anyone who has lines or parched lips, should always avoid any formulation with the word ""matte"" in it. You are better off with a lip liner and a moisturizing lip gloss or lip stick. Matte will always dry down and make the lip skin pucker a little. My lips aren't wrinkled, but I can tell the formula pulls the skin together a little.<br /><br /> The color is bold. 06 Crush Berry appears to be a blue based red. Definitely red, like a classic red, just blue based rather than orange based. It feels super smooth on the lips, not at all tacky. Doesn't feel or look dry to start, but it dries down to a matte look. Can achieve a decent level of stain with a few applications and blotting.<br /><br />The first pass has a more oily look and feel to it. I smash my lips one way, and it appears to come off lips a little. Then I smash them in the other direction, and the color is there again. But once it sets, it isnt budging like that again. Any color disappearance is from drinking, eating.<br /><br />The case looks and feels good. The overall product is pretty good, just comes down to wanting a bold semi matte color that will perform like most other lipsticks- wears off with drinking & eating.Even then it doesnt disappear. Just might need to even out the color after awhile.  It seems to hold up to the product description. So for that (and all else), I give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />I'm not in love with it, but it looks nice in pictures. Has a bright pop of color. This is not a subdued look at all.

So too tight for me to keep on wrist. These are ok if I keep them tucked into a drawer and I grab one as I need one. They have good snug elasticity for thinner hair.

I have used a variety of Busy Co wipes, and I have liked them all, some more than others. When I selected this, I chose it after taking a look at the ingredients (how I always select items to buy or to try). So it was weird not to see direct ingredient list on this product page. I have included the ingredients here:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Glycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Hyaluronate, Astrocaryum Murumuru Seed Powder, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice<br /><br />This unscented GLOW formula is aimed toward those seeking to BRIGHTEN SKIN, IMPROVE DRY SKIN, and REPAIR DAMAGED SKIN.<br />Not sure who is trying to use this on babies, but this product is not marketed for that use.<br /><br />I use this on my hands and feet, prior to bed. Then I add my lotions. The wipe does a good job cleaning my skin and nails. Adds little hydration. Could use them being a little more damp, but they do work. I have a couple tucked into my purse in case I just need a wipe, but for the most part I am keeping these for night time use. While I think this product is ok, it isnt a must have for me, and I likely wont repurchase.

Then I follow up with other products (serum, moisturizer, and/or sunscreen). Ceramides help build and maintain a healthy skin barrier.

I'm going with 5 (4.5 if I could, but leans more 5 than 4) even at early impression. Sometimes you just know.  I have been using it with their Real Ampoule Drops, which I rated a 4 at this time (4.5 if I could. ) as I need more time with it. However, this lotion has been easier to determine because it instantly lends a dewy, supple, perfectly moisturized skin that lasts all day and night (or night and day in my case as I have been using it at night). Anything else it is a doing for me is a bonus, and I know will take time, but right now the instant effect is lovely feeling, radiant skin.<br /><br /> It is a thin, light lotion but it is rich. I love how it feels, and how good my skin looks come morning. Little goes a long way. Maybe it is a combo of this and the drops (which instant absorb, and works well with this lotion). No matter, I am pleased with my experience with Organa Cell products so far. SO much so that I have been looking into other products. I am a big fan of K-beauty, and will likely buy their sunscreen soon.<br /><br />Now, I have no idea what the full ingredient list. I will double check the packaging to see if it is there. I went to their website (Korean, so you will need a web translator) and they do not have the full ingredient  list shown (unless I missed it). Pretty much what you see on this product page is what you will see on their actual web page. I sniffed around other merchant pages (jolse,wantitall,koreanbeautybox, etc). but just found the same info.<br /><br />Real Ampoule Drops: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X4FDWKP<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, dry, CLEAR (no acne), smooth, but contend with Type 1 Rosacea (redness, visible veins, no bumps).

Great for sensitive skin as it has components to help protect, build, maintain skin barrier.<br /><br />I dont rate based on price, we all have our own budgets. Organa Cell is pricier than most K-beauty I try, but it is still a brand I would recommend. I would like to see a full ingredient list, but I also find that it doesn't stop me from using their products and considering other purchases.

5.0,1617976974722,"travel sized bottle will provide many applications, works well, even better as day goes on","It works! Comes down to preference. I use dry shampoo often. I prefer the powder over the spray. I find they work better and for a longer period of time over the spray. Sprays tend to work quicker, so if you are not used to powder variety, know that you have to give it some time. So apply this, let it sit on hair for a bit before combing through. Then comb through and maybe add more. Go finish getting dressed or whatever, then finish combing hair and finishing off your style. OR apply some before bed and wake up to fresh hair.<br /><br />It doesn't take much. I have used other brands with similarly small containers, and the stuff lasts forever even with frequent use. This is a little smaller at 1.5 ounces, which they state is travel size-- but it will still provide many applications. At $9.99, I think the price is great (even though I do not rate on price)- and I will likely buy this again but in the dark hair option (more about that in a moment).  This is a nozzle tip dispenser. Squeeze bottle to get it to disperse. Be sure to take the protective seal off from inside the cap. Mine was stuck up in the cap. It took me a few humorous attempts to get the product out from nozzle before I realized that the safety seal was caught up inside. Once I got through that snafu, all was good to go.<br /><br />I failed to see that this is for ""light hair"". It is a pale yellow powder. ""This particular shampoo is optimized for light hair, so if your hair is blonde, red, or strawberry blonde, this ‘poo is for you"". Not all dry shampoo makes the distinction, but some do. So if/when I purchase the dark hair option (which they have, and I will link below), I imagine it will be a darker powder. But it really doesn't matter!!!  Many of the dry shampoo powders are white, so I figured this would be the same in terms of overall look. If not too much is used, and if it is brushed out well enough rarely is there any noticeable haze. Again, I am used to working with the powder form so it comes easy to me to get it to work.<br /><br />My hair was freshened up as expected. A light lift. Not a massive amount of volume, though over course of day I noticed it seemed more full (I have very long hair, so the roots will be weighed down a bit at first). No problems. I like it.

It is thin, and goes on like a light lotion. Typical viscosity among my other K-beauty brands.<br /><br />I have a wide assortment of sunscreen, of various formulations and types. It is my #1 skin care product as I use it daily all year long. It is a habit. I avoid the sun for a few reasons, so sunscreen is vital to my well being. I live in a variable climate (from dry, freezing temps to humid hot) and I have sunscreen preference depending on season and situation. I tend to prefer mineral (my fair skin can handle any white cast) but do utilize chemical sunscreen often.<br /><br />I am going to like this for basic daily summer use. I tend to reduce my morning skin care routine down to a basic wash or splash of water and a moisturizing sunscreen. Since this offers SPF 50 (P++++), I know my skin is going to be pretty well protected. Since it feels like a moisturizer and goes on clear, I can skip my other skin care if I want. I tend to skip morning skin care in the summer because I am likely to just sweat it off anyway (I have a more involved night time routine to make up for it). So a sunscreen such as this is easy to use, makes my skin feel good, and easy to reapply throughout the day. I dont wear make up usually, but for sake of review I used it under a light foundation tint. Seems to play well- I didnt notice any rolling/pilling. I'll use it up.

Let me tell you about it in terms of my ROSACEA (type 1: redness, and visible veins/telangiectasias). I would not thinking adding MORE PINK would be at all helpful to my already rosy complexion. But it does a phenomenal job evening out my skin tone.  I have fair, cool toned skin so I find this is still a tad dark-- so if you have skin that is even a little darker than very pale, then this should blend in real well. Yet even with the clearly pink mask that it gives me, it looks better than pink and red splotches. I just wouldnt go out in public with this alone. SO, this got me thinking about using it as a BASE layer to another sunscreen, mixing it, or the best use.. using it under make up. It will provide a great foundational canvas for a layer of foundation. Wont need to rely on the make up to even things out. If you have splotchiness, you may like trying this out. That's what appeals greatest to me-- that it evens out my skin tone gently.<br /><br />Nice smell, even coverage.. makes my skin feel really good. Semi dewy supple feel. My skin is DRY, and this feels good on, Maybe it just plays well with my other skin care products? Oddly.. it has a slight gritty feel while putting it on. Yet doesnt have a gritty feel ON the skin.

This ""chalfont 303- a shimmering shade of pearl"" reminds more of a yellow tinged shimmery champagne rather than what I think of as pearl (white leaning pink). It is definitely not a white pink, too bad.  I may use it blended in with something, but it otherwise looks sallow on my fair, pink skin with blue undertones. I do however love the ease of use, how it does not irritate my eyes at all, and it just goes on so smoothly.",359,724

I use it as my first step in dissolving the grime and skin care products I used during the day (mostly SPF,  I dont wear makeup but rarely). I have dry skin, semi sensitive and this is soothing feeling as well as non irritating. The combo of Centella Asiatica (soothing, skin health) and Hyaluronic Acid (retaining moisture) are the clear winning ingredients in this awesome oil cleanser.<br /><br /> I dab this oil cleanser all over the face, then let the heat of my hands melt it into my skin. It quickly turns to a spreadable oil to massage in all over. I really like the solid balm to oils over the liquid oils as I find them easier to work with. They also seem to rinse away cleaner? I feel like I could use this Mizon oil balm as my only cleansing step, but I am rather used to doing a 2nd cleanse with a gentle cleanser to wash off any remaining dissolved gunk from the first wash. You'll have to try it out for yourself.<br /><br />Currently using this gentle, clean, vegan cleanser by To Do List as my second cleanse after Mizon:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDJR7S4<br /><br />I have a couple of double duty balm-to- oil cleansers that I like, and I would consider Mizon Cicaluronic  as a repurchase.",359,725

It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft, smooth, clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F), dry day. Super moisturizing.<br /><br />Oddly, I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps, and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches, nausea), but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners), I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass, but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil, orange oil, and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean, but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.<br /><br />I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent, and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich, super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did, I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here, lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.<br /><br />One does not need a lot of soap, so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down.

I have a facial cleanser by Hylunia I really like, and this has a similar feel to it. I would use this on my face while in the shower with no problems. It is gentle and non irritating!<br />It isn't super sudsy, but it lathers plenty enough to feel like I am covering my body and cleansing it.

They just have a good size and shape that fits perfectly into the hand. That stood out to me on first use. I really like how well it fits in my hand. The bars are tear dropped or pear shaped. More specifically, it is shaped to be a like a defense shield. Get it?  As this is meant to be a bit of an immune defense/support item.<br /><br />The bars are thin, but not fragile. I can palm it and easily rub it all over without it falling out of my hand. I have been using one bar on and off for a couple of weeks now, and it isn't just disappearing. There are six loose bars in a resealable bag.<br /><br />The soap has a slight intentional grit to it . This adds some scrubbing action. Creates a nice lather and rinses well. The scent is an intriguing mix of essential oils. Clove, Cinnamon, Oregano, Peppermint, Parsley, Eucalyptus and Rosemary essential oils Not overpowering. Really quite nice.<br /><br />It has been an odd, but unexpectedly pleasant product to use. The price is budget friendly. I find nothing bad about them or my experience so far.

I know products are sold by weight not volume, but the container really does look like it is missing a portion, as it is half empty. It is probably all there. The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity, with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense, so after settling, I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal, I am reticent to use in on my face, and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me, and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).<br /><br />Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive, the product smells good, and the ingredients are interesting; highly nourishing & repairing for the skin.

3.0,1605277820525,"just like mousse or shaving cream, but is a soap for body","The bottle and texture is very much like a hair mousse or shaving cream, but is a wash for the body.  Instead of a pump or squeeze bottle, this comes out though as pressure aerosol - also just like a mousse or shaving cream.  The ingredients necessary to make this happen are Butane and Propane. They are aerosol propellents.  If you have ever used mousse, hair spray, various perfumes/body sprays, air fresheners, aerosol deodorants, or shaving cream,etc..  then you are already familiar with these ingredients. They are generally recognized as safe, and are used in small, diluted quantities in skin care. Fun fact, ""These ingredients are used in cosmetics and personal care products as a replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC propellants, some of which have been shown to have negative effects on the environment"".  I'm not a big fan of slathering my body with butane, propane, or isobutane, but I understand their use in this type of medium. So it's up to you to decide.<br /><br />This company does have non aerosol body wash available too..<br /><br />The resulting foamy wash comes out thick, it is creamy. Because it reminds me so much of a shaving cream, that it what I have been using it for. Then whatever is left over I use on rest of body. Is pleasant smelling enough to me but it isn't quite a pure aromatherapy experience for me. Clearly it uses a variety of essential oils- rosemary, orange, eucalyptus, peppermint, limonene. However, for whatever reason, it contains ""parfum (fragrance)"" as an added ingredient. As well as Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, another synthetic fragrance ingredient. Is there not enough naturally occurring scent from the use of essential oils? I think the added synthetic fragrance is redundant and takes away from the olfactory experience.<br /><br />As an actual wash, it is fine.<br />3 stars-- this is just a middle of the road rating.  I am not in love.  The experience is underwhelming. I am much too quickly going through the container. Aromatherapy experience is a little off  as I pick up on something other than essential oils.

I also prefer the cheapies only because I am not sure if the recipient will definitely use it, and the higher end masks tend to be more discerning in what it attends to.

I would say from my experience with this line, is that this is more of a longer term use item.

Perhaps once the extra dry cold weather comes in, then I will add something on top.

So for me, I find that it is almost TOO light for my needs. Here is what I do like: I like that I can easily pair it with other products as it doesn't seem to pill or roll.  I would never use this at night as it is just too light for me, but it has been fine for use in my morning skin care routine- after a serum and before a moisturizing SPF. I don't feel like it works as my only moisturizer, but I DO think it is worth a try. The ingredients are fabulous.  While it doesn't feel like it is drying, it doesn't give me that dewy oomph that my preferred products can provide. Maybe I need to use it for a longer duration (sometimes that happens.. something I use for awhile doesnt seem to be doing anything but I keep using it to use it up, and at some point I notice a noted improvement).<br /><br />Despite it containing a lot of different nourishing oils, I would prefer it to feel and look a little oilier.

I highly recommend that it is paired with their Double Hydra Toner, especially if you like using hydrating toners using the 7 skins method (apply toner in layers until skin has soaked up as much as it can). Then follow with this, and the skin feels light, fresh, hydrated, supple, smooth, plump, and oh so happy. I find that I can use it day and/or night. I really have no preference. Seems to play well with other products (SPF, serums, masks)<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077BTR9H4/ref=pe_1098610_137716200_cm_rv_eml_rv0_dp<br /><br />As someone who engages in hobby skin care, I like finding through trial and error items that I would buy again, or would be my go-to if I had to choose just a couple things. These two are my go-to items. If I don't feel like playing around with other products, or if I am in between testing products, this combo just saves my skin and makes it look and feel so good. In a time when we really shouldn't be touching our faces (and we shouldn't anyway), sometimes I can't help it as my skin just feels soft and pleasantly moist.<br /><br />The bottle style is very familiar to me. Tall, thin, with twist off cap. Squeeze to get product. 2.02 fl ounces will last quite some time even when using a generous amount. Dont forget neck and chest :)<br /><br />When I say I have semi sensitive, I used to have really sensitive skin- felt easily irritated, often had a burning feeling or itchy feeling. I had to learn about ingredients and figure out what bothered me. But ultimately, I learned that it incorporating ingredients that help repair and maintain the skin barrier is what helps most of all. So ceramides, occlusives, Natural Moisturizing Factors (NMF), Serine, copper, and several others.. that just help the skin significantly. Add in hydrating toners and consistent use of SPF, and the skin is looking good. Now, using harsh products can contribute to broken skin barrier, but often it is simply environmental or physical (too many exfoliating sessions, too harsh/physical scrubbing, too much sun/wind/vacillating temps). So I consider my skin semi sensitive because I am aware that I used to have really sensitive skin and now I seem to not to, but I still actively regard and address my skin in terms of maintaining skin barrier. THIS product has ingredients that help the skin barrier (NMF, Serine).<br /><br />I like it a lot, good stuff. Definitely recommend.",359,740
5.0,1596938837662,"excellent sunscreen with skin loving ingredients, broad spectrum, great little container","The ""Drop the Bomb"" BBOSONG Suns stick uses one of THEE best UVA/UVB sunscreen ingredients on the planet: ""Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine""! Say that 5 times fast. Or once. lol. It is a broad spectrum, highly photo stable, chemical sunscreen. Chemical sunscreens mean that they absorb rays and disperse as heat before they can reach skin and do damage. The SPF rating of 50+ and PA++++ means that it offers the highest amount of protection that a sunscreen can offer.<br /><br />Korean skin care, particularly sunscreens, can use super effective ingredients that products made in (or for) USA can not have because the governing bodies have not approved it. It is not because they are unsafe, but because there is a significant amount of bureaucracy involved. No new sunscreen ingredients have been approved in the USA in over 15 years, sad since there are so many wonderful innovations in the rest of the world. We lag greatly behind. Fortunately, we can still buy these products.<br /><br />The other sunscreen used in this product is, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate)- a less stellar chemical sunscreen that has mixed thoughts on its efficacy, safety, and desirability. It protects only against UVB rays and breaks down when exposed to light (10% per 30-40 minutes). However, when combined with another broad spectrum sunscreen, it compliments it very well.<br /><br />The third sunscreen component is, Octocrylene.  Screens out the UVB and somewhat in the UVA II range. It is quite photostable (loses 10% of SPF protection in 95 mins) and is often used to stabilize other photo-unstable UV-filters (octinoxate) It is also often used to improve the water resistance of the products.<br /><br />As for all the other ingredients- primarily stabilizers, viscosity controlling ingredients, hardeners-- basically all ingredients that make it a STICK than can glide onto the skin. It is formulated to melt into the skin on contact, and yet absorb thoroughly. Basically, you won't even know it is there.<br /><br />And like so many other Korean skin care items, there are ingredients that go above and beyond the basic sunscreen-- included are skin loving ingredients (emollients, skin conditioners, soothers) such as Japanese knotweed, water lily, gotu kola (centella asiatica), camellia japonica, Lespedeza Capitata Extract (anti inflammatory), scutellaria (ie scullcap/mint), green tea, licorice, rosemary, chamomile<br /><br />Has a super mild scent- clean, fresh almost like a deodorant, but subtle.<br /><br />Happens to be a in a container that reminds me of deodorant. Super small, cute. Stick in a pocket or purse. I happen to love using it on my hands. I am in my 40s, and while I have been using SPF most of my life on my face, I figured it was high time to remember to put some on my hands. I like keeping this in my purse or my car, and applying it when I go to drive. That seems to be the time that my hands are most consistently exposed to the sun. Figure, hands on the steering wheel and in front of a big window. So yeh, this is perfect for that.<br /><br />I have no problem using this on my face.  Doesn't grab skin when used over a moisturizer. If need be can be applied/emulsified in palms then patted on. I prefer it as my ""reapply"" SPF rather than my first application product (I am used to a cream style). When I do apply it to my face, I always run it over my lips. It is very silky, doesnt have a sunscreen flavor or feel, and it is adding much needed hydration and protection from the sun.<br /><br /> Again, I am in my 40s.. clear fair skin but with Rosacea (non acne- just redness and visible veins). Leans dry. Loves Korean skin care.<br /><br />This is so clear, so clean feeling, and so incredibly light that I wish I could show you how it doesn't even feel like anything is on. Not greasy, not even dewy. My skin feels bare.<br /><br />If I have any complaints, it is the use of fragrance. While it smells nice and doesn't really linger.. it would not make a top choice for use on my face. I do however like it for everywhere else and rather enjoy the light scent before it dissipates fully.<br /><br />Even so, it is a really good product, so far. If I experience anything else, I will be back to say so.<br /><br />For all the other ingredients, the each rate 1-2 (very low in terms of hazard to self or environment) on EWG Skin Deep Database.",359,742
5.0,1596160676248,clean brushes every time,"First one I have ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to. When I looked at it, I thought I had been bamboozled as it appears to just be an airy dry foam sponge in a tin can. Maybe that is all it is. So I set out to change eye shadow colors, and was floored by how it thoroughly cleaned my brush. What is this sorcery? I don't use too many colors, and I either change brushes or wipe it on a reusable cotton round to clean off one shadow before moving onto next. My brushes always still have a little color on them (whether it be powder or cream). THIS? This took it all off my brush.<br /><br />I still stare at my clean brush in wonderment.<br /><br />Are there better eye shadow switching pans? no idea. I can only tell you that my brushes always come clean, so far.<br /><br />Also, fits nicely in my make up box!",359,743
4.0,1595442388136,"like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash; zero eye irritation, easy to wash off","I may be in the minority here, but I rather like this mascara. And yes, it is made in China. Not, ""made for USA but made in China"", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn't tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why?  Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn't bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No joke. It sucks.  So when I encounter a mascara that..well.. allows me to actually wear it- I add to my list of potential repurchase. I have tried so many over the years. Funny thing, a few on my list happen to be cheap mascara (Essie, Wet-n' Wild,), --but not all-- and most mid level priced brands bother me as well as uber expensive ""natural, healthy"" brands. What I have noticed is that the WATERPROOF brands do the best in terms of feeling gentle and non irritating (probably less likely to flake). Next up, is the most recent generation of mascara that includes ""4D silk fiber lashes"", which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is so very different in feel and performance over traditional mascara. It has this interesting ability to coat the lashes- like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash. It easily and instantly really darkens the lashes, and can add volume and length. The formulas tend to be waterproof, and yet somehow wash off much much much easier than typical waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is much easier and gentler to work with.<br /><br />My lashes do not look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be extra glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me happy (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn't matter, but the box is super pretty. I still have it, and I have no use for it, but it is just so pretty to look at. Added a picture of the mascara wand.<br /><br />If I can glean any further information about this product, I will come back and add to this review.",359,744
4.0,1593570937241,"lightweight, budget friendly, soothing cica cream, use all over","Can't go wrong with Cica cream, and at this price it is a bargain.<br /><br />Cica cream is soothing and hydrating and is especially great if you have easily irritated or sensitive skin. It can really be used by anyone with any type of skin, or skin conditions. It is just a good all around cream. It typically contains centella asiatica, the star of the soothing ingredients. Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier. So I think this is good one to try if you are seeking to try it out, and want a simple but effective skin soothing product but don't want to break the bank.  The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.  OH yeh, this is good stuff for lips too. It isn't a huge tube, so it could be carried in a coat pocket or purse, no problem.",359,745
5.0,1592427032313,"this is a medium tint- definitely gives sun kissed glow, absorbs well, hydrates, non greasy","Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says, ""medium"" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..<br /><br />This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen, using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays, converts them to heat, then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available, blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great, and it depends on what works best with  your skin.<br /><br />This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious, skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter, jojoba, oilve oil, and vitamin e. It comes out thin, and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round, and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often, sweating it off, etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized, I feel better about keeping it so simple.<br /><br />Again, I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you, then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool, fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast, at all. If your skin is real oily, then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin; seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy, and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive, non-acne Rosacea (redness, visible veins), I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year, and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else, it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot, and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck, then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try, and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).<br /><br />I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new, or think of anything else.",359,746
5.0,1580061530082,LOVE! super gentle manual exfoliation & chemical peeling product; deep cleans pores; brightens,"I am a big fan of Neogen products, and Korean beauty products in general. I like that the focus tends to be on creating healthy glowing skin through skin loving ingredients and maximizing hydration, which all skin types need. I find these Neogen Real Charcoal Pads to be super gentle, non irritating, lightly hydrating, skin brightening, deep cleaning of pores and other yucks on skin. Skin never ever tight, never irritated-- and I have non acne ROSACEA (flushing, telangiectasias/veins).<br /><br />I hadn't used the charcoal pads before, so I was excited to try them out. There are 60 pads in a tub with twist off lid. One side of the pad is quilted and you can clearly see the charcoal coloring. The other side is smooth. The pads are quite damp, and there is plenty of product on them to take care of face and neck, or to use as a targeted ""sheet mask"". Avoid eye area.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: AFTER washing, swipe the quilted side over skin. Then use smooth side to pick up traces of impurities. Pat in remaining essence.<br /><br />When I swipe the quilted side over my skin, I like to go slow with gentle pressure. I allow the product to sit for a moment before flipping the pad over to the smooth side (more white than gray) and wipe my face. One side applies the product, the other helps to lift up what is left behind- or brought to surface as it is meant to draw out impurities and wastes. I noticed that the pad was turning tan/brownish leading me to believe that these pads were indeed doing a good job of breaking down excess junk on my face (despite a good cleansing) and leaving my skin feeling supple and clean. I followed the directions that state to pat in any excess product. I wasn't sure whether to follow up with my hydrating toners, or skip to my Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Since skin needs moisture to make HA most effective, I patted on one layer of hydrating toner, a layer of HA, followed by a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I think this charcoal pad is gentle enough to use daily, if need be. However, I have been using it 2-3x a week. You will have to experiment to see what is best for you. My 40 something rosacea skin is sensitive, leans dry, and loves hydration. My skin can use an occasional boost in really purifying my pores and such. I am really liking this product so far. It just feels so gentle on my skin!<br /><br />Benefits, and a little more info:<br /><br />--Charcoal powder and peeling essence ingredient- Hydroxycinnamic Acid- provide double synergy effect for absorbing sebum and removing dead skin cells. The charcoal powder delivers gentle yet effective adsorption benefit to draw impurities, while hypoallergenic peeling essence (Hydroxycinnamic Acid) provides manual exfoliation combined with chemical peeling effect.<br /><br />--Manual exfoliation + chemical peeling effect.<br />--With two sides including Charcoal pad that cleanses the skin and embossing pad that softly purifies the skin.<br /><br />--Pore clarifying: Formulated with natural Peat water and Charcoal powder(310 ppm), these help to draw deep-seated sebum, whiteheads, dead skin cells, and other impurities out of pores for smoother and clearer skin.<br /><br />--Gentle Peeling: NEOGEN PHA™ removes dead skin cells and impurities without irritation or discomfort while leaving the skin radiantly hydrated and smooth.

4.0,1569875262983,"scent is too much for me on this one, but there other ones are awesome; great nourishing scrub","This is my second scrub with this company. The first was great, but I find that the fragrance is too much for me with this Honey one. These products do contain ""parfum"" as an added ingredient, but it is last on the list. I have included a picture of the ingredients as I do not see the list anywhere else. My other salt scrub by this company-bloodorange, and that scent is wonderful and fresh, in bottle, in shower, and on skin after (very light). This one is just heavy, rather perfume like. I have noticed some shea containing products have that, but the other one that I do like has shea as well but isn't cloying. So I don't know. I'm afraid it might trigger a headache for me. I may have to have someone else in the household finish it off. Love the other one I mentioned, though!<br /><br />As for how it works- no problem. A thick frosting like creamy texture with a hint of grit. It does a nice job cleaning, polishing, and leaving the skin feel smooth and moisturized. It is a gentle scrub- very gentle. Definitely softens skin. I scoop out a generous 1/8-1/4 cup amount to use on my body. With that amount, I expect several uses from this squat container. I particularly like this one for my legs and feet as they are the most neglected in terms of skin care.<br /><br />I really do like Natural Soultion salt scrubs, and it appears that there are 4 kinds. This one based solely on the fragrance is a miss for me, but another one happened to be a hit for me, which I will continue to use as needed.<br /><br />EDIT: While a whiff from the container is too strong for me, the actual aroma in the shower continues to be pretty tame. It dawned on me to smell my skin after showering (something I didn't do with prior showers prior to initial review), and my skin doesn't have that strong smell that I note from the container. It smells pleasant and light, and I wanted to come back to say so.SO I just wanted to say that I haven't had a headache, and I don't actually smell like the scent from the container- I was concerned I would have that perfume smell. It isn't there, thankfully.<br /><br />I'd boost it to a 5 rating, but the product descriptions says, ""No Artificial Fragrances Or Perfumes"", and ""parfum"" is on ingredient list- and doesn't say where that is derived from.",359,748

4.0,1561224373116,"sharp, long plade, short handle, slices hair off easily","WOW!! These are good. They are very similar in style to all the other dermaplaning razors out there, but they are longer than any I have used. The blade is just a hair under 2"". Pun intended. One of the popular blades among beauty conscious people (pictured) is around 1.5"". Many are 1"" or less. SO, keep this in mind for where you want to use this and if you are comfortable with that length of blade. Otherwise it is all very similar.<br /><br />I like that this 5 pack is contained within a box. Many are on a flat piece of cardboard with molded plastic around them. Makes it too easy to lose one, misplace one.. they just fall out of package when opened. This box will nicely store the remainder. I won't lose these among my other beauty goodies.<br /><br />I have no idea what it says on the box. The sticker on the box says Made in China. The box says, Made in Japan. I can't read anything else.<br /><br />Handle is short- I think adds to precision of use. The longer blade makes it harder to get the eyebrow area. For that, I would go with a smaller, angled razor. For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don't over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br /><br />The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn't grow back thicker or darker. But it sure makes the face nice and smooth- great for make up looking good, for skin care setting in nicely, for exfoliation- for overall health of skin. A leg razor is fine, less likely to cut.. but a straight razor provides an extra close shave (if careful). I love these for taking care of upper lip area, and for eyebrow area.. but is taking some getting used to since it is a longer blade than others I use.",359,750
4.0,1555785204360,"easy use, comfortable, could have longer nozzle","I use a larger plug in water flosser unit in my full bathroom (on upper level of house) which has a large capacity water reservoir. I typically take my time and use it at night before bed. However, I wanted a unit on my main floor bathroom for quick use during the day without having to go back upstairs, or for use if I am going to be gone all day and want to take it with me. Therefor I have been keen on getting a portable chargeable flosser. That, and my first floor bathroom is super tiny with nowhere to put a typical flossing unit nor anywhere to plug it in. This is perfect for me!<br /><br />Nice unit, right out of the box. It is attractive, feels comfortable in the hand, as is easy to get it going. While it comes with instructions, it is easy to figure out- very intuitive. USB cord is good length. The port that plugs into the unit has a pop-in cover (""anti-fouling rubber stopper""). It doesn't come attached, and I wish it did since I'd rather not have that area exposed to water. I sense that I will lose that cap soon enough, or just forget to use it. We'll see.<br /><br />The unit comes with four attachments, all for doing different jobs- so unless someone has a need for this unit and for an attachment for something different than what you need, I would say this is for solo use. Good sized water reservoir, too.<br /><br />Unlike my main unit, this one has a fairly straight nozzle in comparison. This makes it a challenge to get behind the rear most molars. If the nozzles were a little longer, with slightly more curve than it has, I would consider this a perfect product.",359,146

The inflatable guitar gives a whole new meaning to the term air guitar. With this you can play Bohemian Rhapsody! “NOT” Long live, Queen.<br />“Wayne's World"" was originally a recurring sketch from the NBC television series Saturday Night Live. It evolved from a segment titled ""Wayne's Power Minute"" (1987) on the CBC Television series It's Only Rock & Roll, as the main character first appeared in that show. A prototype of the Wayne character had appeared several years prior on CITY-TV in Toronto's overnight show City Limits. The Saturday Night Live sketch spawned a hit 1992 film, its 1993 sequel, and several catchphrases which have since entered the pop-culture lexicon. The sketch centered on a local public-access television program in Aurora, Illinois, hosted by Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers, the same actor from ""Wayne's Power Minute""), an enthusiastic and sardonic long-haired metalhead, and his timid and sometimes high-strung, yet equally metal-loving sidekick and best friend, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey). Wayne lives with his parents and broadcasts his show ""live"" from the basement of their house every Friday evening at 10:30. The first ""Wayne's World"" sketch appeared in the 13th Saturday Night Live episode of the 1988/1989 season.

5.0,1657982478280,Works great for me.,"This Argan-Infused Round Brush is nice. I used it while drying my hair and I was happy with the results. The bristles felt a little sharp since I have been using a different type of brush but not so sharp, that I couldn't use it.<br /><br />The box comes with a brush. This brush is round and has nylon bristles. The barrel of the brush is open allowing air from the blow dryer to pass through. Instructions are on the box.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Argan-Infused Round Brush to family and friends.",373,788

I was surprised at well it worked.<br /><br />The box comes with a 16.9 fluid ounce bottle of gel nail polish remover and a pump bottle. It also comes with a pack of cotton pads and a pack of nail clips. Also included is a file and cuticle pusher.

5.0,1638479685636,Nice kit. Love the cutters and gemstones.,"This Janier Coffin Nail Tips Nail Glue Kit is nice. I love that I don't have to put on a base coat first. This nail glue is a base coat and glue on in one bottle. I also love the gemstones.<br /><br />This kit contains a box of soft gel tips. The box has sections inside dividing the different size nails. There is also a number on the tip of each nail. Also included in the kit is a pair of edge cutters, a file, a pack of gemstones, a small UV lamp with a USB cord, a bottle of top coat, and 2 bottles of glue.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Janier Coffin Nail Tips Nail Glue Kit to family and friends.",373,794
4.0,1638141264181,Put the container in something before opening. The little pieces stick to the top and go everywhere.,"This Makartt Nail Decoration Set is gorgeous. The only thing I don't like is the static in the containers. The pieces attach to the top of the container until you open them and then little pieces go everywhere.<br /><br />The kit comes with a plastic tray with 12 small containers inside. Each container opens and closes with a screw-top lid. Be sure to set the container in something before opening it as the contents will go everywhere, especially the small things. The containers have beads, gemstones, and charms. There are also 3 small sheets of stickers included with the kit.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Makartt Nail Decoration Set to family and friends.",373,795
3.0,1637804836491,I think I clicked on the wrong polish.,This Simple Pleasures Kit is cute. I think I might have clicked on the wrong thing. This looks like a child's set.<br /><br />The kit includes two separate sets. One has a separator and 6 small bottles of polish. The other set has 4 larger bottles of the colors in the first set. This one has nail stickers included. These polishes are water-based and kid-friendly.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Simple Pleasures Kit to family and friends.,373,797
3.0,1637200808637,Instructions not included.,This Mini Nail Dust Collector is nice. I would have loved to have instructions included with the collector. I did go on the purchase page to see that I needed 2AA batteries. There is one part that I still don't know what it is for. I did a test and it did work and I am happy with that but instructions would have saved time.<br /><br />The box comes with the collector. It has two little tools include. On small brush and I don't know what the other thing is.<br /><br />I will be recommending this Mini Nail Dust Collector to family and friends.,373,798
1.0,1631820815569,I haven't found a place to buy replacement heads when needed.,"This Women Ultra Smooth Razor works well. It glides smoothly and cuts great. My problem is I don't see a place to buy replacement heads only razor blades. Instructions say to replace the blade every two months.<br /><br />The pack comes with a base, handle, and two razor heads. The razor heads have covers on them and they are magnetic. There are instructions but it does not say where you can buy replacement heads.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Women Ultra Smooth Razor to family and friends.",373,802
1.0,1629218016977,It is soft but doesn't work any better than other mitts.,This Silk Exfoliating Mitt is soft. I used the mitt on my face. I can not tell any difference between this mitt and any other mitts except that it is soft. No difference in the skin.<br /><br />The mitt fits the hand for cleaning. The resealable package comes with a mitt. It says 100% silk but I'm not sure I would agree with that.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this Silk Exfoliating Mitt to family and friends.,373,387
5.0,1623633511549,These work great!,These Daletu Nail Tip Clips work great. I put on the nail and then clipped it to my finger. It helped the nail stay in place while it dried. I think they will be good for other crafty things too.<br /><br />The clips are clear and they are not too tight on the fingers. They come individually packaged. Because they are clear it helps to get the clip in the correct place on the nail.<br /><br />I will be recommending these Daletu Nail Tip Clips to family and friends.,373,808
1.0,1623033973756,Bright red. Chapped my lips.,"This HEXZE-emoji the iconic brand Moisturizing Lip gloss is bright red. I have fair skin so this ""gloss"" made me look like a corpse. It is also supposed to be a moisturizer but it made my lips crack and peel. Not happy with this at all.<br /><br />The lip ""gloss"" comes in a little tube and you brush on the color. If you have a different skin type than mine you might like it but it did chap my lips. I would think twice before getting this product.<br /><br />I will not be recommending this HEXZE-emoji the iconic brand Moisturizing Lip gloss to family and friends.",373,809
5.0,1639987040377,Easy to Use,"I am very pleased with my experience using the Feminine Cleansing Wash. This is very easy to use in the shower as it has a hand pump. The scent is light and pleasant, yet doesn't leave a lingering perfumed odor. I have found that 'regular' soap does me no favors for cleaning my groin area as it's much to harsh for my lady bits. This is a great product to use for those of us that are mindful of our personal hygiene and want to be ready for any situation that comes up between showers. I find this to be a good value for the quality. I certainly will be making this wash a regular order in the future. I hope my experience is helpful as you kindly click the button below.",383,830
5.0,1632478192625,Beautiful Colors,"I am very happy with my order of the Gershion Pastel Gel Nail Polish Set. These are great to use as it's a nice and even texture. The colors are great for me to use under different stamps, stencils and with stencils for nail art. They also look great as plain colors under a glossy or matte topcoat. I find that it dries easily under my 36 watt lamp. I find this set to be a good value. I hope you find my experience helpful as you kindly click the button below.",383,832
4.0,1626349138206,Great for Washing Hands,"There are pros and cons to the Tirtyl Hand Soap Sheet Variety Pack. I found it difficult to get a decent lather from the sheets, even when using 2 or 3 at a time. This makes them less than ideal for bathing. However, I did get them to do a great job for cleaning just my hands. I would suggest them for cleaning hands while on the go. The scent is very light when added to water. A tin is included, which is a bit more durable than the paper envelopes. The tin slides open, matchbox style. I would recommend using the tin as it will withstand being transported in a pocket, purse or bag better than the paper envelopes. If you anticipate being exposed to rain, I would suggest to place the tin and/or envelopes into a plastic bag. Using water and friction is superior to using hand sanitizer, and with the soap sheets you will be able to maintain much cleaner hands while out and about.<br /><br />If you are looking for a portable soap for bathing, I would still suggest to use bar soap wrapped in wax paper inside a plastic bag. If you are in situations where you need to wash hands without soap provided, these are ideal for that need. I would recommend the soap sheets as they are easy to transport and cost effective for hand washing. I hope you find my experience helpful and kindly will click the button below.",383,207
3.0,1619168964723,Mixed Feelings,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about the Cuckoo Upgraded Eyelash Lift Kit. Primarily, the perm solution is really, really harsh. I cannot recommend the kit if this is the primary component of the kit you want. I would suggest looking elsewhere. On the other hand, the amount of glue rings, wands and microbrushes prove to be very useful to me. If you are after the accessories, then this is a fair value. I have no strong opinion about the pads or scrapers. Overall, this is not a product I would recommend, but if you are after the accessories in the kit, then I would say this is a decent kit to have those on hand. Thanks for reading, if my experience is helpful to you, please click the button below.",383,834
5.0,1618738844280,Great Set,"I'm happy with the Fog-free Dental Mirror and 4 Pieces of Stainless Steel Dental Pick. It's packaged securely and all the pieces were in excellent condition upon arrival. I visit my dentist often, but I sometimes need a little help to find rogue bits of debris in some of my teeth. The dental mirror is incredibly handy for that use. I also find the dental picks are better for me as hobby tools. I've never felt the need to scrap my own teeth to risk damage to surrounding tissues. They do a good job in tiny crevices and have a textured handle which is easy to hold. I find this set to be a good value and the versatile use is a great bonus for me.",383,782
5.0,1614125978911,Very Nice Set!,"The anmas rucci Acrylic Nail Art Tools Kit gives you a little bit of everything for making your nails, or even crafting creations several different options for creative expression. My favorite part of the set is the half-pearls and pixie beads, but all of the pieces are really pretty. The tape works well with my own adhesive I already had on hand. This is a really fun set and I'd recommend them to anyone that likes to get creative with their nail art!",383,835
5.0,1603750716714,Fantastic Value!,"The Butterfly Nail Art Decals Water Transfer Stickers bundle is a great deal. You get 22 full sheets of stickers. Each sheet has over 50 stickers as far as I've counted them. They are either multi-colored and halographic or metallic outlined patterns. Every sheet is a little different, so there are no repeats. They apply easily, but I highly recommend doing a base coat first and a coat on top as well. There are also 2 generously filled jars of holographic butterflies that measure 4mm by 4mm at the widest points. This is a really pretty collection of butterflies and I couldn't recommend them more for both the value and variety!",383,836
5.0,1610831769055,Nice set,"This is a very cute set. It comes with a lot. There were many different colors.  The girls really enjoyed it a lot.  Everything seemed to be good quality.

4.0,1626908591516,Decent set of brushes,I travel with these and they are pretty good. Not the ultimate in softness but they definitely don’t suck. They come in a thick travel bag that’s plastic and pretty fake feeling. Non on the bristles have fallen off and there is a good amount of brush sizes and shapes to choose from. *there is no spoolie with this set. ☹️,401,206
3.0,1614543207191,Average product,"Small travel size of so-so conditioner. Smells great and feels like it rinses out completely but as for conditioning? It just sort of works. So, nothing too special but it doesn’t suck.",401,884
5.0,1607766679738,Very invigorating!,"Great product. Made in USA and right upon opening, smells fresh and clean. Like lemons and sunshine. The ziplock bag seals so you can store upright maintain freshness.",401,885
5.0,1603024547462,This stuff is your friend!,"Wonderful lip balm. Creamy, not waxy and stayed put. Smells luscious and sweet. I feel like this hydrates for at least an hour too. No stinging upon application. The lids audibly ""clicks"" when closed so you know it shut. 45 spf too.",401,887
5.0,1602361342066,Extremely happy with this,"This serum is so very very good! Smells warm and woodsy in a way, not floral or soapy. Very viscous, medium-heavy. The dropper only dispenses about 4 drops, which is enough for face and neck. I use a roller after applying too, which I highly recommend. I'm happy with the glow and hydration my skin has. The longer I use it, the better my skin looks.",401,888
5.0,1596972059141,Happy with this,My 14 yo is using this set and she loves it. The mascara is a deep black and it doesn't flake off. She also has had no problems removing this product with just a wet makeup wipe.  The curler has rubber grips at the end so it is easy for her to hold and use. Very happy with this.,401,889
5.0,1596361831112,Very happy with results,"This masks works great! My hair is blonde and fine and tends to go brassy if not processed correctly. Using this mask is an easy way to freshen and brighten. Not too thick, almost whipped in texture. Totally moisturizes and rinses out without heavy residue.",401,439
5.0,1593636481145,Very nice brush,"Very decent bamboo toothbrush. Generally the bristles are too soft for me. This one is medium-soft. So at least it feels like my mouth is clean after brushing. Lightweight, no guilt. Even the packaging is made from recycled material. Great to have multi pack!",401,890
5.0,1593178632696,THE BEST BRONZER I'VE EVER USED,"This is such a high end product. The weighted compact feels sleek and heavy in your hand. The slide/pivot opening is clever and works smooth. The color saturation is rich and deep and looks flawless on many skin tones. Not too much shimmer, so it actually looks like you've been sun kissed after application. Buildable color if you want a more intense look. You can use both colors together, which is what I do. I am medium complexion, blonde, 48 years old. This product doesn't increase pores size, nor does it settle into any wrinkles. In my opinion, deserving of more than 5 stars.",401,891
5.0,1576950976082,Awesome product,"This stuff is wonderful. It's been a game changer for my hands this winter. There is very little scent. Which suprised me because it's filled with so many natural extracts like apple, lemon, carrot, aloe, grapefruit.  The directions suggest to put on before bed and slip cotton gloves on. I'm not planning on doing that because I'm not 80, but am still very impressed at how long my hands feel protected and moisturized.",401,95
3.0,1570467139954,Smells great! Works ok.,"There's not a lot of salt in here to make it exfoliate very well. That said, it moisturizes and hydrates beautifully. Everything dissolves and washes off completely and it smells so light and fresh!",401,895
5.0,1645538841735,Smells amazing and hypoallergenic.,"My daughter always wants to wear perfume, but her skin is so sensitive. When I saw this, I had to get it. It is hypoallergenic, so it even works well with sensitive skin. The smell is sweet lavender, and smells amazing! It is perfect to apply after bath time.",412,908
5.0,1621074811741,"Very moisturizing, but not greasy!","This 4 pack of travel lotions by Spanature is super nice, from the presentation of the product, to the performance of the product. They come packaged soooo nicely in 4 little gift boxes, so they are perfect for gift giving. Also, the tubes are the perfect size to fit in your purse- so they are great for on the go or even traveling!<br /><br />The lotion itself is very moisturizing, and not greasy at all. The green tea scent is not strong at all, which is perfect if you are sensitive to strong scents.",412,910
4.0,1601462568570,Practice makes perfect,"My wife has always wanted to try magnetic eyelashes, so she decided to give these a shot. They really do work! But, with these practice makes perfect.<br /><br />They come with 2 tubes of magnetic eyeliner (black), and 10 sets of eyelashes along with the application tool. When you apply the magnetic eyeliner, you have to be precise. The eyeliner is black, and will look very dark if you do too thick of a line. I would do thinner lines if possible, with about 2 layers so that the eyeliner is not overwhelming. Once the eyeliner dries, use the application tool to put the lashes on.<br /><br />It does feel a bit strange at first (if false lashes are new to you), and it may tickle around your eyes when you blink. But yes, these really work! With more practice my wife will get better at this.<br /><br />The only thing is that the magnetic eyeliner does not come off easily. You will need a good eye makeup remover to get this off as it’s waterproof!",412,912
5.0,1598100257381,Packaged so nicely and smell lovely!,"These bath bombs are great, especially for the price. You get 18 bath bombs in the box. The box looks like a gift box, so these would make a great gift for someone special! ❤️<br /><br />The bath bombs are scented with essential oils and are very moisturizing. Each bath bomb is wrapped in tissue paper and labeled. The packaging is just amazing!<br /><br />The scents are strong, so these may not work for you if you are sensitive to strong scents. I personally think they smell wonderful!",412,913
5.0,1596124000250,Sweet with a little bit of spice!,"My wife really likes this perfume by Shakira! It has a nice sweet scent, with a hint of spice. It’s an incredibly sexy scent that I love too! ❤️ It doesn’t last the whole day, however if you reapply in the afternoon, it does. The bottle is beautiful too! Just looks weird with my wife grabbing Shakira’s bod and spraying. 😂 We got a good laugh out of it!",412,75
5.0,1591874117611,Sanitizes without drying out hands!,"This hand sanitizer by Puretize is great. During the time of the pandemic, this is a must! It contains 70% alcohol, which is great to kill those nasty germs 🦠! It smells similar to rubbing alcohol, however it’s not too strong. I love this hand sanitizer as it doesn’t dry out my hands like others. Every family needs a bottle of this in their home!",412,85
4.0,1577153617349,Makes your skin feel baby soft!,My wife is very happy with this facial cleanser. It’s very moisturizing and makes her skin feel baby soft after using. It barely has a scent to it and it works great on her sensitive skin.,412,94

Just keep them in your fridge!,412,916
5.0,1646158077013,Fantastic hair mask that works,This is a great hair mask that helps protect your color treated hair. It contains some good ingredients that will nourish and hydrate your hair. It comes in a cute little jar and smells fantastic.<br /><br />The mask works very well. It doesn't change your hair color but enhances the life of your color and makes your hair look fantastic. It also helps prevent fading to some degree and makes my colored hair last longer. All in all very happy with this hair mask and I use this about once every week to 10 days.,447,959
4.0,1641830809541,Easy to use dip powder nail kit,This is a great little starter kit to do your own nails at home. It is a dip powder kit that is very easy to use and has everything you need to do your own nails. You don't even need an LED lamp to do your nails.<br /><br />It has amazing colors that I really like and is perfect for those who want to do their own nails. All in all really happy with this.,447,961
5.0,1641830467493,Great lip scrub,This is a nice lip scrub by Simply Dana. It tastes of coconut which I personally really like. It works very well helping to exfoliate the lips in a gentle manner.<br /><br />Especially in the winter my lips are rougher shape and need a little extra help and this gets the job done.,447,962
5.0,1641828237060,Amazing conditioner to add volume to your hair,"I admit it, I just love hair products by ikoo. For some reason these just really work for my hair.<br /><br />This one is a travel sized conditioner for fine, thin or flat hair and my hair really takes to it. I find it sad though that for this little one they are charging so much. You are much better of getting the regular size and putting that in a travel size container yourself.<br /><br />The conditioner itself smells amazing and I for one really love that. It is smooth and I let it usually work on my hair for like 3 to 5 minutes. The conditioner rinses out with ease and leaves my hair nice and soft. I find that my hair looks fantastic. It is nice and shiny, and it definitely gets a boost in volume, and just has a healthy look and feel to it.",447,884
5.0,1638025425471,Lovely lotion,This lotion is great. You get 4 smaller sized squeeze bottles of lavender fragranced hand and body lotion. It smells absolutely amazing first off which is one of the reasons these always come with me when I go somehwere. The second reason is they work. When I use them my skin feels fantastic. The lotion is creamy but lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin making my skin feel soft and hydrated. Very happy and for that price there really are no complaints.,447,964
4.0,1638024173344,Works well if used correctly (sparingly),"This sugar body scrub is amazing. It has an amazing fragrance which is what you will notice first when you open the jar. The scrub is a gentle exfoliator and works very well. It moisturizes as you go along and makes your skin feel soft and smooth. It does have oil in it so that is what makes your skin feel moisturized and you may feel greasy, my recommendation, don't use a ton of it when you use it and start with just a little bit which goes a long way.",447,965
4.0,1630083162331,"Very  nice essence, very toner like","This is a very nice serum. It has sedum extract in it which is supposed to help adding hydration to the skin, which in turn adds firmness and elasticity. It has a low molecular hyaluronic acid which helps adding moisture to the skin and is meant for daily treatment of your face.<br /><br />It has a mild fragrance only and is nice and fresh. I for one do like it quite a bit. This is more like a toner and you use it quite similarly to one. Pour some of it on a cotton pad and gently pad the essence onto your skin until it is fully absorbed.<br /><br />I find it absorbs quickly into the skin. It feels a tad sticky at first but that quickly goes away. My skin does feel nicely moisturized when I use this so I do like this quite a bit. This is a lovely product.",447,709
5.0,1627916483206,Spa treatment at home,This is an interesting product for sure. You get a jar with cream that looks very cute in my eyes but that is not all. You also get a multi-care massage applicator that has red light to treat your skin.<br /><br />The cream itself has a lovely fragrance that I really like. It is creamy yet lightweight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. You can then use the multi-care massage applicator and use it to massage the cream into the skin as a special treat really but it also just works the cream better into the skin. Work the cream from the center to the outside and massage for about 3 minutes. Then make sure to clean the applicator.<br /><br />I have to say this is a special way to apply your cream and makes it more like a spa treatment than anything else and really works quite well. The cream has a lot of good ingredients and together this is fantastic. I for one love this and can only recommend it. When you are out of cream you can just get the refill pack without the massager which is great. The price for this was very reasonable as well. All in all very happy with this and it makes for a fantastic gift!,447,969
5.0,1627907216622,Another great product by Huxley,"I really like products by Huxley. They tend to be not overpriced and the quality that I found to date is always very good. They always come in packaging that is stylish and looks good.<br />this clay mask is just along the lines and I for one even though clay masks tend to dry out my skin, really like this one.<br /><br />It looks great and this one smells fantastic, one of the things I really like about Huxley products. This clay mask really cleans my skin beautifully and does not dry it out too much. I have normal skin and it does dry it out a little bit but since I always use a good moisturizer afterwards it is not a big deal.<br /><br />Make sure you follow the instruction, clean your face, apply an even layer and let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. I let it get pretty dry before I rinsed it off with lukewarm water. My skin felt great and was nice and soft after I used this mask. I for one can only recommend this one.",447,430
5.0,1623933204043,Interesting cream,"This is an interesting kind of cream. The jar it comes in is very cute. It is a frosted glass jar with some cute print on it that just looks really cute to be honest and I like displaying it in my bathroom. Inside this jar you find a very interesting cream, a water gel cream that I haven't really come across yet and really have to say is neat and interesting. I love using this especially on a hot summer day because it is very refreshing. It is even better yet if you put the cream in the fridge to cool it down, because it feels even more refreshing.<br /><br />This cream absorbs really quickly into the skin. It has a fantastic fragrance of lavender that I am a huge fan of. It is fantastic especially in the evening because it just has a very calming effect on top of the refreshing feel of it. It leaves a slight tack residue on the skin but that goes away in about 5 to 10 minutes, so no big deal. I for one really like this one and it hits every aspect that it should. I use this in the evening and like how my skin looks and feels in the morning. All in all very happy and this is one of the ones I see myself reaching for more often than not.",447,431
5.0,1623767406253,Very nice under eye patches,"In this jar you get 30 pairs of marine algae eye patches. The jar is quite pretty and will look good in any bathroom. The eye patches smell great and are rather soothing to be honest. However I have to say paying $24, much cheaper than their green tea version.<br /><br />These work quite nicely and I do really like them. I do like how soothing these are and use them when my under eye area is puffy or is very dark and seems like I have been put through the ringer. These feel even better if you keep them in the fridge, they then have an even more cooling effect.<br /><br />All in all I do really like them, so I will get these instead of their green tea ones from now on.",447,77
4.0,1623762919013,"Nice product, seems to work well","This is a nice serum by Easydew that comes in a dropper bottle. In it is a DW-EGF protein. It is basically a youth protein that helps your skin with collagen and elastin, basically helps your skin stay soft, smooth, and just look great.<br /><br />This serum is a light to medium consistency that absorbs quickly into the skin. It doesn't leave any kind of residue on the skin, it is maybe a bit tacky at first but that goes away quickly. I am not prone to reactions to these kinds of products and didn't have any in this case either.<br /><br />I found this was a great moisturizer and my skin looked soft and smooth overall. This is a nice product and I am satisfied overall. It is also reasonably priced at just $30.",447,970

You get a massive bottle of this shampoo that comes in a convenient bottle with a pump dispenser on the top, which personally I prefer since it makes it so much easier to use in the shower especially. The shampoo itself smells very nice, which is a big plus in my eyes.<br /><br />It lathers up very nice and cleanses your with ease. Once you are done the shampoo rinses out quite quickly without any issues. The hair feels nice and clean and I for one am quite happy. This is a pretty good deal and I for one am happy with this.",447,972
4.0,1618753807681,Works very well,This is a neat little curling iron that does the work for you really. I have tried some different types of curling irons over the year and wanted something easy and simple to use. My hair is quite long these days and when you have longer hair it gets a little bit more complicated I found. So I wanted to give this one a chance and see how it goes. There is definitely a slight learning curve but watch the video and off you go.<br /><br />The temperature adjustment is at the handle and is very easy to use by rotating it. The tip is insulated so you can actually touch it which is a nice added touch in my eyes. There is also an adjustment that lets you switch if it turns left or right when making the curls so you can switch that as well depending on which way you want your curls to go. It comes with 3 different barrels that lets you change the type of curls you get.<br /><br />I found it works quite well and is easy to use. I had no issues with my long hair because it has the long barrel to accommodate all my hair and actually curl it all. All in all I am quite happy with this.,447,974
3.0,1615147181670,Just an average brush,This brush fits nicely into the hand but I find that the bristles are pretty soft. If you have a tangled beard this will struggle a bit to get through it to be honest. Also if you have a coarse beard this also may struggle quite a bit. For shorter beards this will work quite well. All in all I find it is overpriced for what you are getting and find it just to be average.,447,975
4.0,1615144871993,Nice lightweight cream,This is a nice cream by Simply Dana. It comes in a simple yet elegant glass jar. The cream itself has a pleasant but mild fragrance. The cream itself is very creamy and lightweight. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving behind any residue.<br /><br />The skin feels soft and smooth when you use this cream. I for one like how my skin feels when I use this. It looks nice and just feels moisturized. All in all for a lower priced cream this is not a bad choice.,447,976
5.0,1615041463456,Neat eye crayons,"These crayon eyeshadow sticks are interesting. It definitely takes a little getting used to, to work with them but once you get the hang of them they are a nice way to add color to your eye lids.<br /><br />On one side they have the color crayons and on the other side you have a little brush that helps you work in the eye color. In this set you get 6 beautiful colors in the purple scheme which is great. The colors are pretty rich in pigment and they blend quite nicely. All in all I am quite happy with this and for $12 this is not a bad price at all. It is an easy way to create an eye look with just one or two of these.",447,977
5.0,1612720071739,Fantastic firming cream,"I admit, I am a fan of Maelys products. They just know how to do cosmetics right. This Neck & Decollete Firming Cream is fantastic. It comes in a beautiful frosted glass jar that looks great on every bathroom shelf. Inside of it is this amazing smelling firming cream that you will be thankful you got.<br /><br />This cream is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. Once it is absorbed it leaves no residue behind. Instead the skin just feels soft and smooth. My skin feels and looks amazing, exactly what I am asking a product like this to do.

5.0,1611411190255,"Very nice set, makes for a great gift too","In this pack you get 7 masks for just over $42, so these run you for over $6 a masks. These are on the more expensive side of the spectrum but not yet the most expensive ones I have tried. This is an interesting set of masks that provides you with 6 different types of masks and a double for the hydrating type. You get 2 hydrating masks, one brightening, one clarifying, one anti-oxidant, one exfoliating and one renewal mask. These masks should really cover all you need which is great. They are free of toxins, so no parabens, phthalates, silicones, mineral oil and castor oils. In addition they are biodegradable which is great.<br /><br />These are some nice masks that fit quite nicely and have a good amount of serum on them. I found that they actually have a nice pleasant fragrance that does differ from mask to mask based on the ingredients.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 20 to 30 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. The fit of the mask is very nice so no complaints there. Overall my face felt and looked great after I used it. Being able to address different issues with these different masks in nice, however I didn’t really see that much of an improvement with just one mask to be honest. But my face did feel great after I used these masks since they were nicely hydrated and felt refreshed after each use.",447,979
5.0,1611410267342,Great sheet masks that works wonders for your face,"In this pack you get 3 masks for $18, so this is one on the more expensive face sheet masks that I have tried. I like that it is biodegradable since we really should do more for our environment so I find this to me a big plus. This mask has some very nice ingredients in it like Vitamin C that is from pineapple and others. It is free of parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, gluten, formaldehyde and vegan friendly.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 15 to 20 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. My face was a bit sticky afterwards but that feeling did go away after about  minutes or so. The serum in the mask had a pleasant smell that I did like a lot. My face felt nicely moisturized when I used this mask and looked great. All in all this is a great mask I just wish it was not as expensive to be honest since it is not on the cheap sice to be used weekly.",447,980
5.0,1609093886864,Beautiful for every occasion,"In this pack for just over $7 you get 3 different colored hair clips and 2 each color, and then 7 hair ties. The hair clips are gold, silver and black and just beautiful. The hair ties are a plain black. These hair clips are a different, new design and  I wasn’t sure if they would work for my hair, but fear not they did. I have long, but thin hair, thin in density and thin in thickness and this hair clip worked just fine. I had no issues gathering just a section or the entire hair together. Even though the clips are flat in the front I had no issues at all working with these, they are actually quite easy to work with and fit quite comfortably in the hair. The size is big enough to fit my entire hair or just parts of it. They are cute and lovely and the price is not excessive, they are actually inexpensive if you ask me.",447,242
5.0,1609093817595,Very cute and work well,"In this pack for just over $7 you get 3 different colored hair clips and 2 each color, and then 7 hair ties. The hair clips are light blue, a copper and a brown and just beautiful. The hair ties are a light brown, kind of not a great color to be honest but oh well didn’t get these clips for the ties.<br /><br />These hair clips are a different, new design and  I wasn’t sure if they would work for my hair, but fear not they did.

2.0,1609081249231,"Doesn't lather, smells bad and doesn't clean","I have no idea how anyone can make a body wash with mango wrong, but they did and it is such a letdown. This one is one of the worst body washes I have ever use and it was such a disappointment, I don’t think I will even use up the rest of the bottle. I like that it comes in a convenient pump dispenser bottle but that and the price are about all I like about this product.<br /><br />The body wash smells horrible and I found it really doesn’t cleanses at all. I actually had a lipstick stain on the back of my hand that I wanted to get rid of and it could NOT get rid of it, like come one really? I don’t think getting rid of a lipstick is that difficult, any kind of soap or cream based product can do it but this body wash could not. I was not sure if I was even clean using this so I had to use something else on the important parts of the body just to make sure.<br /><br />Even at $5 this is not worth it since it doesn’t even smell great. This is a complete failure and I can’t recommend this at all, sorry I just can’t. At least you know it is super mild since it doesn’t even attack dirt.",447,727
4.0,1608657012284,"Good basic oils, many uses","You get 2 massive bottles of oil, one with sweet almond oil and the other with coconut oil. For each bottle they supply you with a pump dispenser which is great. It makes it so much easier to dispense the oil without making a mess to be honest. Both oils are claimed to be organic which is nice. This will run you $25 which in my eyes is a good deal.<br /><br />These oils can be used direct for skin care and as carrier oils, meaning you can add some essential oils to them to make your own custom oil blends. The oils themselves were pretty much fragrance-free which was a bit disappointing to me, but makes sense since these are often used as carrier oils. When you use this they are pretty lightweight and absorb quickly. I found they do leave the skin a bit greasy, but that is not a surprise since these are oils. That feeling does go away within about 15 minutes or so, so not too bad. All in all a good deal",447,140
4.0,1608652151919,"Cute set of lipsticks, makes a great gift too","This set of lipsticks is such a gimmick but man I really like them. They are meant to look like a box of cigarettes and the 4 lipsticks are actually pretty small, also meant to look like little cigarettes. This set of 4 will run you about $10 which is not a bad deal to be honest.<br /><br />The little bullet style lipsticks all have very similar tones to be honest but are just different enough that you can distinguish them. They are very easy to apply and you can get a nice pointy application with them which is great. They are surprisingly smooth and creamy and have a good taste to them. They have a pretty good staying power, again it was a bit surprising to be honest. They wear not bad in the waterproof department but did wear off a bit on cups and mugs.<br /><br />All in all I was impressed by these and think these would make for a great little gag gift, especially for young adults dabbling into makeup but also for others as well that are looking for a lipstick that goes well into the purse and gives them options.",447,983
2.0,1607872522307,Hair looked and felt bad,"When I received this leave-in conditioner I was a bit confused. I expected to receive a pump dispenser but when I got the product it was in a jar. I have to admit I was a bit disappointed since I do prefer the pump dispenser but oh well, just wish they would actually show the real product to be honest. The leave-in conditioner itself smells fantastic so that is a huge plus.<br /><br />When you then dip into the jar to get some of the conditioner out, it is actually pretty thin and runny, which was quite a surprise to me to be honest. Taking a leave-in conditioner out of a jar is a bit of a challenge to be honest. Doing a pump or two is just so much easier. I found that this conditioner left a residue on my hair that I did not care for. It also weighed my hair down that just was undesirable as well. I for one am not a huge fan of this one and can’t recommend this conditioner, I just don’t like it sadly because my hair just didn’t look good, nor felt great. At least it is not expensive and it may work for others but this just didn’t work for me at all.",447,985
5.0,1606661625081,Amazing facial oil,"Dr. Au Anti Aging Face Oil took me a little bit by surprise to be honest. This is a very nice retinol oil that has quickly become one of my favorites. It comes in a little dropper bottle. It has a very mild and very pleasant fragrance that I really like a lot. It lingers for a bit and I wish it would linger a lot longer than it does to be honest. I can’t figure out what it smells like but I really like the mix of it. This contains retinyl palmitate, related to retinol. Remember, whenever you use retinol you want to make sure to protect your skin from the sun since retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. However retinol is very good for your skin.<br /><br />This face oil is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave your skin slightly oily but to me that is ok since I am using a face oil. I prefer to use this at night for two reasons, one because my face is a bit oily for a while when using it and also because retinol containing products do make your skin more sensitive to the sun. When I use this product my skin feels always super soft and smooth and looks nicely moisturized. There are little specs in it that look like gold and I am not sure if it is that or something else but when I use this facial oil my skin has this natural glow to it that I really like. This oil is fantastic and is quickly becoming one of my go to facial oils.",447,728
5.0,1606489523614,Favorite face wash,"I am quickly becoming a fan of products from EasyDew. This cleanser comes in a very nice pump dispenser. When you use it you will first notice that it has a lotion like consistency which is unusual for cleansers. Next you will notice the incredible fragrance it has that I absolutely love, especially for facial products fragrances are very important to me and this one is fantastic.<br /><br />This cleanser is super gentle I found. After I am done my skin feels soft and smooth and not dried out at all. It actually feels almost like I moisturized it. I do still follow up with a moisturizer but you could do without one if you were in a rush.",447,732
5.0,1606485448234,Fantastic face mask,"This is a very nice sheet face mask. When you open the package the mask is loaded with the mask which is nice, but it is not dripping which you don’t want. You notice the fantastic fragrance of the mask, very strong of honey which I love. It is very smooth and smells incredible in my eyes.<br /><br />The material of the sheet is very nice and soft. I found it is a bit big however so it does take some adjustment to be honest to make it fit. I do prefer that over a mask being too small however. Make sure to clean your face prior to using it, just like the instructions say. You leave it on for 10 to 20 minutes and then remove it. Any residual serum is just gently massaged into the skin.<br /><br />I found that my skin loves this mask. It feels nice and soft, smooth and just looks nicely moisturized. It has a natural glow to it that says I did something good for it. It does feel a bit sticky for about 5 minutes right after, but that goes away and then you are left with soft and smooth skin. In this box, that btw is perfect as a gift as well, you get 10 masks for just $24, which I think is a very good price and allows you to do something good for your skin for some time.",447,987
4.0,1605234134010,Very nice moisturizer,"This intensive moisturizer by Easydew is a very nice cream and runs you $45. I would still consider this a mid-range priced product for the quantity you are getting. It comes in a simplistic looking squeeze tube, that almost looks medicinal in my eyes.<br /><br />The cream has a very pleasant fragrance that I personally really like. The cream itself is a medium weight in my eyes and does take a little bit to absorb into the skin fully. It does leave a slight greasy residue on the skin that takes some time to fully disappear. Because of this I would recommend this as an evening cream because you wouldn’t want to apply foundation over it, nor would you want to wear a face mask all day while having that on your skin. I found that products like this make me sweat quite heavily under face masks.<br /><br />I use this in the evenings and do find that in the morning my skin looks nicely moisturized, is soft and smooth. So it does look exactly as I would expect it to with this kind of product. To achieve all this you really don’t need that much of the product either which is great because it is not the cheapest product, however also not the most expensive either. All in all I do really like this but only like using this in the evening.",447,736

They also have the matching body lotion and all. The body wash comes in a generous bottle that has a pump dispenser on the top that makes it very easy to use especially when you are in the shower.<br /><br />The body wash has a nice fragrance that is very pleasant. It does linger while you are in the shower but once you are all rinsed off, sadly it doesn’t last too long after that. The body wash does produce a decent lather but sadly it is not too luxurious. All in all for the price that you are paying, which is less than $15, this is a pretty nice find.",447,296
5.0,1605106767486,Lovely moisturizer for wrinkles,"This FillUp by EasyDew is a great cream that I personally really like a lot. First of it comes in a stunning squeeze tube that has a one of those interesting tips for a more concentrated spot application. This pretty silver tube will look great on any bathroom shelf really. It is meant for spot treatment for wrinkles and contains hyaluronic acid to help with that with lots of moisture to be added to the skin but other ingredients as well to help with all of that.<br /><br />This cream has a very nice but mild fragrance that I do like. The cream is very lightweight. That tip allows precise spot application to where you want and need to put it and allows small application of the product. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. I found that my skin is soft and smooth when I use this. It looks great, moisturized and just overall great. It is also not very expensive less than $25 so for me this one is a winner.",447,735

But that changed rather quickly and I was impressed on how my face felt. It felt smooth and soft and just looked nicely moisturized. I for one really liked how this emulsion makes my face feel.

It is easiest to use cotton pads to use this toner with so that seems to work the best.<br /><br />The toner has a mild but pleasant fragrance. That scent does not linger though. It seems that this toner is very mild. I have had no reactions to it. It felt moisturizing and did not dry out my skin. I do find this to be maybe a bit overpriced though to be honest at $31.",447,989

3.0,1602949942017,Nice moisturizer,"This is an above average moisturizer by Black Wolf. You get a fairly small white squeeze bottle that contains the moisturizer. You don’t need a lot of the product when you use it. It has a very nice and lovely fragrance that I do like and is fairly gender neutral, but I think it is definitely more appropriate for men than women.<br /><br />The moisturizer is lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave a greasy feeling on the skin though that takes some time to dissipate. Because of that I would recommend this for evening use. It is very moisturizing though so I am happy with that. My skin did look and feel great once the product was completely absorbed into the skin and the sticky feeling was gone. It is fairly inexpensive at just below $20.",447,646

This particular blend is supposed to be brightening, soothing, regenerating, purifying and reduce the appearance of dullness.

They recommend to use it morning and night, however in my experience when you use this it does absorb fairly quickly. It does leave an oily residue on your skin though. If you wear makeup and especially right now with wearing masks, I would not recommend applying this facial oil in the morning. For a makeup application that could cause trouble and I found with facial oils I sweat heavily when wearing masks.<br /><br />It provided some moisture but I didn’t really see a brightening effect to be honest, however I did feel that my skin felt oily which is why I prefer using this in the evening.

In my eyes not really since I have other moisturizers that do the same thing and cost a fraction of this oil while not making my face greasy.",447,993
4.0,1601827045452,"Nice, but not my favorite fragrance and a bit overpriced","This is an expensive facial moisturizer at $60. It comes in a little squeeze tube that has a pump dispenser opening, which are personally my favorite because I think these are just too neat. They claim  a visibly smoothing of wrinkles which I personally can’t say that I have seen happening.<br /><br />This moisturizer is light to medium weight and absorbs pretty quickly into the skin. It leaves some residue on the skin. That residue does go away within I would say 15 minutes or so. It has a decent fragrance that reminds me of essential oils, probably because it contains hemp and some other ingredients that would fall into that category that have that kind of fragrance. The scent leaves pretty quickly though.<br /><br />My skin feels nicely moisturized but I didn’t feel like it really did much for wrinkles to be honest. So I can recommend this for a moisturizer but not really for a wrinkle remedy. Downside, it is pretty expensive and I have moisturizers that are less expensive and also have a better fragrance.",447,738
3.0,1601819843429,"Tiny bottles, not a fan of the fragrance, overpriced","I have always been a fan of Taya hair products. I found though that this duo is not one of my favorites. In this pack you get a shampoo and conditioner that are basically travel size for $14. They are a bit bigger than you would get at a hotel for example so you get quite a few applications out of them, but for $14 I find this to be rather expensive to be honest.<br /><br />The bottles are pretty cute and look nice. When I used the shampoo I have to say I was disappointed by the fragrance. Usually this line has a fantastic fragrance but this one just wasn’t it. It produced a decent lather and rinsed out with ease. The conditioner had a similar fragrance in line with the shampoo. It was nice and soft and I did leave it in my hair for about 3 minutes I would say. It was easy to rinse out and left no residue on my hair. My hair overall looked ok once it was dry and was pretty soft but nothing impressive that would warrant spending $14 on this. I am sorry I just wasn’t impressed with this set, especially since you can get the full sized ones for a similar price really.",447,250
5.0,1601012103409,Incredible hair serum - just everything right about it,"This is a fantastic Leave-in hair serum. It is not too expensive at $25 since you get a nice sized bottle and you really don’t need a lot of this serum when you use it. You then distribute this serum in your hair and when you do that you notice the incredible fragrance of this serum. It is probably my FAVORITE fragrance in my hair products. Its this amazing mix of tropical fruit and this something that is just amazing! It is hard to try out other things when all I want it is this one.<br /><br />It comes in this easy to use pump dispenser and you just do a couple of pumps and distribute that in your palms. Then distribute all then evenly into your hair that is either wet or damp. Your hair is easy to brush through at that point, not a tangle in sight. Once my hair was dry it was soft, light and shiny. Everything it promised it would do. My hair just looked amazing and felt soft.  I love this product, it smells amazing, my hair looks incredible with lots of shine and lift to it, and it just feels amazing, soft and smooth. I can’t say enough good things about this!",447,995
4.0,1601006929046,Very rich and moisturizing - thick cream,"This is an interesting face mask. You get 5 masks for $20 so an ok price, maybe slightly more expensive than usual. You apply this mask to a clean face like you always do.  When you open the package you find 2 masks in it, they split the mask up into 2, the top and bottom.<br /><br />This mask is the first cream mask I have ever used. You will first notice the pleasant scent, the reason I ordered this in the first place. I have a serum by Abib that I love and has an incredible fragrance so I figured this one has to be a great product. This mask feels kind of weird on your face because of the cream. It reminds me a bit of nivea cream to be honest, fragrance wise and thickness / consistency wise. So after the 20 minutes are up you take it off and realize there is still a lot of cream on your face. So you gently massage it into your skin. My face felt a bit sticky from all that extra cream to be honest. After about 20 minutes or so that feeling did start to fade, that is just how long it took for all of it to absorb. This is one rich cream I tell you.  My face was nicely moisturized though and it definitely had a bit of a glow from all that cream to it to be honest.<br /><br />All in all this is a nice mask, but maybe a bit too rich for me. I think this would do wonders when your skin is super dry, like on a horrible winter day when you have been outside in the wind all day and your skin is almost peeling off from the cold dry wind. This would restore it back to health. Right now my skin is just a bit too healthy I would say and this one would just be so much better when my skin is in dire need.",447,319
5.0,1600561023047,Amazing shampoo that smells great and leaves my hair nice and soft,"I really like this shampoo by Giovanni. I was not sure what to expect to be honest, but I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of time when these shampoos contain tea tree and hemp their fragrance is not the greatest, but this one was shockingly impressive and really good. The fragrance of this one was actually really good and you can barely smell the tea tree which is great. I only smelled hints of it while it was on my hair.<br /><br />This shampoo produces a nice lather that wasn’t too rich but plenty to get my hair nice and clean. I didn’t feel like I needed a lot of it to get my hair nice and clean. I did let it sit for a couple of minutes to let it do “its thing”.  It rinsed out very easily and left nothing behind in my hair. My hair felt nice and clean and looked great. I followed up with a leave-in conditioner afterward still but my hair could have handled not using one after this shampoo. All in all I am very happy with this one and can recommend it.",447,315
5.0,1600560382598,Moisturizes as promised and mattifies beautifully,"I have used a few products by Follain to this date so I was curious to see how this mattifying moisturizer would perform. It comes in a little pump dispenser. It is on the more inexpensive side of the spectrum. The design is in line with the rest of the product line. The moisturizer is pretty much fragrance free, it maybe has a hint of a fragrance that is pleasant but very subtle.<br /><br />The moisturizer itself is very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. You can instantly notice the difference between where you put it and where you didn’t. It mattifies the skin nicely and really neutralizes the oils in your skin nicely. I was rather impressed by that to be honest. My skin looked great, nice and matte but still moisturized. It felt smooth to the touch but looked good. All in all I was pretty impressed and liked how my face felt and looked when I use this moisturizer.",447,438
4.0,1600554093512,Great baby oil for young and old,"This is a nice baby bath oil by Emilia. I like that it has organic ingredients since babies tend to be more sensitive still. It is itch-free and hypoallergenic as well. It also has oatmeal extract in it which is known to be soothing.<br /><br />It has a pleasant scent reminiscent of clean baby in my eyes. When you use this the skin feels moisturized afterwards without having used a moisturizer. But the skin does not feel greasy or oily which is great since I am not a fan of that feeling.  You also don’t need to use a lot of this in order to get the benefits of the product. And yes I admit, I actually like using this on myself. It just makes my skin feel great and look fantastic.",447,267
5.0,1599355741726,Works surprisingly well and smells great,"This is the first natural deodorant that has actually worked for me. It contains no aluminum or any other other ""chemical"" ingredients. It is baking soda and some other natural ingredients and I have to say this one actually works.<br /><br />It has a very pleasant fragrance of lavender that I really like and is the reason I choose this one in particular. That fragrance lingers for quite some time. It works very well protecting from sweat and odor. I was pleasantly surprised how well it actually worked. The price for this is reasonable and in line with another leading natural aluminum free deodorant.",447,998
4.0,1598750420635,Nice smelling shampoo with mediocre lather,This is a very nice shampoo. You get a huge bottle for just $16 containing argan oil which is great for your hair. I like that this bottle has a pump dispenser which makes it just so much easier to dispense the shampoo in the shower.<br /><br />The shampoo has a very pleasant scent that I like a lot. It produces only a medium lather but it still works quite well to clean your hair. I personally prefer a nice rich lather with my shampoos. It rinses out very easily and leaves you with squeaky clean hair. My hair looked good when I used this and I have no complaints there. All in all this is a very nice inexpensive shampoo containing argan oil which I do like for my hair.,447,142
5.0,1598742055944,Fantastic detangler,"I really like products from L'ange. This leave in conditioner is no different. It is not cheap at $22 since the bottle is fairly small but the product in it is very good and you don't need a whole lot of it so that does make up for it.<br /><br />This leave in detantler comes in a nice mister bottle. The mister on it is actually very nice and pretty fine allowing you to distribute the product very nicely onto your hair, and therefore you don't need that much of it. It smells absolutely fantastic and does exactly what it promises. I have absolutely not tangles in my hair when I use this.<br /><br />My hair is nice and soft and looks just great. This is a great product to you use for your hair. When dry my hair is still very manageable and looks great. I really like this a lot and what it does to my hair.",447,1001
4.0,1597707056490,Very nice shimmer,"This is a nice shimmer. You get a fairly generous container with this shimmer. It is best applied with your finger but will work with a brush as long as you wet it either with water or better with a setting spray to be honest. Make sure when you apply it that you put it in place where you want it. Going over it again tends to make a mess of it.<br /><br />The color is beautiful and I do really like that. It is very pigmented so that is good, just really load up and apply because if you go back and forth it just makes a mess and can flake off.",447,1003
3.0,1597624721289,Left my face greasy and was completely scentless,"This is a very expensive  facial oil at $79. It comes in a dark glass bottle to protect the oil inside from light from degradation. The oil itself is applied using a dropper like most really. It is completely scentless which is disappointing but will work well for people sensitive to scents.<br /><br />They claim that it will not leave you with a greasy after feel, well I am not sure what they are talking about. It absorbs quickly but I definitely had a greasy residue on my skin and that stuck with me. I would recommend using this in the evenings only because of this. You wouldn't want to wear a face mask with this greasy feel on your face. You already sweat a lot in those masks and this would make you feel even worse in them. As an overnight moisturizing treatment this does work well though.<br /><br />But would I repurchase at this price? No way, there are other much nice products out there especially at that price.",447,317
5.0,1597587337023,None drying face masks that smells amazing,"I have a few products by Higher Education and like the majority of them. This clay mask is fantastic. It comes in a squeeze tube which makes it easy to dispense how much of it you need. They tell you to apply it liberally to your clean skin. When you do that you will notice that fantastic fragrance this has which is great since you will have this on your face for 15 to 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />During that time it will dry out and harden. Once the time is up rinse it warm water. I prefer to do these masks before I go into the shower so I can just rinse them when I am in the shower, so much easier and less of a mess if you ask me.<br /><br />Once you are done you will notice that your skin eels actually nice and soft. A lot of these clay masks tend to dry up your skin but I was impressed that this one did not. It actually felt almost moisturized but I still followed it up with a nice moisturizer right after I was done like I always do.<br /><br />I have to say this clay mask is great. It smells fantastic, is nice and gentle and does not dry you out. There are not a lot of clay masks out there that I do like because most dry my skin out but this one is fantastic.",447,1004
5.0,1596076665278,My face feels amazing when I use this!,"This facial serum by Dr. Denese is one of the best serums I have used in some time. It comes in a stunning looking dropper bottle. Sadly it does not have a scent but I will look past that. It is also not a cheap serum to be honest but I think this one is worth it.<br /><br />The serum has an oil like consistency and is clear. With the dropper you can apply just a few drops, which is all you need to each side of your face. The serum is very lightweight and it absorbs very quickly into your face and just literally disappears into your skin. It leaves absolutely no residue behind which is odd because it has a real oil like consistency so I expected an oily residue on my skin. Instead I was left with super soft and smooth skin that just felt and looked fantastic. And that is why I just really like this so much.",447,1005
5.0,1596026312471,"Love it, oriental scent that is very similar to LouLou","This is a very nice perfume. It is not too expensive since it is less than $40 which is great. When I got it and sprayed it on I had instant flashbacks of another perfume that I really like. It is very reminiscent of LouLou and when I looked up the fragrance profile for both there is a lot of overlap of the similar top, heart and base notes.<br /><br />I found that this one in comparison is a bit less heavy though and not as overpowering. It has a very oriental kind of scent though and I do really like it, ask LouLou, since it is standing right next to it on my perfume shelf. I figured that was the proper space for it. This one does have a hint of lightness though that LouLou does not. It does last quite a bit and does not just disappear after a few hours which is nice.<br /><br />The bottle is very cute and oh so Shakira in my eyes. It is perfect for teens if you ask me but I have no problem putting that on my shelf either. So to keep the comparison going, at the same volume it is cheaper than LouLou but if you get the 2.7 Fl Oz you pay the same price as you would for the 1.7 Fl Oz for LouLou so you could get a better deal but even though they are similar there are just different enough that I can smell the difference if I do a blind test.",447,75
3.0,1595710638513,"Overpriced, doesn't smell like argan oil and to me just about average",This Argan oil is just above around in my eyes. For the $13 you get a fairly small amount of this oil in my eyes. I know Argan oil is not cheap but this does seem a bit overpriced. I am used to argan oil having a pleasant scent but this one was a complete let down and was borderline not pleasant.<br /><br />When you use the oil and apply it to your skin it is pretty lightweight so that statement is correct. It does feel nice on your skin and absorbs pretty quickly but does leave a slight oily feel behind for a short time and that does disappear. At that point my skin felt nice but there are other products I have that make my skin feel a lot better to be honest and give it an amazing smell to boot. So keeping all this in mind I find this just around average.,447,1007
4.0,1595293910508,"Great mascara that improves your eye lashes for length, sadly not for thickness","This is a pretty nice mascara. It comes in a very nice container that looks great. The wand is a very thin and long wand that makes it easy to apply this mascara to your eye lashes.<br /><br />When you apply this mascara make sure you let it dry properly. Once it is dry, it is definitely smudge and waterproof, no doubt about it but until then you can create a mess if you are not careful.<br /><br />I found that I didn't necessarily get thicker eye lashes when I used them but they definitely looked longer. There was no clumping or flaking which was good. I had no negative reaction to this mascara and my eyes were happy. All in all this is a good one, great for length but no real improvement in regards to thickness.",447,1008
5.0,1595077755650,"Smells amazing, gentle and doesn't dry out your skin","This is a fantastic cleanser by Higher Education. It comes in a very nice squeeze tube that is nice and simple but has a very clean design in line with this product line. The cleanser smells fantastic very refreshing and really amazing, one of my favorites that I have.<br /><br />The cleanser does not produce a heavy lather but I don't really need that. It feels very nice on the face and cleanses gently away anything from your face. It then rinses of nice and easy and you don't have to keep going over it over and over again like some cleansers which is nice.<br /><br />When you are done your face doesn't feel like you have stripped it of all its moisture which is great. It actually still feels pretty moisturized. I still follow it up with my standard moisturizing routine but I didn't feel it was really necessary which was nice so if you forgot your face won't be hurting for it. This is a fantastic cleanser that feels great on the skin and smells amazing, everything I look for in a daily moisturizer especially since it didn't strip my face of its moisture.",447,1010
2.0,1594395709227,"Interesting concept, way overpriced and fell short in my eyes","This is an interesting concept. You get 15 bubble pads in this container. Each pad is dry though when you get them. You can actually slip your fingers into the pad which makes it easier to use these pads. With these pads you can exfoliate so that is in theory nice but I found in execution it just didn't work as well. The pads didn't have a pleasant scent, well they were actually rather scentless so to me that was rather boring.<br /><br />So when you use them you wet the pads and then clean your face with them. I found that there wasn't as many bubbles as I would have expected from a ""bubble pad"" so that to me was disappointing. They overall cleaned my face ok and I found they didn't dry out my face too much. All in all these worked ok but I wasn't too impressed. You can get a bottle of a nice cleanser for the same price or maybe more but that will last you a lot more than just 15 applications! so to me this is way overpriced and a bit of a waste to be honest.",447,1012
5.0,1593574484102,Love this one!,"Oh my, now this is a very nice moisturizer by Higher Education. Even though I am not a fan of skin products coming in jars, this jar is just plain beautiful. This gold digger moisturizer smells amazing and I can't really figure out what it is, but it is the mix of cucumber and melon which is always a winning combination. It contains collagen and hyaluronic acid which are fantastic ingredients for your skin.<br /><br />The cream is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. It leaves no residue behind, just soft and smooth skin that looks and feels great. You don't need a lot of this moisturizers so this jar should last you a good while. So even though it is not the cheapest cream around you still get your money's worth. I like this one, quite a bit and can only recommend it.",447,323
5.0,1593574203722,"I do really like this one, slightly more expensive than others in this class","This is a nice Retinol cream that is a little expensive considering it contains only 0.5% retinol. I have others that contain 3 times as much and cost half of this one. One word of caution, please keep in mind when you use products containing retinol to use sun blocker and to apply them in the evening since these can make your skin sensitive to sun light.<br /><br />This serum comes in a stunning little plastic squeeze tube looking like upside down pump dispenser. It has a pleasant and mild scent that I really like.<br /><br />The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. There is some residue for a brief while but that goes away pretty quickly. It leaves you with nice soft skin that is smooth and feels great. All in all I really do like this even though it is a bit more on the expensive side for what you get. My skin does like it though and with the lower concentration of the retinol this may work better for people who are more sensitive to retinol.",447,299
5.0,1593265593764,Very nice mattes and lots of beautiful shimmers/glitters,This is a nice little eye shadow palette that contains 16 eye shadows. The palette is actually pretty small but I have yet to use up a palette to be honest so this one will still take a while. You get 5 very nice mattes that are very pigmented and blend out nicely. With those you can create very nice base looks. Then you can use the 11 different shimmers to change the looks as you please. Anything from creamy lights to golds to purples. There is a very wide variety that allows you to really change up the look.<br /><br />I made some looks without eye primers and the look lasted all day without any issue. So for paying less than $10 this palette is well worth it in my eyes.,447,1013
5.0,1592700605667,Fantastic oil but just not too crazy about that strong essential oil scent,"I am so torn about this oil. It comes in a glass dropper bottle like most oils come, mostly to protect the oil. Make sure you mix it well since the gold settles on the bottom of it, yes it has actual gold flecks in it. Besides the actual 24k gold it has all natural ingredients making this an actual edible oil. You can use this on its own or mix it with your moisturizer or foundation if you want.<br /><br />So this is a high quality product and worth every penny in my eyes. When you use it you will notice the strong essential oil scent and this is why I am torn. It is just a bi too almost medicinal to me. It is a scent that in my eyes should be in a massage parlor in the essential oil diffuser healing you of something. So for me it was just rather strong but thankfully it does not longer on your face too long.<br /><br />The oil is not too thick and absorbs into your skin pretty quickly. It leaves a slight oily residue on your face and I don't fault it for that since it is an oil. However, if you give it about 10 minutes or so, that oily residue disappears and you feel just soft and smooth skin. Absolutely amazing in my eyes. I love how my face felt when I used that to be honest and was a bit shocked.<br /><br />So I love how it makes my face feel and look, I just need to get over the scent but since you really don't smell it on your face for long I think I can handle it.",447,1014
2.0,1592263193148,A sticky mess with an ashen yellowish color that smells funky but at least you are protected,"I really wanted to like this face moisturizer since I prefer using a tinted moisturizer over a foundation every day and this one on top of it also has an SPF 31 to protect your face from the sun. So to me that would be a win win situation.<br /><br />It comes in a nice little pump dispenser that works very well. Unfortunately that is where the positive really stops in my eyes. The moisturizer is not too thick and almost runny but it isn't. It is very tinted so it kept up on that promise. I did NOT like the smell of it at all and that scent actually does linger while you apply it and some time after so that was definitely a bit no no in my eyes.<br /><br />The applying of the moisturizer was not very pleasant since it was very sticky in my eyes. Distributing it evenly on my face took some actual work and I just didn't like that. IT was not like most moisturizers that just get nicely soaked up by your skin but because of its sticky consistency, which actually reminded me of a foundation, it took a bit. My skin also didn't feel great afterwards and I almost felt like I needed to set it with a setting powder like you would with a foundation. The color of it was also a bit off, some ashen yellowish brown that I found was not very flattering but thankfully it did not add a lot of color to my skin but actually blended into my skin after a little bit and you hardly noticed you added a tinted moisturizer.<br /><br />At least while I was out and about my face was protected from the sun and I did not get sun burnt, so that was the other upside of this moisturizer. But all in all I did not care for the scent of it, the stickiness during application and that it left behind and how it really made my skin look. To me this is more a fail than anything else really.",447,746
4.0,1592146223099,Leaves your skin a bit sticky and not huge on the scent but works,"The Iryasa Face Cream comes in a little jar, which is not my favorite container since you obviously dip into it all the time. So I tend to wash my hands before I do that so I don't introduce dirt and such into it because that can shorten the life span of these products.<br /><br />The cream itself is actually a little heavy which was surprising since it looked light and airy. It has some nice natural ingredients in it which is great. I wasn't too crazy about the smell of it though but that is because it used Geranium essential oil, which is probably one of my least favorite but I was hoping that the lemon would help cover it but it still powered through a lot.<br /><br />The cream absorbs fairly quickly into your skin and but leaves a sticky residue on your skin that doesn't seem to fade for quite some time. Thankfully by using this at night you won't know since you add this last thing before you go to bed and then just fall asleep. It does add moisture to your skin so in the morning your skin does feel pretty nice.",447,18

I admit it smells like an essential oil and contains lavender, cypress and sweet orange, all scents I like.<br /><br />The oil is not very heavy and absorbs into your skin fairly quickly. It is a quite oily though and takes quite some time to absorb into your skin. But you can expect that from a face oil if you ask me. Unlike another oil from Lua this one stays oily though, not sure why that is. Because of the oil your face is soft though but that is mostly because of that greasiness. Probably after about an hour or two that goes away and your skin is nice and soft.",447,86

Then you get a trio of bunny ear style scrunchies that is also very cute and decorative and lastly a trio of scarf scrunchies that is very decorative as well.<br /><br />In addition you get 7 hair pins to dress up your hair that are very cute. I still have to learn how to use this the right way and make them work in my hair. I have finer hair so these tend to slide out but I know there is a trick to make them stay in place. This is definitely a cute set that is worth getting to dress up your hair.",447,844

It has step by step instructions that are easy to follow and you end up with great looking nails. It actually doesn't take too long either since you can cure 4 nails at a time in the UV lamp except the thumps. So far I have only used the gray and really like that color a lot.<br /><br />Now what I really wish is that they have an adjunt kit where you can order more colors to go with the kit to mix it up some. Just having pink and gray is not enough in my eyes and let's face it having more options would be great where you could pick and choose other colors.<br /><br />I love the fact that you can just peel off the nail polish when you are done instead of having to use harsh chemicals to remove it. I always hated that part and that was one reason why I don't often use nail polish, that and the fact that regular nail polish is pretty damaging to your nails. Gel nail polish is actually pretty gentle to your nails and protecting at that plus it looks great.<br /><br />No complaints here, very happy with how long it took and the end results.",447,1020

It is pretty much scentless so that is boring but it does come in a beautiful frosted little dropper bottle. The serum is however just ok.<br /><br />The serum is fairly lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. The downside with it however is it leaves your skin tacky and that feeling fades but never really fully goes away. There is always a bit of that tacky residue on your skin. I did not notice any significant brightening effects either so it did not come through on that promise either.<br /><br />All in all this is just ok to be honest. I didn't really like how my face felt and it didn't really brighten it either. It does have some ingredients that are good for my face so at least it does some good things for my face even if I don't necessarily like how it feels when it is on, but you can always put another moisturizer on.",447,87

Thankfully the conditioner does not seem to have any in it.<br /><br />So the shampoo is not bad. The scent is decent, nothing spectacular though just ok in my eyes. It produces a nice lather that rinses out easily. What I do not like is the fact that it has silicone in it.<br /><br />The conditioner in my eyes is much nicer. The big problem is, the pump dispenser does not work. The conditioner is just too thick and can not be pumped up for some reason. So the suggestion of another reviewer to switch the lids is not a bad one. The conditioner smells much nicer than the shampoo and produces a very nice soft feel on your hair while still wet. It also rinses out nicely.<br /><br />When your hair is dry it does look and feel very nice. So in combination your hair does look nice when you use this combination, just not sure I am a huge fan of the shampoo in this set. All in all this gets a 3 star for me since the conditioner is pretty good, the shampoo is just below average in my eyes. As a set it may be just a tad overpriced though.",447,1022
5.0,1584453999779,Incredible sheet mask that makes your face really happy,"This is a very nice sheet face mask. It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face. I like the fact that it comes in two pieces so you really can make it fit perfectly to your face. The one pieces are just one fits all kind of masks and lets face it, not all faces are the same scie or shape and therefore they just don't all fit. With this one you have a lot of nice wriggle room which is great.<br /><br />It is very easy to put on. Once it is on you let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes (btw, if you go longer you get more of the goodies). So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read. I did notice that it is fairly heavy though but it amazingly did not slip on me but I was afraid that it may.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses and for once not overpowering of it. I am not the biggest fan of the smell of roses but this one was pleasant since it was not this cloying smell of it. This is a collagen mask and when you remove it you can tell how soft your face is. I really liked this mask but it is on the more expensive side. You get 4 masks in the box for $25, so each is about $6, so that is a bit on the higher end of sheet masks but they are very nice.",447,337
4.0,1584196769567,"Very nice, just slipped a little bit","These are nice under eye patch masks. They have a nice mild citrus type of scent, almost like mango so not sure how they can say they are unscented because they are not. I personally really like the scent so that is a plus in my eyes. Also surprised how some reviewers say they are unscented. So confusing.<br /><br />These come with a small pair of plastic tweezers to help you get the little patches out. The patches come in a cute little jar. The patches are thicker, gel like and very nice. I had an issue with them staying in place though. You keep them on for about 10 to 15 minutes or so. By that time they are almost dry so all the active ingredients are mostly in your skin or on by the time you are done. The rest you just let absorb when you remove the patches.<br /><br />The patches are nice and cooling and I really like how they feel on. I just wish they wouldn't slip since they did slip on me a bit. Not a big deal just a little annoyance.",447,1027
5.0,1584192758468,It works quite nicely but is this really a bit issue? Who knew,"This hair finishing stick works quite well. It comes in a similar tube as your eye mascara does and also has a similar wand to it. The gel is clear and very lightweight. It feels almost like water when you have it on your hair really. It is not sticky or greasy really.<br /><br />I was surprised that it works quite well and the staying power is pretty good as well. It is fairly cheap to so not a big investment there and definitely reasonable. I am not sure how big of an issue it really is though to get something like it. I guess if you are going to a big event and you want everything to be just perfect this is a product for it, but on a day to day basis I wouldn't really bother with it. But it works and it is pretty much scentless, so no issues there at all.",447,1028
2.0,1583678629264,"Can't say I am a fan, overpriced and not very moisturizing","This is an ok face day lotion. It comes in a beautiful pump dispenser however which I personally prefer. It does have some nice ingredients like shea butter and hyaluronic acid.<br /><br />Where it lacks is its scent. It doesn't have a scent that is worth writing home about. I didn't care for it at all and thankfully it doesn't linger on your skin either.<br /><br />When you use this moisturizer it is pretty light but is sticky on your skin when you use it. It does absorb fairly quickly though. My skin just felt ok when I used this. It didn't feel super soft or anything nor did it look anything spectacular. This to me was just a middle of the road kind of moisturizer. Now considering all this and the cost of $63, I just can't recommend this product.

4.0,1583594267319,Work great for what they are meant for,"In today's age when you are restricted with how much liquids you can bring along on your travels on an airplane, it makes sense to fill these little refillable atomizer bottles with your favorite perfume to bring along so you can have them in your carry on luggage. Some times you don't even have a checked in luggage so this is important.<br /><br />I like that in this pack you get 5 different ones. You can dedicate each one to a different perfume so you can bring different ones on your travel. These work very well and you can bring enough on your travels for at least a week plus. They are easy to fill and use and work very well. These are on the cheaper side but for what they are intended these work perfectly well.",447,1030
3.0,1583590511469,Not bad but not the greatest either,"You get a lot of hyaluronic acid serum in this bottle. It is pretty much scent less for those who prefer that this one is perfect in that regards. There were no hints of thyme, so not sure if it should smell of it since it is in their name? It feels very tacky on your skin when you apply it and stays that way for a few minutes. So it does take a few minutes to fully absorb into your skin. Your skin feels pretty soft after that, not the softest I have experienced but not bad overall.<br /><br />They recommend to rub it in until it is absorbed, that is a bit tough since it is so sticky. All in all not a bad product but definitely not my favorite.<br /><br />Someone did make a good point about this coming in a plastic bottle. I ended up looking it up and it does have a fairly low pH. That does make me wonder what it does to that plastic bottle and if over time it will dissolve that plastic bottle.",447,334
4.0,1583326586217,Very nice mascara but a little bit overpriced,"This is a very nice mascara. It does come however in a cheaper looking container I think, at least to me the cartoonish container looks cheaper. I didn't think it really added that much volume to my lashes as much as it actually lengthened them which is fine. It added a good amount of length to be honest and did add a little bit of volume though. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness but then you would get that spidery look that I do not care for.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is smudge proof. I had it on for a solid 16 hours and it did not budge until I used a makeup remover and it came off very easy at that point.<br /><br />This is a nice mascara and it will cost you $18. I have some others that perform similarly that are cheaper than this one though so it is a bit overpriced in my eyes.",447,329
4.0,1583068556518,Help those poor abused hands,"This is a very nice hand care bundle for very hands on people. First you get a very nice hand cleaner that contains activated charcoal. This detoxes and cleans very nicely of the toughest dirt, eliminating strong odor but doesn't damage your hands like some strong cleaners might do.<br /><br />Next you get a moisturizing and healing cream. This is great for those who have done some damage to their hands in some physical hand jobs where they hand up with dry and cracked hands. This gives back some moisture and heals those hands.<br /><br />Last but not least is a nice protect and moisturizer. This adds a nice barrier to your hands but also adds much needed hydration to much abused hands that are dry, cracked and scaly. When you have this on your hands it is much easy to wash and wipe away stubborn dirt.<br /><br />This is a nice little set that can also be gifted, especially for people who work with their hands like mechanics or wood workers but many others. This works really well and will help restore some of those much abused hands.",447,1034

I am very sensitive to menthol smells and can't stand it. This one is very strong and overpowering.<br /><br />It does have a refreshing feel to it but the smell of menthol just overpowers everything. My skin was soft when I used it and did not dry out so that is great. So for those who like menthol this is great, but for me this just doesn't work.",447,1035

5.0,1582257771798,Beautifully scent duo that performs nicely,"This is now the third product from Taya I have tried out, and I have to say this line does not dissappoint. This is probably the most fancy dispenser I have had to date and the most fancy looking bottle. The shampoo is this super creamy, beautiful creamy shampoo. It does not produce a massive lather but to cleanse your hair that is not necessary. You will also notice the incredible smell it has. The conditioner smells the same. I have a body spray that it reminds me off and it is just incredible.<br /><br />This set is a bit on the more expensive side but my hair does look, feel and smell amazing when I use it, so I use this on my splurge and pamper days. They do make some claims for anti breakage and some ingredients that supposedly help with that. I can't really confirm those claims but I do really like this set a lot. It also comes in this unique bottle with an interesting dispensing mechanism and unlike some I had no issues with it whatsoever.",447,255
5.0,1581724386204,Sturdy and easy to assemble,"This is a nice makeup holder with some ""bling"". Apparently I have accumulated too many products over the last few months and was in need of additional storage. This one is similar to another one I have. Just like with other ones with a lazy Susan the shelves are adjustable which is great since you have products of different size. On the top it has different sections so you can put some items like small bottles, eye liners, brushes, mascara and so on in there to keep those organized as well, which my other two lazy Susan organizers do not have, so this is kind of neat in my eyes. All my organizers are just a tad different so I keep them for different purposes, this one is great for lotions, dropper bottles and mascaras and such. It is very sturdy and a great addition to keep my things organized.",447,1040
5.0,1581121008897,Fantastic lip balm,"This set of lip balm is very nice. It applies easily and leaves your lips feeling nice and soft without feeling greasy or tacky. They taste of tangerine which is great. I admit, for lip balms I want one that has a good flavor at this point and this one delivers 100%. It is packed with great for your lips ingredients such as hemp seed oil, Vitamin E and olive oil and no, it does not taste like olive oil. It is cruelty free which is another bonus in my eyes.<br /><br />It was a bit tricky to open though but once you get it it is actually a neat design, instead of twisting it on the bottom you twist it right by the bottom of the cap.",447,1041

This serum is packed with peptides, resveratrol and grape seed extract.<br /><br />You don't need a lot of this and what you apply quickly absorbs into your skin. It smells great and smells of grapes, which is actually a rare scent in beauty products and nice for a change. My skin felt and looked great when I used this serum. The price is also very reasonable so I for one can recommend this. I am also a fan of the pump dispenser, it is clean and easy to work with and keeps the rest of the product clean as well.",447,90

It is in very classy blue bottle and packed with some very good ingredients like almond oil, Vitamin C, E and K, and Kale, and you will feel that.<br /><br />First when you use it, you will notice this heavenly smell of coconut! I love coconut so when a lotion smells of coconut and makes me smell of it, well I am 100% in favor of it. But it gets better. Once you use this on your skin, it leaves you with super soft, beautiful looking skin that smells of coconut. You don't need a lot of this lotion and it quickly and fully absorbs into your skin.<br /><br />This for me is a perfect body lotion.",447,91

If I would have gotten a different color than gray I guess I could have used it on other occasions for like accent strikes of hairs.<br /><br />It is easy to use and leaves a similar feeling behind as if you used some of those colored hair sprays. The hair is a tad stiff, just like it is when you use hair wax. I don't use those kinds of products often so it is always a bit weird to me when I can't just run my fingers through my long hair.<br /><br />It washes out easily without any problems. When you apply it and wash your hands it comes of easy as well. This is a very easy to use product without any issues and not very expensive so you can't really go wrong with it.",447,1046

I was a bit confused by that to be honest so yes read the description. It works very well that is true. It was almost completely without scent, it may have had some very mild scent but I couldn't describe what it smelled like.<br /><br />To me it was weird to wash your face with something that felt more like a lotion than anything else. So this only gets an ok since it wasn't outstanding in any category really. I had no negative reactions to it and it is super gentle but that is about it.",447,94

You want something nice and smooth that gently scrubs away the excess skin that is oh so annoying and tempts you into biting it off.<br /><br />This scrub has Vitamin E, jojoba and coconut oil and some other nice ingredients and as I said tastes deliciously of peach. I personally am a huge fan of peach and this tastes 100% of peach and doesn't have a weird artificial flavor which is great.

4.0,1609609468863,Effective,"I've been watching as every personality is raving about rose quartz and jade and microneedling etc. I did some research (from reputable sources) and there is actually some science to the use of these products. The microneedle blade is small enough for use. It makes little tiny, non-noticeable holes in the surface of your skin (in effect damaging it) so it will produce more collagen. While I wouldn't use it more than once a week, and just until my skin starts to get red, it does appear that my skin is softer and smoother after the treatment. So I'm find on the micro-needler. (Just remember gently, gently). The quartz roller is supposed to reduce redness, smooth the surface of the skin and help with lymphatic drainage. I'm not sure it actually does all that but it does feel nice and has definitely helped with under eye puffiness so it appears to be working. I'm very pleasantly surprised by the effectiveness of these devices and will continue to use them.<br /><br />The packaging is fine and makes them giftable but I'm not sure the quality of the pieces will actually hold up. I've been using them for several months and so far so good but if they do fall apart, I'm willing to invest in more expensive products.

5.0,1644526895318,"This Is A Great Design- But Caution, How To Get Out Of A Jam","I have baby fine hair.  Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.  I know it is supposed to stay, but mine doesn't.  Other than that, this would get five stars, but I am taking one off for that.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I posted a photo of my hair so you can see how curly it is.

This bronzer had some surprises to it.  Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled.  I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances.  When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH lighter.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a high layered cardboard with a strong hinge to it.  There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it.  It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color.  It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.",499,1147
5.0,1596227932470,"Nice As Bronzer On Cooler Toned Skin, But Fabulous Eye Shadow Too,- Read On","I am a makeup artist.  I am always finding ways to make cosmetics work for all sorts of uses to get the best look and bang for the buck.  This Luminating Bronzer has some surprises up its sleeve.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />This comes in a heavy cardboard compact with a strong cardboard hinge on it.  There is no mirror.  The pan inside has printed letters and design on it.  In this case, the color is number 2, the darker of the two in this collection.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR IS THIS?<br />This bronzer is a unique color.  Instead of being the usual brown or orange color so many bronzers are, this one is a rose toned base which at first seems unusual.  If used on cooler toned skin, you will still see a luminzer effect but the undertone is more of a rose tan.<br /><br />WHAT COLOR SKIN DID I USE THIS ON?<br />Right now, I tried this on two colors of skin.  One was translated into MAC foundation color as NC27- a tanned color which leans toward the cooler side, and NW25 which is a cooler lighter caucasian leaning color.<br /><br />EFFECTS?<br />Things like this have a need for you to choose the right brush.  The wrong brush can make it look horrible.  The right brush can make it look like a million bucks.  When used with a STIPPLING brush (look that up to find out what that means), this bronzer provides the perfect luminescence and glow along with color.<br /><br />You can see the cheekbones highlighted and see the spot of color, but it is subtle, and not overbearing.<br /><br />If you use the dense fluffy brush like you might use to apply blush, the results border on ridiculous.  It is like you have smears of bright shimmer on and it is hard to blend in well.<br /><br />WHAT OTHER USES?<br />Interestingly, I have both color 1 and 2 of this line of Sungasm bronzers.  When using this particular color 2 on the creases of the eyes, it provides a GORGEOUS natural look similar to the old J Lo type look or other natural based looks which in reality take a lot of makeup but they just don't look like it.<br /><br />This put together with color 1 in this series, the two together make a great duo on the eyes.  It really is amazing.  It brings out the color of the eyes perfectly.  In fact, I use the lighter one on the upper cheekbones for highlight/bronzer and the darker number 2 under it and blend well.  The effect is subtle but beautiful.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />I have used good shadow brushes and my finger as well.  The idea is for medium to subtle color, use a tear drop shaped shadow brush.  For more intensity use a flat eye shadow brush on top of eye primer and blend once you have applied the other colors.  For a quick application, I have successfully used my fingers.<br /><br />DOES IT BURN ON THE EYES?<br />I have a terrible time with products on my eyes.  They usually burn and give me trouble.  This bronzer did not do that.  If you are concerned, be sure to get a good eye primer that you are comfortable with and use that first on your eyes.<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT DARKER SKIN TONES?<br />If you use this on darker skin tones, there is a good chance it could show up a bit on the ghostly side.  It has to be applied very lightly and blended well a little at a time to test the best depth if you want to try it.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Not only as a gorgeous rose based bronzer highlighter, but also as a contour or all over eye shadow, this color bronzer is a great price with good performance.  It is not the usual color for bronzers but it works on medium to lighter skin tones.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a great multi purpose product for summer.  It doubles as bronzer and luminzer but also as a great eye shadow.",499,1148

This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.  I like nail brushes out of synthetic brushes instead of real sable.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This works for what I want it for in doing watercolors.

It is creamy but not heavy.  There is a very faint lemon smell, but there is also a smell which is not good- almost like the oils in the cream are about to turn completely rancid.  They are not quite there yet, but I have used enough products over time where I recognize that smell.<br /><br />That is not necessarily the fault of the cream.  This could have been kept in a hot warehouse too long, or who knows what.  The manufacture date on my box is April 2019.  That is over a year old already.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />Since it is not unbearable at this point, I wanted to at least test the product for a few days.  There was no burning or stinging, so it is still okay to use for now.  The product is quite nice.  It does soak in quickly and it does not leave the face greasy at all.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON SKIN?<br />The next morning after using this, I will say that the skin is left looking like it has a slight glow to it.  It does leave the skin looking much nicer than other creams I have used.  It is warmer weather right now and this cream is still not leaving the face greasy or heavy at all.  My skin is definitely left looking nice the next morning.<br /><br />ANY SENSITIVITY?<br />I have not had any sensitivity to the sun or anything else yet.  Like I said, I can not use this long as it is ready to turn bad soon so I only have a short time.  For now, it is really nice.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I really wish that this cream was fresher than it is.  The product manufacture date on it is April of 2019.  I am really disappointed that I could not test it at its best because it has great potential to be a really nice cream.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS- I can not give this five stars in its current state.

I definitely love the 'sunset/rose gold' palettes, and this reminds me of a Huda palette I have with similar shades. It's in a slim, cardboard palette without a mirror, but this is a lower price point for all the shades you get. The shadow itself is a creamy powder blend, and it suggests that you use your fingers for the metallic shades (I find a small crease blush works fine and tends to have less loose powder that way).<br /><br />You have a nice mix of matte and metallic shades this way, with a lot of earth tones. Definitely a lot of copper and reds here, some golds and rose golds and pinks. Colors that will stand out but not all of them. These felt nice on the skin and blended well. Why the three stars?<br /><br />I tried this with and without primer, and this kit definitely needs primer to last more than a couple of hours on my skin. Also? The mattes will last several hours, but not the metallics even with primer (as well as a setting spray on top). I love the metallic colors, but they just fade on me somehow - even if I layer them on top of the matte. I'm used to eyeshadow blending on me after a few hours, but never have I seen metallics melt away on me like this.

Unfortunately I didn’t  see any replacement heads to order on Amazon. I would have liked the kit to come with more heads,  it comes with two, one to use and one replacement . I really like the aloe strip that surrounds the 5 blades , most of my other razors it’s just on one side. The razor cuts close and is comfortable to use.

The flaw is the spinning sprayer that allowed my expensive orange cleaner to pour out of the top all around the nozzle.  cheaply made  but all in all a good glass bottle with a terrible srayer . If you just need a bottle with a screw top your good. If you have a different sprayer you can take off a plastic bottle great. Thats what I did.

It is silicone free, paraben free, sulfate free and alcohol free. I would stay away from this product if you have malassezia (fungal) acne as olive and japonica may be triggers and/or pore clogging.<br /><br />Like all natural bar shampoos, it won’t lather like traditional synthetic shampoos but it does clean. It takes some getting use too and a period of detoxing for your hair to get use to the change in chemicals if you are switching from synthetic to natural but it is worth it!<br /><br />I would recommend this shampoo bar however I am rather concerned about the EWG verified claim.",982,1831

4.0,1613917893005,Pretty decent product but do your research,"Overall, this product isn’t horrible compared to others on the market. It is paraben-free, sulfate-free, EU Allergen free and uses minimal ingredients however it also contains alcohol, silicone and is not safe for fungal acne.  After running this product through a cosmetic ingredient safety checker, it scored an 88% one the EWG Health Rating.  Most popular, name-brand face lotions are around 65%-80% on the EWG Health Rating. I use the EWG (Environment Working Group) as a reference when checking products and try to stay away from the alarmist side. Only 8% of this product is considered “moderate risk” mainly polyarylamide, Fragrance (unnecessary additive; possible allergy) , alcohol denat. (Bad for dry skin, bad for sensitive skin, potentially block pores) and BHT (also found in edibles, rubber products and is banned in UK and EU due to limited research showing BHT is linked to cancer). This product is good for brightening, anti-aging and promotes wound healing.  It also contains steric acid which can potentially block pores.<br /><br />Keep in mind, everyone’s skin is different and what effects one person may not effect another. Learn your skin and what products work best for you. Personally, I would stay away from this product if you have very dry skin and/or sensitive skin. I have “normal” skin (no sensitivities, not overly dry or oily, limited acne, no allergies) and didn’t have any issues with this product so far. It has a light scent that isn’t overpowering but completely unnecessary (I HATE fragrance in beauty products; stick with essential oils). It absorbed nicely and didn’t leave my face feeling oily. I am giving this product 4 stars as of February 21, 2021 due to the minimal ingredients and will update this review once a larger amount of time has passed to fully understand how to works with my skin.",982,722

4.0,1598744765305,Great glass files,"These files are fantastic. I really like the fact that they're not etched like any other glass file. They do a great job at filing natural nails without all that ear splitting, teeth hurting, grinding noise other glass files make.<br /><br />As far as buffing/polishing goes, yes, they do make a naked, natural nail shiny.  But unless your nail is free of bumps, humps, divots, etc., it's going to take a long time to shine the nail evenly. What you end up doing is making thin/weak spots in the nail which will cause breaks or cracks as the nail grows out because these files take off a lot of nail. You can get shinier nails quicker with a base coat.",1099,1553

Overall, great set.",1105,1538
4.0,1612720536136,Great clay facial mask,"I have very sensitive dry skin, So I was worried that this would over dry and irritate my skin. First of all, it smells amazing. It smells very natural, like greenery and botanicals. This mask has ever so slightly some grit to it. It isn't the scrubbiest of exfoliating masks. The clay doesn't over dry your skin. I do not feel like my skin is tight feeling after washing my face. Overall, it feels very luxurious and relaxing. Great weekly skin treat to unwind at home. Highly recommended.",1105,430

4.0,1607021903612,Great nail files,"These are very good nail files. They work very well, and lasts through multiple uses. I have natural nails, and I I find that the two different grits work well with smoothing edges and removing sharp corners of nails after trimming. I was replacing my old files after every use and the sand was flaking off and getting all over my floors. I did not have any problems with these doing that. Overall, it's a very high quality product and I would highly recommend it, especially for professional use.",1105,252
4.0,1605739422732,Great for brightening the skin,"I use this at night time as a serum before moisturizer. It smells wonderfully first if all. The texture is very thin and lightweight.

There's a plastic cover under the lid, but there was a mess of cream all around the rim and threads. Maybe it was used? It smells like lotion and salad dressing. It feels like Vaseline on the skin, which is okay for a sleeping mask. It made me feel like it was  certainly locking in moisture, but the next day, I didn't really notice anything different in my skin. I like sleeping masks but don't expect I would order this again. I definitely find it overpriced ($44) for the packaging, experience, and results - or lack thereof.",1116,2000
4.0,1663279576415,Good for the price,"This came with a foil seal in a bag.

I'm not sure if it was this serum alone or how it worked in conjunction with my other skin care products, but my skin felt velvety soft afterwards. I enjoyed the lavender-scented milky texture of this serum. It came in a sealed box. It's affordably priced at $9.99. I would get this again.",1116,2002
3.0,1662233921903,Prefer the Hydrating Instant Mask,"I really like Everyday Beauty's Hydrating Instant Mask so was hopeful for this Night Cream, but I wasn't as impressed. It didn't seem to leave my skin quite as velvety soft or last as many hours, yet the Night Cream is more expensive at $38/1 fl oz. The Mask is $22/1.7 fl oz and can be used overnight as often as needed. I use it as the last step in my skincare routine. This cream came in a box, unsealed and simply smells like a cream.",1116,2003
4.0,1661566099213,Gentle exfoliator,"If you love strawberries and/or are seeking a gentle scrub, this is a good choice. The sealed tub also had a plastic cover under the the lid and was boxed. The scrub had a little brown in it like what you might see when fruit starts to rot or in yogurt, but it's dated good until 9/14/2023, so I felt okay using it. The red particles made my husband and I realize we didn't confidently know the color of strawberry seeds, but I think they are. They feel kind of squishy, and the scrub feels more like a creamy moisturizing lotion. It does smell like strawberries and makes skin soft. This is a different scrub that feels gentle. I personally prefer one that feels like it's polishing and cleaning more than moisturizing though. This is currently $12.",1116,426
4.0,1661565580173,Okay cleanser,"The bottle came in a sealed box. It's a light pink gel. The scent is nice but more fruity-rose like you might find in products scented for children. It cleans okay. I don't feel it's worth $16, but I don't think I would buy this one again regardless.",1116,2004
3.0,1659156454649,Dry rub,"The tube had a foil seal. There is a pineapple scent. You're supposed to massage the gel on dry skin for 2 minutes. As soon as you start, it starts to pill. I feel like most of it immediately dries up and falls off though I'm sure it's grabbing dead skin too. While it's gentle in that it's not using coarse particles, I didn't enjoy the dry rubbing and tugging at my skin. You can only avoid that over 2 minutes by applying a generous amount of gel, but it's a small tube. My skin looked a little brightened afterwards but not as soft and bright as many other exfoliators (scrubs, peels, masks, serums, etc). This is $12.99, which doesn't seem like as great of a value after seeing how much you need to use. I didn't like the application, results, or price enough to reorder this.",1116,2005
4.0,1657331859882,Very glittery,"I have a lot of orange-gold lip colors because I find them very flattering on me, so I was pretty confident I would like this. The color is beautiful and not too orange. While I like the gold too, the specks of glitter are larger and more obvious than I would like. Some gold is really fine and distributes as an even shimmer across your lips. With this, you can see the glitter speck here, the glitter speck there, the glitter speck falling a little outside your lip line that will probably end up somewhere else on your face. It has more of a youthful, party feel. I agree it's a color reminiscent of sunsets, suited for summer and fall. The case is possibly the most sophisticated I own though. It has a nice weight, and the magnetic closure feels good. It came in a box and in a sealed bag. I don't mind wearing this color, but I wouldn't buy it again. I think I like the case the best, but I'm not convinced the color or feel add up to make it worth $38.",1116,2006
3.0,1655157446189,Maybe better for older skin?,"I've used a drugstore pressed powder for years and always gotten compliments, so it's hard to think I need to pay $52. I can't say I was especially impressed by this. HOWEVER, I'm getting to the age where I'm starting to notice my makeup can look dry and accentuate lines I didn't even think I had. I'm not wearing much makeup these days, but based on reviews, I got this with the hope it will work for maturing skin. I can see this also washing you out a bit as another reviewer mentioned. It's white, and even though I'm fair, I felt this needed a very light application. The good news is if such a thin dusting can live up to the reviews, it makes the price a little better. I was surprised how low quality the puff felt. It's very thin and almost felt rough.",1116,2007

5.0,1651876910308,Working well,"I needed a brush for my cats because the one I've been using removes almost too much hair and hurts my one cat plus it's uncomfortable to hold. The brushes I've been seeing look flimsy and painful with their wire tips. I liked the rubber tips on this so took the chance. It's working great so far. I can tell it doesn't hurt my cat...although she still doesn't love what's happening. It smoothed their hair without pulling it all out. The bristles kept their shape. The button pushed all the hair up, so I could cleanly and easily pull it all off. It's more comfortable to hold, and the cover is actually helpful to keep the bristles clean and protected from being bent. It's a little large for even my large cats but totally doable. It would definitely work for larger dogs as well. The price is reasonable and considering so many other similar brushes received poor reviews, I'm especially happy with this for the price.",1116,2009
4.0,1608574408385,Mixed feelings,There is a lot to like about these bobby pins. They are sturdy and come in multiple colors. They are pointed uniformly and seem to hold my hair well.

Overall I think that more hair will get pulled out with these pins than my old ones.,1193,2108
5.0,1599514004399,Surprisingly good!,"This deodorant has a very strong lavender scent (which is a plus for me!) It went on smooth, though it was difficult to get the plastic cover off of the stick for the first time.

4.0,1658366200714,Likeable liquid lipstick,"To me the shade on the product picture looks like it might have a little pink in it but I don't notice it when I apply it. Maybe that's just me 🤔 Regardless, I feel the shade is very pretty...and definitely is metallic.<br /><br />It's also very long-lasting- to the point that later when taking it off, I used both an oil cleanser and makeup remover. Transferring is minimal. It actually stays a little sticky the whole time while wearing it, so that makes it a little surprising that it's so long lasting- since many liquids dry completely. It's not overly sticky, so I didn't find it bothersome.<br /><br />Applies smoothly- it does feel like a velvety, whipped texture<br /><br />If you're concerned about the appearance of lines on your lips with a liquid lipstick- I feel this is one makes them a bit pronounced.<br /><br />Overall, for a liquid lipstick, I think it's pretty good. Has rich pigment and has a stand-out metallic look<br /><br />Packaging is pretty",1214,2133
5.0,1657243552589,Happy with it!,I had never heard of this brand before and was also looking forward to trying this out because I feel like this shade wouldn't look right on me- I guess because I have a lot of redness in my face. So getting the opportunity to try it out allowed me to branch out and try a shade I would normally be hesitant to buy. I'm glad because I love it! I ended-up loving the shade and how it looks on me. It applies so smoothly and even feels moisturizing while wearing. I love the shimmer- it's enough to be noticeable and pretty but isn't too much. Happy with it!,1214,2006

The length and style combined with the colors is a lot of fun. It sheds a little. I try to be careful with the ends as they've been a little tangly but it's a costume wig so I often experience that with other costume wigs, especially with length and curls.

This cream is soothing and leaves a lot of moisturize but not a lot of goop.

I have had this pair on for 4 days now and still look great.  Everyone thinks I put them on daily but, nope I sleep in them and they do not get bent, fold, or lift while I sleep.

4.0,1601232869958,Nice grooming set,"My husband used this kit and took, when asked to do a bit of a review on it for me, took it very seriously. The price isn't cheap so he wanted to make sure to really look at everything as he used it. Here is what he had to say:<br /><br />""You have a pack of accessories here so I thought I would run through them in turn to tell you what you are getting and my impression of it<br /><br />Shampoo and body wash.<br />Okay, I ran through this way too quick and used all of it. It's good. It's really good and I couldn't really get enough of it. So that's a plus and a negative in that there isn't really a lot of it to begin with.<br /><br />Face wash.<br />I love to get In there and give my face a right good scrubbing. This helps. The wash is thick and gel like with the exfoliating, and it does feel like you have given your face a good scrub after use. You do feel cleaner after use.<br /><br />Shave cream<br />I'm not one for using cream very often. I prefer basic foam from a can. But wow. This stuff leaves your face feeling clean and fresh after shaving.  Not only that but incredibly soft.<br /><br />Moisture cream<br />This is really not something I use at all. I would think it best to use after shaving because you are stripping moisture from your face, but in that regard the shave cream is sufficient. I just don't personally have a need for a separate moisture cream. So it is sort of hard to form an opinion about it.<br />What I can tell you is that it doesn't really have a scent, my face does feel super soft. On the downside it is a little messy and I found myself wiping away the excess.<br /><br />For the most part then I really like this set. It comes in a handy pouch you can use long after the accessories are empty. However, that won't take too long because the bottles are very small. It's something for people who aren't concerned about the cost. It's very expensive. Is it worth the cost for me? Not really. Not in terms of either quality or quantity but if the price was lower I would be recommending to everyone.""<br /><br />There you go guys and gals. That's what he thought about the set. He's still talking about it so he did like it, just thought it was a bit much.",1218,2184

He is more prone to acne than I am and recently he's been getting more and more breakouts. I asked him to let me know how he felt about it after using it. Here is what he had to say about it:<br /><br />""So like many people i have been wearing a mask all day. It's hot and it becomes humid under the mask. Perfect breeding place for acne. It was forming all around my mouth. I'm not going to complain about it. Just that's how it is now, and we have to work with it.<br />This serum seemed to be working at first. It's easy to apply using the dropper. Just squeeze a few drops on to the affected area and let it dry in.<br />You will notice when you use it that your skin appears to be tightening. Also with continued use the red marks on your face will lighten and eventually fade.<br />I had to stop using it. I believe it was working at first but after some continued use it was making things worse and the acne was spreading. I have a slightly oily skin type and this may not have been best suited to me.<br />Glad I tried it and I have a feeling that it may work better for a different skin type than mine.""<br /><br />There you have it. That's what he thought about it.",1218,2185
5.0,1586713851194,Great brushes!,"This is a very good set of brushes and combs, especially for the price. They work great. You get four things in this set. You'll receive a paddle brush, a rectangle comb, a detangler hair brush, and a tail comb. I don't really use the combs as much as the brushes but did give them a bit of a testing so I could type a review. I absolutely love all of these brushes and combs. They are sturdy and work very well. When used for what they are supposed to be used for specifically I thought they all held up well and did their jobs. They detangled perfectly and when used for styling they were easy to hold on to, didn't get in the way at all, and worked the hair into it's style nicely.<br />I would recommend these if you are looking for a good set of hair brushes and combs that won't cost you much. These are terrific for that!",1218,845

You get three velvet headbands with pearls- pink, black, and beige, 3 fabric headbands- 2 have flower patterns and one is black with white stripes, and three knitted- green, grey, and black.<br />These are very well constructed. The only thing is that after a little while they did begin to dig in bit where they rest at the ends. Not too much but enough to make it uncomfortable after a long period of time. They still so nice it's worth the slight suffering.<br />These are very nice and worth it.",1218,257
5.0,1582817808950,Works great,"This shampoo and conditioner leaves hair feeling clean, soft, and manageable after the first use. It smells nice, too, which is also a plus!<br />My hair is not that of a teen or even young adult anymore so it's been through a lot. When looking for shampoo and conditioning products I tend to look closer at those that claim to make hair stronger, reduce breakage, and things with words like ""restore"" and ""fortify"". These hit the mark so I decided to give them a shot.<br />I've been using them about three weeks and I think that they are definitely doing my hair some good. It looks healthy and feels very soft. The conditioner does a good job with tangles and knots. I do sometimes still use a leave in conditioner or separate type of moisture just because it's winter my hair is increasingly dry on any given day depending. I can't tell for sure about the breakage but it does seem stronger. I suppose in many ways they go hand in hand. It has more pull to it so it's not snapping and breaking as much.<br />I like this. A little goes a long way as well which is nice.",1218,255
2.0,1582216946430,My lips and this didn't have a lasting friendship,"Unfortunately I wasn't a fan of this one. It didn't do much to help my lips. Rather than exfoliate it actually just seemed to dry out my lips and not just a little bit. It wasn't fun. I tried it a few times, as directed. Just apply a small pea-sized amount to the lips using a finger-tip, scrub gently in a circular motion to remove the dead skin cells for about 30 seconds then rinse or eat off remaining sugar. All of that was done, rinsed not eaten though the one thing that was good was that it didn't taste half bad. Alas, my poor lips were left in worse shape than ever. Dry and roughed up. No matter how hard or gentle I used the stuff over a three week period. I finally gave up and had to admit defeat. Perhaps others had better luck?",1218,1054
4.0,1582127825944,These work very well,"This mask is very nice. I have never used a mask like this one before. It's heavier than the usual thin almost paper or gel like masks that a lot of them seem to be. This one definitely has a bit more to it. It's also a two piece mask which is great in some ways because sometimes I looks like a one person comedy routine trying to get the masks on right while they flip and flop all over.<br />With this mask you put the bottom part then the top by your eyes, it makes it a lot easier. Then you leave it on for at least 20 minutes ( though it says to leave it on for 30 so I did that). When you take it off you gently pat the left over into your skin.<br />It leaves your skin feeling so soft and really well moisturized. I feel like it did a very nice job with firming up the skin as well. I have only used two of these so far, one a week over two weeks, and have really liked the way my skin looked and felt after each use. I would recommend giving these a try if you can. Perhaps in summer as they have a nice cooling feel to them that I bet would feel great in the summer heat!",1218,337
3.0,1578848833914,Good scrunchies but...,"(3.5)<br />Beautiful scrunchies. These scrunchies are very nice. They are made from 100% real natural raw mulberry silk. What makes these special is that they are not supposed to pull your hair as much or get stuck like many others do. That is true of these! The scrunchie works great. It goes in nicely, holds the hair back, doesn't slide out, and when it's taken out there is little to no hair caught in it.<br />However, I can't really see that the price for one is a great one. This is something you have to sort of weigh the options out though for yourself. I have noticed less hair pulling and loss with this hair thing, but the cost is up there. It's a good scrunchie but it's truly up to you if you'd spend that much on one. Maybe the other options make the prices seem less daunting?",1218,649
5.0,1569958212528,Really good stuff!,This body scrub is really nice.  It smells so good and it smooths the and nourishes the skin perfectly. When you rub this gently onto your skin then rinse it off you can instantly feel the difference. It feels as if all the dead skin has been removed and your pores have been opened. It leaves you soft and refreshed as well as incredibly relaxed.<br />This is a big jar as well that you get and it's worth it for the price. It's definitely worth giving a try if you are interested and able to. It's really good. I love it.,1218,748

Compared to some perfumes and colognes, this is moderately priced.<br /><br />Smell? It isn’t the greatest. I do like it as a light, after-bathing scent. It seems more suited to a room freshener than a perfume. But, it isn’t the WORST perfume/scent I’ve smelled.<br /><br />The generous size means it will last a while.<br /><br />Would I get it again? No. Nor would I recommend it either.",1219,908
3.0,1626746723600,Great for Travel,"As most have said here – these are great for travel, especially when you can’t find soap around but have water. Though I wouldn’t carry a bar of soap, I have used “travel” size body wash as a hand soap. If it cleans the body, should clean the hands, right?<br /><br />Anyway …<br /><br />The metal container I got was dented, but that is okay as I don’t intend to travel where I won’t have soap. So, I’m using these at my bathroom sink.<br /><br />LET ME STATE THIS AS A WARNING: HANDS MUST BE DRY BEFORE GRABBING A SOAP SHEET.<br /><br />I know all caps is yelling, but trust me – it is for a VERY GOOD reason. As one reviewer said, even a drop of water can damage these.<br /><br />Basically I grab a one with dry hands, hold it in palm, turn water on, let it dissolve. Good lather, I don’t really smell a “scent”, hands wash clean. They don’t dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn’t say these go years – if you’re like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup – they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they’re used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax. That’s just me.<br /><br />I do have other soaps, and these should last me a while. I would not recommend them as a body wash. As opposed to carrying a bar of soap, try a travel container with body wash. Just my suggestion.",1219,207

THIS DEVICE IS CELSIUS (C) ONLY, NO FARENHEIT (F) OPTION. Google is strongly needed here.<br /><br />According to Redken: “For those with fine or thin hair, keep your iron set below 200 (so below 100°C on this device) degrees Fahrenheit. Any higher and your strands may burn. For those with coarse or thicker hair, have your curling iron set between 200 degrees and 300 degrees (148.9°C or on this device 150) Fahrenheit for optimal curls” [9 Curling Iron Secrets You Need to Know About/Redken]<br /><br />Using that, as well as Glamour’s 8-10 second rule [How to Curl Your Hair Correctly: 7 Mistakes to Avoid – Glamour; “Drill it into your brain: You should hold an iron on your hair for eight to 10 seconds max”], along with using thinner groups of hair – I should have SOME wave. Nope. I even went 25 seconds. Nothing.<br /><br />As my hair has become a bit thinner, has been color treated, and exposed to SO much – I wasn’t about to turn this up hotter.<br /><br />The curler is designed much like a crimper, but the “width” can make it difficult to handle, especially by yourself. There is a “guard” which heats up as well and it is easy to burn yourself.<br /><br />It wins with innovative idea as well as the digital temp gauge. Also, it does heat up SUPER fast, as well as cool down just as fast when lowering the temp.<br /><br />For use by myself – this is a two star deal.

The faux fur is soft and doesn’t shed, and really adds to the unicorn aspect. The horns stand up from the headband, and are sparkly silver. The ears don’t stand up as well, they’re a bit floppy, and also have sparkly silver on the backs.<br /><br />The headbands are on the smaller side. I measured approximately 6 inches across the opening with a headband unstretched, and about 9 inches when fully stretched. I like that the headbands are tight, they stay on my head and hold my hair back. I don’t have to keep fussing with them, they stay in place. They are about 2½ inches wide, which helps with comfort.",1224,2212
5.0,1600129477155,Great files,"This pack of 16 nail files from Keiby Citom is a great value.<br /><br />I started doing dip nails at home, and the worst part is getting off the old manicure. I have to file off the layers of top coat, which can take a while if I don’t have a good file. I prefer a glass file for actually shaping my nails, but they’re not good for removing layers of polish.<br /><br />Using one of these files, I had the top coat filed off all my nails in less than ten minutes. The 100 grit side is perfect. I actually asked a nail tech friend what I should use, and she told me 100 grit.<br /><br />The files come in a zipper seal plastic bag that can be used to store them.<br /><br />The edges of the files aren’t sharp. I’m talking about the edges that touch your skin; sometimes these can be sharp, especially on pro files, and need to be seasoned to prevent cuts. No problems with that here.",1224,252

The gray is a medium shade with a smooth finish that won’t pick up hairs and dust. The pink is a metallic magenta that really pops.<br /><br />The speed controls are on the handle. The slide button doesn’t move easily, so there’s not a big chance of accidentally changing the speed/temperature without meaning to. On the back of the handle is the option for either cool or hot temperature.<br /><br />The hair dryer doesn’t dry my hair any faster than any other hair dryer I’ve used. But I like that I can set the temperature to cool to lessen damage and not have to hold in a cool shot button.<br /><br />The hair dryer isn’t as lightweight as some plastic models I’ve used, but it’s weighted pretty well. The weight of it is distributed evenly on both sides of the handle.<br /><br />The attachments have little tabs that line up with notches on the nozzle, and then you twist them to lock them in place. I like it -- there’s less chance of them popping off while I use the hair dryer.<br /><br />The bottom of the hair dryer says the rated power is 1800 watt, which is contrary to the description which says it is 2000 watt.",1224,1557

I worried it would leave behind a sticky feeling, since I could feel it on my arm the whole time it took to dry. But once the gel finally absorbed, I couldn’t feel any residue left behind. I didn’t notice much of any scent either, which is another positive for me.<br /><br />The gel is clear; the plastic bottle is amber colored to help keep light out. I wish the bottle had a flip top or squeeze lid instead of a screw off cap.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is what gives me pause. I’m not sure why sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) would need to be added to the organic aloe leaf juice. The product description mentions “we perfected our serum by enriching with Vitamin E, & Citric Acid for improved nutrient absorption.” I don’t see Vitamin E listed in the ingredients.<br /><br />I will probably end up using this aloe vera gel to make hand sanitizer.

This gel absorbed into my skin after about a minute, without leaving behind a sticky or tacky feeling. I’ve used some aloe vera gels that have left me a sticky mess, but not this one. So I like the quick absorption.<br /><br />The gel does have a slight scent to it. It’s a fresh-smelling scent that sticks around for a while.<br /><br />This Aloe Vera gel would also be great for homemade hand sanitizer.<br /><br />This gel is manufactured in China.",1224,301

I like the pumice in the cleanser, as it gives me a real clean, scrubby feeling.<br /><br />Superior Barrier Skin Cream (individually 4/5 stars):<br />--Actually does help prevent grease or oil from staining my hands. Also helps keep my fingernails from becoming a dirt mess when I weed without gloves. But doesn’t provide much of a moisturizing effect.<br /><br />Superior Healing Hand Cream (individually 3/5 stars):<br />--Truly unscented hand lotion.

The lotion has a medium-weight consistency and gets the job done for about half the day.<br /><br />What I don’t like about this lotion is the scent.

This one is a sort of all-in-one, with the reservoir built into the handle, but I kept getting water bubbles in the tank/tip, which made flossing take a lot longer.<br /><br />There’s only 3 speeds: low, medium, and high. The low is quite low.

The shape of the tube and the shape of the lipstick itself harkens to another era. Perfect for making the ultimate Cupid's bow pout. It even has that slight fragrance that will remind you of vintage lipsticks.<br /><br />I normally wear red that has a little more blue in it, so was surprised that this clear red was fine for me. To me that says that it will flatter a wide range of skin tones.<br />After swiping it on my wrist and then wiping it away, it left a nice stain. If you aren't interested in that drop dead gorgeous look and want something a little more subtle, it does double duty by leaving a pinky red stain when blotted. But go for the high voltage dramatic red if you want to be noticed.<br /><br />Very comfortable lipstick, but I didn't have a problem with it bleeding. Non-drying and non-cracking. Opaque coverage with one swipe.<br />Another plus, it makes your teeth look super white.<br />I hope that this review as well as the photographs can help you to make a decision about this lipstick.

It's a heavy cream, despite the company identifying it as being light and whipped. It looks whipped in the jar, but it is not light on the face. I don't think it would be suitable for all ages. Because of the heaviness and intense moisturizing, I believe that mature skin is going to benefit most from using this.<br />For reference, I'm in my early 60s, in a dry climate, with combination skin (T Zone) and some wrinkles as a point of concern.<br />This cream works very well with all of the above. I don't put it on my nose, of course, but when I feel like a splurge I put it on my hands because it's so moisturizing.<br />The claim that it moisturizes 24/7 is indeed true.

It's activated by water, so after washing your face, leave your face damp and put a thin layer of the gel quickly all over your face. Include your neck if you like.<br />Then with each passing moment, it's going to get foamier and foamier. That's why you have to have a very thin coat. You only need a small amount of product. If you use too much, your face is going to foam up like you have shaving cream all over!<br /><br />After about 5 or 10 minutes, you massage a little bit with warm water and then rinse. After you dry your face it's going to feel squeaky clean. If you have dry skin, you're ready for a moisturizing serum and cream. If you have oily or acne prone skin, use the appropriate products for that skin type. I don't feel that this mask is drying, but it does leave you very clean.<br /><br />So, in my opinion, this is good for all skin types, as long as you use it as a brightening mask as opposed to a hydrating mask.<br />This is just what your skin needs if you have overdosed on hot humid weather.please look at the ingredients to see if you have any sort of allergy or if any of them are a trigger for any skin issues. Because I have sensitive skin that can be triggered, but I only left it on for about 4 minutes. I had absolutely no irritation, but I think if I had left it on longer, I might have. That doesn't mean it's bad for you.

Does that light actually do anything, or is it a gimmick?<br />There are a number of high-priced red light units on the market. They were first used in dermatologist offices and med spas. When they first came out, I had a red Tanda unit. This is exactly the same concept, and yes, you will have a slight difference.<br />The amount of cream gone in the jar has been for about 10 applications. I do it at night so I can relax while holding the unit at various places on my face. The red light goes on when you press slightly on the metal ring, as you can see in the photographs. As you press it to the area of your face that you want treated, slide it from the middle of your face outward, for 3 minutes. Then go to the next area. This way you get a little bit of a lymphatic massage.

However, I tend to agree with them that half the bag was not quite enough and when the bath was full, I couldn't really smell the fragrance anymore with just half the bag.<br /><br />That said, even with just half the bag, I could feel the detoxifying qualities and after the bath I rinsed off well in the shower to remove any of the toxins that had come out through my skin.<br /><br />The sharp, rough rose quartz gem that was included was a bit of a surprise. I would've expected that in a product that you're supposed to dump out into your bathtub, they would've chosen a smoother stone rather than a rough one. It had some serious sharp angles to it. I would definitely recommend fishing it out before dumping the bag in your bath so that you don't scratch your bathtub.

4.0,1556724639735,Desktop Pro 2019 works great; upgrading an existing payroll subscription is awful,"Desktop Pro 2019 upgraded smoothly and easily with absolutely no issues. I began by backing up my QuickBooks desktop Pro 2018, and then began the installation process. It went smoothly and quickly and didn't take very long. I used the express installation which was recommended, and the whole thing was very easily done, retaining all of my previous settings and information.<br /><br />The part that was awful was that I have an existing payroll subscription and had to call into tech-support to upgrade that portion of things. Luckily I was aware of this so when simply entering the information into QuickBooks didn't work, I knew that I was in for a phone call. About 45 minutes later of being on hold and trying to be up sold on QuickBooks online by an Indian tech-support person (hey guys, I just got desktop Pro 2019 upgraded, please don't sell me on QuickBooks online), I was good to go.<br /><br />I think it's absolutely offensive that after you've purchased a software product like this they make you call in as a matter of course to activate. Anybody using this product is either being paid by the hour or runs a business and does not have that kind of spare time to sit around wasting on a process that should be 30 seconds of data entry.<br /><br />I have multiple employees and so end up paying an additional 4 to 8 dollars per month for the subscription to add additional employees. It's another two dollars a month per employee after the first one. Also, be aware that the setting is set to subscribe you to an annual payroll subscription, which if done through QuickBooks will cost you about $420. Purchasing the new upgrade of desktop Pro 2019 with the payroll for a year costs less than that, so being automatically billed such a high amount for just the payroll is offensive and ridiculous.<br /><br />I would really like QuickBooks as a company to reconsider how they deal with their payroll subscriptions and activation of payroll that has already been purchased, because this is a huge problem that is been garnering them poor reviews and lots of bad press for some time. I personally have considered many times changing to a more congenial company just to avoid this particular dance every single year. Do I pay $420 to avoid being on the phone for 45 minutes with somebody from India who act like I've done something terribly wrong by purchasing my payroll upgrade on Amazon along with the software upgrade? Or do I do as I have done most years and purchase the yearly upgrade that comes with the enhanced payroll.<br /><br />As an FYI, the enhanced payroll really does make it very easy to run your quarterly reports and do your e-filing.

It felt reasonably moisturized and looked good. I usually wash twice a week and switch between conditioner and hair mask.

I learned: use less hair, maybe separate top parts from bottom parts, somehow make sure they're dry before removing. I used too much hair in some of mine and they didn't turn out.

There's a barrier cream that can be used as a hand lotion, charcoal exfoliating hand soap, and a thick hand cream. There is a faint scent, but it's clean smelling if anything. The soap says you can use it with or without water. I wouldn't eat anything with my hands without using water with it though. The heavy cream is really nice to out on just before bed, just the tiniest amount will take care of your hands. Both creams soak in quickly and aren't greasy at all.

There aren't any instructions other than to clear the tube in case it gets stuck. It says it's a continuous spray and through a brief trial and error I discovered you pump the handle to prime the spraying mechanism and that makes it basically a continuous spray. The pump is really easy to operate, you can easily squeeze it with one finger. When you put the top back on you have to push it down and then it's just like a half or quarter turn to keep it on. One of the questions was would I take it when I travel and it's a little too bulky to bring it with on all trips. If I think I would need it or have tons of room in my suitcase maybe.",1239,1069

I kept these securely on my feet for the directed amount of time and then took them off and took a shower. A couple days later my right foot started to peel first but got really itchy so i think i scratched off some of the peeling skin. The description says it will peel in about a week and leave skin smooth but my whole foot didnt peel and I still have patches of dried skin and calluses.

It looked horrible; The left side got clumped together and the right side looked like my eyelashes were growing baby eyelashes. Very unnatural looking.

The way it opens leaves my hand too close to the heat which results in easily getting burned. Which isn't a problem if you wear the glove... but being honest, I'm not going to use a heat shield glove every day to do my hair. I only use one of these **sometimes** when I am using a curling wand. So for me that is a huge con. It also comes with two hair clips to help separate the sections of your hair. For the price...

3.0,1563745951752,It's just ok and has a few hiccups,I am always in need of a good curling iron and this one is okay but it is a little bigger than I would like for it to be. I really love all the settings this one has. This has two buttons that control the temperature up or down and it has a little window to show what the current temp is. The maximum temperature is 350 and it reaches that rather quickly. It has a switch that controls the speed of the twirl low or fast. Then there is a button to control the direction you want to curl your hair left or right and it has a home button to return the iron to the correct home position. This has a flipper that is about an inch to start your twirl but it leaves crease marks in your hair that cannot be corrected unless you re-wet it and start all over. It really needed a heat resistant glove because no matter how skilled you are at this you are going to try and wrap your hair with your hand so it is a high probability of user error which will probably result in a burn. This is a really nice gray and white. I do like this curling iron it just has a few hiccups.,1244,2350

4.0,1612239503391,Mini Iron,"I actually like the small size of this curling iron. It gets hot quickly and the temperature is not adjustable. I have fine, color treated hair so using heat protective product is a must with this. It is pretty easy to use. The curls are more like retro style waves. They last a most a day. It is lightweight and ideal for travel.",1263,137
4.0,1610744876429,Stylish,"I really like these velvet hair bands. They are stylish and the buttons are positioned perfectly. They hold my mask securely without slipping or aggravating my ears. There is a nice variety of two leopards and three neutrals, cream, black and gray. It was supposed to be a six pack but I only received five. Mine also were not as wide as depicted. But that being said they are a fashion forward way to keep hair and masks in place.",1263,237
4.0,1582861752285,Perfect for Special Occasions,"These nicely made lashes add drama. Perfect  for special occasions they have length and volume. The black band is flexible. My own lashes are rather sparse so these make a big (and wonderful) difference. But I need something less dramatic for daily use. These are good, reusable, and comfortable on. The glue is NOT included.",1263,1585
3.0,1672169671571,More of a makeup remover than a cleanser,"This product comes in a glass bottle with a pump dispenser. The dispenser has a very small spout, making it difficult to dispense the product without having it run down the side of the bottle. Note that there is oil in the name - it feels like an oil and goes on like an oil, with no foaming or cleansing at all. It also has a strong scent of lavender (which I like, but others may not).<br /><br />This product works well as a remover for eye makeup. However, I don't feel that it does a good job of cleansing my face overall. Although the product rinses clean and leaves my face feeling soft, my face doesn't feel clean, and I feel the need to use an actual cleanser after. I would recommend this product as a eye makeup remover only and would suggest that ""cleanser"" be removed from the name.",1362,2488
4.0,1643400000171,Pretty little red lipstick,"This is a red lipstick in an attractive case. I don't wear a lot of red, as so many of the red lipsticks turn orange-y on me, but this one appeared more blue-based, so I decided to try it. It goes on smoothly and has decent staying power. It does seem to have more blue undertones than some I've tried. However, based on the picture of 3 stacked lips that appears in the item description, I was looking for a result similar to the center one (or top one if you are looking at the lower photo that appears above the reviews), especially given that my skin color is close to the skin of that model, but on me, the color looks more like it does in the bottom photo, with a slightly more orange-y hue. This is not bad if that's what you want; just be aware that your personal result might vary from what is pictured.",1362,1098
4.0,1640548270316,Comfortable cooling sensation,"I was looking for something to help with my dark undereye patches and to generally revive my eyes. I have used these twice now around the holidays when I've been worn out. These comma-shaped masks are easy enough to apply - there is a little spatula thing to help lift them out in order to be sanitary. They have a wet, silicone-like feel that is very similar to the feel of a contact lens, only thicker. I found that they stuck to my skin fairly well, even when I was moving around. The mask felt nice on and was a bit cooling after awhile. The area under my eyes felt refreshed after using these, although I didn't actually notice anything visibly different. These might be worth it if you are simply looking to make your eye area feel better.",1362,2489
4.0,1611157768037,Solid overall cleanser,"I recently started using this product in the shower.  It has a nice gel-like consistency and lathers easily.  The fragrance is a strong cucumber scent, which I didn't like, but luckily it faded quickly.  Overall, this performs well for cleaning the face and leaving it feeling fresh, but it is not a particularly remarkable or different product.",1362,815
3.0,1610408668285,Very thin lotion with an unpleasant initial fragrance,"I love trying different lotions, particularly those that have nice fragrance, but when I received this set, I almost threw it away!  I the bottle, the smell of the lotion is horrible - I found it to have a strong, artificial scent similar to alcoholic spirits.  I decided to give it a try so that I could write an accurate review.  The ""lotion"" is quite thin, much more watery than any other moisturizer I have used.  Just to spread on my elbows requires at least 10 pumps from the tiny bottle.  The good news is that once on the skin, the distasteful fragrance does not last; I didn't really detect much scent at all after that, but there may have been a faint hint of rose in the dry-down.  The moisturization was adequate, nothing more.<br /><br />I do like the Nail & Cuticle Oil, which comes in a little roller bottle and actually DOES have a rose scent.  But this set is absolutely NOT worth the cost, especially given that the lotion is likely to be completely gone after just a few weeks of daily use.  Not recommended.<br /><br />NOTE:  At least one other reviewer (""Jam Blaster"") mentioned the same issue with the lotion smelling bad and gave this product just 1-star as a result.<br /><br />UPDATE, 2/1/21:<br />Since I don't like the scent of this product, I decided to try it on my feet.  Despite the lotion being very thin, I actually found it to work quite well on my feet!  I put it on in the a.m., then put on socks; by the end of the day, my feet definitely felt soften and smoother.  I think the product is too expensive to purchase for this reason alone, but it does work, and so I increased my rating to 3-star.",1362,448
4.0,1607024174411,Somewhat helpful for improving lashes,"I have been using this product for several weeks now.  I choose the option for the ""mascara brush"" style, as I thought this might be easier to use than the thin brush styles I've tried in the past.  My results with this were mixed.  First, the product is barely discernible on the brush!  It seems only completely dry; more product gets on the wand part than on the brush end.  Second, the brush is plastic and feels VERY harsh; a brush with soft bristles might have been better.<br /><br />That being said, this product has seemed to help my lashes somewhat.  The effect isn't very noticeable with bare lashes, but when I use mascara, my lashes do look thicker and longer than they would normally.  I have used this product on my eyebrows too and have seen some improvement there as well.  I wish this was a little easier to use; I would rate it about three and a half stars.",1362,2491
3.0,1603576496847,"Decently longevity and appearance, but some shades not wearable","This lipstick set comes in 2 sets of 5, Set A and Set B.  I wound up only opening the ""A"" set, as after trying these 5 and finding only 2 to work for me, I decided to give the ""B"" set away.  From the photos, I thought that the colors would be nice and muted, but that's not really the case.  The color I am wearing in the photo is ""Almost Friday,"" which is a pretty neutral, nude-ish pink.  I also kept ""Blush for Me,"" a light, brownish peach.  The red shade, ""Red for Me,"" was very bright and didn't seem to belong to the rest of this collection.  But the other shades seemed MUCH less intense than in the product photos.  Rather than buying a set of 10 like this, I think most people would be better off choosing individual shades that work best for them.<br /><br />Two other things to note.  When I opened one of the lipsticks, the color cylinder popped out and onto my floor, so I wonder about quality.  Also, to open the tubes, you have to unscrew them rather than simply pull the top off.  This might be good for some who carry around lipsticks in a bag, but for quick everyday use, it's annoying.",1362,2492
5.0,1545666938036,Really seems to work for me!,"My eyelashes are thin, sparse, and short (like my hair, haha).  I had a eyelash grower product that seemed to work for me before, so I thought I would give this one a try.  My previous one stressed to only apply once per day, before bed; this one encourages you to apply twice per day.  I started with once at bedtime but then began adding mornings too.<br /><br />This definitely seems to work for me!  Now, if you are expecting full, lush lashes, I think that's unlikely--at least that's not what happened for me.  For me, this product added length but not really any fullness.  And the length is mainly noticeable when I use mascara--my lashes actually hold the mascara and look significantly longer.  Also, it only takes a week or two to see results!  My only complaint is that this is a tiny tube, and after just a few weeks, there doesn't seem to be much product left.  Still, overall I really like this product and would recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/18/19:<br />I am still using this product, although I think I might be getting to the end.  It is still giving me longer lashes.  I attached a photo to provide an idea of how it works for me.  I am wearing mascara for this photo, but even with mascara, my lashes would NOT usually come all the way close to my brows like they are in this photo!  But you can also see that while my lashes are longer, they are still pretty thin/sparse.  Given this, I think this product would work best for those who have thicker but short lashes.",1362,1095
4.0,1678383652271,"Good Product, Deluxe Travel Size","I love Moroccanoil products. I have their full size Color Care Conditioner but this one I ordered is the deluxe travel size - TSA friendly and easy to pack for travel, but the amount is not a lot and you will use this up easily if you wash your hair frequently. The price is high for the amount so it's not a great value - I would just purchase the large size and transfer some to an empty 3 or 4 oz bottle so you can get it through airport security.",1375,425
3.0,1674614136635,Moisturizing But No Firming,"This cream feels great on my skin and is readily absorbed but I have been using it for months now and haven't seen any ""firming"" effect. For the current price it's too high for what it does - which is being an effective moisturizer. There are many products out there that hydrate your skin - I usually prefer olive oil-based products. This one doesn't change the sagginess around my neck so only three stars from me!",1375,978
2.0,1646488985828,Another Product for the Landfill,"This is more like a gimmick than a functional ""nail dust"" vacuum. I was hoping I could use this mini vacuum for cleaning up crumbs as well. It runs on batteries but the suction level is average and I have to go over the space with the vacuum several times before it picks up anything. The idea is good only if it has strong power but you can tell it's cheaply made. Another item for the landfill, thanks AOERM (yet another meaningless and unpronounceable brand name from the land of junk)",1375,798
4.0,1639759173217,Inspirational Gift Set for Teenage Girl,"I think this set would make a nice present for a teenage girl. It comes with a makeup mirror, cosmetic gift bag and ceramic dish that you can use to hold jewelry. The design is rather simplistic but the quality is good for this sort of thing. It's like those items you might find at TJ Maxx. I think the price is a little high for what it is - it's not bad but not great either. It would make a good goody bag item but I wouldn't spend too much for it.",1375,194
5.0,1633398883633,"High Quality Roller, Better Than the Quartz Ones","Sand & Sky makes great products. It's only natural that they should extend their skincare line with this massage tool. I own many quartz facial rollers but this one is high quality and well-made. It works similar to the ReFa carat tool but without the high price tag. It pinches your skin a bit when you roll it but that's necessary to improve skin circulation. In addition to anti-aging benefits, it's also great for smoothing out any moisturizer or makeup foundation you've applied and prevents caking. Overall it's a great tool and I love using mine with Sand & Sky gels and moisturizers.",1375,373
4.0,1629155514489,"Very Small, Great for Travel","These are very small towelettes that come in a small sealed packet. It's perfect for travel given its small size but I needed at least 2 towelettes to wipe down my entire face. That means it will be used up very quickly so the value is average. The towelettes aren't particularly strong either - I tore one just pulling it out of the package. There is also no alcohol in the formula so it's best used for wiping your face rather than disinfecting your hands - for that you're better off using something with alcohol in it to kill the germs. As a result, this bundle of towelettes has limited usefulness - it's good for a light face cleaning or to finish the job left by a facial cleanser.<br /><br />I like the fact that it's paraben free and has no scent to irritate my allergies. Overall it's good but not great.",1375,2239
5.0,1628552514391,Good Quality Stone and Roller,"This is a decent rose quartz roller and gua sha stone. The quality is pretty good, on par with similar sets I've ordered. The rose gold hardware is attractive and the roller doesn't make a squeaking sound as you roll it across your face, unlike some of the lower quality sets I've seen. The gua sha stone isn't perfect (it has several small nicks across its surface) but since you use the edges of the stone and not the middle, it doesn't affect the function. Overall I like the quality of this set. It comes in a generic box (there are so many of these), but is ready for gift giving.",1375,389
5.0,1622566101767,Reminiscent of a Subscription Box But High Priced,"This set reminds me of one of the ""subscription boxes"" that are sent out every month or quarterly. Everything in it is geared toward a theme - mindfulness, stress relief and relaxation. The sizes are all small - the shower gel, the candle, the pillow spray, the roll on. It's a small, thoughtful box for someone who needs some downtime. The candle smells great and is small enough to take with you on a trip. The other items are TSA friendly. Overall this is a pleasant box but I felt the price was way too high - for that price, I feel it should have included an additional item, like a white noise machine, sleep mask or some other stress relief item.",1375,2255
5.0,1620482003076,Pretty Comb But Not Space Saving,"This comb is made with thick wood - while it's not heavy (it's surprisingly lightweight), it's chief disadvantage is that it takes up more room in a drawer. I'm not sure what is to be gained by its thickness (the teeth, after all, are normal) other than to exaggerate the fact that it's made of wood. I think it's made to be more of a display piece than a functional one, so if you have space to display it on a dresser table, it's certainly worthy of that. It has a nice design and comes across as well made. In the end, however, it's just a comb and while I appreciate its decorativeness, it's one of that space hogging pretty things that make sense only if you like displaying beautiful things.",1375,222
4.0,1615412675371,"Kind of Garish and Loud, More Like Costume Jewelry","This is a pretty headband with lots of sparkly rhinestones and colorful stones. The embellishments look almost too pretty for a headband and I wish I could remove the stones and make a necklace or brooch out of them. The headband is comfortable to wear though I feel like I'm wearing headphones at times because of its thickness. As it is, the colors are a little garish and over the top, so I wouldn't wear this as a serious wardrobe accessory but rather as a whimsical adornment to a costume or a 1950s style event. I think a teenager would love it.",1375,1844
2.0,1611856389557,"Cheap Looking, Best for a Teenage Girl","I'm disappointed in the look of this pink jeweled headband. The crystal beads look cheap and the headband seems made for a teenage girl. I was hoping for sparkly pink rhinestones but they're actually plastic faceted beads, the same kind you'd sew on the cuff of a sweater. They're kind of blah and look chintzy. It comes in a zip loc bag with a dust cloth with the company's unpronounceable name printed on it. Disappointed.",1375,2136
4.0,1608137302289,Powerful Nail Lamp,"I've reviewed many nail lamps and I like this one because of the color, the ease of operation and how quickly it dries my nails. It has a wide mouth so you can put both hands in if your hands are small and the same goes with your feet.<br />The LED screen is bright and easy to read. It has a strong UV light but you can adjust the speed so you can use just enough to dry your nails (too much may be bad for your hands). Overall it's a decent nail lamp but the price feels a little high for this type of item.",1375,1549
4.0,1607806639435,Average Body Wash,"This has a strong scent of mango, which is quite appealing. Outside of that, the body wash doesn't lather that well and the consistency of the wash is on the thin side. It's cleans well but other than the mango scent I wasn't impressed by it. The price isn't too high though it's a rather small bottle. Overall it's OK but I don't love it enough to order it again.",1375,727
2.0,1606578853404,Awful Scent,"I was looking forward to getting this, as I love perfume and hoped to use this on a trip. Each towelette is infused with the ""Pinrose"" scent so you can dab it on your neck, arms, and wherever. It's space saving as each sealed packet contains a towelette. It reminds me of what you might get at a hotel. Unfortunately I absolutely hated the scent. It literally made me want to gag. It isn't floral or sweet but some kind of awful chemical smell. This is one of those things you really can't buy online sight unseen, you need to smell it first.",1375,79
3.0,1606166599435,"Average Quality, Nice Design","You're getting a set of two shower caps with a leopard print design on them - one that's silver with black leopard prints and the other is the conventional brown with black spots. ach one comes separately sealed in a ziploc bag, so you could easily gift one to a friend if you chose. The caps are on the small side - good for a child and an average adult-sized head but not good if you have a large head.  The price is low but then you get what you are paying for - the quality is average - better than a 99 cent discount store but made of a cheap synthetic fiber that doesn't feel that durable or long term. OK but only moderately better than the throwaway caps you might get at a hotel.",1375,2513
4.0,1605749827955,Bag of Tear-Shaped Soaps,"In these COVID times, staying clean is a priority and anything related to soap and sanitation is all the rage. Since I don't travel much anymore, I felt a bit nostalgic when I saw this bag of six soaps. Each one is tear-shaped and about the size of a hotel travel soap. I really like the scent and it lathers well - best of all it's made without the toxic chemicals most mainstream soaps and body washes are filled with. It has a refreshing scent, thanks to being made with essential oils.<br /><br />It's advertised as a soap that ""boosts immunity"" but I find that laughable - everyone is reminded constantly to wash your hands as a way to prevent the spread of COVID and that action, you could say, ""boosts"" your immunity given that COVID is no match for soap. But to say the soap gives you some immunity is a bit of a stretch. Except for this questionable marking slogan, I liked these soaps.",1375,729
4.0,1603558302113,Refreshing Soap for Your Face as Well as Your Body,"This black soap bar feels as thick as a brick but feels great on my skin. It's made with activated charcoal and has the coloring of charcoal, but thankfully not the scent! Under a hot shower it releases a nice minty scent and the hardy soap appears to less vulnerable to melting away in the soap dish unlike other softer soaps I've used. It's made for men but I don't see why women can't use it as well, as it's refreshing. It's best used for the face, as it cleans out your pores, but as I wash my face and body in the shower at the same time, it's a perfect face body combination soap.",1375,2515
4.0,1603469377574,"Beautiful Bottle, May Use This as a Hand Soap","I have a weakness for beautifully decorated soap bottles. This Bouquet Garni bottle looks great and I'm tempted to use this as a hand soap rather than as a body wash just so I can display it on my sink. As for the scent, ""White Musk"" I don't like it as much. It's OK, but I prefer lavender but thought I'd give it a try. As a wash, it foams up nicely and leaves my skin feeling soft and cleansed. It's made in Korea, home to many high qualty skin care companies so I trust its quality (more so than if it's from China!).<br /><br />Again, I love the bottle so I'll be sure to re-use it after the body wash is all gone, but if I had to do it again, I'd choose a different scent. But if you're a white musk fan, go for it!",1375,296
4.0,1603414240825,"Refreshing Scent, Easy to Use","The only thing I didn't like about this shower ""foam"" is how quickly it will be used up. It comes in a relatively small caninster and it comes out like shaving foam, only it's for the body and not for the face. It feels great and helps clear my stuffed sinuses. The scent is ""mint and rosemary"" but I feel like it's mostly mint. It's a step up above your ordinary shower gel but it won't likely last as long, as it's hard to tell how much of the bottle you are actually using since it's not liquid. Except for that caveat, I liked this.",1375,733
5.0,1603022205313,Great for travel,"I usually pack travel size bottles of facial cleanser. This package comes as 20 individually wrapped towelettes, not dissimilar to what you might find in a hotel or airline first class amenity kit. They look like dry wipes but once you add water, it suds up really well and is perfect for washing your face free of makeup. It can also be reused as a regular wipe after the first use, just hang up and let dry. There isn't much of a scent, which is fine by me as strong fragranced wipes are bad for my allergies. Overall a nice product though not the most environmentally friendly with all the packaging.",1375,739

This is the secret behind the success of Ipsy and Birchbox. You get five travel sizes of the most popular and bestselling items sold by Caudalie: an eye cream, radiance serum, moisturizing sorbet, foaming cleanser, and beauty elixer. The eye cream was nice but I didn't see any effect on my wrinkles; the radiance serum made my skin feel great, as did the moisturizing sorbet. I think I liked the cleanser the most and the beauty elixer the least (it didn't do much for me). Considering that each one is costly for a full size version, it's great to be able to know which one is right for me before purchasing. To top it off, it comes in a beige canvas cosmetic travel bag decorated with grapes. Very nice.",1375,82

They feel sturdier than the swabs that have plastic handles - I use these to clean my ears but also to dab Listerine along my gumline to help fight gingivitis.

Each one is individually sealed which is convenient and hygienic, versus those where you have a resealable package and risk drying out the other towels if it's not sealed properly. I will also use these when I go hiking or camping. They are biodegradable so it's also better for the environment. Recommended.",1375,2516
4.0,1591400756313,Great as a Styling Wax - Hold Is Not as Strong,"I think it works better as a styling wax - it didn't stiffen my hair as much as I would have liked, but the cream made it a breeze to style. The scent is a little strong but it's pleasant. I think this product could be used by both men and women though it's obviously intended for men. This product is made in England and the graphics are pleasant to look at it - it has a quaint Victorian vibe about it. Overall I'm pleased with the product but the price could be better",1375,1077
5.0,1591124149911,Soft and Flexible to Wear,This headband is soft and flexible. It keeps my hair from falling into my eyes when I do my morning routine of washing my face.

4.0,1582918494019,Huge Bath Pillow with Suction Cups,"This is miles away from the small inflatable bath pillow you see at 99 cent stores. The pillow is huge and provides a lot of support for your head. It's held securely in place by the suction cups.<br /><br />This is a nice gift for anyone who takes a lot of baths. However, if you only do so occasionally, you might find that the size of this pillow might be a deterrent. It's not space saving and does take up a lot of room for storage. That would be my only critique.",1375,1136
3.0,1568059668741,Turns the Tips of Your Nails Yellow,"UPDATED Review:<br />I took off one star because the tips of my nails turned yellow (and stayed that way for a few days) after using this product. Using ordinary nail polish didn't have that effect.<br /><br />Previously:<br />These are convenient for travel but I found that using one pad just isn't enough to remove the nail polish from both hands, especially if you have glitter or gel. When you rip open the packet, the cloth is heavily saturated with nail remover and when you unfold it it's about the size of one of those wet naps you get when you eat greasy food. I draped the cloth over both hands and pressed my nails against it, but though I used every inch of the cloth and squeezed out as much product as I could, I still had leftover polish on the edges of my fingers. Not wanting to waste a whole other cloth to finish the job, I blotted the remainder using a cotton ball and my usual polish remover.<br /><br />Overall, it's strong and will remove most of your polish, but the cost of this product is higher than if you stocked up on a few bottles of nail polish remover and used cotton balls. But if you're traveling, it would definitely be  more convenient and I suppose that's what you're be paying for. But be prepared to use 2 cloths at a time to get it all off, which adds up to only 5 uses.",1375,2302

This set contains a beautiful rose pink quarter roller with two tiny bottles containing quartz crystals. I love the bottles but the downside is absolutely no instructions are given as how to use them. If you add essential oils, you usually need a carrier oil (like coconut) because they are not good for your skin if applied directly. I'm not sure how the crystals would mitiate this or not, as they're just little rocks. As a result, I'm not sure how to use these.<br /><br />The roller itself, however, is of good quality and I've been using it frequently.

As a result, you aren't able to tell one from the other unless you open each one and then mark down the numbers for your reference.<br /><br />I like the look of the red and gray finishes more than the others, but to dry your nails fully you have to purchase a LED nail lamp. I didn't have one especially made for nails but I had a table lamp that uses LED. It worked, but I'm sure if I used the LED Nail lamp the drying time would have been faster.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant and I like the glossy finish. There hasn't been any serious chipping or loss of polish for a week now, but I've used other gel polishes that have lasted almost as long as the LED kind.

4.0,1664842264557,Nothing spectacular. I have received more... for this price.,"This Hair Removal Device by Ulike just as well as a couple of other IPL devices I have that cost much less. It comes packaged nicely, though I kept trying to open the flat two-sided green piece that covers the accessory side. It doesn't open.<br />The device does look quite fancy, and I was interested in skin rejuvenation, which is in one of the photos (that is mentioned in the other listing that shows this exact same device). The instruction booklet contains about as much as the empty listing page that I ordered it from. That page has no bullet points, only one photo.<br />They do have another listing for this same exact device, showing the accessories, extra photos with bits of information, and bullet points telling a little about it. I got my information from there.<br />The device does have the cooling feature, as many others do, which helps it not to zap too badly. It also comes with a razor and eye protection.<br />What it lacks, that many others include that are in or around this price range, is more attachments for the device. There needs to be at least one smaller light head for use around the lip area, as it's very hard to use the main one with the device being so large.<br />This IPL device works pretty much as well as any other, with none having the ability to make you completely hair-free at any point in the future. As far as the studies that I have seen, with diligent use, home IPL devices can only offer a little better than 50-60%-ish less hair.<br />My preferred device, which costs very little more than this one, has several attachments, including some specifically for skin rejuvenation. You do get a fancy box with this device, and it looks nice, but I don't think it provides any more or less than devices that cost much less.<br />I haven't found one yet that really only takes 10 minutes to do your legs, but if I ever do, that is the one that would probably take the cake! If you like fancy boxes and a sleek-looking device, I would recommend this one.",1667,2823

This applies so easily for me, cures as expected, and looks great. I am even able to build an apex.<br />The brush and other accessories are sub-par, like what most inexpensive sets have. They will do well for a newbie, until they figure out if they like the process. Then, they can replace them with better quality items.<br />The slip solution is confusing to be in a builder gel kit, though I find it great for wiping the sticky layer off the nails after application. It can also be used to clean the brush handle, and any other sticky places.<br />I am more than happy with the quality, viscosity, and end results I achieve with this builder gel.

The description of the scent profile really enticed me, as I love all of the notes.

5.0,1620378771291,Much more than just hyaluronic acid! Very moisturizing and best fitting for my face. 5 stars⭐,"I love these masks! For the price and how many you get, I was surprised to find the plastic backing. I really like this, because I can open it up and make a few cuts using the plastic and its cutouts as my guide to make it easier. I cut right through the plastic and the mask at the same time. I always have to cut a little slit at both the inner and outer corners of the eye openings, and also the outer corners of the mouth opening, as I like to move my mouth a bit and I have extremely dry eyes and the serum always gets into them, if I don't. This also lets it lay down flat on my nose and eyebrows better. I also cut four slits at about 10 and 2 o clock and 4:30 and 7:30, or roughly equal spacing coming upward diagonally from my eyes and coming down and outwards diagonally from the corners of my mouth. My face is a bit small, and this helps me to be able to overlap those areas and make them fit better, especially with larger masks. With these, I have to do the shallowest cutting ever, because they fit so well. They cover my entire face better than any mask I've used. I haven't had a problem with them lifting up or drying out at all. It also helps with something I will share later in my review.<br />It takes a little finagling, but I manage to squeeze a bit of the serum off the mask while removing it from the package. I start before I even open the package by pushing all the serum to the bottom. I cut the top open, grab the top of the Mask, and fold the sides of the package inward, almost in half, using my non-dominant hand. I start pulling out the mask while squeezing the top closed around it as best I can. This squeezes out a good bit of the way too much extra serum that comes out if I don't do this.<br />I love hyaluronic acid, but these masks have so many more wonderful ingredients than just that. Almost every ingredient is so nutrient-rich or moisturizing for the skin. I use Retin-A and these are the most soothing masks 1 to 2 days after my application nights, which are every 3 nights. These moisturize my face so well and they feel great while I have them on. I don't want to take them off when the timer goes off. There's plenty of serum in the package to use elsewhere, like on your neck & decollete, and even on your hands. I always put a moisturizer on afterwards to hold all the nutrients and moisture in properly.<br />I learned a trick while back from another reviewer that I've been doing since I read it. When taking a mask off my face, I cut it into 4 pieces. Mainly, I cut them apart at the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas, using the four diagonal cuts I made, but you can make the cuts as you wish. I usually discard the small pieces that cover the nose and upper lip. I then take those four pieces, put them back in the serum that's left in the package remoisten them, with these that is no problem, or just add a little hyaluronic acid serum to moisten them again, put them on my neck and decollete area the best I can, and wait another 15 or 20 minutes. This really lets me get the most possible use out of every mask.<br />I really love these masks and all of the skin loving ingredients they contain. They make my face feel wonderful afterwards and the effects last all day, if not longer. These are definitely on my must-have list. Highly recommend!",1667,1133

As a hair stylist, you do not want to use a product that contains formaldehyde and apply heat to it. You certainly do not want to use it every 6 weeks, as it's harmful to your health. It can cause breathing issues among other things. It's very hard to believe that I even saw actual formaldehyde on the back of this product, and so high up in the ingredients list.<br />Even hair stylist must wear protective gear, such as gloves, aprons, masks, and be trained how to safely work with this hazardous chemical. Salons must have adequate ventilation and follow strict protocols regarding blow dryer temperatures and monitor formaldehyde levels at all times when they provide Keratin Treatments containing formaldehyde because of the immediate and long term health dangers.This is something you cannot possibly do at home.<br />Also, the pretreatment that you add to the shampoo is extremely strong and stripping to your hair. When they say add just a little, no one knows what that means. That particular product, or the two main ingredients, should only be a small percentage of the product you're adding it to. I don't think you can mix this properly at home without causing damage to your hair and/or your skin.<br />I ""might"" use the shampoo and conditioner, but I will not touch the pre-treatment nor will I touch the DIY home keratin treatment. Over the course of a few treatments, I can see this product going really awry for some people. They will end up with damaged hair and possibly other problems. It is not safe. I absolutely would not recommend it!",1667,12
4.0,1614679036865,"Very moisturizing, but leaves too much oil behind. 3.5 stars ✨","The name of these masks really throws you off. It makes you think they are supposed to be used with an LED light, but they are not. Upon opening one of the mask packages, I wasn't expecting a gooey, in between a cream and lotion, to start leaking out. It's not like a Serum at all.<br />The mask itself is quite thin, but it's not at all easy to tear. I read that one reviewer commented that it rips easily. On the contrary, it's quite difficult to even tear it. I actually had to use scissors to cut it for a use that I will explain later. It is a good size, covering all areas quite well. The cutouts for the eyes are quite small, which I like because it really gets to the under-eye area without it getting into your eyes.<br />I left it on for 20 minutes, and then did as another reviewer did, and cut it up and put it on my neck & decollete for another 20 minutes, with the rest of the cream/lotion that was left in the package.<br />This mask is extremely moisturizing and did not sink into my skin completely afterwards. I had used Retin-A the night before, so my face was quite dry, and really needed moisture and nutrients. But, I think it is a little too oily for my skin. My skin was still so oily hours later that I had to blot it with a microfiber facial cloth. The next day my skin felt great, though, without any ill effects.<br />These are very moisturizing and emollient masks, and would be great for someone with extremely dry skin. For me, I think these will work well using them once a week or every other week, when my skin is at its driest. For five masks, I think the price point is just right. I would definitely recommend these. Especially for those with very dry skin.",1667,2361
4.0,1613726358633,"Very hydrating, but left my face sticky. 4 stars ✨","This is only my second time using a face mask, and this one was a much better experience than the last. I chose the morning to do the mask while I was having my morning coffee, checking the computer, and using my LED White light therapy lamp. The Mask itself is made of a very durable fabric like material that does not tear. The serum is nice and silky feeling without any scent, that I could tell. I appreciate that, as I have a sensitivity to certain smells.<br />For me, the mask was a little bit short on the forehead and not wide enough on the cheeks. I don't have a large face at all, and I had quite a bit of skin left to cover around the sides and top.<br />There's an ample amount of serum left in the package that I was able to keep re-wetting the mask with, as it seemed to dry fairly quickly. I also rubbed some on my neck and decollete. I left it on for about an hour, so that my skin could soak in as much as possible. I then used the mask to rub the rest on my neck, decollete, and the backs of my hands. I wanted to make use of every bit I could. I use Retin-A on my face, and had done a treatment the night before, so my skin really needed the hydration and nourishment. It looked and felt very hydrated and nourished afterwards.<br />The only thing I did not care for was that my skin was very sticky after removing the mask, and it stayed that way. I ended up having to take a damp cloth and blotting it off. After that, my face felt a bit greasy, and I had to keep blotting it until it was time for my bedtime skincare routine.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed using this mask and will be using it at least once a week. It is very hydrating and nourishing, I just wish it didn't leave the sticky and greasy feeling behind. Maybe, I left it on too long, as I do have combination normal to oily skin. Next time I will only leave it on for about 15 minutes, as I think that may work much better for me. I would definitely recommend this mask, but would also recommend starting with less time than I did if you have combination to oily skin.",1667,446
3.0,1613555086658,"Somewhat good in theory, not so great in reality. 2.5 Stars ✨","This mirror really wants to be elegant looking. It has a pearlized finish with some elegant swirls at the top, but it really just looks like a plastic vanity mirror that should come with one of the Barbie mannequin heads that little girls put makeup on and do their hair.<br />The mirror has three light settings, bright white, really yellow, and I'm assuming a daylight, which is the only light I can somewhat see myself a little bit with it on. Really, it's just awful trying to see in this mirror with the light on. This is the first lighted mirror that I've experienced this with. For some reason, the light seems to shadow your face somehow, or either it's just the wrong color or brightness, and you can hardly see yourself in the mirror at all. And, no matter which mirror I want to look in, I have to pick the mirror up and bring it close to my face. And even then, I feel like I'm looking at light, and not my face being brightened by the light.<br />Also, once put together, the fold out mirrors do not stay flush when folded in. It gives it the look like you've broken it and are just living with it like that. And, I find the fold out mirrors very cumbersome to look at myself in them, with the light on or off. Especially the bottom one that has the most magnification, which really should have been on the top, in my opinion. If I don't pick it up, I have to bend way down to see in the bottom one, and then I can only see half of my face if the light is on. The other half is in a shadow, whether the light is on or off. The upper mirror is just as hard to see in, as my face is shadowed on one side very heavily if the light is on. It's just an awkward design.<br />This mirror seemed somewhat good in theory, but because of the very poor design and the lack of quality materials, it is rendered nearly useless. Each mirror, in and of itself, is nice and clear and seems great. One might think of recycling them, or a young girl may find better use of this vanity mirror as she's playing dress up, or learning to do makeup. For myself, because I cannot see into it with the lights on, as it's meant to be used, and I don't find it aesthetically pleasing to display, I will not be using it.",1667,1545
4.0,1611654159665,Nice quality bottles with lots of the goodies! 5 stars ✨,"These are good quality thick amber colored bottles, and they arrived very well packed. I love that they come with a funnel, labels, marking pen, a dropper, and screw top lids along with the sprayer tops. They work great for making my witch hazel facial toner spray and colloidal silver spray. The sprayers work pretty well, although the sprayer part spins around freely. It makes them feel a little clumsy and uneasy to grab hold of. The price for these is on the high side of what I would normally pay for a set like this. Aside from those couple things, they are very nice quality bottles that come with lots of goodies.",1667,234
2.0,1609415095648,These are not USDA certified oils. 2 stars ✨,"First, I will say these oils seem fine. They work well together or apart, mixed into other skincare products or alone. I use these types of oils to make my own facial oil mix or to add to my moisturizer.<br />The thing I absolutely hate that companies do to try to sell their products is to say things that aren't true. The USDA does not certify oils - food, cosmetic, or otherwise. The fact that the bottle says this product is USDA certified on one side, and the other side says not intended for ingestion should speak volumes. The USDA certifies and regulates the welfare and production of food products; meaning products that you ingest. So, why on earth would they certify a product you cannot ingest? The bottle also makes outright claims of known cures from using these oils. There is no disclaimer on either bottle that states that these claims have not been approved or proven by the FDA, or whatever the disclaimer is that is mandatory. There are ingredients listed, one ingredient for each product, the oil, and that's it. Nothing tells how these oils were extracted. Therefore, we do not know if they are refined or unrefined. They probably don't know either. So you see, therein lies the lies and deception.<br />These oils would be much better if they weren't tied to lies. Because you know what they say about lies... if you tell one you have to tell more to keep up with the first one. Is what they say in the bottle really what's in the bottle? Are they pure oils or mixed with a lesser oil? Oils are greasy. If they are unrefined, why aren't they greasy? When you refine oils, you take away a lot of their natural properties and their nutritive value, is that why they aren't greasy? Because of the lies and lack of important information, I really don't know for sure what these oils are.<br />Because of the deceptive practices and claims made, I would not recommend these or any of their other oils.",1667,140
3.0,1609114164865,Nice but missing the clips... 3 stars ✨,"These travel-size bottles are really nice. I love that they are a larger size so that I can use them for hand sanitizer and facial care products. The ones for hand sanitizer can easily fit in my handbag and carry bag, and the ones for my facial care products fit nicely on the small caddy I have in my bathroom. They are easy to fill from my large pump containers, which is a plus. My only issue is that mine are missing the clips that go on them. It's not so terrible for the few that I use in my bathroom, but it is for the ones I use for hand sanitizer. It makes it harder to find them in my purse and bag. Hopefully, no one else has this problem. I would definitely recommend them if you get the clips.",1667,2830
5.0,1607237132135,So many butterflies it's hard to choose! 5 stars ✨,"Wow! This set comes with so many different types of butterflies. I love how the butterfly stickers come in so many different colors that no matter what color polish should you choose to wear, there are so many butterflies that will go with it. Some of my favorite ones are the butterfly outlines that are shiny or holographic. Most of the color ones also shimmer, which is so beautiful.<br />I like that there are butterflies that are flying sideways and also complete butterflies. It gives nail art a lot more interest. Having the glitter butterflies is a bonus to play around with encapsulating. With this sticker and glitter kit, there are so many nail art designs you can create. I've done several, but my mind is filled with endless possibilities. Highly recommended! 5 stars ✨",1667,836

I thought this would be something new to try altogether.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this fabric is awful to wear in your hair. I am a seamstress and it is definitely synthetic and feels like it. It's slippery, hot, and doesn't' feel nice at all. The design seems like an afterthought, as it will not stay in place.<br /><br />So, I've had a big change of plans! I will be using these during my skincare routine and putting on my makeup. At least these headbands will get some use.

4.0,1598739212520,Acrylic girl tries Polygel for the first time...crazy different!,"This was my first experience with poly gel, and I can't say that it was an easy and straightforward one. I did do some research and watched several videos to learn the process before even venturing into trying my own. Boy, I had NO idea what I had gotten myself into... This is nothing like my beloved Acrylics! But, for a little laugh, and a few Pro ""lift proof"" tips along the way, I've added a video at the top to show my adventure.<br /><br />First, none of the nail forms seem to come close to fitting any of my nails properly, and my mind could not even grasp this whole strange concept not one bit. So, I just added a tip and began to apply the gel as I would acrylic. The gel is extremely thick and sticky and very hard to work with, unlike the gel from the past. The kit did not include a slip solution, which would be hard for those just starting out and may not have 70% alcohol at home. I did have some, but it really didn't help, aside from keeping the brush clean, as the gel was so thick and almost unworkable. It took me about 20 minutes to complete one nail from start to finish, including polish. <br /><br />It was quite frustrating that none of the boxes for the Polish were marked, neither did they have curing times noted. The instructions also did not include this information for the polishes. But, in the end, I had a pretty nice looking poly gel nail for the first time ever.<br /><br />I appreciate that the kit comes with all the necessities, aside from the slip solution. It also contains quite a few glitters and tapes to get creative. The light is very small, but it gets the job done, even if it takes a few extra seconds. Once the nail is cured, you get a very hard and shiny finish. The polishes are very nice, although I don't care for a few of the colors myself, the topcoat is very thick.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice kit. I enjoyed the learning experience and will likely play around with it again. And, I may try those strange nail form attachment things. Although I could have done over half a set of nails in acrylic in the time it took to do my one nail in polygel~~ everyone has to start somewhere, it's always fun to learn something new and the first time usually takes the longest.<br /><br />I would recommend this kit for those starting out new and fresh, or those who are seasoned a bit doing poly gel. You definitely get a lot for your money, and you will get a nice strong nail from this kit. I'm giving 4 stars ✨ for the lack of information on the packaging and instructions on colors and curing times. But, I really do think I will like it much better once I get the hang of it.",1667,2835
3.0,1597647367195,"Why didn't they add another magnet, so you can trim them?","This was my first magnetic eyeliner and eyelash kit. The eyeliner works great and the lashes adhere very well. The eyelashes themselves are beautiful and I love the lengths. The liner is easy to put on and so are the lashes. And, they stay on very well, with one exception.<br /><br />The eyelashes are too wide for my eyes, and I need to cut the last magnet off for them to fit properly. But, when I do that the outer end flips up and makes the lashes look terrible. If I don't cut them, they stick into the inner corner of my eyes, causing major irritation and immediately flip up, also making them look terrible. <br />I feel like they need one more magnet on the outer end, close to the last magnet. Because, most people need to trim any and all eyelashes, in order to make them fit their eyes better. In every video I've ever watched with glue on lashes, the person always has to trim the eyelashes just a little bit shorter in width. Why didn't the manufacturers of these eyelashes think that it would not be the same for these lashes?<br /><br />I love the concept, and really wish that these worked for me, because I have very dry eyes and cannot wear eye makeup and mascara. They just need another magnet!",1667,1870

I’ve tried a couple different versions and found this one to be good, if it fits your dog’s paws.<br />I have a golden retriever. The box I received said “medium” and it works for her, though it’s a little tight. There are a lot of silicone bristles inside and while that’s good for cleaning, if you’re on the borderline of it fitting your dog, too many bristles make it difficult to get your dog’s paws in and out and to agitate the cup enough to clean. I didn’t see a size noted when I ordered, so I’m not quite sure if it’s possible to order different sizes since I don’t see that info on the Amazon page, just on the box I received.<br />Cleaning the cup is easy - just rinse if the water isn’t too dirty or unscrew the top and remove the silicone bristle insert for a deeper clean.<br />The included towel is nice and fluffy, but only the size of a standard washcloth. My dogs feet come out pretty wet, so the cloth is soaked by the time I’m done wiping her feet. I use a towel instead.",1691,2865

4.0,1635091963994,"Nice cream, gimmicky packaging","When I opened this package, I had no idea what I was looking at. Inside the Amazon packaging bag was another bag, a plastic bag with a bubble wrap lining and a ziplock type zipper. Inside that, was what looked like a syringe. Honestly, I was at first convinced I had the wrong order as I had no recollection of ordering anything matching what I was seeing. Upon further investigation, I discovered it was the Play Pretend brand of under eye cream. Yes, the Amazon product page does state the the cream comes in a syringe-like tube, and yes, it does state that it comes with a skincare travel bag, this wasn’t what I had envisioned.<br />On to the product…<br />Once I figured out how to open and operate the syringe (hint: remove the large, clear cap, remove the white tip, turn the plunger to unlock) to dispense the under eye cream, I applied some to my face. The scent is strong, like cucumber with an underlying perfume smell. Not unpleasant, but kind of strong for me, someone who is overly sensitive to scents. My problem, I know, and most people will probably really enjoy the scent. The cream is white, smooth, goes on evenly and is absorbed quickly. There is a bit of a cooling sensation which I found pleasant.<br /><br />The travel bag seems unnecessary to me. It’s really not much more than a heavy ziplock bag lined with bubble wrap with a large logo reading “Skin Set Go.”  If someone needs a bag, great, but I have several and I don’t think I’ll be using this one.<br /><br />According to the company’s website, Skin Care Go products are made in the USA in small batches. Good. A lot of natural ingredients go into the product, which I like, but the complete list of ingredients from the company’s website is as follows:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius Seed Oil, Polyacrylate-13, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Polyisobutene, Squalane, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopherol, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Butylene Glycol, Polysorbate 20, Acetyl Octapeptide-3, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Fragrance, Yellow 5 (CI 19140), Blue 1 (CI 42090).<br /><br />The final verdict:<br />The product is nice, and while I’d personally prefer something less heavily scented, I like the way the cream works and what it does for my skin. It’s very hydrating and brightening, with nothing that irritated my skin. I understand the idea behind the syringe dispenser: it’s unique, it’s fun, it’s memorable. However, there’s a ton of plastic used that isn’t necessary, and with the design, I don’t know how I’ll know when the tube is nearing empty.<br />Overall, this is a good product, does what it says it does, and if you’re looking for something a little unusual, give it a try.",1691,2868

Not a big deal.<br />It does have to be plugged in.  Again, not an issue.  I only have it out, while using it, for about 10 mins tops.  Takes me 2 seconds to plug it in.<br />Love having this.  Anything that makes a day go a bit easier is okay with me.",1707,2903

These tweezers seem to work nicely.<br />I tried 3 of them so far and I have no complaints.<br />The case is nice to keep them all organized and easy to find.  The eyebrow brush was a nice addition to this set.<br />The curved scissors work great also.<br />Glad to have this set in my collection.  Will make it so much easier when I need to do a bit of face grooming.,1707,2904
5.0,1456955411000,Quick and easy facial cleaning in no time,"Fantastic facial cleaning brush.  I like that it has a pretty case to use if I ever travel with it.  You can store the other brushes (comes with 3.  One for massage, one for sensitive skin and one normal brush)<br />Great that the battery holds a charge for about 30 uses.  Nice feature for when I'm on the road and don't want to bother with the charger at every hotel.<br />Has 3 speeds so you can decide on how much brushing you want on your face.<br />My face feels so clean after I'm done using it.  I put on some night cream, with the massage brush, afterwards and my face is so smooth.  I love it.<br />I'm also wondering how difficult it will be to find replacement brush heads.",1707,263
4.0,1632877607693,Good performance; no scent; slow to absorb,"This is a pretty good cream for dealing with ultra dry, cracked skin. I've used it with good results on my elbows -- it softens, soothes and helps with healing. There's only a small hint of a scent to it that is only noticeable if you smell the cream in the jar. Once it's applied there's no scent that I can detect, which is a major plus.<br /><br />It's a soft cream that's easy to dispense and spread. That's also a plus since other intensive moisturizing creams I've tried tend to be more solid and harder to use. This has more of a whipped cream type of consistency that's easy to work with.<br /><br />It does take time to soak in, and my skin remains greasy feeling for a while after using it. It's not a significant problem for elbows, knees, feet, etc., but is a issue when using it on my hands. The greasy feeling makes it not a great hand cream other than at night.<br /><br />Not perfect, but a better than average intensive moisturizing cream. A solid 4 stars.",1709,1516
3.0,1630362066648,"Nice compact size, but too little witch hazel to be of significant benefit","This are mini wipes, with each measuring about 5.25 by 4.25 inches. They are packaged very compactly, making them easy to take along in a gym bag, backpack or even in your pocket. The packet is soft, which means it's not ideal for dispensing one wipe at a time without some measure of struggle. There's an adhesive flap to cover the opening, but again, as with pretty much any packet with this design, the flap doesn't do nearly as good of a job as a hard plastic cover.<br /><br />The wipe material is soft but pretty durable. It's designed to be a ""prep"" before using a stick-on breathing strip on your nose. As such, it doesn't do all that good of a job. While it does contain witch hazel, there's too little of it for the wipe to perform well. Witch hazel is the last ingredient (after water, glycerin, and aloe). Witch hazel is a great prep for any adhesive to ensure a good skin bond. Using these wipes is really no better for that task than plain water.<br /><br />While it is a comfortable wipe to use for general face and hand cleaning, given the price and the lack of unique benefits re: better adhesion, I see this as a 3 star (average) product at best. It's not something I'd get again.",1709,2239
5.0,1622211391282,Good scrubbing performance; nice light scent,"I'm pleased with this face scrub. It hits the right middle ground: not so coarse that you feel as if you're rubbing gravel on your face, but not so fine that there's no scrub action. This provides a good amount of scrubbing but not to the point where it's irritating. It's a medium thick cream consistency that spreads easily. Not much is needed per use.<br /><br />The scent is fairly mild and while you can pick out the eucalyptus scent it's not so strong to be overwhelming, as eucalyptus can sometimes get. The scent does not linger after rinsing.<br /><br />Checks all the right boxes for me for a face scrub. Five stars.",1709,2909
5.0,1621954893466,"Unusual soap, but works well","I've not come across a face soap in this format -- it's a stick format, much like an antiperspirant. You rub the stick on your dry face, then use water. It's different but very easy to get used to quickly.<br /><br />The soap doesn't lather all that much but it does do a good job of cleaning without drying out my face. The scent is quite nice, with the eucalyptus coming through the most. It's a medium/mild level of scent that is noticeable without being overwhelming. The scent does not linger after rinsing. The soap itself is black due to the inclusion of charcoal.<br /><br />The dispensing tube is well done, with a screw base that pushes up the soap easily and evenly. It also has a screw top cover, which is a nice touch for keeping the lid affixed if you take this while traveling or use it in a gym bag.<br /><br />It's an unusual but enjoyable twist on face soap. A bit pricey for the amount you get, but it's sufficiently unique to justify the cost, in my opinion. Five stars.",1709,2910
3.0,1613251549342,Pleasant scent; very gentle; not all that effective for cleaning,"There are a number of positive features of this face wash. I love the scent -- it's a light, ""fresh"" scent that is sort of floral and sort of botanical. Normally I prefer unscented (or something that just smells soapy) but this light scent is quite enjoyable. It's a thick cream that resembles a moisturizer more so than a soap.<br /><br />There's virtually no lather to it. It foams up a bit, but very lightly. It's a very gentle soap but, for me, it's a bit too gentle in that I don't have a clean feeling after using it. My face feels more like I've applied a moisturizer. That's not a bad thing, especially in the dry winter months, but I want to have a clean-feeling face after using a face soap, and I don't get it from this.<br /><br />Balancing the positive and negative features puts my rating at three stars (average). It smell great and it is very gentle, but it's not a face soap I'd get again. There are other gentle soaps that also offer better cleaning and a better value on a cost per ounce basis.",1709,2913
5.0,1610155908475,Excellent quality; useful accessories; good protection,"I'm impressed with how well these glass bottles are packaged by the manufacturer. Each bottle is double-packed in bubble pack, and all accessories are wrapped up so they can't move around and damage the glass bottles. Even though the shipping box was beat up, the bottles were all 100% fine.<br /><br />The glass is of good quality in terms of thickness, and quite sturdy (as far as glass can be, however). The brown tinting is excellent for UV protection of the contents. The accessories are mostly useful items, with the best ones being the caps and the funnel. The caps have an insert to provide an excellent seal, which is key to maintaining content freshness. They also come with spray heads that, while functional, are rather lightweight in terms of build quality.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent set of bottles that are packaged very well, and come with some very useful extras. Very pleased!",1709,234
5.0,1610127186966,Very good quality; useful extras,"I'm very pleased with these glass bottles. The glass is thick and, while it's certainly not immune to breaking, it can deal with the occasional bump without a problem. Having it be tinted brown is great for limiting the amount of UV that can enter, plus gives it a nice look.  The caps are excellent and provide a good seal. The sprayers are just OK. They work, but are not all that heavy-duty. I'm using these more for storage than application, so I'm more interested in the cap seal than the sprayer.<br /><br />It also comes with a very useful funnel, a dropper and a white marker. The funnel is something that I'll use often; I won't use the others. But, it's a nice complement of accessories.<br /><br />The bottles come very well packaged with two layers of bubble pack, and are in a box that's the right size to prevent things from moving around. They arrived in perfect shape even though they were shipped in a non-padded ship bag.<br /><br />Very pleased with the set -- 5 stars!",1709,234
2.0,1597244685172,"Nice compact size, but very cheap construction","I like the small, compact size of these spray bottles. The height makes them easy to stow in a cabinet without taking up much room at all. Of course, a small size means small capacity, but for my needs that's a perfectly fine trade-off.<br /><br />What's not so good is the overall build quality. The bottles are made of thin plastic that look and feel cheap. The trigger action on the sprayers is not smooth or reliable. The sprayer hose detaches easily.<br /><br />Given the price, these are 2 stars for value -- they look, feel and perform as a bottle you'd get in a dollar store. A shame, since it can be hard to find compact spray bottles.",1709,318
4.0,1595603174231,Decently durable; easy to use; could be a bit longer,"These are reasonably durable mask holder bands. The ""fingers"" that hold the mask straps are thin, but I didn't experience any tearing even when tugging on them a lot harder than they would be exposed to in normal use. The fingers are widely spaced and can deal with flat-style elastic bands without a problem.<br /><br />My only quibble is that they are a bit too short in length. While using them does increase mask comfort around my ears, they would be better if they were about an inch or so longer.<br /><br />Not ideal, but a helpful aid to increase long-term mask wearing comfort especially with masks that have short ear loops.",1709,615
5.0,1593992915498,"Basic design, but effective; great for house guests","This is a pretty basic toothbrush. It lacks the features found on more expensive toothbrushes, such as sculpted bristle patterns, but it performs just fine. The bristles are a medium/soft density which works well for me -- firm enough for good cleaning but soft enough that it doesn't cause any gum irritation. The handles are also pretty basic but the bamboo makes them more grippy than the basic plastic brushes.<br /><br />The bristles are all firmly attached. None have come loose after a good amount of use. I can't say the charcoal infused bristles do anything beyond what a regular bristle does, but they look nice.<br /><br />Each comes individually packed and includes a tiny tube of toothpaste. It's a great item to have on hand for situations such as house guests who forget to bring a brush, for traveling, to stow in your desk at work, etc.<br /><br />No complaints. They work well, and I'm glad that it's a way to use/discard less plastic waste.",1709,890
4.0,1560867463741,Nice balance between soft and firm; some fitment issues,"This is a good middle ground between the standard Oral-B brand brushes and the Ultra Soft Oral-B brand brushes. I find the standard brush to be a bit too firm and, while I like the softness of the Ultra Soft, sometimes I'd like just a bit more firmness to the bristles. This is a good compromise. It's softer than the standard but firmer than the Ultra Soft.<br /><br />On the downside, it does not fit as well as the authentic Oral-B brushes. It's a little bit loose, which causes it to be noisier in operation than an authentic brush. It still works fine and stays on firm enough so there's no danger of it coming off in use, but there's enough play in the fit that it's more buzzy than an authentic.<br /><br />Even with the fit issue, this is a decent alternative to the Oral-B brand brushes and a solid 4-star brush.",1709,2915

All the oils in this product are normally liquid at room temperature so I'm not sure how they got this to have a butter-like consistency. Maybe some beeswax or something was added but it's not on the list of ingredients. I really like the tea tree oil scent this castor oil butter has as tea tree is one of my favorite scents.  I think this is a very good castor oil product.",1714,2896

I color it at home and if I don't use products to control brassiness my hair will start to turn kind of orangish.  I really like this shampoo.  It's nice and dark purple and lathers up really nice.  It cleans my hair well and thoroughly rinses out.  The creme rinse doesn't do much as far as conditioning or de-tangling but should help to keep hair from color warping.  It's not as dark purple as the shampoo and has no scent that I can detect.,1714,2929

4.0,1619365433281,Good Collagen Supplement,"If you mix up approximately 2 tablespoons (close enough to 1 and 2/3rds) you can sort of taste the berry flavor but it's basically bland and flavorless.  That's fine, you can add a flavoring to it if you want too.  As far as helping me get to sleep it doesn't.  1mg of melatonin does nothing for me.  I like that one serving delivers 10 mg of collagen but it's only one type - bovine collagen.  I think it's kind of pricey coming in at $34.95 (as of this review) since I've reviewed collagen powders that contains several types of collagen and were more than 9.3 oz for as much or even less money.  Also, you won't see any results in 2 weeks so don't let those reviews get you all excited.  I've been consuming collagen on a daily basis for about a year and am now just beginning to see some positive changes in my skin and nails.  I'm 63 and realize all the collagen supplements in the world won't make me look 40 again but I have seen some improvements in less crinkly skin on my arms and some fine lines around my eyes looking much smoother.

I have been lightening my hair using home kits and prefer shampoos and creme rinses that help control any brassiness.  The conditioner is a much lighter color and makes my hair feel great.

It's good, but I just don't see why it costs so much money.  The texture is close to that of sour cream and it's easy to apply.  It's a little greasy for a short while until it gets absorbed.",1714,976
5.0,1611251386013,Very Good Shampoo,I like this castor oil shampoo though I don't know how much castor oil it contains.  Castor oil is wonderful for hair and skin and I use a lot of it in my hand made soaps because it makes them very emollient and soothing to the skin.  This is a huge bottle of shampoo and will last me a long time.  It makes very good lather - nice and light and it rinses out well.  My hair is very clean afterwards.  I still use a good conditioner afterwards because my hair is a little damaged from being lightened.  This shampoo has a very light scent too.  There's nothing negative I can find to say about it.,1714,972

It won't stop sweating, but it will keep the smelly bacteria from breeding for a while so you don't stink.

I have another bamboo brush with longer bristles that I like best but this one is still a very good brush especially if you have short hair.

I can put it on my face, arms and hands and it feels good, but my skin is not as moisturized as some other lotions and creams that I've used.  I like the shape of the bottle because I can keep it in the slot in my car door and use it as needed.

Your skin must be clean, dry and free of any moisturizers.  They stick well to my skin and definitely pulls it up some.  However, the skin that's pulled up gets crinkled up and if your hair doesn't cover it, the crinkles will show.  The tapes are really hard to see once applied, and easy to apply once you get the hang of it.  I blew through at least 10 just trying to figure it out but you get 40 in a box.

This software suite is perfect for the small business with big goals and the features assure you can accurately assess where you are with your finances as you meet them. My brother is a real estate agent and while there are other industry-specific programs for that, he is really enjoying this QuickBooks so far because it allows him to track his expenses, listings aka inventory, commissions and taxes that must be precise with each transaction. Secure import of financials was a relief, and he was set up in about an hour or two and learning his way around the program with relative ease. He also has an assistant that he was able to easily add to the payroll and able to do so without the free support!<br /><br />Considering the list price on this new 2019 edition of Quickbooks is close to $500, the current offering is a steal and I recommend jumping on it before the price goes up again, as these sorts of offerings tend to fluctuate. QuickBooks is the most popular and affordable software compared to others on the market, and you do get what you pay for, so the value here is terrific too. I just began using the regular 2019 since I am on a smaller scale and this version is new to him, so I can't comment on the issues others are having.

My other furgirl is an older, rescued papillion and because her fur is straight with no undercoat, this brush works great on her.

Now, the problem is, curly hair ""fights"" with some hair items - from my younger years my sisters used bristle curlers (they had straight hair) but the first time I tried using them, my hair like BIT INTO those bristles and man, I nearly had to cut my hair off to get those demon curlers out of my hair!  These are similar, apparently to the bristle, demon curlers as they grabbed a hold of my wet hair and when I tried to pull one off, even holding onto the hair at my scalp, I could feel the tube holding onto my hair for dear life.  That was with WET hair...I'm glad I did not wait for my hair to dry before attempting to pull the tube off!  I have several friends with longer, straight hair and I'm sure they will have a different, happier and more comfortable experience than I did.  What I'm saying is that I'm sure they work - for those with straight hair.  If you have curly hair, best be careful when using them!",2147,61
4.0,1594324006442,Works well for what I need,"Yeah, I have a physical job that requires I wear a mask while working.  I work in an non-air-conditioned warehouse so I sweat...having a headband that can catch some of the sweat trying to drip into my eyes helps, but now with having to wear the mask, having the buttons on the headband allows me to combine the two instead of having to try to hook the mask's elastic behind my ears and then pull the headband over my ears and getting it situated on my forehead.  Life has changed and finding the best way to work with the new normal is the only way to go...and this headband is working for me - maybe it will work to make it easier for others!",2147,84
5.0,1593282636613,"I don't have ""broken"" hair","But I have baby-fine hair that is also curly.  I always have hair around the hairline that will NOT lay flat or blend into the rest of my hair whether it is pulled back or down.  Oh, and don't even get me started on humid/rainy days.  Curly hair, especially baby-fine curly hair, frizzes like crazy in humidity.  So yeah, I could spray the crap out of my hair with hairspray and have one great helmet head with not a hair out of place, but I absolutely hate hairspray.  Besides, that would require washing my hair every time I coat it with hairspray - the problem is baby-fine, dry hair isn't made to be washed daily.  So...I have lived with all those crazy ""free-wheeling"" hairs until trying this product.  It worked so well I was amazed and it did not leave my hair feeling like a hair helmet!  I used the mascara-like wand around the hairline from one ear to the other and those little hairs stayed in place!  Cool beans!  I will buy this again, definitely.",2147,2170
5.0,1592375500115,I decided not to cut my hair this summer,"Usually I get a ""summer cut"" so that my hair doesn't make me any hotter during the summer months, but with the pandemic and all the salons closed, my hair is going to stay long over the hot summer months.  I can do many things with it and one is to keep it away from my face with these headbands.  I like the colors and the headbands themselves hold firmly in place which is just what I wanted.  I have some that had a twist in them and for some reason, they don't hold in place on my head very well like these do.  Colorful, comfortable to wear, and keeps my hair back - that's all I can ask for!",2147,3361
5.0,1584074031485,This is an all-inclusive package for those wanting to get into gel nail polish,"I mean, you aren't starting with tons of colors or anything, but when you are new to gel nail polish, keeping it simple is the best way to begin the process.  The two colors are nice, but I am sure once a person starts gel polish, they will love it and buy a set of colors that suit them.  Now, the only thing I would change about this set is the UV light as it is very small.  I already had a larger one and am comfortable using my big one as I can fit all four fingers under it with ease.  Not that I have fat fingers or anything, but I just feel the included UV light is a tad smaller than most women would like.  Other than that, this kit will get absolutely anyone started properly in the gel nail polishing procedure.",2147,1020

These clips are about the only type of clips that work well in keeping my wispy hair in place for any length of time.  The only thing that was a problem with these is that the side of the plastic these came in had torn and they were all over the shipping box.  I mean aaalllll ooovvvveeerrr inside the shipping box.  What a pain to pick all of these up...but I believe I got them all.  I do love these little clips and love all the bright colors that I can use for spring and summer.",2147,847
5.0,1581235684687,Followed the instructions above and got great results,"I think part of it is choosing a good black under polish prior to adding the mirror powder as it needs that dark base to really shine and look like chrome.  I chose the dark blue to try first and it looked stunning when done!  The part I hate with gels is getting them off, but I'll work on getting better at that.  I love the tangerine chrome powder and will be trying that next!  These are gorgeous colors and I will be trying each of them in turn.",2147,2340
5.0,1581056475206,I haven't worn the pearl-covered ones,"But I have worn all the rest!  I love how these look on my head and they do a great job of keeping my hair back from my face when I'm working around the house.  I mean, I've used scrunchies to pull my hair up on my head, but after a little while that hurts my scalp.  These are gentle on both my hair and my scalp and they do look good (at least to me) on my head!",2147,257
5.0,1577776840233,Sweet Orange is amazing!,"Liquid body washes are my favorites, but some seem to dry my already dry skin out so that right after my shower, I have to slather on lotion to keep my skin from feeling tight and dry.  Not so with this one!  First, it smells so good - love the orange scent that envelopes the shower!  Second, a small dollop on my scrubby lathers up well and cleans thoroughly without having to add any more to the scrubby (like other body washes).  Last, when I step out to dry off, my skin feels hydrated and soft.  I really like this body wash!",2147,336

I have a LOT of hair, but because my hair is so fine, I have trouble with wispy strands  coming loose at the wrong places.  These type of clip work really well to keep my wispies corralled.  Granted, these are very brightly colored, but I have a few of the kind that blend into my hair.  What I was looking for was something that coordinated with what I was wearing so that I could ""celebrate"" my hair with the bright colors of these clips.  I mean, why hide ""difficult"" hair issues?  Or maybe hiding it in plain sight when wearing a Christmas-y red dress with red hair clips!  If you have wispies that escape and make your up-do look messy, maybe you too could try bright clips to celebrate your wild and crazy hair!",2147,852
4.0,1561191714866,"Straight razor with a ""guard""","That's basically what this is.  First off, the box is written in Chinese, I believe, with absolutely no English on it.  No instructions other than a pair of pictures.  Not great pictures either.  Not to be deterred, I opened the box, pulled one of the razors from the box, removed the plastic cover and tried it.  If you look closely at the one picture, you will see what appears to be a drop of blood - it is.  That is why I described this as a straight razor with a guard in quotes.  Make NO mistake, these are SHARP.  Use them delicately and only on smooth skin.  If you have a blemish, a mole or anything just slightly raised on your skin, it will be cut off.  You will bleed.  Just want others to be aware of what this is and to take care not to hurt themselves.",2147,750
5.0,1628199199569,Working so far,We tried this out and so far it is working.  We have a noticeable reduction in the amount of hair in the tested areas.  It does take several weeks and several sessions to notice a difference.  Plan on at least a half hour per session (depending on how large of an area you are doing.  Make sure to wash after and use some skin lotion.  Follow the directions for skin and hair type and you should see good results.,2149,2903
5.0,1625069103303,Nice scent,"I'm not usually a fan of flower scented sprays, but my wife loves them so we gave this a try.  I was shocked at how well I enjoyed this scent.  It was floral, but not the usual sickey sweet scent I usually associate with floral scents.  This one was a lot better and almost woodsey smelling.  My wife loves it and was thrilled that I liked it too so now out whole house smells like this and she is happy and I can tolerate it!  Worth a go for sure!",2149,204
5.0,1621810481066,rich shampoo,"This is a very rich thick shampoo.  Salon quality stuff here.  Amazing lather, great scent and rinses super clean.  Works amazing for color treated hair, and perfect from stripped hair.  The conditioner is also incredible. I used some on my beard and it made it amazingly soft and manageable.  I caught heck from my wife as she told me this was to valuable for her hair to waste on my scratchy beard.  Oh well sometimes you can't win.",2149,2357
5.0,1618593410785,handy,"These smaller spray bottles are very handy for sprayer needs.  We use them to most our plants, and to spray unruly hair.  They are a compact but work very well.  Nice and thick, but plastic so no worries of shattering them it they get dropped.  So far they have worked great and we have not had any issues.  The intake hose is long enough to reach the bottom and get most of the liquid.  No clogs or extra drips.",2149,3369
5.0,1610285483064,Granddaughter loves this,"My granddaughter (13) is real into nails right now and loves this set.  She did her own nails and her friends nails and I will say they did a nice job.  She said this was easy to use and worked as well as any other set she has tried.  Colors were great and the nails were strong and easy to shape perfectly.  The only real problem we had was this does have a pretty nasty smell, but we set up a fan and that took care of the fumes.  She has added this set to her growing collection of nail stuff, and likes to come over every couple of weeks to open up her ""salon""  I like it cause I get to spend some extra time with my granddaughter.",2149,1546
5.0,1607799838687,Nice set,I use tweezers a lot and these are pretty decent ones.  They work for holding small screws and reaching hard to reach spots.  Not super fine tips but work for my needs.  I did sharpen and shape the pointed set a bit to use to remove some solder flux in a very tight spot.  Handy for most any detail work.  Scissors are so-so and will probably get trashed pretty quick in the shop.  The case is super handy and keeps the set together and is easy to slip into a pocket to take with you.  These would work pretty good as eyebrow tweezers also.,2149,2904
5.0,1607174175943,Nice color,This is a good gel polish.  Works well with other gel topcoats and base coats.  Most of the colors were single coat coverage.  A couple of the lighter colors required a second coat.  Set up was quick and no foot or tacky spots after running the UV cycle.  Soaks off well and clean up was as easy as any polish. Loved the variety of colors and overall quality is great.,2149,3370
5.0,1604069798131,nice set,This is a nice gel set.  Colors are vibrant and the glitter really stands out.  Super easy to use and setup was quick and complete.  Very easy to shape and overall the kit was a pleasure to use.  We even let our 13 year old granddaughter use it as it worked so well and was so easy to use.  She liked it so much she took several colors home with her to do some friends nails.,2149,1551
5.0,1601127020450,surprised,"I have this a try with a very negative attitude about it.  Wow I was shocked at how well this cleans ears, and how comfortable (dare I say it actually felt pleasant????) it was to use.  It is very soft and gentle on the ears.  Cleans very well and cleaning the tools was a breeze.  Case holds everything secure and keeps it clean and ready for the next session.  I use this once a week and very pleased with this product.  Heck even the mirror in the case is super nice and easy to use.  This is perfect for all ears.",2149,3372
5.0,1600603097596,better than hot oil,My wife has damaged hair and has used those hot oil treatments.  This works so much better and is not as difficult to use.  After 2 shampooing a and conditionings her hair looks and behaves so much better.  This has repaired the split ends and has tamed the frizzies.  Gentle on the scalp and leaves her hair so soft and shiny.  Safe for colored hair.,2149,250
5.0,1600292286301,smells nice,"First and foremost- this is a cream deodorant.  If you have never used a cream it is basically rubbing  lotion into your arms pits (anyone remember Tussy deodorant?)  We gave this a go and it smells really nice- a little strong (Jasmine has a very strong sweet scent),  but pleasant.  Did not irritate the skin at all and pretty much stopped odor (we did have a very sweaty 1.5 hour workout and by the end of that we were pretty stinky).  For normal daily use this works just fine and keeps you stink free.  It does leave a bit of a challenge residue on clothes so watch out for sleeveless clothing.",2149,2936
5.0,1599394167461,Great masks,These masks work very good.  Very soothing on the face.  My girls have a beauty day about once a month so we are always trying out new masks.  These ones work great and they loved how clean and soothing these were.  They said their skin felt younger and more elastic.  Super easy to use and no I'll side effects.,2149,980
5.0,1599303650934,Love aloe,"I love the way this Aloe works to cure dry skin problems and to soothe any skin irritation.  I use this on burns, and bites, and any other skin issue.  Very soothing and long lasting.  It cures the issue not just covers it up.  Super mild that even my sensitive skin is never irritated.  Smells like aloe and does leave a bit of a tacky- feel (that is what is supposed to do!).  This also works incredible in quickly healing blisters and bringing relief to raw skin.  Great easy to use bottle and no negative issues with this.",2149,301
4.0,1598993797628,work ok,These foot stones work ok.  They do remove dead skin and calluses but are a bit rough and don't leave a smooth finish.  We end up following up with a very smooth foot file.  We tried using them in the shower and that seemed to work better so they get 4 stars for shower use but dry they are a bit too rough for our taste.,2149,2366
5.0,1598128009918,great files,If you have never tried a glass nail file do yourself a favor and try these out.  Even as A guy I love how these work on my nails.  They leave such a smooth finish to your nails and greatly reduced the number of hang nails I get.  My girls love these and use them exclusively for all their nail care needs.  These come packaged in a padded case so your assured a safe chip free  file.  These are super quality and should last a lifetime.,2149,1553
5.0,1598105790894,good workout bands,"My wife likes these a lot for her workouts.  It has been a very hot summer and our workouts have gone from a little sweaty to drenched in sweat grossness.  These have not only kept her long hair out of her face, by have stopped the sweat from dripping down her face and into her eyes.  Gross yes but they work wonderful and wash up perfectly.  Zero complaints.",2149,2834
5.0,1596667095354,ear saver,Tried these out straight away.  They work great and have a good level of adjust ability for different size heads and masks.  Easy to hook and unhook.  Very comfortable to wear and does not grab or tangle even long hair.  Colors are a bit on the feminine side of that matters to you.  Saves your ears from the pain and suffering associated with mask wear.,2149,3374
2.0,1596574464089,odd shape,This has an odd shape.  It is almost pointed at the front and kinda like a crown.  It really is slippery and  kept pulling down when used with a mask.  Without the mask it kept riding up and would not stay put.  Very large writing on it made it a bit tacky.  Just didn't work for our needs.,2149,3375
5.0,1595680663462,No hair pull,My wife is a big fan of these hair ties.  They work well for her longer hair.  She generally wears her hair up in some kind of bun and these times work well for keeping everything in place.  They stay put but are easy and pain free to remove.  Just enough stretch to wrap up the hair.  These also work well in conjunction with bobbiepins.,2149,2224
4.0,1592342692422,A bit large,First this is a real nice pointed top brush.  it is well made and very sorry and consistent.  The handle is also well made and tight to the brush (no wiggle).  Brush cleans up and dries soft and pliable.  It is a #4 size which is on the larger size for a lot of nail art.  This is probably best for solid designs or applying top coats and not for fine detail or complicated designs.  My daughter uses it to apply latex masks and peel off base coats.,2149,1150
5.0,1591829861586,Amazing for mask use,My wife loves this headband.  Her masks hook up easy and this relieves all the ear strain the elastic bands cause.  It is stylish and comfortable.  Helps keep her quarantine hair (which is getting very long) manageable and out of her face.  Fits great and works wonderful for all day use.,2149,84
5.0,1583066832466,Excellent bottles,These little spray bottles are awesome.  We filled up a couple with some scented oils and they work perfect.  The bottles are glass and are securely held in the covers.  They do not leak and spray a very fine mist.  The spray is perfect for adding a refreshing scent into a room (or a musty winter weary car interior).  Super easy to fill and the entire package is compact and fits easily into a purse or glovebox.  We also filled one bottle up with a little soapy water to spray on out house plants to take care of the fruit flies that are attracted to the flowers.  Excellent all round spray bottles.,2149,1030
4.0,1582672910079,ok if you want a lot of flex,This is non metal (i.e. plastic).  The tips are curved well but are kind of wide (they don't come to a point) and they flex a lot.  It takes very little pressure to get them to flex and as far as using this to scrape your teeth... well you would get almost no scraping.  This would be great for introducing kids to what the dentist does or for people with super sensitive gums.  I did give 4 stars as it it a good tool for removing paint from delicate surfaces and it is non marring.  Handle is comfortable to hold and I actually use this when clean my air guns as the chambers are small and tight and this won't cause damage and can get into the tight spaces.,2149,254
5.0,1581169846523,Awesome combs,"I love these wooden combs.  They are static free and on a great job of de-tangling the hair.  I have issues with static hair and these have solve the problem with the first use.  I have shorter hair so I don't even bother with a hairbrush anymore.  I really can't evidence which one is my favorite as I tried them all and love them all.  I won't go back to a brush or plastic comb ever again as these work amazing,  Also the finer tooth ones work great on my beard so that's an added bonus!",2149,256
5.0,1556328194600,Great for diy beauty masks,"My grandaughter and her friend love to give each other facials.  These are a huge hit as they are having a ball ""building"" there own face masks.  These are the perfect asorbancy for using as a face mask.  We made some simple face oil and water masks and the girls loved them.

Perfect for a light makeup.<br />It run smoothly on the lips, I do use a primer  before because I have very dry lips.<br />It last at least all morning and then all afternoon.<br />Even if the color is soft, the lipstick have a good pigmentation.<br />No weird scent.<br />I like it!<br />Recommended.",2332,3570
3.0,1612808773154,Definitely not for every night,"I wanted to love it, but i just can’t.<br />It smell good, it spread easily. You don’t need too much of it for the entire face. My skin did feel moisturized after using it BUT i just can’t stand the stickiness!!!! I tried with several amounts of it and i could not sleep at all because of the sticky feeling. It was too much. It did not absorb into my skin. Obviously every skin is different, mine is sensitive and dry.<br />The consistency is like a heavy gel.<br />So, for me is a BIG no, but i will use it during summer after sun tanning, before shower. I can see that would be best for me....i even think it will work great if i storage it in the fridge before using it... just like a cooling gel.",2332,431
5.0,1610241742367,Soft feet!,"A couple of times during the year I get my heels very very dry.<br />I ordered this mask and it was great!<br />It start peeling around day 5-6.. and it was soo relaxing!!! Just like when I was little and we use glue on our hands!

5.0,1608779153210,Great set!,"This set comes in a plastic box, nice detail because you can use it for storage.<br />The clips are bigger than I was expecting, but they are perfect. I have very thin hair and medium length.<br />I like that they lie flat on my head. So they don’t hurt me if I’m using them for long periods of time.<br />Lightweight and well made. They feel sturdy.<br />The set also comes with hair ties, love them! Very soft. They are made on 1 piece of fabric which helps on the hair.<br />I really like this set.<br />Recommended.",2332,242
2.0,1595954861092,Mmmmm Im not sure...,"I was hoping more of this oil.<br />First it does not have any árgan type of scent... on the contrary it smells like fried oil. Not good. It is not super strong scent, but definitely you can smell it.<br />Second, it does not absorbe fast. I was oily until I fell asleep.<br />It was lightweight.<br />I did felt my skin hidrates the next day, but not quite sure if this is better than other oils that I use.<br />Definitely, I won’t use it, because mainly of the French fries smell.",2332,1007
5.0,1593883266584,Big difference!,"This was my first attempt to do faux eye lashes. I can not compare to other systems, but I love it! I use the 3 pair from the top. The look was pretty normal. I had to cut a little of them because it was too long for me.<br />The set comes with 2 eye liner, tweezer and 5 pairs of lashes.<br />The liner was easy to apply and then the lashes were stuck on it fast and easy.<br />I went to a barbecue with them and they stay in the entire time.<br />After, they go out without any pain. The eye liner was a little hard to take off. I use my makeup wipes in a hard way. Haha.<br />It did not make my sensitive skin hurt or burn.<br />I love it!",2332,2362
5.0,1592869817621,Beautiful case!,"This is beautiful. Not only the box is very nice, but the case is stunning! Looks like a smooth shell. Very luxurious. Perfect as a gift!<br />It is however, because of the material, like a ceramic or something, very heavy. I think it will not be good as a pret a porter kind of makeup. But perfect for the one you leave on your makeup vanities.<br />The colors are perfect for my skin tone, I’m like a light brown tone. But I’ve found myself using it more as a eye shadow than bronzer.<br />The highlighter gives a pop of glow.<br />No scent on it and it stays perfectly during my days.<br />Like it. Beautiful!",2332,891
5.0,1586624730011,Works great!!,"First of all, I don’t use to much makeup, no thick layers of foundations. Just some primer, concealer, eyes and mouth.<br />For me, they worked perfectly! They are pretty wet, so they took off all my makeup easily.<br />They are small, so if you use more layers of make up you maybe are going to need more than one.<br />They are soft and have a nice scent.<br />I have mixed skin and delicate. They did not hurt me, burn me, or leave my skin red.<br />After using them, my skin feels clean and moisturized.

5.0,1584424934577,Fun and works great!,"I love this set! Even though I don’t need 6 of them.<br />They are well made, very stretchy, so I guess they fit a wide range of head sizes!<br />Super super soft. The fabric is thick.<br />Comfortable to use, it does not squeeze the head. But it holds all the hair back.<br />I use it when washing my face. It keeps my hair dry too.<br />I love the bow! Very 50’s!!!<br />Great colors. Like it a lot.",2332,88
1.0,1580304485149,This stuff is awful!,"I couldn't use this but one time!  It broke me out, dried me out, irritated my skin, and the rose scent is overwhelming.  The texture is fairly decent as far as cleansing balms go, but it's a very aggressive cleanser and not in a good way.  My skin felt rough and raw when I was done using it.  I've used Clean It Zero for a while and highly recommend it over this balm.  Steer clear!",2333,1121
5.0,1578501374488,Smells great and keeps my hands soft...,"After falling in love with the C.O. Bigelow Rose Salve, I knew I had to give this a try.  I haven't been disappointed with the results.  Not only does it have a sweet, citrusy smell, it also moisturizes and softens my dry, chapped skin.  I deal with dry hands in the winter and I'm a big hand washer, so I end up with rough, cracked skin.  This light yellow, creamy hand lotion has helped to keep my hands from feeling like sandpaper without leaving them greasy.",2333,95
4.0,1565792228274,Cool once you get the hang of it....but the price...,"I'm someone with extremely thick and stick straight hair.  My hair loses curl within an hour of me fixing it.  I've tried other rotating curling irons and haven't had much success with them, so I didn't have very high expectations for this beach waver.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  Once I got the hang of it, I found it to be pretty easy to use.  It features buttons that allow you to chooses which direction you would like to curl each section of hair, and a Home button that after each use, and after the previous section of hair is no longer attached, allows the barrel to return to a neutral starting point.  I ran into an issue the first few times I used it, which was accidentally hitting the home button while my hair was still around the barrel.  This caused the hair to get very tight and the barrel to press up against the scalp.  This is very easy to do and I definitely think a design change should take place to correct this issue.  The barrel is long enough for my medium-long hair and I can see it needing to be used more than once up and down the length of long hair.  The curling iron gets up to 410 degrees max, which works pretty well on my thick hair.  I've tried fixing my hair in different ways after using it, to see which method holds the curls longer.  I still have an issue with my hair losing the curls a bit to quickly but it's remedied by using styling products before and after curling it.  To be honest, I think this beach waver is very overpriced.  Maybe the results would be better for someone with thinner hair but I don't think I'd pay more than $50 for this curling iron.  Nice results, but the design flaws make this a product I won't reach for that often.",2333,3574
3.0,1565723989887,I'm not sure this is worth the price asked...,"I've always wanted to get into the art of doing my own acrylics so when I saw this drill set, I knew I had to review it.  Firstly, it comes with numerous accessories- a fluffy brush for removing dust from the nail and work area, a set of to separaters for painting, a nail board, and the drill bits themselves.  The entire set is nicely packaged and comes nestled in a velvety foam materials.  The bits are held in their own clear container within the box.  The set comes with a detachable adapter that plugs into the end of the drill and then into the wall outlet.  The drill itself is small enough to handle pretty easily, although I can see where it would be difficult for someone with smaller hands than myself (I have large hands.)  Inserting and removing the bits can be a challenge.  The mechanism isn't well made so I have to fight with it.  The power cord is much too short and I had to use an extension cord to give myself some wiggle room away from the wall outlet.  Some of the bits' textures do a better job than the others, while some don't do anything at all.  The over all look and feel of the set isn't worth the price, in my opinion.  It works a bit too awkwardly to be something I'd use that often.",2333,1587

I'm glad I did! This is a significant improvement! I wanted to wait several weeks to write my review to see if there were results and after 6-7 weeks of use I'm definitely seeing a significant reduction in hair! The device is super easy to use and instead of having to manually select the correct level of power for your skin tone, the device analyzes your skin tone and makes the selection for you. It literally could not be easier. There's little to no irritation if you use it correctly. If I get lazy and try to use it with any sort of stubble, then it stings a bit. But if I shave prior to use then it's quite comfortable. It's absolutely worlds better than epilating for sure. But that's a different story for a different day. (Ouch.) The one thing that's a little tricky about using this device is that you're not supposed to overlap the rectangle of light, but there's really no way to see exactly where you're placing it because it's up against your skin. Other than that, this is a breeze to use. In the 6-7 weeks I've been using it I've seen probably a 40-50% reduction in hair growth and what is growing is lighter and more fine. I don't expect to be completely hair free even after the 12 week treatment program, but even a significant reduction in hair would be fantastic! Bring on the shorts and tank tops!",5182,6007

My husband also said he really liked it, so that's a win! The only thing I don't love about it is the cheap looking plastic lid on the bottle. It really cheapens the look of the bottle and doesn't snap on well, which is kind of a pain.

I ordered this set because my 3 year old LOVES all things sparkly, so it's perfect for kicking solid colors up a notch and making them fabulous enough for a preschooler. It took two coats to get enough sparkles for her taste. It's kind of tricky to get them even, which for makes my inner perfectionist feel a little crazy, but she's 3 and doesn't care. The sparkles are almost holographic so they are intensely sparkly. These nail colors arrive in a nice box with a foam cutout for each bottle. My only complaint about the packaging is that nowhere on the bottles does it say the name of or show the color.

I'm a busy mom and honestly, I just hate going to the nail salon, and who has time to wait for 300 hours (Ok, maybe not quite 300) for your regular nail polish to dry, only to smudge it or have it chip within 2 hours? I had pretty much given up on nail polish and just been resigned to the fact that I would have boring nails forever. This stuff is seriously incredible. You just paint it on, cure it, wipe the top with the cleanser to remove the tacky finish, and VOILA! Perfect nails! I did mine last week with this set and they still look AH-MAZING. When this set arrived, I was a bit bummed to find that there's no color included, just base and top coat. I live an hour from the nearest mall and so I couldn't just pop into the store and get a color, and yet I wanted to try it out... Like, right now. I did some reading and found that you can actually use regular nail polish to make a ""Gel-y"" sandwich. Once you have the base coat on, cure it, then paint your regular color over the top and wait the ""300 hours"" it takes to dry. Then paint the top coat over the regular color, cure, wipe with cleanser and enjoy your stunning, long lasting nails! The only thing I would change about this set is the light. I wound up buying a larger light because the one that comes with this set is quite small and I wanted to be able to fit all my fingers or all my toes in at once.

5.0,1595280661306,Cleansing Pads,"I adore these makeup remover rounds. They are the perfect size for a clean face, or even just to remove my eye makeup. No getting water everywhere, no harsh chemicals or cleansers, and there is plenty in this set so that I can just use and wash a new one each time.<br />They are very soft, but don't let that mislead you. Add some water, and wipe away the day. Flip it to the longer side and buff and exfoliate. Super soft, super clean skin - zero irritations.<br />Highly recommend and will never be using disposable face wipes again!",7331,7607
5.0,1567809422557,Super Convienent!,"I wasn't expecting to love these nearly as much as I do. Thick, large and easily removes all ten nails worth of polish without making my fingers feel overly dried out like using my regular polish remover.<br />Because they are all individually sealed I can keep one in my bag for any polish removing emergencies, which trust me... they happen.<br />These work fast, I don't know what makes the formula 'advanced' but the process is quick and clean.<br />The smell isn't overwhelming, just the basic remover smell. Works great, travels even better. I'll be keeping these on hand!",7331,2302
5.0,1560984489447,Dermaplaning-tastic,"These are some pretty fantastic razors. They are straight edged, but the provided safety edging prevents me from nicking myself while keeping the blade close to my skin.<br />It removes peach fuzz quickly, efficiently. My skin is super smooth for about a week after use. My makeup goes on like butter, and I am convinced my moisturizers and serums also work better on my dermaplaned skin.<br />They are small and precision enough that I can use them around my eyebrows, though I go slow and don't usually use them for that.<br />But for my upper lip, chin, cheeks and forehead I don't know how I got by before these. While my easy to use electric is nice, these are so much closer. Will be a faithful weekly user!",7331,750
5.0,1555974669207,Super little facial masks!,"I wasn't sure what to expect from these compressed facial masks in terms of quality, as reviews were across the board. But, they far exceeded my needs and expectations!<br />They are about the size of three dimes stacked, and are embossed with little flowers on top, which is really just a pretty presentation.<br />They expand easily with moisture, I mixed up my own serum solution with essential oil, and it was easy to soak and unfold. I worried I would have to be super delicate so as not to tear the paper, but these are more of a fabric than tissue.<br />In fact, I opened one up to test it's durability. I used some warm water, added some dish soap and went to town scrubbing my basin. No tears, no ripping, no holes. (In fact it cleaned up really well). I used some extra pulling pressure on the cut parts, mouth, eyes chin, and as expected had tears and stretching happen, but that was with abnormal applied pressure.<br />They didn't smell, they didn't feel weird, and they fit great. For the relaxing usage of a home facial these little compact masks are perfect. I know exactly what I'm putting on my face.",7331,3376
3.0,1546807809794,High 3 stars,"This is actually a decent palette of eyeshadows. They are not super pigmented, but very easy to work with. This is a very nice beginner palette, especially for the under 10 price.<br />That said, these need a primer. They last an okay amount of time, but will fade quickly if you don’t use a primer.<br />Simple cardboard container, very similar to colourpop and bh, but doesn’t have a mirror. Still it’s sturdy and all the pans arrived unbroken!<br />The shades are arranged nicely, it really has a visual appeal, and makes choosing an eye look easier.<br />It’s realky not bad, and while my tastes typically run towards the more luxury and pigmented, this is a good entry for a beginner or lighter makeup user.<br />I will be looking into other palettes by this brand.",7331,259
4.0,1546804748666,"Soft hair, smells great!","This leave in hair remedy from AG smells wonderful, like a sweet and spicy scent.

5.0,1619135797017,I use this to help me relax before bed,"I use this with lavender oil in my baths at night.  It relaxes my body and helps sooth sore muscles from exercising. The flakes dissolve pretty quickly. If you add it when you first start running the water, it's mostly dissolved by the time you get in.<br />You use 3 cups of salt per bath so I expect this bag to last for a few baths.

5.0,1610226434922,Perfect for travel. Only one heat setting. Long cord.,I ordered this for when I'm traveling and it's perfect for that. This does take longer to use than my full size waver but the size makes this easier to pack and it doesn't take up too much counter space.<br />The curler only has 1 heat setting and that's 410°. That's the temperature I always use on my straightener so I'm fine with not being able to adjust it. It heats up very quickly in about 30 seconds.<br />You use this like a crimper by taking about a 2 inch section of hair and clamping from the top to the bottom.  You can't pull this straight through your hair or it'll just straighten it.,7872,137
5.0,1600300847796,Great for traveling!,You get 5 sets of under eye pads and each one is individually wrapped so you can throw it in your luggage when you travel. You also get 5 facemask which are also individually wrapped. There's a big container of 60 makeup remover wipes and they work really well to remove my makeup.<br />I saw someone say the mask didn't fit them.  My head is pretty small to average size and it fit mine fine. I still had room on the velcro part to make it bigger. The mask fits comfortably and can be refrigerated to help with eye swelling or puffiness.<br />What I liked most about everything is it all says it's not tested on animals and most of it has a cruelty free bunny logo on the back. I always try to buy cruelty free cosmetics and spa products so this is perfect.,7872,2327

It comes with lots of attachments and even several sandpaper pieces to use.<br />I used it to remove stubborn gel polish and I've used it to prep my nails for press on nails. I like that it's small and basically the size of a highlighter. It has a little weight to it but it's easy to hold and use.<br />It powers through a USB cable, it doesn't come with a wall socket.",7872,2197
4.0,1594783475123,Very conditioning but doesn't really tone my hair,I've followed the directions and used this twice after shampooing with my purple shampoo.

It also has a light pleasant scent.,7872,439
5.0,1593288996626,"Nice selection, super easy to use.","I've always struggled with gluing in lashes and I had pretty much given up. I ordered these after a friend was telling me about how great magnetic liner is. I was super impressed with how easy it is for me to put these on.<br />I'm kind of confused on whether the liner is sticky and magnetic or just magnetic. I didn't let it dry all the way before doing my eyebrows and my lower eyelid got stuck to my upper eyelid. I couldn't tell if that was magnet pull or glue.<br />Whatever the liner is, it keeps those lashes in place and they are so easy to put on. The brush is thin but the thicker the line, the better it will hold on to the lashes.<br />My eye lids are sort of small and I think I'm going to have to trim these a tiny bit or the ends can be a little jabby in the corner of my eye.<br />I haven't worn these out yet due to the pandemic but I know the liner lasts because you have to scrub hard to get it off. These should last all day.",7872,2362

It will help your eyes look and feel better in little to no time at all",8250,8262
5.0,1658943183375,Wireless,"Purchased for hubby who does tattoos and he was so surprised it's cordless and actually works. He was worried it wouldn't hold power but it's motor is 12V or 10,000RPn and it has a 2200mAh battery that allows you to work for 8 hours. It has an overcharge protection so if you put it on charge and it finishes it won't ruin the battery. It also has short circuit protection and temperature control. It has a digital LCD screen that's shows you the display in HD. It's lightweight and easy to take anywhere with you to tattoo where it's clean and safe to do so",8250,8264
5.0,1611551901536,No glue needed,"These lashes are 100% magnetic, no glue needed. They are easy to apply and use, simply put the magnetic eyeliner on and attach the lashes.

5.0,1609304483691,Inexpensive alternative to the spa,This mud mask is like a trip to the spa. It makes your skin rejuvenated and fresh feeling. It's a great way to replenish your skin. It has a nice aroma to it and makes your skin feel clean and fresh. It can be applied daily although I recommend about three times a week. It's a very inexpensive way to make your skin look and feel younger. Great choice.,8250,434
3.0,1659582686046,too scented,I have very sensitive facial skin and cannot tolerate perfumed face products. This cream has a scent to it and made my face itch. I will use it as general moisturizer--just not on my face.<br />It is fairly thin cream and spreads easily. At first I thought it was leaving a greasy trail but this disappeared as the cream was absorbed. A bit pricey for the amount you get.,9376,2895
5.0,1657470189792,For cosplay,"If you are into cosplay or just historical costumes, then this wig is a lot of fun. It comes with a necklace, earrings and a set of buck teeth. I ditched the teeth. Easy to wear wig which comes with a nice stretchy adjustable cap and a hair net to keep your own locks locked down. It's a fun, creative wig and I hope to see a lot of other styles in the future.<br />The hair itself it auburn. Not too fake looking. The hair line is a bit of a struggle but I got it right .",9376,4065
2.0,1645507798532,way too strong,"I tried the Lavanda. It is way too strong. It's suggested to spray it on clothes, on the body and perhaps even in air.<br />The spray is ejected in a tiny amount. I thought to myself it was too tiny an amount until I smelt it. It has all the good labels, no cruelty to animals, gluten free (I did pan on eating it!),  etc etc. With just a small amount on my wrist, the smell was overpowering. I thought it might wear off but I ended up washing it off. It was just too strong. Smelled chemically to me--not a bit like flowers. Can't imagine putting this on a baby or baby clothing.",9376,908
5.0,1635606785768,A lovely gift set,"This would make a lovely gift set for all those people you don't know 'that ' well. But since the 3 enclosed bath bombs spell MOM, then the box is limited... The gift box wrapping is lovely. Take off the mocha silk ribbon which matches well with the paper, and underneath is a plain cardboard box.<br />I love these combo boxes: inside: 3 bath bombs which are very lightly scented, a box of dried rose petals (yeah potpourri bags) and an adorable, square bar of soap. I put the soap in my shower near the shower head as the water drips release some of the scent over time as the soap melts.<br />Anyway, a very nice, gentle set. I wish the bombs didn't spell MOM as then this would be very giftable to something other than MOM.",9376,198
4.0,1635436023191,For kids,This is a fun little set geared towards little girls. It has the nail spacer included in a lovely glittery purple. The nail polish tends towards the clumpy so I added some thinner. I don't expect perfection anyway with nail polish for kids as the little girl in question doesn't sit still long enough for it to dry properly anyway. But thicker polish is destined to be a problem. So thinner is great.<br />The colours are perfect for a little girl and she was thrilled with this set. Teens... may require something a bit more sophisticated.,9376,797
5.0,1633365286104,Very pretty,"Whoever designed these hair clips knows that little girls LOVE unicorns. The sequins on one clip project a gold-fuchsia vibe while the other is magenta, gold and blue.<br />The wings and star are glued on and I can see these coming off in time but hey I've got a glue gun. The front of strong clips (the bit you see) are covered in the dusky pink grosgrain ribbon, and the endings look neat and tidy. These are a big hit with a 6 year old",9376,9095
5.0,1630642325534,really pretty,"One of the headbands was aurora borealis and the other was black. The aurora borealis is beautiful and all the rhinestones catch and reflect the light so there's a huge WOW factor. At first glance, the black one seemed a disappointment in comparison but once under the light, the silver tone sets off the black rhinestones well. It's more subtle and not as WOW as the other headband but it's also very pretty.<br />The headbands have lots of flex and are very comfortable to wear. The inside of the band is a soft black velvet which is pleasant to the touch. Well sewn. No loose ends",9376,9096
5.0,1623883910930,Sold!,"I just recently started using purple shampoo. I have grey hair,  btw. I liked the results I had with another brand so was eager to try this brand. First, at least at the time of this review, the price is decent.<br />The purple shampoo is a deep violet. I applied it to my wet hair and worked it in. Loved the purple lather. Then applied the conditioner which is more of a deep inky blue.  The instructions said to leave it in for a few minutes. When I wash it out, my hair feels differently--it feels as though there's still something there on my hair, but deeply mixed in. It feels differently than when I use regular shampoo.<br />Anyway, I love what this does for my hair. It seems to brighten the light silver and darken the darker grey. At least that's what it seems like. No frizzies either and that's important for me.<br />I used Great Clips brand before trying this, and while I really liked what Great Clips Purple shampoo did for my hair, I prefer this brand. Anyway, I'm sold. I like the tones and depths the purple shampoo gives my hair.",9376,2929
4.0,1606144470654,Quite surprisng,"This is a very pale mud mask. It spreads really easily. It's not as 'mud' looking as most of the other ones I've tried. Makes you look like a ghost appearance wise or someone who is very pale.<br />I left this one for about an hr. It never cracked, but it was there as a very light mask. Easy to wash off. My skin felt very soft afterwards. I was surprised really as I had left it on for so long I'd almost forgotten about it.<br />I feel that the mud mask did have a restorative effect to my skin. It also has a very subtle (and I mean subtle) flower scent. I liked the scent but was happy that it wasn't too strong as I have extremely sensitive facial skin and perfumed skin products make me itch.<br />My skin still feels softer 24 hrs later.",9376,434
4.0,1603931353741,More vanilla than musk,I liked this shower wash. The liquid is thick and feels rich. It produces a heavy lather. I like both musk and vanilla and found this to be a pleasant blend with its emphasis on vanilla.<br />I had no issues with my skin using this.,9376,296
3.0,1598218764172,not that strong,This is a fairly weak retinol formula. I have several on my shelf and I can tell from using them which ones are stronger. This isn't the worst I have tried but I would place it in the middle range. It's rather expensive for what you get. It's also quite thin and runny.,9376,299
4.0,1597945586405,Moisturizes nicely,"This cream is very moisturizing. It feels a bit decadent to be honest. It's a light green and not quite as cucumber-y as I would like. The cucumber smell is there but it's more delicate than another cucumber cream I have on hand.<br />It's silky smooth, goes on easily and is very quickly absorbed. It is pricey, but it makes my skin feel soft and supple.<br />It's especially good on some tough spots--neck and elbows.",9376,323
2.0,1596935013732,Great box,"The box is the best thing here. I had high hopes for the mascara. It's string, so it doesn't go on easily. It clumps. And I also found it very difficult to remove, Of course it is waterproof and that feature works. It took many swipes with oil to start to break this up and off the lashes.",9376,744
3.0,1596933771684,fairly gentle,"I have very sensitive facial skin so I have to be careful with any products. This did not irritate my skin. I would say that it is a very mild facial scrub. It didn't take much to use on my face, but it didn't feel as though it did a while lot either. Pleasant enough but I wouldn't be tempted to buy it.",9376,1092
5.0,1596497462547,I love the purple,"This great set is a larger square and two small circles. The material is so soft, you want to rub your face all over it. Each piece comes with a handle for easy storage/drying. Instructions say these can be machine washed and dried but I hand washed mine and they came out just as lovely as before.<br />The seams are very well sewn with some type of lightly corded material.<br />Very nice indeed. The colour is purple but it's a heliotrope purple. Quite beautiful.",9376,1198
4.0,1596496891589,A new experience,I've never quite tried anything like this. The cleanser is a light green gel--almost slime but not slimy. Instructions say to apply with wet fingers.<br />At first I used too much as the cleaner went far further than I expected. It has a wonderful light fruit smell and smears easily over the face. I have very sensitive facial skin and this cleaner did not present any problems. It was easy to wash off. My skin felt nice afterwards--not dry at all.,9376,1010
4.0,1596398540944,Good clay mask,"I liked this clay mask a lot. The mask cream is very thick indeed, and it takes a squeeze to get it out of the tube. It goes a long way, but at the same time, this is a small tube (3 oz). It dries quickly. And it's the type of mask that makes your face feel TIGHT. The type where you can't smile.<br />After about 20 mins, I washed this off. It was easy to remove. After using a few times, I think it does indeed have a brightening effect on the skin. It doesn't moisturize. At least it didn't for me, and I had to lather on cream afterwards as my skin felt a bit dry after the mask.<br />Overall I liked this. I like how it worked but it is on the pricey side.",9376,1004
2.0,1594835672084,Nifty idea but I'd worry about it holding mask in place,"What's that saying about necessity being the mother of invention? Well here we are in a pandemic wearing face masks. Someone came up with the idea of a head band with buttons to hold the mask mask in place.<br /><br />This is a thin material. Think very thin t shirt type material. The headband measures about 18 inches and just over 3 inches wide. I like the material for a headband. However, its use as a mask holder is iffy. Many people complain that the elastic that holds the masks in place makes their ears pop out. That is definitely true of some masks. They can also be wearying on the ears, having that elastic against your ears all day, so this headband is a great concept.<br />I put the headband on and as I stretched it over my head, I heard a pop, so some stitching gave somewhere.<br /><br />I attached two types of masks, one at a time. First, it was a bit fiddly to get the elastic over the button. Once it just sprang off.<br /><br />One mask using the buttons fit well. Another did not. The latter mask opened up on the sides.<br /><br />I would hesitate to wear this out thinking that everything would stay put for hours. I like the headband as a headband. It's nice material. A sort of light grey merle, but if you are looking at this for long-term safety, I would say no.",9376,84

And used the white (which is the mostly iridescent  one) on my four year yeah old over her eye shadow for Halloween as well. It just was absolutely stunning! It came off easily with one of my makeup remover cloths, however it does leave behind some glitter on the face. But that’s to be expected with liquid glitters. Over all I’m really impressed with these!",10506,9808

ITS HEAVY AF! Compared to my revlon hair dryer it’s half the size and twice the weight! Not a fan of that. I have curly hair and I was super interested in the using his to diffuse my hair. It took FOREVER on the highest heat setting compared to my regular drier. Like twice as long literally.

4.0,1619485994612,OK,"I tried this on thick curly 3c hair. The results were quite decent. You first wash your hair with the pre-treatment shampoo to clarify the hair and remove dirt and oils. At this point, make sure to detangle the hair well and section it into smaller parts so that you can apply the keratin treatment. The hair should be 80% towel dried. You then comb in the keratin treatment to each section of hair. I recommend wearing gloves. Allow it time to process and then blow dry and finish with a flat iron. The hair came out quite silky and smooth, but it began to revert into fluffiness as the day went on. Adding a bit of hair oil helped to restrain the humidity. For an at home kit, it is decent, but it is not as strong as salon treatments.",10513,12

4.0,1593677316375,OK,The texture of this product is basically watered down hair gel. It probably works better for people with straight hair and not course curly hair types. My hair didn't feel hard or crunchy when it dried.,10513,2170

5.0,1606694217973,Good,Love this poly gel. Fun colors. Can be hard to apply if you aren’t used to it. There’s lots of YouTube videos that can help. Doesn’t lift or fall off as long as it’s applied right. This does require curing under a light.,10785,1551
5.0,1611957762049,Wow. This is really nice stuff.,"Two things drew me to ordering this product. The rose scent and the name ""Manilla."" I assumed it was made in the Philippines, and I'm half Filipino. To my surprise, it's made in Lithuania! It is, however, really quite nice. It's a moisturizer with a scent - not something too often seen these days - but the primary aroma is definitely rose. And I just can't resist that. The scent doesn't linger and follow you around. I really only noticed it until after the cream had been absorbed. The cream itself is very sheer and feels lovely going on. It's absorbed quickly and leaves no greasy residue behind. My skin is quite sensitive and I've experienced no breakout issues. All in all, using this product has been a genuine pleasure, both tactile and sensory. I really just enjoy using it, and my skin feels soft and moist, even in our dry winter air. I can recommend this product with enthusiasm!",12206,312
5.0,1607704149561,My new favorite thing! I'm obsessed with it.,"This is really wonderful stuff. The application directions are unusual. Following them, I put four drops (that's what works for me) in my palm, then rub my palms together until they feel warm. Then I pat my face with them, applying the serum all over. I spread it gently afterwards to make sure I haven't missed any areas. The solution is very quickly absorbed and leaves my skin feeling as soft as a baby's bottom, as the old expression says. I'm mean it's reeeealy soft, and not oily or greasy at all. It's AMAZING. What really has me addicted is the smell. It's not floral or citrus, or really like anything I can put my finger on. If I had to, I'd say it's faintly sweet… possibly herbal? Well, whatever it is, it's intoxicating to me. It lingers just a while after the serum dries and I thoroughly enjoy it. I'd wear this scent as a perfume if it were available. It's not strong or offensive; it's just unique and pleasant. I recommend this with enthusiasm!!",12206,728
5.0,1599144493171,Better than the loofa one I have.,"I recently started using one of these with loofa on it. It works for me, even if loofa does take a while to break in. However, it also absorbs quite a bit of soap. I like this one much better.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to order it. How would silicone feel against my back? It turns out that it feels fine and works well. I like that it needs much less soap since it doesn't absorb it. Instead of spreading it all over the thing - I like the side with little bristles like a brush - all you need is to put some in the center. Moving the brush over your back spreads the soap out nicely and does the job without a lot of waste. It squeaks a bit on un-soaped skin, but that's pretty easy to get over and doesn't last long. It was just a surprise, initially. It feels like a gentle scrub, and that's the important part. It also rinses off easily and dries quickly, an important point here in our humid climate. The interior relative humidity in our house hovers around 55% in the summer, so things can get moldy fast. That's what usually happens if a loofa or any other kind of absorbent surface isn't dried properly. I just hang this up on the thoughtfully provided suction hooks and forget about it. It's great, and I'm really glad I gave this a try!",12206,2328
2.0,1598622810104,"Large, stiff, awkward to hold and overstuffed.","I know that loofahs take a while to break in, but I think this product has other issues. I'm a woman with smaller hands. This is just too oversized for me. It's difficult to hold and control. It's also overstuffed with a very convex surface, so only the center of the raised area actually touches my body. It doesn't mold itself to the surface of my skin, so I feel like I'm scrubbing in thin lines, and it doesn't really do the job in the dips and grooves a human body has because of that. It does dries quickly, even though I don't have anything to hang it off of. I'm pretty disappointed with this order and I can't recommend this product.",12206,10905
5.0,1564775230507,Quite happy with this! A great find.,"I had some reservations... I’ve seen the round wood ones around, but never made the leap. I was afraid the ceramic would make this too heavy and bulky, but it does not. It’s quite lightweight and because it’s vertical, saves some space. It comes with extensive directions - a nice change - but is really very easy to use and set up. It’s very hot and humid where I live, so I was also worried that adding more humidity to the air would be a bad thing, however, the air that comes out is quite cool, which seems to cool down the area around it (and by “it”, I mean me). I found it very comfortable.<br /><br />I wasn’t sure how I felt about the colored lights option, but I love it! You can choose red, or a brighter red, and also green and a soft lavender blue with their corresponding brighter shades. You can choose to have your color, or opt to have the unit cycle through them all. It’s quite restful. You can, of course, just use the white light. You can set the steam for a continuous output or intermittent.<br /><br />The until must be cleaned after 10 hours of use. It doesn’t hold a great deal of water, so I was wondering if that was going to be inconvenient. I ran it for two continuous hours and I could tell that filling the tank twice would be about 10 hours. So THAT’S easy to keep track of!<br /><br />All in all, I couldn’t be happier with this unit! It checks all the boxes and I can enjoy my essential oils in an peaceful, comforting environment. Highly recommended!!",12206,2208

Thankfully I have a detachable shower head so I was able to easily spray around and clean things up because it was all over the place! Oh well.

It's not so thick that it's hard to get out of the tube, and it's not very greasy, but still feels really good and moisturizing, taking a minute to really absorb. The smell is great! I wasn't really familiar with the scent of quince before. All I knew about it was that it was a fruit. The smell is really nice, I don't even know how to describe it!

It really does make a nice smooth surface to apply makeup to and reduces the powdering or blotchy look of your makeup.<br /><br />Do not let “moisturizing” fool you though, this isn’t like a bb cream, you do still need a separate moisturizer.  Also keep in mind it is “minimizing”, it doesn’t make your pores magically and completely disappear, especially if you have any enlarged pores.  It works great on my chin and forehead to reduce pores but I have some enlarged pores on my nose that it doesn’t touch.<br /><br />I’ve used other primers that work slightly better but at a MUCH higher cost so I save them for going out vs every day.  I think this makes a good every day primer.  And since I still use a separate moisturizer that has spf I don’t have to worry about this not having it.

This easily adds a pastel color to my lighter hair with a smallish amount of product.  I could see that to change up dark hair or to get a strong/intense color tone, you'd need to pile this stuff on, and I think that's where this gets a bad rap. Yes, you can glob this on to higher opacity and change your dark colored hair to the color shown in the jar. BUT, you need a lot to do this, and you may not like the sticky, waxy result -it is wax, after all.

The mist is fine, but not quite as fine as I was hoping- it's more granular than a steamer or vibration dispenser (like cool mist vaporizers), but this is manual, so I guess I'm complaining for no reason. For a hand pump spray, this is a very good (fine) spray overall.  They recommend that you not put anything but water in the device, and I'm guessing that may be due to it being easy to clog.

I've been using it mostly on acrylic dip powder, but have also used it on top of traditional polish with a clear coat on top. if you apply a light/thin layer (or on dip powder base that has NOT been buffed), it adds a subtle shimmer. If you apply it more thickly AND buff it with the eyeshadow-type applicator, you can achieve a solid chrome look that's really fun as well. I enjoy putting it on all my nails, or just on one nail for a fun accent look that still matches my overall color scheme. I've also enjoyed using it on a relatively plain nail for a fine-textured glitter look while other nails have full-texture glitter. It's really a lot of fun and goes a super long way (basically as far as a comparable eyeshadow palette would go). Strongly recommended<br /><br />UPDATE: I've ditched my acrylic powders (long story - I kayak too much) but couldn't let go of this shimmer. Turns out it works on traditional nail polish as well.

The formula advertises to be sweat proof/waterproof, but that is definitely not the case. I wore this and sweated when I wrote my initial review, but after getting wet in the rain, this product seemed to disappear (my reason for removing a star). It has a natural look to it with a 4-fork tip head that lets you create more realistic looking brows. This gets 3 stars for its wearability and durability and application. The formula goes on quite dry so you really have to work in applying yet so it looks even on both brows. However, I like the color and the fork applicator. See my pictures for a before and after (First picture is before and second picture is after application of this product).",14517,12265

Cons:  If takes multiple applications to add real volume and thickness to your lashes.<br /><br />This mascara did not cause any irritation or sensitivity and it stayed put all day long (even when sweating). It’s also easy to remove with a waterproof eye makeup remover.<br /><br />I didn’t notice this mascara helping curl my lashes.

It glides and rolls smoothly. The microneedling treatment is not too painful when you simply apply a little bit of pressure. It did not cause bleeding because I used it gently as directed.

I like the fact that this is aluminum free, paraben free, toxin free and petroleum free. it is also free of imitation perfumes.<br /><br />So far, I like using this product but need to put it to a test on a hot humid day while exercising!

I’ve used it on my hands, elbows, and on dry spots all over my body and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. I didn’t notice any scent when using the lotion.

4.0,1656002296946,Nice Brush | Similar To We Love Doodles & Chris Christensen | Cats Love It | Easily Removes Hair,"If I didn't already own & love my ""We Love Doodles"" brand of big slicker brush, I would have rated this brush at a full 5 stars. Mostly what I don't care for this brush vs Doodles is the handle. It is a little more narrow so it's a teensy bit less comfortable to hold. I have carpel tunnel. I've been grooming cats furever & grooming English angora rabbits for well over a decade.<br /><br />🐱For short & long haired cats, this brush works great. All of my cats love this brush & my Doodles brand. I can comb all of them except for my 14yo with a surprising amount of pressure & they roll around purring. Tons of hair gets picked up into the tines. Unlike some styles of brushes & combs, no hair is left behind around the tail area.<br /><br />Removing the hair from the brush is very easy. Start at one side from the bottom to loosen & then move to the other side. Keep working your way around & it comes off in a nice clean loose mat. I actually prefer these types of slicker brushes over self cleaning brushes & also over brushes with the little plastic beads on the ends. If you groom your animal properly, you don't need little balls on the ends of the tines. Those balls also make it a little harder to get the brush fully clean of hair.<br /><br />Cosmetically, I like the look of the brush much better than my Doodles brush. This is all black with a more classy branding in small white text on the head. We Love Doodles is blue & loudly brands itself on the head.<br /><br />🐰I don't recommend this style of brush for English angora rabbits. I have found that my bunnies seem to be more comfortable with smaller slickers with shorter tines. You'd think with their dense long coats, you'd want something large with long tines, but it really doesn't work out like you'd expect. At least for me it doesn't.<br /><br />🐰Recommended for English Angora Rabbits:<br /><br />🐇Doggy Man sells a small soft slicker brush that my angora rabbits love. It's plastic with a little blue ring on the handle. I have purchased/replaced many of them over the years (the handles tend to break over time) because they work well.<br />🌐 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NLVFH2<br />🐇I also recommend if money allows, a small slicker brush by Chris Christensen. I've never needed to replace it.<br />🌐 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GU7NKWW<br /><br />Personally, I'd shop between this brand (Rita's), We Love Doodles, & Chris Christensen. Chris Christensen is top of the line. They are worth it if you have the money. We Love Doodles has been the middle ground for me. They were originally priced at $50, but the price has been a lot lower for a while now. Rita's is currently the second most expensive & probably the lowest quality of the three brands. However, I've been using it for the least amount of time, so it's too early to know for sure. So far I like all three.<br /><br />Chris Christensen: Made in Germany $75.99<br />https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product//B00KAJTPZ2<br /><br />We Love Doodles: Made in USA $29.99<br />https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09G981NXV<br /><br />Rita's: Made in China $36.99",14892,12473
4.0,1650219651737,"Attractive Comb, Works On My Long & Short Haired Cats (Long sparse teeth comb)","I ordered the "" Long sparse teeth comb"" with my long haired cat in mind. I was worried the teeth would be too far apart, they're not. What is surprising is that this even works on my short haired cats. It pulls out loose fur just fine & my cats enjoy the way it feels. It does pull my long haired cats fur. She doesn't put up a fuss. Just purrs, cries at me if it hurts & continues to purr & reaches for me when I stop.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of getting away from plastics whenever possible. The comb is attractive & looks nice left out on my coffee table. The downside is that the handle is very thin & is pretty short. I have very small fine boned hands (I'm a wee Irish lass) & need to have my fingers at the comb for comfort & control. If you have large hands, I'm not sure this will work. Also, because it's not ergonomic it's really only good for short periods of use esp. if you have carpel tunnel like I do.<br /><br />In summary, I like the comb even though the quality could be better. A wider, longer more comfortable handle made with a stronger wood would have been pawsome.

The clips work fine on my junior bunnies, but on my adult bunnies, they are not able to catch all of the bunnies bangs to get the wool out of their eyes. After some humorous trial & error I found that these work beautifully as a side clip on my adult bunnies. 🦋 A reviewer stated they held a lot of hair; they don't. I'm sure they are fine for kids as advertised, but not a lot of adult hair (or bunny wool) as was implied in the review.<br /><br />The clip part feels very strong, like it is made of metal. You pinch one end & it opens up so you can slide it into the hair, then let go. Really simple to use.<br /><br />I docked a star because of the packaging 🤬 These came in the cello bag pictured. This means they slid all around & bunched on each other causing 3 of the 12 to become permanently disfigured. I have been trying to get the wings corrected, but they just want to stay like they are. Had they been attached to a card, this could have been avoided.<br /><br />Made in China.",14892,1832
4.0,1615134299267,Emphasizes Lashes For A Natural Look,"This goes on nice, doesn't clump at all even after a second or third swipe (to try to separate my lashes, not to add more; one swipe offers enough coverage). No big lift or length, but it still adds more than what my middle aged lashes have on their own. Overdone lashes would look silly on me anyway. This provides a natural look. No irritation & easy to wash off.",14892,506
3.0,1612028329379,"Unscented, Seems Decent, Not 100% Sure About Ingredients","I looked up the ingredients for this product at the Environmental Working Groups (EWG) Skin Deep data base & the following ingredients either rated as not green or I couldn't find them (0=green or safe, 10=red or dangerous):<br /><br />CYCLOPENTASILOXANE (3) - Persistent, bioaccumulative in wildlife, classified as expected to be toxic or harmful, uterine tumors in female rats, increased anogenital distance observed in rats at a moderate dose, moderate dose in rate suggested dopamine D2-receptor behavior on pituitary cells, suspected to be an environmental toxin and be persistent or bioaccumulative.<br />POLYSORBATE-60 (3)<br />DIPEPTIDE-3 AMINOHEXANOATE - Can't find this ingredient on EWG.<br />ACETYL ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN - Can't find this ingredient on EWG.<br /><br />I looked up DIPEPTIDE-3 AMINOHEXANOATE on DuckDuckGo & I guess it's a new skin ingredient. It might be why it & ACETYL ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN are not on EWG as they haven't been evaluated for safety. I really don't know though, it's just speculation on my part. As for safety, who knows? I rely on EWG to let me know. This is frustrating.<br /><br />I've used this several evenings as a night cream & I like it, but I don't love it. I heat my home exclusively with a wood stove. Even running humidifiers & essential oil diffusers 24/7, the air is painfully dry. So far this cream seems pretty good on my middle aged skin. The funny thing is, out of all the various brands I've tried on my face, a little known handmade brand has by far served me best. It's a brand called Eruzile or Progress in Health. They have two names. I don't know why. It's really annoying. They are on Etsy & last I checked, have their own website but for some foolish reason, it seems to be more expensive to shop at their website. And to be clear, I am not affiliated with them, I'm just a long time customer. Another brand I like but it is ridiculously expensive, so I hardly ever buy it is Juice Beauty Stem Cellular. You can get it right here on amazon.<br /><br />Okay, back to this brand. It is a light/thin feeling cream. Not greasy. It seems to absorb well. My skin does feel a tiny bit tight when I get up in the morning. I find a few spritz with rose water helps. This is packaged in a glass pot that you use your fingers to apply. A little plastic in the lid, so not Zero Waste, but not bad. It is not scented. It does have a smell as is normal because the ingredients will have their own smell to them, but when applying I don't notice the smell, so calling it unscented or fragrance free is more than reasonable. I only notice its smell if I'm practically sticking my nose in the pot & inhaling deeply.<br /><br />For me, this isn't moisturizing enough for the dead of winter, but for spring & fall I expect it will serve me fine.<br /><br />Overall, I would have rated this higher if not for the ingredient concerns.",14892,976
4.0,1609692701647,"Pretty Set, One Brush Frayed After First Use, The Rest Are Holding Up Well","I ordered this in the #6 set to use for watercolors. I know these are nail brushes, but I have found some nail brush products to not only be prettier in the hand, but also to last longer than standard watercolor brushes so I will order brushes like this on occasion.<br /><br />This set has it's pros & cons. The blue colored brush has a very disappointing brush head. After only one use the bristles started to fray.  The amber colored detail brush works great with no issues, same with the pink colored blunt brush. None of the heads are particularly large. The light blue is nice for little details.<br /><br />Knowing that watercolor is much more gentle to use, the fact that one of these brushes frays makes me wonder how well they will hold up to much more rough chemical nail use. Something you might want to keep in mind when considering your brush options.<br /><br />The overall look of the brushes is very nice. I love all things girly & nail brushes rarely fail me in the girly options that are floating around on amazon.<br /><br />So far my absolute favorite nail brush (that I use for watercolor) is a 100% Kolinsky Sable Round Nail Brush.

I find it is too dry & too much got wasted to be effective.<br /><br />I make my own cold process milk soaps & thought I'd give this a try that way. I make up my batch & mix some of this into part of the batter to do a layered swirl mix as to not over power the soap & make it too gritty. The bars look great & smell great, plus there is the natural exfoliation which is wonderful for the hands as well as the body.<br /><br />I personally love this as a kitchen hand soap because it really helps to remove cooking smells from the skin. Plus, the granules make for a wonderful, although brief hand massage.<br /><br />No toxic fragrances or perfumes, just natural safe ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, I am more than pleased.",14892,4057
5.0,1598564182499,"So Far, So Good","These have been working well so far. I mainly ordered them to scrub my face so my tinted moisturizer goes on more smoothly. I have combination skin that has both black & white heads plus dry skin. When I ordered these, I expected them to be half the size. So for my intended purpose, they are a bit of overkill. Once they are fully wet, they get a lot thicker & fluffier. In order to get my nose properly scrubbed, I bend the loofah & use the bent edge. It works.<br /><br />I hang these to dry on a copper rod that is just small enough to accommodate the little hanging loop that these have on them. This then hangs in front of a window which gets a lot of sun. It's a great way to get them to dry & to help fight bacteria.<br /><br />I hope they are 100% natural. I read in one of the questions that it has a foam core. I'm not too sure what to think of that. Really, with all the Chinglish & poor spelling, what should one think aside from, ""Oh, it's yet another made in China item being sold on amazon."" For the record, these loofah's will not ""remove horniness"" OMG, they really need to get someone to clean up their listings LOL!<br /><br />Overall, I'm really surprised by the quality & the size of these esp. after the lack of quality control in the listing. When you order stuff online, you never know what you're going to get. Time will tell how long they hold up for. I expect/hope they last a long time.",14892,10905
5.0,1598199782505,Beautiful Upgrade for DIY from Polluting Plastic Bottles,"This is the second set of spray bottles of this type that I have ordered. Each set has been from a different brand/seller. They both perform exactly the same. I use them to make my own household cleaners, room sprays, toilet sprays, etc. I'm not a fan of our cultures plastic addiction & try to reduce my impact on the planet when I can. Running my own eco family farm full time helps considerably ;)<br /><br />I like everything about these bottles except for the same exact thing I don't like about my other set of bottles, the spray head rotates easily. It doesn't unscrew, that's not what I'm talking about. It's the spray head itself. I think if the bottle wasn't so heavy this wouldn't be an issue, but when spraying downward, the bottle will move due to the weight. If I hold the bottle with one hand, while spraying with the other, all is well.<br /><br />A possible solution to this might be to purchase these 16 oz amber glass bottles separately, then purchase a separate pack of very highly rated, top quality spray nozzles & a sheet of labels to see if that helps. Perhaps these sets are being sold with lower quality spray nozzles. I really cannot say. I currently don't have a need to order a bunch of bottles in this size & enjoy the convenience of having a ready made kit of 2, so for now, I'm happy enough with what I have.",14892,1814

I cannot even imagine someone with average or large hands trying to hold onto this. Perhaps the issue is that I have very long, nearly to my butt straight hair, but I somehow doubt it. While this is a nice brush, Bass Brush is still the winner (link: https://amzn.to/2Y72DVJ)<br />The comb that comes with this is plastic. Not my thing at all. I wont be keeping it.<br />I'm keeping this brush in my vehicle, using my Bass in my home where my hair is brushed most often.<br />Overall, would have been a great brush if the handle was longer.",14892,2938

These need to off gas outdoors for at least a week. If the weather holds, even longer is better. I let them sit in my hay barn for 2 weeks before using them. They hold my very long straight hair well & do not tangle. They are even packaged in a tidy little round plastic case with a screw top lid. There are 2 of each of five different subtle & soft colors.

Obviously the brushes wont last as long, but right now, I'm not using them, LOL! I just wanted them, because you know, Harry Potter & therefore I had to have them. Impulse ordering at it's finest/worst? They even come with a velour drawstring pouch with the Storybook Cosmetics logo.

5.0,1594063246762,They Work Great,"These perform very well. I use them to make my own essential oil (EO) bug sprays, after sun sprays, room refreshers, etc. They are small, spray well & don't leak.<br /><br />The small size is great for portability. I take one of my bug spray formulas outside with me for while I work on my farm. Because I only use EO's the effectiveness wears off much faster than synthetic products. I keep the bottle on me to respray as needed. I have a bottle in my purse with a germ fighting blend for when stores are out of the cart wipes. I even made up a bottle of toilet spray. I use peppermint EO for that.<br /><br />The funnel has a very narrow spout making pouring a slow processes but it keeps me from accidentally over filling the bottles. The tube that goes into the bottle is plenty long. It actually curls up in a C on the very bottom of the bottle. You can cut it if you want, but I leave it as is, I think they function better with the long tube. The stickers are a bit of a joke. I can't really fit ""Bug Spray"" on one tiny label. I'd have to write ""BS"" so I write ""Bug"" instead or ""Sun"" for example. It just barely fits.<br /><br />Overall, great little spray bottles that suit my farm girl needs.",14892,10387

It adds a nice warm touch of color that is perfect for summer wear. It performs exactly as described. It does leave a shine, so I touch it up with Organic Wear pressed powder. There are no weird ingredients or fragrances.<br /><br />Another natural tinted moisturizer I like is by Organic Wear. Organic Wear provides a very thin, light coverage that requires a little bit of pressed powder to tone down the shine.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I decided to try this.

The ""leather"" sections are synthetic but still look good. The beads are wooden. There are two dyed green pheasant feathers & some really excellent quality rooster saddle feathers. The two silver beads that you use to adjust the size of the headpiece are plastic. The dream catcher section feels like cotton, it is a pretty blue color that compliments the peacock feather perfectly.<br /><br />It's very earthy & very natural, just what this dirt loving tree hugger farm girl loves.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased.",14892,4058

While I do like them & they will work for my purposes, they are not as wide as they appear in the product photos (my Walmart ones are double the width). I took off a star for that & only that. Otherwise they are great. I love the variety of prints, they are comfortable, & look good.<br />If it helps, I have long straight hair that goes past my bra line. I don't have bangs.

5.0,1666059138599,Very useful!,I ended up liking this Pedicure tub more than I should😊! It has many uses not just for your feet! The fact that it collapses makes it a very wise option for small houses or apartments! Material feels durable and should last a long time! The bottom of the bucket also has a pattern on it that can gently massage your feet as well as take off dead skin!,15118,2877

Not<br />short teeny tiny bristles! The hair is soft but I don't feel it's 100% pure kolinsky!

5.0,1657847822231,LOVE the mirror effect!,"I've used chrome powders in the past and have never been impressed by them.  Honestly, I just couldn't achieve a mirrored chrome effect.  This set of powders, however, is amazing!  With almost no effort at all, I created 4 test nails, with the mirror effect coming through on all of them!  I used white at the base color on all my test nails, except for the gold nail that uses a nude base color.  These powders are super easy to use, a tiny amount goes a long ways, and the colors are just lovely.  A few tricks I discovered:  less powder is better than more...if you use to much it get's clumpy and can't be easily fixed.  Apply a base coat, a colored base color, AND a top coat before adding the chrome...this creates a wonderfully smooth and durable surface for the powder.  Be sure to brush the nails off to remove any loose powder before adding your final top coat.  I'm excited to use this powder on my own nails!!",15230,12252
5.0,1655301960371,"Great, versatile builder’s gel!","I was concerned this builder gel would be difficult to work with based only on how runny it looks in the product pix.  In real life it looks runny and sticky, but is surprisingly easy to work with.  After applying a long bead of the gel with the included brush, I pushed the gel to my desired shape, and then let it self level to smooth itself out.  On both thick and thin layers very little effort was required on my part.  In fact, if I tried to get the shape perfect with the brush, the gel got stickier and messier, so I quickly learned to let the gel smooth itself out.  Tip: once you get your shape all smoothed out, turn your nail upside down and let gravity create a natural apex before popping it under the lamp. So far I’ve only used the clear gel.  I created on extension (not shown), attached rhinestones to several pride nails, and fully encapsulated a fully covered rhinestone nail.  1 thick layer of this hard gel and a have encased rhinestones that fully cured in just over 2 minutes!  I also plan to use this for simple overlays when my nail need additional support.  The sticker nail forms work well, the slip solution is good for clean up work (not shaping the gel), and the brush/spatula tool work as expected.  The tiny buffer and file are silly...why include tools that won’t last a day?  Best off all, the gel containers are pretty big... these will last me awhile!",15230,2825

Hyalauranic aside serum increases the skins ability to absorb moisture,  Niacinamide helps keep the moisture in.  This cream has a lovely scent, is super light and absorbs easily, without leaving my skin oily or heavy...I absolutely love it.  I apply it right after my HA serum in the morning, and follow it with a moisturizer.  After just a few days there’s a noticeable improvement in my skins moisture level and my skin tone has improved.

5.0,1622732343904,Good hydration and plumping!,"I like these face masks, and for the price, they cant’t be beat!  Pros:  they stay in place without slipping or dripping, even while I move around; within an hour of use my skin feels more moisturized,; after several uses my skin looks more plumped; non-irritating and scent free; they cover my entire face; and of course, at about $1 each, the price is great!  Cons:  the masks are folded with a backing sheet but are still trickier than most to unfold; the eye holes are a little small; and my skin feels sticky after I remove the masks and pat in the remaining serum, so I have to splash cool water to get my skin feeling clean.  Overall, these are a great as a daily mask!",15230,1133

The lotion has a nice medium consistency and absorbs nicely and doesn't leave a greasy residue, but it does take a couple of minutes.  I use this lotion on my hands, keeping it in my bag, car and on the nightstand.  My only issue is that the moisture it creates doesn't last long...I have to reapply it frequently...like every couple of hours  But let's be fair...at roughly $4/tube, this lotion is a fantastic value!",15230,211
3.0,1618348253072,"Mostly good results, wasteful packaging...","I had mixed results with these 3 products.  The eye patches are gel patches and not meant to be wet with serum - the serum is released by the gel when it's in contact with skin.  The patches easily stayed in place, but resulted in no visible improvements, and left my undereye area feeling a little dehydrated.  The lip patch is also a gel patch.  It was odd to wear, but it stayed on while I moved around and almost seemed to form a suction seal around my mouth after 10 minutes.  I liked this patch - it left my lips smooth and soft for a day and a half...nice!  The foot booties are for moisturizing only...these are NOT exfoliating booties that take days to work and lead to skin peeling.  They were easy to use and comfortable to wear.  I wore them for 30 minutes and was quite pleased with how soft my feet still felt after 2 days.  My only issue was that after removing the booties I had to spend a good amount of time massaging in the lotion left on my feet...seriously, even after trying to dry them with a towel my feet felt greasy.  Be sure to allow time for the product to absorb afterwards and don't plan to run out the door like I did.  For all of this, I would give the set 4 stars.  However, there's an EXCESSIVE amount of packaging.  The patches all have plastic protectors on both sides, are enclosed in plastic clam shells, and are sealed in the final package.  I felt guiltier than usual when I saw the pile of trash I generated by using this set...these items are definitely over packaged.",15230,12672

It’s not artificial or overwhelming like perfume, but smells botanical, like real lavender.  The lotion has a medium consistency and quickly absorbs, leaving a slight, non-greasy shine on my hands that makes them look less dry.  The scent fades quickly, but my hands feel soft and moisturized for hours...love it!  And, each lotion comes in an unbranded gift box, making them very giftable!",15230,964
3.0,1605840100014,"Ok, but not as clarifying as expected.","First, Pelargonium Graveolens = Rose Geranium (I had to look it up!).  Fancy flower aside, this mask has absolutely no scent.  One of the main reasons I ordered this was because I expected a pleasant scent, so this was disappointing.  The mud is very thin and a little watery which was surprising.  Ultimately the mud doesn’t fully dry or pull my skin, and it’s pretty easy to wash off...no dried mud on my hairline!  There are little bits of something in the mud, leaves I think, that I don’t care for.  They’re aren’t a lot of them, so it seems like this wasn’t intentional and may be a quality control issue.  Up close the bits look a little rotten and rather unappealing.  After 15 minutes my pores look a little tighter, the few tiny blackheads I have are still there, and I can’t really say my skin feels more hydrated.  It doesn’t feel dry, it pretty much feels like it always does.  The packaging, as with all Freshme products is lovely, with the tube of mud packaged inside a matching box, so very giftable.  Personally, I prefer the Freshme sheet masks to this mud.  The clarifying benefits I expect from a mud mask just aren’t as obvious as I’d hoped.",15230,434
5.0,1604809765483,"Nice masks, nice results!","I’ve tried several different Karuna masks...they’re all good, but some are better than others.  This particular set is a great mix of masks designed to help with different needs, including hydrating, soothing and brightening.  The masks are individually wrapped and presented in a box that opens like a book, with suggestions for which masks to use on which days.  The packaging is nice and these would make a great gift.  The masks are very saturated (overly saturated, IMO) with serum, with plenty left over to use on my neck.  They’re large enough to easily cover my entire face, and come with a paper backing that makes them easy to to unfold.  Because they’re so saturated they easily slip while on my face, which makes it impossible to do anything other than sit still for the 20-30 minutes I wear them.  Also, there’s so much serum left on my face after I remove the masks, it’s impossible for my skin to absorb it all.  I’ve discovered that lightly splashing my face with cold water helps remove the excess serum and my skin fully dries more quickly.  Ultimately, all of the face masks left my skin very soft and hydrated, and a few of them plumped my skin and created a lovely even skin tone.  There is one set of eye masks in the kit and that that were surprisingly light and effective, reducing puffiness and brightening my eyes.  These are a tiny bit pricey, but they’re a nice quality and I like having a set of masks that cover a range of needs.",15230,979

The packets are small and easy to toss in my gym bag or purse, the wipes have no scent, and one will go a long way.  And most impressive, aside from the company’s commitment to sustainability, my skin dries quickly, isn’t sticky, and feels quite soft.  The air just got dry where I live, so every bit of moisture is appreciated.  Love this company, love this product!",15230,2271
4.0,1601147333449,"Super soft skin, but oh so messy to use!!","This coffee scrub smells divine while dry, and leaves my skin smelling ever so subtly like coffee and cinnamon.  Oddly, I don’t really notice the smell in the shower.  I love the exfoliation and use it on my entire body.  Out of the shower, I feel a mild oil barrier on my skin that I don’t care for.  Once I add my normal body shaping cream (Clarins Body Fit), I’m in heaven!  The 2 products together leave my skin super cool and tingly for about an hour, followed by crazy soft skin.  I don’t actually have a lot of cellulite (thank you Clarins!), but what I do have is less noticeable after just 2 uses.  So, what’s not to like?  This scrub is so incredibly messy, it’s borderline impractical!  Most scrubs are made with sugar or salt crystals held together with some form of oil or gel, and dissolve in the shower.  Ground coffee doesn’t dissolve and this scrub is dry, so it literally gets everywhere...like sand from the beach!  And worse, I have a walk in shower with white tile floors...coffee stains if it sits too long!  As much as I like the way this product smells and improves my skin texture, it’s a pain in my cellulite free backside to clean up!  Mixing it with a little water and creating a paste before use helps a little, and thankfully I have a handheld shower to quickly rinse it off my tiled walls and shower door, but I’m constantly concerned it’s going to stain my floor grout.  Deep sigh...I soooooo wish this product weren’t so messy!",15230,4057
5.0,1600207061094,My favorite Karuna mask!,"I’ve used various Karuna masks, but this is defiantly my favorite.  The mask was super saturated out of the package, so I had to scrape some of the serum off to keep it from dripping.  I also had to fold the large mask over in a few spots where it covered my hairline on all 3 sides.  On my face the mask was cool and refreshing.  Conveniently, it didn’t slip at all, even while sitting up and looking at my cell phone.  I could smell the green tea, but it wasn’t overwhelming.  TIP:  I’ve learned that Karuna masks leave A LOT of serum on the face that doesn’t easily absorb into the skin once the mask is removed.  I left the mask on for 30 minutes, increasing absorption and letting it dry out a bit...I highly recommend this, followed by splashing cool water on your face to gently remove any excess serum.  This prevents sticky skin and left my face feeling smooth and soft almost immediately.  Within 2 hours my skin felt hydrated and looked brighter and super clean.  Very happy with this mask!",15230,980

3.0,1632173708221,This Is Poorly Designed,"While this Aoraem collector can pick up some small particles, the suction it produces isn’t that great, so it leaves a lot behind. If you add the small hose attachment, then its suction power lessens even further. It was doing a halfway decent job at cleaning my keyboard, but the attachment kept falling off. The little bristles aren’t really helping anything and they are very harsh on my large mouse pad, which is what I mostly use these for. My old collector has a small lever you push to turn it on. The Aoraem requires you to turn the entire top half of the unit to power it. That’s fine for turning it on, but when you try to turn it off, it can loosen the bottom tray and the particles spill out if you’re not careful.

The water tank is the same capacity as my smaller, inexpensive sprayers and the battery doesn’t last any longer. The Tiang spray feels quite harsh on my face.

It truly does feel velvety, silky and soft.<br /><br />I was able to appreciate all of the above before I even tried the product. However, using the product is the real treat. This soft and silky cream is just fun to use. Getting out of the shower and dealing with dry skin in the winter is a pain and this product changes that. Instead of being in a hurry to get some lotion slathered on my skin so I can get dressed, I look forward to pampering myself with this product.

Once the battery is put in, you choose a head and turn the device on. It vibrates rather than spins and it does an amazing job cleaning my face. I really like the silicone head because it cleans but it also feels great. The brush head is a bit abrasive and not as comfortable but does clean deeper.<br /><br />Because the brush is waterproof, I can use it in the shower. It also has a stand so I can leave it upright in the stand when finished. I also like not having to charge it.",16965,8418

5.0,1605736873530,Great for moisturizing during the winter months,"My oils arrived in bottles with security seals beneath the lids. Each bottle has a cap but a pump accompanies each bottle as well. I much prefer the pumps for oils since they are thinner and it can be difficult to control a pour. During the winter months I use these oils as skin moisturizers. When still damp from a shower, I rub the oil on my skin and it moisturizes much better than any type of lotion that I have tried.<br /><br />These oils also make wonderful body scrubs using essential oils for scent and sugar or salt for the exfoliating. Using the scrubs also helps to moisturize.<br /><br />I found the oils to be fresh, no sign of a rancid smell. They both come in an amber colored bottle which is the best way to store them.<br /><br />Just in case you are not familiar with these types of oils, they are not scented. Neither oil has any type of scent at all and they are meant to be used as moisturizing products or carrier oils.<br /><br />Overall: really nice set of oils that are fresh and in the right type of bottle.",16965,140

If you have never used good scissors, you may not know that these are poor quality and won’t do a good job on anyone’s hair.<br /><br />I was actually disappointed in the cape as I expected it to be a bit better than it is. It is poorly designed and doesn’t quite cover the entire area where hair would fall on your neck. The combs are OK and so are the clips.

I’ve been using this ceramide serum after cleansing and follow with my face cream, but it also layers well with my favorite staples, such as a Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serum (followed by my moisturizer).<br /><br />I like that this ceramide serum doesn’t appear to have any harsh ingredients, and it feels soothing and gentle to my skin. I’ve used it about a week so far and it adds noticeable hydration that isn't heavy, greasy or sticky, and my normally sensitive skin is calm and comfortable.

3.0,1669914635772,Pleasant But Feels More Clarifying Than Hydrating To My Dry Skin-Has Risky Ingredient TEA,"I have dry, sensitive and mature (55+) skin and used this Reboncel Aqua Rich Foaming Cleanser daily for about a week. This cleanser has fragrance that smells relatively light to me, though fragrance is an ingredient that poses health risks. I generally avoid foaming face cleansers as they tend to make my skin overly dry, but this has a pleasing creaminess and initially made my skin feel good. It cleaned my skin well yet left it feeling refreshed, soft and comfortable after use.<br /><br />After using this wash more than a few days in a row, it felt more clarifying (better for oily skin) than hydrating to my skin. While it didn’t strip my skin or make it visibly irritated, by the end of the week my skin just didn’t feel as comfortable as it did at first and it felt like my skin would end up too dry if I continued daily use. So I switched back to my creamy, hydrating cleansers, but felt this cleanser would still be good to use as needed as a clarifying cleanser.<br /><br />However, while this wash has some good ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Aloe Extract and Sodium Hyaluronate, this has controversial Triethanolamine (“TEA”) high on the ingredient list. It’s on my personal list of ingredients to avoid after reading many articles about it and seeing it on lists of risky chemical by many sources. Some sources say it’s safe in amounts we get thru cosmetics, but I’m concerned about the cumulative effect of risky chemicals.<br /><br />TEA is a nitrosamine used to generate foam and adjust pH and is likely a hormone disrupter and irritant. But the bigger issue for me is that TEA gets absorbed through the skin and reacts with other chemicals to form the carcinogen NDEA. While less risky in rinse off products, it still poses more risk than I’m comfortable with. The problem is that I have no way to know if this cleanser or any product I’m using with it has chemicals that react with TEA.<br /><br />So, for me, I find it best to avoid all products with TEA, especially since so many alternative products are available that don’t have it. I also dislike that this has so much Cocamidopropyl Betaine (second ingredient), which I generally avoid mostly due contamination concerns. Fragrance also poses health risks, though it’s a common ingredient I don’t avoid altogether (but I do try and minimize use). All things considered, this is just okay for me. 3 stars.",17622,2281

It’s described as having green calamine to tone down redness and cica pine water to calm skin. But I’m unable to find a full ingredient list. The box has directions in English but lacks an ingredient list in English, so I don’t know what’s even in this product. I have dry, sensitive skin and avoid many skincare ingredients, so I won’t make this balm or any product part of my daily routine without an ingredient list.<br /><br />I have used this balm a few times after my moisturizer and before foundation (if wearing makeup). The balm smells light and pleasant, and it adds some comforting moisture. While it tends to sink into my skin, I do get some color correction of redness on my nose and cheeks. But it’s less than I get with my corrective color makeup. If the balm has healthy ingredients that benefit my skin while also correcting some degree of redness, I’d likely prefer it to just hiding redness with makeup. But I can’t judge if the trade off is there without knowing ingredients.<br /><br />This balm also makes my skin smoother. It feels like it might have silicone and/or glycerin and feels a lot like a primer under my makeup. I like the moist and spreadable texture, except it’s so soft I can’t just swipe across the top with the puff for an even amount of product as it smooshes in the balm and gouges out pieces (which I then spread and dab with the puff). It becomes less noticeable as the balm soaks in, but I don’t like that this settles into and emphasizes pores on my nose. This is just okay for me. 3 stars. Made in Korea.",17622,14017

The color reads darker on me than I’d expect from the photo, but it’s a lovely metallic shade that looks like a bronze with rose hue or a little rose gold in it. I have light skin with an olive hue and rosy color lips, and this color is flattering but is probably even better on medium and dark skin tones.<br /><br />But, while this lipstick initially spreads on smooth and velvety, it stays sticky and doesn’t fully dry down on me even with just one application. It doesn’t feel comfortable as I tend to get dry lips and it adds no moisture (and may be drying my lips more). Used alone, it accentuates lines and flakiness even used after a great lip scrub. And it doesn’t work applied over a little lip balm as it rolls off in weird little pieces. For me, it’s best with a little gloss over it, but it still feels sticky and rolls off (to a lesser extent) if I rub my lips together. Overall, it’s just okay at best. 3 stars.",17622,2133

My lips don’t get dried out or irritated, and the color doesn’t bleed even though I have dry skin. This is semi sheer yet buildable and even one swipe gives me good coverage that wears well. This does have sparkles that I need to remove after wear.<br /><br />This lipstick is really pretty. It looks sparkly and shimmery and has become a favorite for evening as it’s more glam than my subtle everyday pinks, yet it doesn’t look overdone or too intense. I wouldn’t normally choose an orange shade, but this turned out to be really flattering with my light skin with an olive hue. While “burnt orange” is a fair description of how it looks in the tube, on me this looks less orange and more like a reddish/nude color with a sparkly finish that’s coppery.

4.0,1653717347249,"Weightless, Skin Feels Silky, Makeup Lasts Longer, Blurs Lines-Odd Smell, Skin Gets Weird Sensation","This Grown Alchemist Anti-Pollution Primer has a gel texture that feels weightless on my skin. This doesn’t have a lot of ingredients and lacks chemical fragrance, but I find the scent is moderately strong. I assume it’s mostly from natural lavender, rose and grapefruit oils. I really don’t love the scent as it smells odd to me, but it mellows out and doesn’t really bother me. The lavender and grapefruit oils are potential irritants, but my sensitive skin hasn’t had any visible reaction or real discomfort using this primer.<br /><br />I have dry skin and when I apply the primer my skin feels a weird initial sensation that reminds me of alcohol, but so far it hasn’t caused any visible dryness. I do always apply a hydrating essence, serum and cream before the primer and I see the primer has glycerin, so that may be why I don’t see dryness or maybe something in this just feels mildly irritating to my skin. This does have benzyl alcohol pretty low on the list, so maybe I’m feeling that but the good part is that I haven’t had any real issue. I can’t say if daily use might dry my skin.<br /><br />This primer is super lightweight, so sheer it’s invisible and I don’t feel any sticky residue. It makes my skin feel silky, and my cream and liquid foundations spread smoothly and evenly over it. I do notice a blurring effect, especially around my mouth area where I need all the help I can get. My makeup holds up well all day even though the weather has been so really hot lately.

I can usually get the top pretty smooth but have some baby hairs and bad hair days where little hairs stick out and adding more of my regular lightweight gel or other products can weigh my hair down too much, make it look wet or dirty or make it clumpy or stiff. I don’t know why but I didn’t have high hopes that this Wing Fly Grl Mane Taming Wand gel would be anything special, but it really works great for my fine hair.<br /><br />It’s about the size of a mascara and has a wand with a small foam type applicator (similar to one on a lip gloss) at the end. I just gently run it over the hairs sticking up on top and they just lay down and blend right in with the rest of my hair.  I can’t say how this works for thick hair, but it sure is fast and easy to use and works great for me. My hair is very dark brown and I can’t see any sign of the gel, just the benefit of smooth hair.<br /><br />I haven’t experienced any flaking, dryness, stiffness, wet look, burning or discomfort or issues with my hair color. This wand is convenient as it’s so compact and easy to carry in my purse on-the-go. The ingredient list is short and no ingredients stand out as worrisome health risks or as being possibly damaging to my hair. It works like a charm smoothing my little flyaways and so far has no negative consequences. I’ll update if I see any issues in the longer term, but it’s all good so far.

4.0,1630820824652,"Best For PM As A Little Heavy & Greasy, Boosts Moisture Well & Skin Feels Soft, Light Lavender Scent","Dose of Colors Cold Pressed Booster Multi-Use Oil agrees well with my dry, sensitive skin. I do find this Booster oil a little heavier than some other facial oil blends, but it doesn’t bother me as I tend to use facial oil blends of this type at night, and my skin is dry enough that I can use this during the day. I just have to be careful not to apply too much. When I add a little oil to my cream, I get extra moisture and the oil makes my skin feel soft and look dewy.<br /><br />This Booster has a high percentage of squalane (about 44%). It’s one of my favorite ingredients as it adds extra moisture to my dry skin and makes my skin smooth and soft. For daytime, I do have 100% squalane that I tend to prefer to this Booster oil just because it’s so lightweight yet gives me that extra moisture and softness. But I’d rather use like the the Booster oil blend at night as it has additional ingredients beyond squalane that add benefits, such as antioxidant and fatty acid rich sunflower seed oil.<br /><br />At night, I’ve tried this Booster oil various ways. I’ve applied it after cleansing and toning but would rather use a regular serum. I’ve mixed it with my night cream and have also applied after my cream. I feel there’s no right or wrong way, but I like it best added after my night cream as I can use all my regular products yet I also get an extra boost of antioxidants and moisture that can soak protect and nourish my skin all night. I like waking up to skin that still feels hydrated and comfortable.<br /><br />I’m impressed that this Booster oil emphasizes natural and gentle ingredients, and it also lacks chemical fragrance. I do smell a hint of lavender oil. It can be an irritant form some and can give me headaches if it’s too strong. Luckily, it’s subtle enough not to cause an issue. In fact, this Booster oil doesn’t cause any irritation to my sensitive skin at all. Like it a lot. 4.5 stars. Made in Canada.",17622,73
4.0,1623685953622,"Easy & Painless, Temporary Smoothing w/ Serum-Enjoy It But Can’t Gauge Long Term Benefit","﻿I’ve been using the NIRA Skincare Laser & Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a couple weeks and can’t yet gauge whether the laser is effective at increasing collagen production and smoothing wrinkles as a long term benefit. I get good results from the hyaluronic acid (HA) serum as it gives quick but temporary plumping and smoothing of wrinkles, as do other good HA serums. I also suspect the warmth created by Nira laser may increase absorption of the HA serum and boost its short term benefits (though I can’t say for sure).<br /><br />I assume it will take regular use for at least 60 days (and likely 90 days) to judge Nira‘s benefits beyond the temporary HA plumping. Nira’s own before and after photos are from the 90-day mark. While I’ll continue use of the Nira laser to see if it helps, I question the extent of any long term benefits based on Nira’s own photos that show a smiling before photo and a rather solemn after photo; clearly, we more lines are evident when smiling so I feel photos would be more credible if they showed someone with the same or similar expression in the before and after photos.<br /><br />Still, I like the Nira laser as it holds a charge well and is quick and easy to use. It gives feedback via beeps. Nira states it has FDA clearance (which I haven’t verified) for wrinkle treatment around the eyes. I’m cautious about the eye area, so I’m initially trying Nira on less sensitive skin between my eyebrows where I have fine lines and slight sagging and also on my neck where I have a weird wrinkle likely from looking down at my tablet. I started using Nira on fine lines around my mouth, but I may hold off until I feel confident it won’t exacerbate existing pigmentation issues.<br /><br />Nira is painless and I only feel warming on setting 2 or 3 (depending on area). The skin around my mouth is drier and only tolerates a 2, and it turns red temporarily. I’ve tried a 4 between the eyebrows and it stings, so I’ll need to work up. I use the HA serum after use, and it’s a clear gel like serum that’s calming and my redness goes away quickly. I get a quick plumping effect that temporarily helps smooths lines, but I can’t say if Nira will provide a long term benefit over time. I do like using it with the serum, so I’m rating it 4 stars. I’ll update as appropriate.",17622,8

This is a thick, heavy, white cream with very subtle fragrance (last ingredient). This cream feels rich, but my dry skin doesn’t look greasy and my skin is dry enough that I’ve used this during the day. Still, it’s heavy and I prefer it as a night cream. It makes my skin feel calm, supple and so hydrated that it minimizes my fine lines.<br /><br />When I first applied this cream, it felt kind of like a barrier cream. While I love rich creams, I dislike creams that sit heavy on top of my skin as it feels annoying to me like my skin can’t breathe. But this Ogana Cell cream feels good as it turns out it absorbs well and feels like it only leaves just a light, protective layer that’s breathable on my skin. It’s probably just the feel of the occlusive dimethicone. This cream feels good and isn’t too heavy for me.<br /><br />This cream is perfect for times my face gets irritated or agitated as it feels extra gentle and calming. I also used a little of this cream on the back of my hands when they feel dry and get red as this cream is soothing and makes them feel better. This cream has no alcohol and the ingredients rate low risk by EWG, except fragrance always get a high risk rating. Love it. 5 stars. Made in Korea.",17622,710

I go through lotion and cream fast as I use it every time I wash my hands and more, so I like this bigger size as it lasts longer but is still a compact size for my purse. It’s also big enough for a long weekend away from home.<br /><br />This is a lightweight mineral oil based lotion that absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave any greasy residue. It has a pleasant feel and adds just enough moisture to make my dry hands soft and fairly comfortable. I do prefer more hydration, but I also have dry rather than normal skin. The fragrance is moderately strong and sweet. It’s okay used just on my hands, but it would be too strong for me if used as an all over body lotion.<br /><br />I dislike that this lotion has controversial Triethanolamine (TEA). The FDA designates it as safe for limited use (but bans it from hand sanitizer), but EWG rates it as a moderate health risk (allergen). And TEA can play a role in the formation of dangerous nitrosamines when combined with certain preservatives. I can’t assess that issue in this or any specific products, so I just try to avoid TEA.

This is a clear, fragrance free liquid in a dropper bottle. Its non greasy, feels weightless and is non irritating to my sensitive skin. It can be applies directly to the skin, but my favorite way to use it is to add a couple drops to my face cream (and still use a serum). I’ve used it with Beauty Stat Moisture Boost Cream, but it also works great with other face creams. I even add it to my creams that fall just short of hydrating my skin enough and feel like the I get enough moisture once this squalane is added.<br /><br />I love the results of this squalane Essence as I notice it gives my skin an immediate moisture boost that minimizes my fine lines, and it also makes my dry skin feel silky soft. I’ve been using Beauty Stat squalane well over a month as this is my second bottle (finished a travel size first), and my skin looks and feels firmer too. Squalane is also anti aging as it has antioxidants that fight free radicals and skin damage. This Beauty Stat squalane is excellent for my dry, sensitive skin and squalane gets a low risk EWG rating.

The pads are large and soaked in a generous amount of solution. My pads look totally covered in makeup after gently wiping my face to remove my makeup, so I feel they do an excellent job. There’s no fragrance, but this has a nice light scent that hints of citrus.<br /><br />I squeeze out excess solution when I use the pads to remove my eye makeup (concealer, highlighter, shadow, etc.) and the pads do a great job with my eye makeup too. However, I don’t wear waterproof mascara and also don’t rub mascara off my eyes with any remover. My mascara largely comes off when I wash my face, and I’m wed to particular mascara remover that I use to wipe mascara residue after I’ve cleansed. But this works well too.<br /><br />There’s no need to rinse or cleanse after I wipe my face with these pads, and I have skipped cleansing at times. This makes my dry skin feel soft and hydrated and leaves just a hint of residue that I’d guess is glycerin (but I’m not sure). Other times, I basically double cleanse given how I remove my mascara and sometimes I just really want to make sure and remove all residue from my face (especially if I’ve worn more makeup) before applying other products like an essence, serums and creams.<br /><br />I’m impressed that this works so well and also has low risk ingredients. It lacks chemical fragrance, alcohol, silicones and parabens, and it has sodium hyaluronate to hydrate and plump the skin and other dry skin ingredients, such as glycerin, matricaria flower/stem extract and butylene glycol. This has other good stuff like a marine complex, botanical extracts, collagen, pearl extract and more. Love it. 5 stars.",17622,13636

I’m not one for a complicated makeup routine and also don’t like experimenting a lot with my makeup, so love that this compact includes my contour bronzer, blush and highlighter and step-by-step application instructions for applying and blending all three colors. It’s rare that I can use all colors in a palette, so I’m really pleased that all three colors work beautifully together and actually flatter my skin tone. The highlighter and even the blush can be used as eye makeup too.<br /><br />I have light skin with an olive hue. I knew the bronzer and highlighter colors would work as I wear similar shades from my regular bronzer palette, but I wasn’t sure about wearing a peachy blush color as I’ve always worn red and pink shades. But I’m so glad I tried this palettes I realize I should have shifted to wearing a peachy shade ages ago as it goes with my skin tone well. This peach doesn’t have too much orange and is rather neutral, but it gives my skin a natural flush that’s pretty. These colors are buildable, so I start light (especially with the bronzer).<br /><br />These are well pigmented and apply evenly with no streaking. I have dry skin but get a smooth, velvety application. The colors are long lasting as I wore them all day yesterday, and my makeup still looked good at the end of the day. These powders don’t settle in my fine lines, and it’s quick and easy to apply and blend the colors with just one brush. The palette is made in China, but the box says this is certified cruelty free. I’m really happy with this palette, and the quality exceeds my expectations at the current $28 price. Love it. 5 stars.",17622,14026

These fragrance free products are exceptional for my hyperpigmentation and skin tone issues, dry skin and skin texture. These don’t irritate my dry and sensitive skin and seem well suited to any skin types.<br /><br />I’ve used 20% L-Ascorbic acid for many years and worked up from 5% to 20% over time as it can sting, itch or irritate the skin to go straight to a high 20% concentration. I’ve been using this Universal C Serum since last year (before this sample kit) and had no stinging this time and had only temporary, slight stinging when I first tried the C serum last year as I wasn’t using my Vitamin C serum as routinely for a short period.<br /><br />With regular use at least 1x a day, the Universal C Serum brightens my skin and evens my skin tone. While it didn’t go away 100%, this serum flattened and faded a large brown spot on my jawline so much it became barely visible. It also faded smaller brown spots on my cheeks. The serum makes my skin smoother and it seems a bit firmer. Vitamin C is an excellent antioxidant for long term anti aging benefits too.<br /><br />I apply the Universal C Serum after cleansing and toning and follow with the Essence (Squalene drops) and Moisture Boost. The Moisture Boost feels lightweight and nongreasy, but it’s super moisturizing when I mix in a couple Squalane drops. The texture of my dry skin feels so silky and smooth, and my skin feels comfortable and amply hydrated all day. These products provide real benefits for me. Love this set. 5 stars.",17622,1538
4.0,1617128292905,"Feels Lightweight For My Dry Skin, Better For Evening As Strong Lavender Scent & Retinyl Palmitate","This Kneipp lavender lotion is thick, but it’s not a heavy or greasy lotion. This probably provides moderate hydration for normal skin, but for me it feels quite lightweight. I think it’s a nice cream, but I prefer a richer lotion or cream that comforts my dry skin more and provides longer lasting hydration. When I’ve applied this after an evening shower, my skin feels reasonably moisturized for a few hours but it’s not enough moisture to last all night so I need to reapply before bed. This seems best for those who don’t need heavy hydration and enjoy a lavender scent.<br /><br />This lotion does have a moderately strong lavender scent that even lingers on my hands after washing. It smells nice and doesn’t bother me, but it may bother those sensitive to fragrance as this is just in the range of what I can tolerate as strong lavender has been a headache trigger for me. This lotion has retinyl palmitate, which is especially risky mixed with sun exposure. This lotion seems best for evening use given that lavender can be relaxing and retinyl palmitate doesn’t mix well with sun. Like it. 4 stars.",17622,2990

This Murad Hydration Intense Recovery Cream is pale green and has a nice, light spearmint scent that may be from mint oils, such as Mentha Viridis Leaf Oil and Mentha Arvensis Leaf Oil, as chemical fragrance isn’t listed. This cream has an unusual balmy texture that feels slippery and silky. It oddly feels like it just sits on top of my dry skin rather being absorbed. It’s not greasy, but it feels heavy like a barrier cream. I’m not crazy about that feel. I do like that it’s thick and has somewhat of a firming feel.<br /><br />I’d be okay with the texture at night (not for daytime), but this cream imparts a strong cooling sensation (possibly from mint oil as this is alcohol free) that doesn’t feel pleasing to me. Instead of feeling soothing and calming, it feels stimulating and kind of agitating. My skin gets itchy and prickly, so I’ve had to wash it off as my skin feels uncomfortable and like it might blister or get a rash (though it hasn’t in the short time I’ve left it on). It feels better rubbed on my arm, so maybe it’s good for other skin types.<br /><br />I can’t gauge how well this hydrates as I had to discontinue use. It has some good stuff like apple fruit extract (scavenges free radicals) and algae (antioxidant and hydration). It also has moisturizing and/or soothing ingredients, such as glycerin, vitamin E, butylene glycol, macadamia nut oil and shea butter. However, it also has known sensitizers, such as spearmint and mint oils, that get “poor” ratings by Paula’s Choice. This generally seems like a quality cream, but it feels heavy and irritating to my sensitive skin. 3.5 stars.",17622,1542

My favorite gels are by Patchology as I get amazing results. The GenSkin marine algae gels seem good quality and they do make my skin feel soft, but I don’t see the obvious plumping benefits I get with the Patchology gels and these gels also don’t feel as comforting or refreshing. I’ve even compared by wearing one of each brand at the same time, and my skin with the Patchology gel gets superior results as my lines barely show.<br /><br />These GenSkin gels are deep blue and have added colorant (which is typical). They also have fragrance, but it doesn’t smell overly strong. The GenSkin patches stay on well and have some good dry skin ingredients, such as sodium hyaluronate, glycerin, beta glucan, matricaria flower extract and butylene glycol. Most ingredients rate low risk by EWG (other than fragrance, colorant and preservative).

I follow my shower with my usual moisturizer, and my skin feels calm and comfortable. This soap bar seems long lasting, maybe because it doesn’t get mushy or disintegrate. I enjoy the scent as it’s fresh, light and I think it’s smells more like citrus than lavender. It’s a neutral scent that seems good for anyone.

I apply 3 drops to my skin after cleansing and follow with my face cream after giving the oil a little time to absorb. This oil feels rich, but it doesn’t have a heavy or greasy feeling on my skin. It makes my skin feel great whether I apply my face cream after waiting for the oil to absorb fully or I apply it while there’s still a light residue on my face.<br /><br />I can use Laloirelle during the day without issues applying makeup after, but others may have a different experience as I have dry skin. But I do prefer it at night with a face cream after as it’s so effective and long lasting that my skin still feels well moisturized and smooth when I wake the next morning. The oily residue is gone by then, but I think my fine lines look softer and my skin looks more radiant. I feel like my skin gets a boost or head start for the day, and that it’s not just a temporary effect from silicones and chemicals found in so many products.<br /><br />This contains a sandalwood and jasmine oil blend that’s so light I don’t even smell it when I apply the product to my face.

I don’t feel my dry skin gets as much hydration as I get with my favorite premium body butters and creams, but those are heavier products so I don’t expect as much from a lotion.<br /><br />When applied after my shower, I get about 8 hours of hydration. That’s pretty good, though not the 24 hours claimed on the site. I do have dry skin and find this lotion hydrates better than most lotions. I’ve occasionally found one that gives me longer lasting hydration, but it’s uncommon. Excipial keeps my dry skin comfortable and itch free more like 12 hours but has chemicals such as parabens, while Guayaquil Hemp Lotion emphasizes organic and natural ingredients (but does have Phenoxyethanol).<br /><br />Guayaquil Hemp Lotion feels gentle and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. It doesn’t list chemical fragrance and is labeled fragrance free, which is a big plus as some fragrances trigger sensitivities for me. But it still may have fragrance. I smell a faint non offensive scent and don’t know if it’s from added “essential oil” (last ingredient) or just the natural scent of the natural ingredients.<br /><br />Guayaquil Hemp Lotion has 250 mg of CBD (THC free), which is still being studied but “may” hydrate dry skin and help inflammation.

I especially like the Peony and Linen scents as they work best with my chemistry, but all three smell nice and none of the fragrance is too heavy. All three came with protective shields under the caps.<br /><br />The unscented is still my favorite, but the scented varieties also work well for me and do seem to neutralize bacteria so my armpits don’t get stinky. While not an antiperspirant, I haven’t noticed my armpits getting wet even when the weather gets hotter. These scented deodorants have tapioca starch and sodium bicarbonate (just like the unscented) that I assume helps my pits stay feeling dry.

This soap isn’t overly drying, though I almost always need lotion after hand washing. The lavender scent from essential oils is light, which is a plus as I’m not a fan of heavy scent. The container holds 12 oz. and the company sells 16 oz. refills (currently $6.95) in a paper based container styled like a milk carton to reduce plastic waste.<br /><br />The glass container has a modern design that looks nice countertop. It has a beige or taupe color silicone (or similar) material on the bottom and lower sides that prevents slipping and adds breakage protection. The plastic pump is also beige and good quality but may not last as long as the glass container. Beige isn’t my favorite color but it’s neutral and the company offers a blue shade that looks pretty in the photo. This soap has coconut oil, olive oil, potassium soap, aloe juice, vitamin E, citrus acid, sodium chloride and a natural essential oil blend (not in that order).

I used Glo Pro regularly for about 2-1/2 months, 2-3 times a week. I’m 57 and felt my skin did look particularly good with regular use. While results weren’t dramatic in that my wrinkles didn’t magically disappear, I feel the overall appearance of my skin seemed brighter, firmer and some lines seemed less noticeable. Around my eyes and cheeks aren’t big problem areas (except dark circles), but my fine lines looked virtually nonexistent in those areas and I feel I looked more refreshed and my skin looked more taut. The frown lines by my mouth are my worst issue and those didn’t improve as much as I hoped, but I did think the lines seemed less noticeable and the area seemed less saggy or firmer to me.<br /><br />I decided to take a break of about a month to see if I stopped if I’d notice a difference.  I don’t think my skin looks as good as it did when using Glo Pro regularly. I feel I look less refreshed, my frown lines look worse and my skin seems kind of dull. I can’t speak to the science of whether micro needing really increases collagen production (or if it can damage the skin), or if my benefit is because it increases absorption of my arsenal of serums and creams. But I do think I looked better from use and my skin doesn’t look as good since I stopped. It’s a tool that I’ve gone back to using, and I do really like using a lot.  I apply quality serums and creams within 60 seconds of using Glo Pro and do think I get bigger benefits from my products. I personally avoid using AHA and retinol products after Glo Pro as they’re too irritating for my sensitive skin.<br /><br />I don’t find Glo Pro painful to use. The needles feel just a little prickly and give me a slight burning sensation. But it’s not uncomfortable or painful and hasn’t caused me any excessive redness, irritation or bleeding. I’ve seen videos of bleeding caused by micro needling done by professionals and read that going that deep isn’t required for micro needling to work. I only use Glo Pro at night and never wake with any redness or irritation. I do use the Glo Pro Pads after I cleanse to sanitize in order to avoid bacteria spread as I got a few blemishes after I ran out but don’t get blemishes using the pads (and alcohol is much too harsh for my dry skin).  I always keep the included spritz bottle filled with alcohol and spray the head after every use. While subjective, I do feel my skin looks better from using Glo Pro regularly with good treatment products and rate it 5 stars.",17622,5806
5.0,1539878247619,Eye Replacement Head Fits Glo Pro Perfectly & Makes It Easier To Use Glo Pro In Eye Area,"I’m using the Glo Pro eye attachment head with my Glo Pro that I bought from a department store that included only the face attachment head. The eye head is slimmer and less than half the width with just four rows of needles. The eye head is an authentic and high quality attachment that snaps on easily and fits Glo Pro perfectly. I definitely prefer using this slimmer eye head for the delicate area around my eyes and between my brows and even my forehead (which is small). The smaller head gives me better control and greater ease of using Glo Pro in small areas.<br /><br />I wasn’t sure of the boundaries around my eye area, so I emailed Glo Pro and was informed the eye head can be used right up to the bottom lashes (but not on the eye lids).  Still, this device is new to me so for now I don’t go much beyond the orbital bone- where I apply my night time eye cream.  The Glo Pro needles are short and feel just a little prickly and give me a slight burning sensation. But it’s not uncomfortable or painful and hasn’t caused any excessive redness or irritation. I definitely recommend the smaller eye attachment head for Glo Pro users and rate it 5 stars.<br /><br />I wasn’t provided a Glo Pro device and this review is only of the eye attachment head.  Still, I’m sure people wonder if Glo Pro works. I’ve used a Glo Pro about a month, twice a week, and don’t feel I’ve used it long enough to know.  I’m in my 50’s and my skin does happen to look good lately.  I don’t see dramatic changes, but my skin seems firmer and my fine lines around my eyes and elsewhere seem less noticeable.

This seems to have neither.<br /><br />I have dark spots on my face and have yet to find a product that I'll stick with for very long, or a product that will actually work.

You do have to use soap and water to remove the powder well.  The spoolie and brush tool come in handy for adding a bit of powder where you want it, fine tuning, and the spoolie is a good size for combing and bushing to a nice finish.  I would love a taupe or blonde option for color because the brown is just not quite right. But, the shape and look of the brow is so good, I can tolerate the color.

Way less obvious rough spot, my feet feel normal. It's just simple lotion with a great scent. It's fresh, uplifting, light. Not strong or lingering, but it's nice to put on a lotion that has an enjoyable scent. It isn't perfume, and I don't think it will compete with fragrance.<br /><br />5 stars.

4.0,1618218516591,Pretty nice quality hair for the price.,"I've been using extensions since 2006, due to health issues causing extreme hair thinning.  I used to get the fused extensions at the salon, 1500 dollars back in the day. They broke off from the weight of the extensions because my hair was so fine and thin. The fused glob of hair was just too much and so many fell out. I started buying the clip in hair, taking the clips off and using them as weft hair. I use salon pro white glue, much like eyelash glue but used for weft hair.  It is a wonderful solution and I still alternate between tape in hair and the clip in wefts. I also buy closures and custom color, to make my own toppers. What a job! But, I'm happy with the results. I have more control over the color and style, and I feel 'normal'.<br /><br />This hair is a medium to coarse texture, thick, and has a really nice body wave. The  is soft and smooth and doesn't feel damaged.  It will blend with fine hair. You can use a straightening iron, just be sure that you can control the temperature. Once you burn this hair, it will stink and it will be ruined. However, if you control the temperature and use care, the hair looks great straight and shiny. You can also curl the hair. I have used felted hot rollers, and those work really well. They are safer, and not as damaging, and the curls last so long.<br /><br />These 16"" extensions are very nice. Although the ad isn't quite accurate. The color is a darker caramel blond, and a reddish brown. This is not piano keys, but close. The wefts are not in the ombre style, they are bold and varied high lights. If you look at the ad images, the photos showing the people aren't shown with this product in their hair. The wefts laying on a surface showing the color differences between the offered colors is the most accurate.  I've offered some images that show the color more accurately.  You can custom color most of the wefted hair, but adding color is easier. Typically the hair has so much red in it that it is impossible to cover or remove, and the dye can be hard to remove. You can add a longer root to eliminate the chunky roots.  My hair is so fine, the sewn edge can be obvious, so have a good match to my natural blonde ash tone roots helps. Any coloring will add to the damage and potentially shorten the life of the hair, but for me it makes me happier to have an exact match to what I want, and I am hard to match for color.<br /><br />The weight of the hair is shown in a photo in ounces. In grams, we get a little over 104 grams, far less than the advertised 120grams, and I would complain about this and have, just not for this brand.  That being said, the fullness and the weight is still good, and the wefts seem to feel average when compared to what I usually order. If you order the longer options, the hair will be thinner, as most hair is sold by weight. 120 would be better, of course. This weight is significantly lower than 120grams.<br /><br />Shedding.  Over the last 7 years or so, shedding has become a real problem. It never used to be this bad. There is a weft glue that is meant to slow or prevent shedding and I always use it. It makes the weft more stiff, but if you use the weft the way I use them, you need to do something to protect your weft hair.  You can find it online. If you are using this hair for special occasions and clipping  to thick strong hair and are simply making your hair more full, wild and glamorous, then you may not need to worry about shedding. I did finger comb this hair once out of the packaging, and there was significant shedding. Again, I say, this is a common issue now, and unique to this particular brand. I have no idea what changed but the wefts should not shed this much, but they all do this with most brands.  I have to say that if the wefts didn't shed so much, they would last for a couple of years or longer.  Also, keep in mind I use the wefts differently, so clipping, as intended, may offer longer life and far less shedding.<br /><br />The length is 16"" and the hair hangs nicely, with a gentle, natural taper.  There is a very nice body wave. It's not a blunt edge finish, which is nice.<br /><br />The clips are the same type that I see on most clip in kits. They are small, and hold nicely even on fine hair.<br /><br />Over all, I think this is a great value and will require the extra effort to keep them looking great over a year or more.  To keep human hair looking good and tangle free, I use the sleep and shine shampoo and conditioner. It keeps the hair fresher and mat free longer.  There are a lot  of youtube videos that can help you with application and care, and give you tips and tricks.<br /><br />4 stars.",17997,7855
5.0,1597266840461,Must have for extensions and precision color.,"This is a great comb. The material is strong but flexible. It has a nice feel and texture. It's not too fine or wide in the tooth spacing. The metal tail is slightly smoothed and rounded for safety when coming in contact with your delicate scalp. Some combs can be too pointy and can be painful.  I use various products to boost the illusion of thick, healthy hair. I use color, highlights, tape in wefts and glue in hair, as well as toppers and sometimes wigs. All of these helpful products are impossible without a great 'Pin Tail' comb to help you with perfect sectioning and parts.  5 stars. I will update with longevity as needed, but right now I am quite happy with this comb.",17997,14237
5.0,1596274050964,This is a great product line.,"This product is exactly as advertised and shown in the images. This mini system does not come with color, so be prepared.  The packaging is attractive, and the products came very well packaged and arrived safely in perfect condition.  This gel nail polish kit has  a little different texture than some of the kits available these days. This system has a complete nail prep and foundation product line-up much like the really great gel nails from 20 years ago. I'm hoping the long term quality of the nail growth and health with this product line,  is as good as the old products as well. As well all know, products can help your nails or destroy them, and this product line, the formulas remind me of the better products that were once available and were very expensive to buy.<br /><br />The thing people may not be used to is the last step of using the finishing wipe to remove the sticky layer once the manicure is complete. Some top coats are completely set and free of any tackiness right after the curing process. These products cure quickly with some heat, and 60 seconds seemed to be plenty of time. After the top coat and final removal of the tackiness, the nails are perfect. This kit doesn't come with color, so I experimented with a milky white and some blue ink, using the wood tools included in the kit to move and swirl the pigment around. It's a fun, creative way to change  up polish. I think stencils could be fun, and I do have mica powders, some bling pieces, to play with as well. I like these products, and the box came with a nice catalogue of other products available.<br /><br />This product is easy to use, I've experienced no irritation of my cuticles or nail bed, no itching or discomfort at all. The light is really cute, tiny and it works. Just one easy button and it turns off automatically in a minute. I pressed twice to get 2 minutes but found that 1 minute was enough, which is great. The result of this product is thin, but strong, offering flexibility of the nail as well, and no cracking. I'll update with wear and removal.  Very reasonable and competitive value.  5 stars.",17997,6009

I offer a photo of one pump of product in my palm. It spreads over the skin nicely and absorbs well. One pump is nearly enough for the entire face, I also have used the lotion on my elbows, backs of my hands, neck and decolletage.  So far the lotion is reacting well with my skin and I like it. The container is attractive and it does fit the hand well and feels comfortable to hold.  The product is gentle and feels good on the skin.

I have just made my first attempt at using gel polish and I am loving the results and longevity gels provide. I did a few simple polka dots on my nails to test out these nail tools. It worked out just fine.  I like that the glitter is inside the base so that the outside is smooth to the touch. The different colors also makes it easy to differentiate between the various sizes at a glance. Next time I'll use the brush end to add some stripes. The metal end was easy to clean with just the wipe of a cotton ball. I'll clean the brush side with soap a water when using gels and acetone when using regular polish.",18048,4596

The turbine has been great for my daughter. Much easier to get on her thick hair after it has been freshly washed. The twist towels always hurt her ears and since I wash her hair in the shower, getting her towel wrapped head in a tee shirt could at times be difficult.  The turbine is easy on her ears and comfy all over. It isn't bulky making it easier to get dressed with it on after a shower.<br />I use the wrap towel and it works great. Really soaks up the excess water. The button and elastic loop are sturdy, they don't feel like they will fall off or snap from regular use. The scrunchies are a bonus. They too are soft and velvety. Not needed for my hair styles or my daughter's really she still loves them even just to wear on her wrist.<br />I have multiple wrapping hair towels but these are my new favorites.",18048,141
4.0,1601055318801,I like the scissors,I really only wanted this for the cape and the scissors and the scissors are decent.  I've been using them to shape the recent hair cut I gave myself.  They are sharp and have a good weight to them.  I have not used the thinning shears yet so I cannot speak to them.  The other items in the kit are all pretty basic and cheap.  I gave the thin plastic combs to my daughter to use with her dolls.  The cape is thin and the strings in the back for tying seem flimsy.  One of the strings is way to too making tying difficult.  I have not had a need for any of the other items.  I do like the storage case though...a nice compact way to keep everything together and easy to find when it is needed.,18048,2311
5.0,1608395362487,Beautiful butterflies,Very pretty butterfly tattoos. There are 24 sheets with between 8 and 20 tattoos on each sheet. No two sheets are the same.

2.0,1594393683288,Strange cut,"The front of this cape is super long (almost too long) however the back is cut in a way such that no matter how you adjust the neck, only about the top 12"" of the back are covered, leaving the lower back exposed. It is like a long rectangle with the corners of the short end joined behind the neck at a diagonal. It is better than nothing but the cut is just off. Maybe if you have an actual barbers chair it works better. I was using a towel as a cape when I cut my husband and kids hair, and this on top of a towel for the lower back (or two of these capes alternating directions so the long part can go in the front and the back) should do a better job than just the towel. The fabric is cheap thin polyester, which gets the job done but is definitely not ""ultra soft silk fiber"" as stated in the description. The neck is easy to adjust and fasten, so at least it has that going for it.",18051,783

They have stayed in through a full school day and gymnastics class without falling out. They do have some rainbow colors, just not as many as we'd hoped for. We got 105 clips. So it the colors are important to you, know that they are on the more pastel side of what's pictured and that there is no true orange. They don't come in a giftable package. If staying in hair is what is important to you, these can't be beat.",18051,847
4.0,1581082952530,Helps dirty hands,"We do a lot of house work, art, construction work, and gardening. We use a lot of soap. That orange goop with pumice in it is our normal heavy duty hand cleaner, this soap is equivalent to that soap without the orange scent. You definitely do need water for it to be effective even though the bottle claims you don't. The hand cream is a great heavy duty healing lotion, similar to eucerin. I haven't noticed an appreciable difference in the ease of cleanymy hands after using the barrier cream however.",18051,1034
3.0,1581081882783,Not fond of the smells,"It doesn't work as well as old spice to prevent odor and sweat, but it does leave less residue on shirts.

I don't think my skin is stressed, but thought it still might be worthwhile. For now, I'm not going out in the world to submit my body to any skin-stressing stuff in the air.  So far, I used the very nice cream at bedtime, and in the morning before applying my makeup.  I really like it under my makeup.  The pure white lightweight moisturizing cream spreads easily and soaks in fast, leaving my face and neck feeling ready for anything (perhaps it's coating is boosting my skin's natural immunity = protection).  There is no stickiness, no sheen, no oiliness, and no noticeable coating, just a comfortable feeling like there's nothing there except a clean face ready for the day.  The 1 oz. container is a frosted glass with a subtle light grayish silver plastic lid.  There is a slight scent that is not objectionable, and doesn't last.  (On the bottom is the expiration date of 6/2021 - not a lot of time - this is 1/2021)  The ingredients appear to be similar to a lot of other products used in cosmetics.  Listing a few: Safflower oil - good for acne, eczema, and healthy skin; Silicone - helps product glide smoothly and easily; Squalane - an emollient and moisturizer, good for hydrating the skin; Chamomile (wild) - for the scent, not much.",18091,976

These two oils from Shiny Leaf are pure and natural, refined and lightweight, and perfect for my use.  They are in liquid form and clear.

Ingredients that are made into Essential Oils that are blended with other stuff to create this soap.  The scent is really strange, it's spicy, herby, woodsy, and lingering...hard to pinpoint or explain.  There are 6 little soaps in a package, and are a modernized teardrop shape, a shield design, making it easy to hold while using.  The soap actually produces a good amount of a creamy, sudsy lather, and leaves the skin very clean and soft with a nice amount of moisture.  They say it's good for immunity support with the special natural oils, but all I know is it's a great cleaning soap that has a very distinctive and potent scent.",18091,729

Bergamot is also used in my preferred special tea of Earl Grey, so it's very familiar.  I used this nice soap in my morning shower and was pleased that it produced a lot of rich lather and suds, and it left me feeling super clean.  Listed in it's ingredients is a mixture of Palm oils that are from certified growers of this product, and it contains Shea Butter that helps keep the skin moisturized, and Argan oil that's good for a comfortable and soft feel on the skin.

If I happen to touch my face it leaves a slick film on the fingers, and I worry about touching anything else and leaving a smudge of the tint.  The moisturizer has an unusual scent when applied, smelling like natural clay.  Maybe that's the Zinc Oxide?  After a while it's not quite as noticeable.  I usually use a same brand moisturizer with SPF 15 and the liquid foundation also SPF 15, and they appear to be much better absorbed into my face.  If this product works for others, that's good.

I cleaned my nails as usual and made sure there wasn't any oil or dirt on the nail area.  I swiped a single thin coat of base coat on, and it immediately pulled into beads and channels, away from the edges of the nail.  It looks very funny with the polish over it - lumpy.  I'm not sure if I got a bad batch, or what.  I went ahead with the process, did the dryer, and the mid- and top-coats, and yeah, just uneven looking nails.<br /><br />The top coats are fun.

It is a softer product than some balms, especially those petroleum-based ones.  It doesn't drag across your lips but glides on nicely.

Good luck getting a pea-sized amount to your lips because it is so crumbly that you will lose a good part of it on the way.  Or at least I did.  It does scrub reasonably well, but did not entirely eliminate the roughness on my winter-chapped lips.  It did help smooth them though.  It smells good, but I'm certainly not going to try to eat the residue, as the instructions say you can.

And that is both a plus and a negative.  While I like this for daytime because it doesn't feel greasy, it does not feel hydrating enough for night time, at least not for my old skin.  I like that this product is made in the USA, and that it is cruelty free, although ""cruelty free"" claims need to be taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />The pump bottle works well, and keeps air out of the product, but there is no over-cap or anything, so this is best left on the counter.  Putting it in a travel bag could cause a mess.<br /><br />Although I like this for a day cream, I can't find that it contains any sun protection, so if you are going to spend any time in the sun, you'll need a separate product.<br /><br />This seems a good product, but in my opinion, it is not outstanding, doesn't really differentiate itself from dozens of other products in all price ranges.",20174,2993

So I don't have a clue what these are made of.<br /><br />They are not quite as soft as the ones that come with their own serum that I've tried.  But they are fairly sturdy.

The other gemstones are other various shades of purple. There’s a deep purple that is almost red and a purple that’s in the middle of the light and dark. The tiara is substantial. It’s not sharp despite looking like it has many sharp pieces to it. I will say a few of the rhinestones that set up on top of the metal decoration were bent. I was able to bend them back ever so slightly. Of course I worry too much bending may break the tiara.<br /><br />It fits well on the head and it is quite comfortable. It’s a attractive tiara and definitely one that’s more for an adult or teen head. I wouldn’t consider something like this for a child. It’s definitely larger for a larger head.,22590,1830

I would say quality falls into the average lane.  Some of them have more glue visible than others but overall they’ve been done well enough. The key for the area that goes behind the ears is to position it so it’s not directly on the skin but more on hair.

The nail polishes are very Arendelle<br />colors. Blue, purple, green, yellow, and orange are the main color themes in the set. They are natural and remind us of the elements; trees, water, ice, etc. There is a nail dryer that is in the shade of purple with an Elsa and Ana sticker on the front. It’s a petite size and perfect for little princess hands. I like that the battery case is enclosed with two tiny screws. They are safe and the children are unable to get to them. After the nails have been dried there are various gemstones and stickers that can be used. They are a small size and work for toddler and up. The gemstones are a little bit bigger and a little large on my toddler‘s fingers.  However the size is ideal for a child’s finger nails.<br /><br />My daughter has had so much fun with this kit. There are a ton of options for color. Naturally with so much to choose from, she never wants any one fingernail painted the same.<br /><br />The bottles have all been easy to open and use.

That one was better for scrubbing feet or less sensitive areas.<br /><br />This one is completely different and luxurious. The handle is a thick bamboo that is sealed. It’s a neutral colored wood but very attractive. There is some wrapped smooth rope on the base of the brush for holding. It makes the brush less slick when it’s wet and soapy. There is also a hole with a piece of that same rope for hanging. I use the rope to hang the body brush off of my shower caddy.<br /><br />The bristles are extremely soft! They are pure white and have been cut so that they have a texture for the skin.  The bristles are tightly positioned and there are a ton of tiny ones. They are as soft it not softer than some of my smoothest make up brushes. It’s soft enough that it could be used on my skin without irritating it.<br /><br />Now the flip side is that because it is so soft there isn’t any exfoliating action. I wouldn’t mind some slightly more rigid like a loofah for really deep cleaning. It’s even softer than a wash cloth but closer to a makeup cloth. This brush is really going to depend on the user and the need. It’s not for exfoliating.,22590,235

5.0,1654482104519,LOVE these wonderful scents!!! But…,"There are three main things that are special about this hand sanitizer:<br /><br />(1) they ALL smell WONDERFUL.<br />(2) they pack a LOT of sprays into these tiny bottles so they are especially great for travel. They supposedly hold 500 sprays.<br />(3) if you love Disney, these are cute as can be!<br /><br />But there are two things I don’t like so much:<br />(1) the cost. If you really get 500 sprays out of each bottle, maybe that’s not a bad value on a per use basis— but about $50 for 4 of these is more money than a lot of people have to spend on hand sanitizer.<br />(2) I can’t see any way to refill them. Most purse size hand sanitizers can be refilled—even though you wouldn’t get the same great smelling original product.<br /><br />Overall, these are certainly wonderful products and I LOVE them!

One set of 6 smaller bottles come in a clear plastic zip-lock cosmetic bag, and a second box of 4 larger bottles.  The set of 6 smaller bottles also comes with a glittery toe separator and kitty-shaped emory board.  The set of 4 larger bottles also comes with 50 nail stickers.<br /><br />These are the colors that you get:<br />Gold glitter (a small and a large bottle)<br />Baby blue (small and large bottle)<br />Baby pink (small and large bottle)<br />Violet (small and large bottle)<br /><br />Additional small bottles:<br />A slightly brighter baby pink<br />A deeper pink<br /><br />I took a photo to show you that the polish is the correct consistency and I applied it to my nails easily.  It dries quickly.  Since this is water-based nail polish meant for little girls, it wears off quickly.  And you can peel it off very easily. That way, you don’t need harsh nail polish remover to take it off.<br /><br />This is not really suitable as a single 10 piece gift set since the bottles come in two totally separate packages of 4+6, and since ALL of the 4 larger bottles duplicate with the same color that is included in the set of 6 smaller bottles.

It soaked into my skin quick. It created a nice based for the moisturizer.<br /><br />The moisturizer:<br />The moisturizer was thick and creamy. I have VERY dry skin, and my skin soaked it right up. It felt really nice on my skin. My skin stayed moisturized throughout the day after using in the morning.<br /><br />None of the products irritated my skin. I have dry skin with some rosacea.

4.0,1593099255291,Nice bronzer and packaging,"The best part of this bronzer duo is the packaging. The container holding the bronzer and highlighter is very heavy.

The top part slides to the right to show the bronzer/highlight duo.<br /><br />The bronzer does a good job. It goes on my skin very smoothly. It is a naturally bronze color.

5.0,1630565008961,"Great for a quick, easy eye when you're in a hurry that's gonna LAST!!","I loved the color I chose.  It's a light neutral with the tiniest bit of shimmer that I can run all over the lid of my eye, tap it/blend it out with my finger, and call it good.  And it looks like you've done one of those sleek, monochromatic eyes that just work.  It's very blendable and does play well with pretty much every other shadow I've paired it with.  It also has no issues with the eyeliners I've run over the top of it just to finish off the eye look.  I've worn it for 12+ hours and it looked pretty good at the end of a long day.  I'm a fan!!",27846,724
5.0,1621323021370,"Love it when I microneedle and plasma, and now I use it daily!!","I've got 50 year old skin and I've treated it pretty horribly for the first 48 years, so I've got plenty of issues I'm dealing with.  Initially I wanted to use this when I microneedle (machine, not roller) and as part of my aftercare for plasma fibroblasting.  And I loved the results.  So much so that I started using it with my other serums in my nightly skincare routine.  I've noticed increased hydration (or more accurately an increase in the retention of hydration) in my skin.  There's also been an increase in the firmness of the skin, which I can't say is down to this product alone.  I'm sure it's because I'm using it in conjunction with the microneedling and plasma treatments, but it's definitely adding to the overall outcome that I'm loving.  The research available on EGF is plentiful and something that makes sense to me as far as an anti-aging ingredient.  So much of the info surrounding ingredients is mostly hype and very little science or actual research.  EGF is one that is backed by research and EasyDew provides a GREAT formulation!!",27846,970

I had one person who decided to quit smoking and one who tried to stop biting her nails.  They both used their Jaw Exerciser to help with their oral habit.  I'm not sure how effective it is with getting rid of a double chin, but it does seem to tighten up the jawline if you're using it every day.",27846,19174
5.0,1618105113261,"Quick, easy, blendable & at drugstore prices....gotta love it!!","I think we all have days where we're looking for something quick and easy when it comes to makeup.  Anything to get us out the door looking somewhat put together with the least amount of time involved is the goal.  If you're looking for a quick eyeshadow look that takes next to no time these are one answer.  Cream eyeshadow on one end and a brush on the other.  The brush is surprisingly usable, but since I've got older eyes (which means older skin that needs to be babied) I just use one of mine.  They go on pretty smooth and creamy.  Not a ton of pigment on the first pass, but it's very buildable.  The swatches on my arm are 2 passes of each color.  They also blend out really well.  I put a couple passes on my lower lid and blend it up into my crease and I'm good to go.  There is a bit of shimmer in this one, but it's not overwhelming.  Just a bit of sparkle that looks good even on aging eyes.  They make it through the whole day, but I did notice some creasing and breakdown after about 6-8 hours.  Not a lot, just enough to be noticeable.  Overall these were pretty impressive and I think they'd also be great for someone who was just getting into makeup too.",27846,977
2.0,1611806679933,"This was kind of a ""gimmicky"" fail for me.","Generally, I love EasyDew products and they always seem to deliver what they promise.  That said, this product was a serious letdown and a bit gimmicky, in my opinion.  The delivery system of the product was completely unnecessary and did absolutely nothing to help with product placement.  The use of growth factor along with the claims to provide filling of lines and wrinkles instantly was where my disappointment came in.  Mostly because it did NOT do what it claimed.  The product is a clear gel that absorbs into the skin and does provide some hydration.  However, I think that's mostly down to the use of the hyaluronic acid it contains, which becomes a problem for me to use in my daytime skincare because I live in an absurdly DRY climate in the winter months and hyaluronic acid without access to moisture in the air or in the form of other products means it's going to suck the moisture from the surrounding tissues.....which means you end up with a VERY dry, wrinkly looking area anywhere you put this.  As for the EGF it contains, there are some studies that show it does help with repeated use OVER TIME, but it does not magically erase lines and wrinkles, and certainly not in the formulation offered here.  I feel like it's a case of a very good company, with very good skincare products that sadly made a mistake in caving into the ""quick fix"" trend so many other companies have.  This was a definite miss for me.",27846,735
5.0,1611566405597,Loaded with hydration & plant extracts that my skin NEEDS during the winter months!!,"These masks have become a favorite this fall and winter when my skin needs an extra dose of hydration.  I've just turned 50 and it's a constant battle to keep my skin hydrated just due to the aging process.  When you add in cold, dry air outside and hot, dry air inside it just makes it so much more difficult.  I've been adding masks to my skincare routine this winter and they've made a huge difference.  I try to do at LEAST one a week, but as it gets colder I've been using them every few days.  I'll use them at night after I've cleansed and used my prescription skincare and then I'll follow up with my nightly routine.  I love all of the plant extracts loaded into this one along with the niacinamide and hyaluronic acid.  One thing to keep in mind though is that if you're using this (or anything with hyaluronic acid, really) and you're in a dry climate you need to make sure you provide additional moisture for the HA to bind to.  It's why I use this one at night since I keep a humidifier running on my bedside table that pumps that moisture into the air.  In addition to the hydration it also does a great job of noticeably minimizing the appearance of some of larger pores on my face which of course makes my skin look firmer and smoother.",27846,2323
5.0,1611462546248,Gorgeous metallic shimmer that wears really WELL!!,"This is a 4 pack liquid metallic eyeshadow.  Icy silver, gold, a plummy/mauve, and a very deep midnight blue.  This shine factor on these packs quite a punch.....I don't think it comes across in the pictures very well, but they definitely are a metallic shadow.  They all are very opaque, but they can be sheered down a bit if you work with them right after you put them on the eye.  They do dry down fairly quickly so it's not something you can take your time to blend out.  I had the best luck applying them with my finger and blending them that way.  I didn't experience any creasing when I wore them and they don't transfer to other areas once they're dried down.  I've worn them for up to 8 hours and they didn't fade or start to slough off the eye.  They're pretty impressive for a liquid shadow.....for a liquid metallic shadow they're DAMNED IMPRESSIVE.",27846,9808
5.0,1610190530982,I've found the BEST BB CREAMS from Korean beauty brands & this is no exception!!,"So, I'm recently 50 (I'm wondering how long I'll keep adding recently to my age??) and during 2020 I fell in love with Korean skin care and Korean BB Creams.  This one gets high marks, and it's a bit different than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I ordered the lightest shade since I'm VERY fair and it worked perfectly.  That's one of the things I love about BB Creams in general, they provide coverage but they also seem to work with your skin tone rather than masking it.  This applied beautifully with a brush and my fingers (my preferred method).  I'm assuming it would work with a damp sponge, as well.  On me that tends to look cakey for some reason, so I don't generally go that route.  It worked well over multiple moisturizers and both of my favorite sunscreens.  I use a primer occasionally and had no problems with application when I did.  It goes on smoothly and blends out easily.  It's a very light formula and feels like I'm not even wearing makeup.  It doesn't have a high amount of coverage.  I would call it a buildable medium, as far as that goes.  Now, here's where it differs from the other Korean BB Creams I've tried.....it dries down to a very satin, skin like finish.  Most others end up with either a dewy or slightly luminous finish, which is fine.  This is the first one I've found that doesn't.  It's definitely not a matte finish, though.<br /><br />It wears really well.  I can get a full 10 hours of wear out of it, whether I set it or not.  That's another thing about the way this drys down, if you tend toward dry skin (I do) then you can get away with not powdering this one if that's your preference.  When I do use powder I go in pretty lightly, and usually just in the areas where my pores might be having a particularly ""showy"" day with a blurring powder.  The bonus that seems to come with most Korean beauty facial products is the SPF.  This is a PA+++/SPF 50+.  Now that doesn't mean I skip my normal sunscreen, cause you're never gonna convince me that what you get in foundation or BB Cream is adequate protection.....but I will never say no to MORE protection.  EVER.<br /><br />This is a beautiful BB Cream that works really well on aging skin, so I imagine it would be a dream on younger skin,  perfect or textured alike.  One other thing I noticed is that at the end of the day I still hardly noticed I was wearing makeup.  And when I washed it off my skin felt and looked pretty good.  It wasn't dried out and didn't have that worn out look that I've gotten used to seeing after a full day in makeup.  Definitely a keeper!!",27846,19175
5.0,1605513049395,"Excellent daily moisturizer, plays well with ALL my other products!!","Easydew has a winner in this one.  To start, it has a creamy texture and a light, fresh scent.  It’s super hydrating and has a great slip to it so it just glides over the skin.  It sinks into the skin beautifully, and fairly quickly, and leaves a dewy finish to your skin.  No weird residue or film left on the skin, and it works well with all of my sunscreens and foundations.  It provides you a nice, plump hydrated base to work with and that dewy finish holds up really well.  It works really well as a daily moisturizer for me during the colder/dryer months of fall and winter.  It will probably be a little too heavy to work during the day in the warmer months, but I can see myself using it as a nighttime moisturizer then with no problem.  Super versatile and definitely one I would recommend for daily use.",27846,740
5.0,1603341485504,"Solid, heavy glass with an excellent mist & great for mask relief!!","I ordered these to hold the essential oils mix I use for sachets.  The mist from the sprayer is perfect to refresh the bags and to evenly distribute the scented oils over materials used in the mix.<br /><br />Since the COVID thing hit, and everyone in our house is dealing with prolonged mask use irritation and “maskne”, I’ve filled up a few more with a 100% green tea toner that can be sprayed on the face during the day.  It helps cut down on the inflammation from irritation and since it’s also an anti-bacterial it has helped control the acne, as well.  These are great to throw in your purse or keep in the car.  The glass is heavy & durable and the spray attachment screws down tight so they DON’T LEAK and the mist created is a nice, fine mist with zero “spitting” or errant streams.",27846,9370
5.0,1596498471304,This is LITERALLY a sun-kissed look in a bronzer.

Or whatever.  So the point is that I was writing this review and I had used the words ""sun-kissed"" twice (I took one out).  Then I looked at the product description and I was like....well, crap.  That's what they literally said it would look like.  So here's the details:<br /><br />It is a highly pigmented powder that blends out beautifully and is easily buildable.  Not an in-your-face blinding shimmer, more of a sun-kissed shimmer that looks natural on the skin.  The color 02 bronzed euphoria looks like you’ve gotten a light tan with a little bit of pink undertone.  (I’m fair skin, strawberry blonde, blue eyes for reference.)  Kind of like what would happen if you actually WENT into the sun.  Without SPF.  Which, of course, you shouldn’t do.  Like, ever.

My hair is very dark brown underneath it and it covers the hair beautifully and in this video, I didn't even fo as good of a job as I could have to put it on and it still looks amazing. The seam in the middle part is very subtle and if you part some of the hair to the side you can even hide the seam and it looks even more natural. I like that the top is dark and that it's ombre because it looks more natural than if it was all grey. It's beautiful grey color and the hair is very soft, long, and full, And the curls are gorgeous.

4.0,1623148421152,It's good,"This Melao lavender exfoliant foot peel works very well. The box contains one set of booties for one time use. It’s real simple to use these. You have to start off by cleaning your feet well. It doesn’t hurt to give them a bit of a soak for a time as well beforehand. Just to get them good ready. Next, you place the booties on your feet. It’s recommended that you put socks over the booties to hold them firmly in place since you have to wear them for an hour. I did just that and think that’s a mighty fine recommendation to follow. When that hour is up, you take all that off your feet and give your feet a good washing with soap and water. Now comes the waiting game. At first, I thought they did absolutely nothing.For days, I thought they did nothing. Then, around the 4th/5th day my feet just started to peel. They were shedding skin. It was so weird! They continued to do that for a few days and when it was all over my feet did look and feel really nce for quite some time. Just remember to keep moisturizing to keep them looking and feeling nice for a long time after.<br /><br />The thing about this product is that you can’t expect instant results. It takes a few days and you have to still use the same moisturizers and stuff you were using on your feet, or at least I did. I have really dry feet in spots and I despise it so to have something actually work for a little while was great.

My skin isn't dried out and feels generally better than where I was using normal soap.

It smells very floral and light. It feels good, I use this in my skincare routine before a moisturizer, after I get out of the shower.

Before getting it I was thinking it was going to be like regular soap but when you see it it’s anything but regular soap.  My roommate and I were both a bit confused thinking perhaps these were bath bombs because the look is similar to bath bombs more than it is to bar soap. I had to revisit the listing to double-check that it is meant to be used as soap.<br /><br />Usage is interesting.  It does break down very quickly though it stays intact long enough to use as bar soap.  You just don’t get many washes out of each bar.  With water, it does suds up a good amount which I like.  It also gets a bit milky looking and the gritty texture does exfoliate too.<br /><br />After using it I like the feeling of it on my skin.  My skin feels a little tingly, refreshed, and soft.  So it does work well for me as a soap but it just doesn’t last long.<br /><br />The scent is not my favorite at all.  Some might enjoy the scent but it’s very strongly clove-scented.  It’s a bit too overbearing for my tastes. The scent also seems to last on my skin for a little longer than normal bar soap would.  If I was more fond of the scent this would be a good thing.<br /><br />Overall it’s a decent product but it’s not really for me.  I just don’t love the scent and it’s a bit too different from normal bar soap for me.  I love the exfoliating ability of this soap.  That is the one area I really liked and I would buy this if I found a scent I enjoyed.  The price is reasonable given that you get 6 bars.

It does have the little metal clip so you can lock it and not have to keep holding the handle down.  What I really like though is the water pressure aspect.

One of my friends and I were talking about lash extensions and lattisse. I was telling her how my eye lids turn red when i try to use lattisse. I even tried the RF brand and same thing! Anyhows, then i've been doing exentions for about a year now but I am finding that my lash is getting worst and worst.. like when my extensions fall out, I barely have lashes! I used to have average lash that  I could curl. But now it seems like I barely have anything. So this is why I decided to finally consider perming my lash. So perming the did not make it longer by any means! What it did though is made it look like I had lashes that were longer but it curved up! My lash tends to grow straight. It may have have to do with the fact that I have asian eyes. So the curling has always been important when I used to wear mascara. The thing is I hate that sometimes it poked at me and the curler would yank some lashes out!  Also I just hate it doing it every day. With perm lashes, you don't have to do this. However, I don't know if I could have done this alone. I had to get a friend to help me. She said it was pretty easy. What took the longest is us reading things over and over to make sure we weren't going to make me blind! I think it took about an hour or so? I can't recall exactly as we didn't time it.  The reason I am giving it 4 stars is that you really cannot do this by yourself.  Now it may not look drastic to most people bc they don't usually notice your lashes.

It is lightly scented with a clean fragrance that smells pleasant when applying this to my face.

This product is water based and does not dry on my skin like most clay masks do. After I apply this to my face and leave it on for about 15 minutes, it still feels moist and slick when I go to rinse it off. The texture of this mask is more gel-like than it is clay. It feels lightweight and does not leave my skin feeling too dry and tight. This mask is effective enough for use during the winter, when my skin tends to be more dry.

However, I always wash my hands and feet after using nail polish remover, so I don’t think the added panthenol and vitamin E stay on long enough to provide any significant benefits. This product works well enough to deserve 5 stars, but I detracted a star because of the retail cost. There are more affordable nail polish removers that work just as well as this does.

It takes a bit for it to heat up and would take forever to actually dry wet hair. It works well on lightly damp hair.  It has a button that spins the barrel different direction and it’s quite easy to use, but the motor to turn the barrel isn’t very strong and it take a bit to get going.  My biggest complaint is the sound.  It is very loud with a high pitched wail this is especially problematic because you use it right next to your ear.",34303,3587

And with eye creams, you need to use for atleast 2-3 weeks to see some results. I’ve been using it for a few days and it seems fine. You only need a little bit. The under eye area does feel a little more hydrated and not swollen compared to if not wearing the eye cream. However, in order to help with the dark under eyes, one needs to use this product for atleast a month or more to see some noticeable results.",34624,22328
3.0,1654637405122,Plush but pricey!,"These scrunchies feel very plush and soft. They came individually wrapped also, in case you want to add them when making gift baskets or something. The colors are also beautiful. I sometimes like to wear them on my wrist ( as a fancier version of an elastic). The other good part is that they’re kinder to hair compared to normal elastics/ hair ties because don’t pull hair out whilst removing.<br />The only downside to these is that they appear quite pricey for $25.99 for a pack of 6.

I wanted to take a pic at the end of the night to upload, however most of the curls had come out by then. On the other hand, it’s quite a handy tool as it’s traveling friendly/ portable and doesn’t need to be plugged in to use. It will take me time to practice and get used to it.

I mostly need help on my cheeks this time of year, so that's where I've been using it.<br /><br />I spread this on my cheeks and it immediately leaves a slight cooling sensation. It takes a while for it to soak in/dry down completely and it feels a bit tacky until then. Once the tackiness is gone, my skin feels very soft to the touch, however, when looking in my makeup mirror, my skin doesn't look hydrated at all. It looks just like it did before using this moisturizer.<br /><br />I think this might be more suited to someone younger and with oilier skin.

Secondly, the listing says this has the ""Delicate scent of rosewater,"" but mine smells old...you know, that kind of smell when a lotion hasn't been used in a long time. I immediately checked the box and saw that my bottle doesn't expire until 5/s022, so I'm not sure if I just got a questionable batch.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't recommend this.

I've included a picture of how I rigged mine to dry. I took one of those suction hook thingies, wedged it between two metal pieces of my shower caddy, and hang my loofah to dry. The important part of this is that in doing it this way, no part of the loofah itself touches anything. I read years ago that wherever something like this touches something else while drying, bacteria can collect there. I'm no scientist, but it makes sense to me, so that's how I've hung stuff like this for years. Works like a charm. I also love that I can throw these in the washing machine.<br /><br />These are very nice loofahs and I recommend them.",34713,10905

With a regular spray bottle, I always end up getting a lot of water on the floor when spraying my hair, then have a problem cleaning up the floor after cutting my hair as my hair is stuck to the wet floor.<br /><br />This bottle has solved my problem. The mist from this bottle is consistently super-fine. No rogue giant droplets. I can spray my hair down and not get water everywhere. The bottle is easy to hold, is a great weight and is balanced well. The trigger is easy to pull.<br /><br />This bottle is perfect to use for homemade wrinkle reducer for clothing as well. I just mix one cup of water and a tablespoon of fabric softener, shake well, then spray on fabric while pulling down on the fabric. The micro-fine mist dispenses a perfect light spray, so the fabric dries quickly.<br /><br />This bottle is very easy to clean so I can use it for several things, but I'd like to get more so I can stop switching the contents out.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.",34713,1069

I came across this SAISZE Jaw Exerciser which, like the YouTube ads, claim to be a Facial Fat Burner, and eliminating Double Chin Reducer for improved jawlines, so I finally bit it and ordered myself one to try.<br /><br />Unboxing was surprisingly taken aback, since I thought the packaging would be a little more elaborate, better packaging in bubble wraps, instructions, illustration, etc, the kind of packaging that I expect for items bought from my local Dollar Stores. Inside, it contains the blue Jaw Exerciser, anda laynard. Inside the Dollar Store-style plastic bag, there's nothing else. I was trying to figure out where does the laynard go, typically lanyards go inside a tiny holes, for example, on a smartphone. Since there's neither any ""tiny"" holes anywhere nor instructions, I went back to the product page, and looked at the product page photos, so the lanyard goes into the HUGE opening in the center of the Jaw Exerciser. This is nice, since this permits you to hang the Jaw Exerciser while it's not in use, instead of putting inside my pants pockets which is full of dirt & lint, probably not the best place. NOW, the only thing to try out is:<br />🤔🤔🤔🤔does this thing actually WORK?🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔<br /><br />Well, you first should put the Jaw Exerciser in hot water for 5-10 minutes to soften it, and then after removing the protecting strips, you'd bite down to put pressure and allow the "" softened"" device to be molded according to your individual jawline, which will make the Jaw exercises more effective.<br /><br />I've been trying it for the last 2-3 months, while it's better than nothing - the Jaw muscles are probably the most neglected and difficult to exercise on a regular basis. So, for that purpose, ANY exercise is a plus, however, if you TOTALLY depend your double chins be gone on this gadget, you'd be drastically disappointed 😞☹️😞☹️☹️ Simply, it's a supplement to Health Diet, Regular Exercises, and Sleep Well, that's the ONLY way to burn fat, and eliminating double chins, this or ANY Jaw Exerciser is just a gimmick gadget.<br /><br />☹️😟🙄👎Not Recommended👎☺️☺️😟",34866,19174

At this point, I don't even care that much about its list of active ingredients, no matter how good they are, I felt that my facial cleansing experiences were compromised by the lack of foaming in working up enough lathers, NONE to be visible.

5.0,1584329434277,💞💓💕💕Natural Skincare Antioxidant Made in the U.S.A💯💕💓💞,"As I hit the dreaded middle ages, fine lines & wrinkles creep up all over my face, especially around the corners of my eyes - a true testament that battling Father Time is a losing proposition & I need help. Hence, I practice my daily skincare regimen religiously! My daily skincare regimen includes using serums, moisturizers, oils, eye creams. Sometimes I indulge in a spritz of Rosewater for refreshment.<br /><br />Now I use my face serums to do two things. First, of course, is for the benefit to my skin; and the various serums produce different effects simply because they consist of different main ingredients. Most all of them help protect against environmental contaminants, help reduce the appearance of lines, and some even help dark spots to lighten. Merlot Sunrise Serum uses natural grape seed antioxidants as its main active ingredient. (If you check the Merlot skincare line website, you'll see that their focus is on the use of grape seed antioxidants in all of their products.)<br /><br /> My second use is my own personal ""spa"" massage. I literally massage the serum into my skin. I focus on my temples, forehead, jaw line, nasal bridge, between eyes, and crows feet areas. I apply a firm, upward rotating massage with my splayed fingers. I thoroughly believe this helps me to relax, relieves tension, and massages the lymph system to aid in drainage. I just feel this is good for me. I even do this more than once a day when I have a headache or a particularly stressful day. This will work with most any serum.<br /><br />It works well with the Merlot Sunrise Serum because it in itself is refreshing, a light hint of ""fresh air"" scent, and literally feels good on my skin.<br /><br />The recommended use is twice daily - morning and evening - on cleansed skin. Then followed by moisturizer. I am totally enjoying this lovely serum.<br /><br />💞💓💕💯👍 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍💯💕💓💞",34866,90
5.0,1584326875842,💕💌💓💞👍Botanical Hyaluronic Acid much better than Synthetic HA👍💕💌💓💞,"As we hit the much dreaded middle ages, most of us will then realize we ain't going to win the battle against Father Time. As such, we can, probably do, use a little help such as Retinol & Hyaluronic Acid based skincare products.<br /><br />  While It is widely known that it's  the collagen that gives the skin its firmness, but it is the Hyaluronic Acid that nourishes & hydrates the collagen.<br /><br />Most Hyaluronic Acid found in night creams or serums are traditionally extracted from rooster combs, and now it is mainly produced via streptococcal fermentation.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this 『Brittanie's Thymes 100% Botanical Hyaluronic Acid Serum』. Botanical Hyaluronic Acid is derived from a plant called cassia angustifolia, protects the skin, strongly binds to water, and fills in wrinkles and fine lines.<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />==========<br />  Unboxing revealed that this bottle comes in an 8 oz (or 236 ml) of Botanical Hyaluronic Acid Serum which, even if used daily, should conveniently last me 3 months as part of my daily skincare regimen. I have been applying this ""Botanical"" version of Hyaluronic Acid Serum for about 2 & 1/2 months, I can see that it really performs better than its ""synthetic"" counterparts. In general, botanically sourced ingredients are better for the skin than their synthetic counterparts. As a result, Brittanie's Thyme Botanical Yyaluronic Acid holds 1000x its own weight in water, making it an essential ingredient for hydrating skincare products.<br /><br />  If you've already using some sorts of Hyaluronic Acid based skincare products (mostly synthetic types), nothing wrong with it, and it's working for you, GREAT! However, if you're looking for a more effective one, I highly recommend that give this botanical version a try.<br /><br />💓💞💕💌👍 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍💕💌💓💞",34866,334
4.0,1583120630162,💓💖💕🛁🛁 Enhance Your Bubble Bath Relaxation Experience🛁🛁💕💖💓,"After a hard day's work or workout session, there's nothing better than nothing than soaking myself in a bubble bath with epsom salt - it really helps me with relaxation & pain relief. I also love to turn off the lights, and light some aromatherapy candles & music. There's only one thing that's missing, a bath pillow so I can lay back & rest my neck as well.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this 『Charyeah Bath Pillow for Bathtub/Spa』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it's a decent sized bath pillow, not too large that it takes up too much room around your bathtub, but large enough to hold your head/neck comfortably.<br /><br /> INSTALLATION<br />🛁🛁🛁🛁🛁🛁<br />Since I've never owned one, it would have been nice to have a picture of how it should sit in the tub; but eventually I figured it out since there's really only two ways to place it. For those of you having issues, remember to put the thin, rectangular strip portion around the rim of the bathtub, and the wide part on the slanted portion of the tub & that's where your neck and head would rest on while soaking in the bathtub.<br /><br /> REMOVAL<br />🛁🛁🛁🛁<br />A few words of cautions, after you're done, make sure you slide the bathtub pillow suction cups off the tub instead of pulling them off, trust me - you pull enough times, the suction cups will no doubt be severed from the pillow main body.<br /><br /> The VERDICT<br />🛁🛁🛁🛁🛁<br />  I think this bathtub pillow works well, allowing me to get the true relaxation bubble bath experience that it's designed for. As long as you follow the aforementioned tips, it really does the job. It would have been nice to have a hook so that upon removal I can hang it inside the bathtub area like bathtub caddy or showerhead allowing it to dripdry.<br /><br />💓💖💕🛁🛁 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED🛁🛁💕💖💓",34866,1136
2.0,1581825998021,Works Better for Much Older & Wrinkled Skins,"We all may want to age gracefully but aging does take a toll on our face in the most bothersome way. Sagging skin and age lines look utterly unappealing and make us self-conscious. While there are myriad of facelift choices, such as Botox, facelift surgery, non-surgical facelifts, etc., a large section of women still look for less painful and less expensive options to achieve the best results. An instant facelift is also in pretty high demand to restore a more youthful look and here comes the importance of a face tape. The affordable solution takes years off your face immediately without the use of harmful chemicals or painful injections.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across the 『Crystal Lemon Face Lift Tape』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it comes in a 40 band-aid lookalike patches of various sizes for different areas of our faces where you'd like to tighten the skins a little. I'm skeptical to begin with, but unless I try, I don't like to pre-judge anything, and let the results speak for themselves.<br /><br />The Premise<br />==========<br />These face lift tapes are basically a ‘band-aid solution to a mature face’. As the name reveals, it is nothing but a simple facial ‘tape’ that pulls back and stretches the skin to create an illusion of a tighter face. The tape is usually breathable, hypoallergenic, and of medical-grade. This non-surgical option gives a mini facelift instantly by smoothing out wrinkles and fine lines in a sagging and aged face. Since the last few decades, the facelift tape has been very popular only among Hollywood celebrities. But now, it has become a fast and easy at-home fix for anyone developing premature signs of aging.<br /><br />The VERDICT<br />🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏<br /><br />When used correctly, this Face Lift Tape could make dramatic changes to your aged look by reducing fine lines and wrinkles instantly. They are effective in smoothing out very fine lines around the eyes and firming up the jaw, which is really difficult to achieve even with makeup. However, this typically works better in older seniors like my mom, they didn't quite work, or make any difference, as I'm not old enough. Remember it's easy to go from F to D, but not so easy going from A to A+, if your skins are not wrinkled bad enough, it's nearly impossible to see a difference 🙄😏🤔😁😄<br /><br />🙏🙏 If you find my review helpful, pls hit the 👍🙏🙏",34866,1139

How could they mess up vanilla? Well, when they use old soybean oil as one of the main ingredients, you end up with a scrub that smells more like rancid soybean oil with a hint of coconut oil more than anything else. I thought I was being persnickety. But when my daughter (who doesn't have the strongest sense of smell) picked it up saying she wanted to use it, she had the same reaction.

These contain a piece of loofa stitched very well onto a cloth pad with a piece of elastic over the back to keep on your hand. I didn't realize until recently that loofas are made from the dried insides of gourds. So, no, they're not a product of the sea like a sponge. It's amazing to me that they're able to be stitched so well into cloth.  I really like these. I just read that it's possible to machine wash loofa but that you shouldn't put them through the dryer. Eventually, my loofa got moldy from hanging out in the shower so often. I threw it away, but next time I'll know that I can put it through the washing machine before it gets to that state.

This product was by far the MOST difficult to use because no matter how I sectioned the hair, it ALWAYS managed to get stuck or tangled in either the silicone or stick, while pulling the hair through the tube.<br /><br />In the end, there also wasn't enough tubes to curl my whole head. I also ripped, tangled hair, and on top of that, when I assembled the blue stick (originally in 2 pieces), I was unable to detach it for traveling (?????). I ended up breaking it in order to detach it. Not to mention that some of the tubes also had bits of silicone (on the edges of the tube, to prevent slipping, I assume) that were already ripped. This was HORRIBLE because it would also contribute to the ripping and tangling of my hair.<br /><br />This was just a whole nightmare to use. I would skip out on this product.",40144,9812

The brush cleaner is something you don't realize you really need until you REALLY do, and it is a godsend.<br /><br />A common complaint many people give about boar bristle brushes is that the brush is too soft to penetrate the bottom layers of your hair -- duh! You will need to section your hair and brush each section!

At the time of writing this review, so far, yes!<br /><br />I really like the formula of the eyeliner, it has been one of the smoothest I have tried so far. As for the strength of the adhesiveness of the eyeliner with the lashes, it is super strong! Even the slightest touch of the lash to the eyeliner will have it STUCK! The eyeliner also is very water and smudge proof!<br /><br />I have only taken one star off because the lash band itself can be a little bit irritating for people with small eyelids/monolids. While wearing these lashes, the inner corner of my eyes were feeling a bit irritated because the band was poking the skin. Eventually this made my eye water, and the inner corners of the eyelash were beginning to peel up. I feel that if I readjusted these lashes, or cut some portion off, it would help with the issue.",40144,5645

I've attached photos of the lashes after wearing them for 10 hours at my workplace. The magnetic lashes and the liner are so strong in fact, that I actually ripped out a lash because I accidentally had the magnetic liner on my lash!<br /><br />I'm very impressed by how well it stuck onto my eye throughout the day. I am also VERY surprised of the formula of the eyeliner. I have tried many, many waterproof, smudgeproof eyeliners, but this eyeliner is by far THE MOST waterproof and smudgeproof! I have oily eyelids and my original waterproof eyeliner would still smear on my lower lids (I bought a waterproof Missha eyeliner for $27 and it still smudges!)<br /><br />Not only that, the liner will also remove very easily with micellar water or makeup removing face wash -- it washes off so clean that I don't have to follow up with another makeup wipe after the shower. This is amazing!<br /><br />I only really took off 1 star for three reasons:<br />1) The formula of the eyeliner has a scent that is very perfume-y/chemical-y. This doesn't bother me too much, but I do think that some customers may be bothered by it.<br />2) The brush of the eyeliner is very flimsy -- it is difficult to get a sharp line, because the brush is so thin.<br />3) the inner corners of my lashes began to curl up and off my lash line, pulling some eyeliner with it (leaving gaps in my liner).<br /><br />Overall, I really like this small kit! It is VERY easy to apply and the lashes look so natural! I got very many compliments while wearing these!",40144,1870

This is my new favorite way to do my nails!<br /><br />I have listed pictures of my results using this kit and as a first time poly gel nail user, the results speak for themself. I followed the directions given with the kit with no issue, and I didn't even need to paint my nails with the gel polishes in the kit -- I was already in love with the transparent rosy color of the poly gel!<br /><br />My favorite part is that curing the nail under the mini UV light (which is SO cute btw!) will pretty much dry and harden the nail IMMEDIATELY. I LOVE that there is no wait time to dry my nails. I can do both of my hands within an hour and then go ahead and do whatever I need to do, without any fear of ruining my new manicure.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about getting this kit, then I would definitely recommend taking the leap and trying it -- this kit has everything you need and will definitely give you many, many manicures with just $25.",40144,2835

I've gotten quite a few of these blenders online and these are hands down the softest and bounciest blenders I've came across. I don't have a latex allergy but it seems like these are great for anyone with an allergy. On the packaging it also says part of the proceeds will go towards protecting animals against abuse. I didn't do any additional research on that so take it with a grain of salt, but if they do, that's a wonderful cause!<br /><br />I did more research and a lot of people seem to love these and switched to these from the pricey $20 a piece brand. This is so much more affordable and reasonably priced, not to mention it works great. I highly recommend giving these a try as many other people have raved about these as well. If you don't like it after trying, you've still only spent half the amount of what the famous brand costs - my point is, you really don't have anything to lose!

3.0,1645640209258,not entirely convinced on how baby safe this is but maybe better for pre teens or adults,"I was curious about a perfume for baby because we've been taught not to use anything on the little ones except the gentlest of lotions and body wash. I decided to give this a try because I was curious about the scent and the execution of a product like this.<br /><br />First thing I did was smell this, and while it is a pleasant smell, this particular scent isn't my favorite. It is too floral for me, almost artificial. I may have liked and felt more comfortable using a citrus and fruity type of scent on my little one. I also looked at the ingredients list and while they may be free of parabens, phthalates, synthetic colors, dyes, GMOs, and Gluten Free, there are some potentially irritating ingredients for the very sensitive of skins. Ingredients like Linalool, Citral, Citranellol, Limonene can be an allergen. It may have prebiotics which is good but one good ingredient does not negate a potentially irritating one. I'm all for someone coming up with a safe and good cologne for baby but I'm not entirely sold on this product just yet. I did read up on some additional information but I need more convincing for me to be on board with this perfume for infants. I do love the story of why the founder wanted to create these scents for little ones but I'm just not fully on board with some of the ingredients used.<br /><br />I'm not sure I will be using this on my baby but I think a more appropriate age is pre-teen or teens. I may have been a little more open to a ""cleaner"" perfume for that age range as I'm sure there's a market for that. From what I read, the founder is going to be launching perfumes for that age group, so that might be more appropriate.<br /><br />My baby actually smells nice from good hygiene so he doesn't need anything else but I understand the concept behind these scents. Fragrances do invoke certain memories, just like music. There are certain scents that I get a whiff of and it immediately transports me back to that day, the person, or the memories of that particular time period. All that said, I will be holding off using perfume on my baby and will be spritzing this stuff on myself. I think the concept is great but I would like to see even ""better"" and cleaner ingredients if I am to use it on my baby.<br /><br />I didn't see the ingredients list posted on this Amazon page yet so here it is:<br />Ingredients:<br />Alcohol Denat., Aqua (Water), Parfum (Fragrance) Niacinamide, Glycerin, Lactitol, Xylitol, Linalool, Citral, Citranellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Gernaniol, Amyl Cinnamal, Limolene, Hydroxycitronellal.",40562,908
5.0,1637268727025,hours of fun,"I was going to save this as a Christmas gift for my nieces but just could not resist and had to give it to them early. They aren't allowed to go to a real nail salon/spa yet so I planned an at home ""spa day"" for them, with their mom's approval of course. The foot spa uses batteries so I was able to do this anywhere and not have to worry about being close to an outlet. However, that could also be a ""negative"" as you have to worry about replacing batteries. We always have plenty of batteries at home anyway for our gadgets so it wasn't an issue. They had to ""wait in line"" for their turn while I painted their toes and gave them a stack of magazines to flip through. It was such a fun experience for them without having to spend a fortune, and in the safety of our home. The foot spa machine itself is pretty cool, and is almost like the one I have for myself. I did use warm water - the machine doesn't heat up or anything, so make sure you use lukewarm water for the little feets! I went a step further and even gave them an exfoliating foot scrub which is something I already have at home for myself. This is honestly the best $40 spent - an experience like this in a ""real"" salon and spa would have easily cost more than $40 for two girls. The great thing about this is that it is a suitable item for a wide range of ages, even after they've entered their teen years. I highly recommend this set.",40562,10917
4.0,1635459121478,you will see results if you commit to it,"I've been using this for 3 months now and I do think this works with longterm use. You obviously aren't going to see overnight results but if you keep at it you will notice a difference on your wrinkles. Luckily I don't have too many yet but I did use it on the little areas where I'm starting to see wrinkles. I noticed a tightening of the areas I used the laser on for the past 3 months. I really liked the hyaluronic acid serum that was included in the set - the serum felt gentle and has no smell (fragrance free). On some days where I didn't use the laser I would still use the serum to moisturize my face. I looked into purchasing just the serum, which they do have for sale, as I really like the product. The laser is easy to operate and charge (usb). I didn't use this daily as I wanted to give my skin a rest, but I think if you used this religiously then you would see results at a much faster rate. It isn't painful, but you feel a little zap. I would equate it to the same level of ""pain"" as a derma roller, that spikey/zappy feeling - not painful, not super uncomfortable. That of course, will depend on your skin sensitivity. I recommend using the lowest setting first then working your way up as your skin sensitivity will allow. Don't force your skin into what it cannot handle - listen to your body's reaction!<br /><br />I've seen so many of these laser type products for the skin/body, and never tried it because I didn't trust it. Nira is the first at home laser product that I decided to give a chance to, as I trust it. Overall I am not disappointed but do know that you need to commit to it if you want to see results. If you are going to use it once every few weeks then it will be a while before you see results, if ever. I plan to keep using this to stimulate my skin.",40562,8

If you are a fan of lavender scent then this is a great soap for you. I did find it to be a little too strong and overwhelming, and would have much preferred if they had sort of watered it down a little (the lavender smell, not the soap). I can also smell the tea tree, so I would say it is a good combination of both. I do like the ingredients and don't see a lot of unnecessary ""stuff"", which is a huge plus! I know some people are saying this is pricey for hand soap but you also have to look at the ingredients they use, and in this case, seems to be of quality. Although I can be price sensitive I also hold other factors to importance. This hand soap is a somewhat runny gel consistency, not too thick nor too thin/watery. This is good quality soap but I probably should have went with another scent, something more citrus-y.",40562,384
5.0,1627947863379,a more natural approach for acne prone skin,"I am familiar with the Sibu brand as years ago I used to purchase the sea buckthorn oil supplements and was taking that religiously. I stopped just because I started to take other supplements (pre-natals, etc) and it was just getting to be too much I had to cut out some of the stuff. I still really like the Sibu brand and their sea buckthorn oil. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they now have skincare products. My favorite product in this set is still the sea buckthorn supplements (60 softgels). I am still nursing so I won't be taking this just yet but I am just about done nursing. The supplement is one thing I am looking forward to taking again. The expiration date is listed on the bottom of the bottle. I do like the smell of the anytime face wash, and it  did a nice job of cleaning my face without drying it out. I do get little hormonal breakouts here and there so this is a good face wash for me. I've also tried the daily facial defense oil, a zit zapper, but it is too soon to tell if it works. It does a great job of moisturizing my face for sure as it is packed with different kinds of oils (argan, sea buckthorn, lavender, patchouli, etc). All these products are made in the USA, which I know is important for some people. This is a good set of skincare basics for acne prone skin. I like the more ""natural"" approach with the use of sea buckthorn oil and less harsh chemicals. This product came in a cardboard box (like a subscription style box) and placed inside a bubble foil zip loc style bag. Good packaging.<br /><br />Some improvements ideas for this product:<br />- supplement does not say how many to take per day. The supplement facts says ""serving size 2 vegan softgels"", so I am assuming that means I should be taking 2 pills a day, making this a 1 month supply. There is no information pamphlet in the box or in this Amazon description page<br />- ingredients list for all 3 products should be listed on this Amazon page, I didn't see it listed yet<br />- brand name is confusing and made it hard for me to do more research on this product. Is the name of this product line ""NOT OR"" or ""Not for him or her"" or ""NxO"" or ""NO""? It is just all very confusing. Either way, all of the names still made it hard to do a search because it sounds like it is a part of a sentence.",40562,3582

I don't mean beautiful packaging but the fact that they sterilized it and individually packaged the brushes in a sterile manner makes this product stand out from other brush sets. I prefer a clean, sanitized brush over a fancy box that I’ll end up throwing away. The price is also VERY reasonable for the quality of brushes I received. No, it is not high end brush quality but I'd rather get this starter set for $13 over one brush that would cost me $50-$80. I guess I'm not a makeup brush snob or a professional makeup artist so I just don't understand paying that much for a makeup brush. I thought these were great quality, the bristles are so soft, the color scheme is beautiful, and I love the plain matte handles. This one does not have any brand or printed words on the brush handles, which I haven't seen in a while. The brush sets I've gotten on here always has a brand stamp and sometimes they are a little corny sounding or tacky looking - this one is perfect. I thought the size of the brush is just right, good density - bottom line is I have no complaints about these! This is a set I would recommend getting.

You can make it even cooler by storing it in the fridge prior to use. I also had some tightness in my neck area and it worked great as a massager too.

5.0,1623906196087,loving ayurvedic skincare,"After trying AAVRANI's exfoliator, I fell in love. I was excited to try their other products so this was a great kit for that without having to purchase the full size of each product. This came in a beautiful cardboard box, fancier than most trial kits.<br /><br />There are four products to try:<br />- restoring serum<br />- activating exfoliator<br />- softening hydra-wrap<br />- eye rejuvenating elixir<br /><br />My favorite is the hydra wrap and exfoliator.<br />The hydra wrap is quite moisturizing and rich without feeling heavy, nor did it feel sticky/tacky after applying. I could slightly feel it on my skin after applying but it wasn't greasy or uncomfortable. The exfoliator has little shea nut powder beads in it to help exfoliate and scrub, and has a thick consistency. It is like your typical face exfoliator except it has great, good for your skin, quality ingredients.<br /><br />The eye elixir is good and felt like a gentler/less rich moisturizer compared to the face cream.<br /><br />I didn't like the serum because of the consistency - it is too liquid-y for me, and is almost like a toner than your typical serum. It felt fine on the face but I just didn't like how runny it was. The dropper style dispenser is great but it was like dispensing toner.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed AAVRANI's product line. I'm actually surprised at the quality of the packaging for a trial set like this. It is just as luxurious as the full sized products. I feel bad that I'll just be discarding the bottle/packaging after use. AAVRANI products products smell nice (some are even fragrance free as I didn't smell any fragrance) and nothing felt sticky/tacky or uncomfortable on my skin. I have been loving a lot of these ayurvedic based skincare brands as they seem to use better, cleaner, and gentler ingredients.

I loved how it felt on my skin, and although it is a ""face oil"", did not leave my skin a greasy mess. My skin soaked it up soon after applying and just made it feel nice and moist. It just feels very light and will not feel like it is ""weighing"" down your skin like some heavy oils can do. It feels very gentle and I did not experience any itchiness or irritation.

I was expecting the typical masculine scent you find in men's skincare but I was pleasantly surprised that it is more gender neutral. After using the scrub my face felt clean. It isn't a super strong, gritty scrub but more on the gentler side. I think this could be a good scrub to use 3 times a week because it isn't super gritty but I would also rotate this with another face scrub that is grittier. This scrub didn't leave my skin with the softest, smoothest feeling afterwards like with some other scrubs but it isn't bad. This is a good one for someone that wants a gentler, less harsh scrub.

It doesn’t have any offensive scents and odors, and I like the way it makes my skin feel. That product is 5 stars for me. However, the other two, Skin Refiner and Moisture Boost, I am not sold on because of the ingredients. When I first used the skin refiner I loved how it felt - goes on smoothly, glides through my skin, and melts into it like butter. I looked at the ingredients only to see that it is, of course, filled with silicone (siloxane and petrolatum). I should have looked at it first before trying. I know studies may have shown that silicones are ok for skin, but for me personally I just don’t want that on my face. As for the petrolatum, that is something I just don’t want anywhere near my skin! While I loved the way it felt I didn’t feel good about the stuff in it. The skin refiner also made my skin itchy and tingly, even though I tried on three separate occasions, so I had to stop using it. The good thing about these products is they are fragrance free.

That is still my mantra, but occasionally when I know I’ll be in the sun I put on a good Asian sunscreen - because they tend to uncheck all the boxes of the things I mentioned above. That said, this is another sunscreen I am adding to my collection. It did not feel uncomfortable on my skin and did not leave any white cast or blotches. It absorbed pretty quickly and my skin didn’t feel tacky. Also, this is SPF 50! All in all, this is another Asian facial sunscreen that I am adding to my “loves” list.",40562,712
5.0,1615188652447,Beautiful headband,"Beautiful headband, very well made. I haven’t worn a headband in years but they sort of had a comeback recently, like the scrunchie, so I wanted to have one to coordinate with my outfits. I love the color combination - the white and the colorful jewels. The floral jewels are very well made and gorgeous. It feels comfortable on my head, and stays put. This headband just ties my entire outfit together. Love it!",40562,1844
4.0,1614838106193,Has everything you need for skincare routine,"This set pretty much has everything you need for a night time skin care routine. There’s a cleanser, toner, face cream, eye cream, etc. The packaging is beautiful and for some of the items, heavy (glass). There is a light scent but it is nothing overwhelming or offensive. The amount of product is also quite generous, especially given the affordable price tag for all of these items. If you were to purchase items like these separately (from a different brand) it would definitely be way over this price point. My favorite is the face cream. It is light, not too heavy or greasy, and just dries on your face with a nice moisturized feeling. Although I am using all these products myself, I could see this being a wonderful gift set. It makes a good gift for Mother’s Day or birthday. This also makes a good starter kit of basic skin care essentials. Not the most high end skin care but not bad.<br /><br />Just a tip: Although the product labels are in Chinese, there is English on each of the bottles stating what the product is (eg: eye cream)<br />You can throw away the packaging with the English product description but you just have to remember how to use it.",40562,14
3.0,1614683512060,Patches break easily,"Having previously been disappointed with another one of their product (spilled and dried out), I was half expecting this product to arrive the same way. While this one did not arrive dried out, it was disappointing to see the eye patches were not drenched in the solution like most eye patches I’ve tried. They looked almost dry. It applies fine but just would have been better soaked in more solution.<br /><br />The patches also breaks too easily. I just put my fingernails on it and it split apart. I usually wear my glasses when I am using eye patches at night and have never experienced any that tore during use but these did. It tore near/underneath my eyeglass nose pad, which I had not touched with my fingers. When I went to remove them they broke apart in several pieces, which has never happened with any eye patches I have used. Overall these just did not leave a good impression on me.",40562,77
5.0,1611547292178,"So soft, dense bristles","These bristles are SO soft! These will definitely not make you feel like you are scraping a layer of your skin off like most brushes do. This lathers very well which is great when I am trying to get my back. This brush is really so soft that I can use it on my baby as well. The wood handles are quite sturdy. Very good quality, dense brush.",40562,235
5.0,1611466095340,"Loving this product! It’s white, not blue, so don’t worry!","I am starting to ramp up my mask use again and do them about 3 times a week. This week I gave these a try and really liked them. First of all, the smell was quite nice - very light but a very nice smell. I actually try to put all the serum that was stuck on the package onto the mask because I wanted more of the nice smell on my face. The mask is soaked in serum and had a little extra left which I scooped out and piled onto the mask on my face. The material of the mask is soft. After 20 minutes it was not dry yet (still damp) but I removed the mask to a very moisturized face. I was able to massage the rest of the serum into my skin and sort of wiped off some of the excess. I really enjoyed using this mask and I’m actually looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />One thing I thought was that this mask is going to be blue colored, as it mentioned about a blue powder (copper peptide?). When I opened the package it was your standard white mask, white serum. It was a little confusing to me with the image of the blue cream in the front and the mention of a blue powder on the back of the packaging. Just know that this mask just looks like your typical face mask, soaked in white serum!",40562,2361
5.0,1607935919725,no more lugging around a heavy bottle of perfume / body spray,"Prior to these I had been carrying wet wipes in my bag for when I’m out and need a little refreshing / wipe down sweaty body parts. The wet wipes are not scented and I did not want to carry a bottle of perfume or scented spray with me because those are too heavy and bulky. I would be clean but I wanted to smell nice. These perfume wipes are the perfect solution for me. I now have these in my bag whenever I am out (to the park, grocery shopping, etc) and I don’t have to worry if I start to sweat or not smell as fresh as a bed of roses. What I’ll do is I wipe myself down with wet wipes first then I’ll swipe these on my neck and wrists. These are so convenient! I really like this scent as well. These would also be great for weekend getaways where you’ll have one less heavy thing (perfume bottle) to pack. The only issue is that it is not very cost effective - but you’ll have to weigh convenience with cost to see which is more important to you.",40562,79
5.0,1604610895029,loving this serum!,"I just love the scent of this serum! Others are saying they smell vanilla but for some reason it smells like honey to me and I just love the scent. I am trying to phase out skin care that have added smells but I just could not resist this one! After applying the serum to my face and spreading it all over, it just seeps into my skin and moisturizes. It did not feel sticky or tacky at all. I really enjoyed using this serum at night before bed and letting it work its magic. Now that we are in colder weather my skin needs a thicker face cream like oils/serum so this is just perfect. I plan to use this every night because the scent just soothes and relaxes me. I can’t wait to try the other products in their line!",40562,1550
4.0,1604201679894,great quality sanitizing wipes,"These wipes are great for when you are out and not want to lug around a huge bottle of hand sanitizer in your bag. They don’t really smell like alcohol or anything overwhelming at all, which I was surprised with. This would be a good wipe to bring with you to a restaurant where you can use it on your hands first then wipe down the table. I like this wipes but they can get a little pricey in comparison to pump gel/liquid sanitizers (per use).",40562,2271
4.0,1603594551669,nice bottle of shower gel for guest bathroom,"I know scents are a personal thing and can be a hit or miss for most people. I didn’t mind the vanilla musk scent at all and thought it was pleasant. This is a good sized bottle and should last quite a while. For anyone who does not want to use this as a shower gel you can always use it as hand soap or as a refill for your hand soap. I already have plenty of shower gels I need to use up in my own shower so I am putting this in our guest bathroom, especially since the bottle has a nice floral design. My only complaint is this is a Korean product but they should have also included a list of ingredients in English in case it was a gift and the recipient needed to make sure they were not allergic to anything used in this shower gel.",40562,296
4.0,1602889307282,a face cream for use in the colder seasons,"I like that this product uses oils like jojoba, cocoa, and coconut. This face cream is a little on the richer side (but not super rich and thick to where it is hard to soak into the skin). It is a little on the oily side but the thing is now that the colder/fall/winter season is coming, this is the perfect face cream for the season. I would not recommend this for use during the hot summer but your skin will drink this up in the cold. The scent was light and pleasant, but that always comes down to personal preference as some people are very sensitive to smell.<br /><br />It says this cream has collagen and stem cells, but I’m not sure how much of those ingredients are used in the formulation. It would be nice to know because if there is too little then there is probably very little anti wrinkle benefits. As with all beauty/skin care products it takes time to see the results. Overall this is a good face cream if you just want something moisturizing for the face but I can’t say yet if this will help erase or prevent any wrinkles.",40562,435
5.0,1601764335991,I love this face oil!,"I love face oils and never worry about them being too oily because I only use them at night before bed - that way they have time to seep into the skin and work while I sleep. I just love the smell of this one - especially when the smells are from oils / essential oils, and nothing synthetic. This bottle is just chock full of good stuff, good ingredients, and herbs and things. As we get into the winter season this will be perfect to keep my skin moisturized so at the moment I am using it sparingly. After trying this face oil I am excited to explore other products from Laloirelle because their formulation and ingredients used are exactly the type of stuff I love and trust to use on my skin.",40562,991
4.0,1601606675167,makes a great travel cleanser!,"I am saving some of these for my next weekend getaway as they are super lightweight and I’ll have one less bulky product to bring (facial cleanser). My night time face routine usually consists of step one, using makeup remover wipes to get rid of all the makeup, and step two, washing everything off with a facial cleanser. These do a good job doing the second round of cleaning my face. Please know that these are not to replace makeup removers and will not get your mascara off. Overall this is a great product for washing your face (no makeup). My only concern is these are a bit pricey per use, understandably so as they are individually packaged, so I would probably save these for travel convenience and not so much a product I would use daily at home.",40562,739
4.0,1596343075225,Great travel sized set filled with your Caudalie staples,"I am a huge fan of Caudalie products, especially their grape water spray. That was the product that got me to explore the entire Caudalie line. I love the quality of their products. This is a great set of 5 different staple items to try (face wash, serum, spray, eye cream, and moisturizer), especially if you are new to Caudalie products. I love that it comes in a good sized zippered pouch bag so I am able to put my other makeup / skincare products too. The products are all travel sized so this is a great set to bring with you on a weekend getaway. I recommend this set to anyone looking to sample their products before committing to full sized ones.  Also great for anyone who already love and use some of these items on a daily basis but need a mini version to bring with them on a short trip - nobody wants to lug around tubes of full sized skin care products when you only need a few drops on that short trip!",40562,82
4.0,1649952052883,Great value but a bit thick for my liking!,"I get massage almost everyday coz of all the pain I have. This is very good to have if you use a lot of lotion and don’t need much to glide while you’re massaging. It’s a bit thick for my liking so a small amount can go a long ways, which is good if you’re trying to make this lotion last you a long time.<br />Doesn’t seem to clogged my pores specially in my back where I get pimples so that’s a good thing. For the price this is a good buy.<br />No skin irritation experience so that’s a good thing.<br />Beside the texture, I am happy with the overall experience with this lotion.",40598,191

5.0,1638397232966,Love how clear the mirror is!,This took more than a month to arrived but I’m glad I waited. This looks exactly as advertised and my favorite is the mirror! The mirror looks very clear and is easy to clean.<br />I got this to use not only to keep my simple makeup stuff but also to use for my channel.<br />Is $22 worth it? I honestly think it is too much but if you want convenience of finding a simple sweet gift to give to your girl friend/daughter/sister this makes it worth it.<br />The makeup bag can be flimsy if you have nothing heavy or flat to keep in the bottom and the zipper is a bit thin and I wish it’s thicker or better than what they use BUT at least the bag looks exactly as what is pictured in their listings so I cannot omit a star coz of that.<br />Also this is packed really well in a box so if you’re planning to gift this to someone directly from Amazon then you don’t need to wrap it.,40598,194
5.0,1638373939849,Takes time but it works!,This is a product that I’m surprisingly impressed. Winter seems to be hard on my feet and I’m glad I get to take care of it using this product. Application is easy. The box have illustrations as well as translated English version of the Korean wordings.<br />I have size 7.5 wide feet and I have no issues using this. I think if you have a bigger feet 10.5+ it maybe an issue.<br />The scent is a bit strong for my preference when I first open the packet BUT it gets better after I apply it.<br />It is well moisten so my feet feels good after I put it on.<br />If you have hick calluses you may need to use another one after the 1st peel.<br />Over all I’m very happy with my experience and will definitely get this once my 3 packets are used.,40598,19874

The product is good and is fun to use with my niece when I have them with me.<br />The foot spa is easy to operate and makes your little girl feel extra special.<br />The items that comes with it is cute BUT the slippers are super thin/flimsy and slippery so be very careful if you plan to use them around wet areas/tile floors.<br />This uses a battery and will cost you more than the unit over time, if you use the rechargeable kind then you may not be able to use it longer (spa time wise)<br />Overall the product is good and exactly as described!",40598,10917
5.0,1635349666253,Relaxing indeed!,"This is a nice gift set! The packaging is really nice that it looks like it is wrapped already, so if you’re thinking of sending this to someone, you can skip the gift wrapping and just mail it as it is!<br />The tumbler looks exactly as advertised. The letterings are good and no smudges. The lid closes nicely and the straw fits perfectly. My only wish is the bottom of the tumbler have nonskid bottom but even without this stays in place without issues.<br />The soap, bath bombs and the candle smells really good and doesn’t irritate my skin and nose.<br />The wine topper and the key is cheap looking but I guess it’s the thought that counts.<br />It maybe a bit pricey, but the convenience it gives you pays for it.",40598,374

The smaller roller feels perfect on my eye areas. I love how it relaxes me. I like to put mine on the fridge for awhile so it feels colder on my skin and after I use it it feels good.<br /><br />NO CONS YET! I know this kind of stuff takes awhile before you can really see a difference on your skin. If you have never use anything like this give it at least 3 months to see a difference (6 months to really see how much your skin have improved). Make sure you read the instructions to know exactly what to do and not to do.",40598,756

You will need a a few ziplock bags to contain the scent if you are traveling or else it will be all over your luggage. If you happen to mix it with food items, expect it to taste whatever you put on this bottles.<br />* don’t use for hand sanitizers or anything with alcohol base on it. I got it mainly for holding hand sanitizers for my whole family but the scent leaks so bad that I have to not use it for the purpose. It is also not good when squeezing coz it will not give you little amount.<br />* some liquid leaks too.<br /><br />This product will be good for lotion, toothpaste or shampoo/conditioner coz they have thicker consistency. But be aware that scents leaks. The reason why I gave it 3 stars is because I can’t use it for the purpose I got it for (hand sanitizers)<br />If you plan to use it thicker liquids and don’t mind the scent leaks then this is perfect coz the silicone material is very nice.",40598,2830

There's something about the vintage aesthetic that they capture so perfectly that always draws me in. I wasn't sure what I would think about their actual lipsticks however because of the bullet style is so unusual, but I really love this. The formula is creamy but long-lasting and even leaves a little bit of a stain, and the color is just the perfect red in my opinion it's a slightly deeper red so it feels a little more sophisticated and a little more wearable than a brighter red. It also has a slight blue base to it which makes your teeth look a little wider. The packaging is absolutely lovely and I actually find that I really enjoy the style of the lipstick bullet. I still always wear a lip liner of course but the angle of this makes it really easy to fully coat your lips. I will absolutely be buying more lipsticks from this brand.",41698,1098
5.0,1620942843347,This stuff looks great and it lasts forever on your eyebrows,"I am shocked. I was kind of expecting this to be a mess but I was curious so I decided to try it. This works exceptionally well. I have tried some of these little three-pronged brow markers in the past and never been very impressed. These have enough stability to them that you really can flick and get straight little lines that look just like hairs. They are thin and you have actual control. This formula also lasts forever! I definitely have to use makeup remover to get it off, so it is for sure waterproof. I also like that this color isn't pulling red on me. So often browns do that but this is nice and dark and definitely neutral. The only complaint I have is that when I open these there was a little bit of ink that had leaked out around the applicator at the top so it looked a little messy, but I love the way this works so much I don't care One thing to note is that it's best to put this on before you use any other wax or gels to keep your brow hairs in place. This really doesn't work well on top of anything but dry plain skin.",41698,25571
4.0,1613753146957,Exactly what I wanted,This is exactly what I was looking for in a scalp scrubber. It has a fairly comfortable to hold handle which makes this easy to hang on to and not slip out of your hands even if you have super slippery shampoo.

It shows the curling iron on a model's hair and it looks like an average sized curling wand with three barrels. No, in person this thing is so tiny. It honestly looks like a curling iron for dolls. As you can see in my photo I'm using a pencil for scale. Each of these barrels is about a pencil and a half to two pencils big. Meaning that the type of curls you get are more like 1920s finger waves than anything you would probably want to wear today. It's just ridiculous.",41698,137

The hair does have that typical slight plastic sheen but it's not nearly as noticeable as others I've seen especially blonde wigs. There's a good amount of hair here as well so it's not one of those wigs that gets wispy towards the ends. The part hairline could look a little better but if you fiddle with it you can make it look pretty good. All in all this is going to be a great wig for my Hocus Pocus costume.,41698,14009

5.0,1595544432071,Such a beautiful cream shadow,I'm not generally a huge fan of cream shadows but I wanted to give this one a try and I'm so happy I did. It is so glimmery and beautiful. My favorite way to wear this is just padded over a bear eyelid with some mascara and maybe a little bit of liner. It just adds a beautiful finished touch. It also looks really lovely tapped on top of eyeshadow. For that method I prefer my finger versus a brush. It's nice because it doesn't bunch up or overly crease.

I had one here that I was trying to get and I had to go over it several times and it just wouldn't seem to trim it. It's not super expensive so it's not a complete fail for me but I'm not going to be using this a lot unless I really need to. It also heats up relatively quickly.,41698,147
3.0,1549914442598,Kind of firm but good shapes,"I'm not a complete beauty sponge snob and I've tried lots of different brands, both high-end and budget friendly, and I found sponges I liked at both price points. These sponges are definitely on the farmer side, so for that reason they aren't my favorite. They do expand when wet and I really do like the shape of the larger ones in this set--they are very similar to the Real Techniques sponges--but they're just not as soft and bouncy as some of the others that I prefer. If you're looking for a good drugstore-priced sponge I recommend the Loreal ones.",41698,258
4.0,1544141625183,"Super pricey, but much better than the budget-friendly alternatives","I've been in the market for a microneedling device for a while now, but I wasn't sure if I needed something super expensive or if I could get away with a more budget-friendly option. I decided to try two super inexpensive versions , both costing around $20 and see if this significantly more expensive option from GloPRO was really worth it. In short, yes. Both of the cheaper options were incredibly painful and flimsy feeling. One of them even felt kind of like getting a face tattoo. It was awful. The GloPRO option actually feels nice on the skin because of the vibration feature and the red light therapy is a huge benefit for those monthly breakouts. I do feel like my skin care is absorbing more effectively since I've been using this, but it's still an extremely expensive tool. If you really want a microneedling device, in my opinion this is worth the investment, however, I don't think it's a necessary item.",41698,5806
4.0,1616017398189,A decent micellar water pad,"These are really handy to have.  I find using a makeup removing cream or gel a bit annoying and any sort of wash type remover ends up trailing down my arms and neck.  You know how when you see women on movies gently splashing their faces and not making a mess?  Well that's not me.  So back to the pads.  I do like them.  They're nicely soaked and a decent size, about the size of a large cotton pad but it took 3 pads to make an inroad at removing my makeup and I don't think I plaster it on, just a bit of foundation, some mascara and a bit of blush.  The bonus is that you can use both sides but I do think it could do a better job at actual makeup remover.  For a quick cleanup and removing tinted moisturiser it does a good enough job.  If you're using it as part of a multi phase make up removal which I do when I have the time and motivation then this is a great second step.  I didn't have any adverse reactions.  I didn't dislike them, I just wasn't blown away by them and my search for the unicorn of make up removers continues.<br /><br />All in all they work as well as your average micellar water with the added convenience of having the pad and micellar water all in one.",41869,13636

I used it when I came home from a red eye flight and the term “red eye” has never been more appropriate. My eyes felt like sandpaper. I used it on the highest heat setting and it really does get very warm but not uncomfortably so. I set it for 15 mins and fell asleep with it on.  I’ve used it a few times since and it makes me feel so relaxed and soothes my eyes and reduces redness and puffiness.,41869,1543

Sadly the wipes I got were quite dry and as such really didn't do much to remove my makeup.  I had to use about five to make a dent in it and I really don't wear too much makeup other than a bit of concealer and CC cream.  That said they don't have any sort of strong scent and didn't cause any irritation.  I'd use them to freshen up my skin but I'll to pass on using them as a makeup wipe.

They're packed full of serum, stay on well and cover the whole under eye and side area.  The brightening face mask did seem to make my skin more even and brighter but it does say not for sensitive skin.  I do sometimes have some sensitivity issues but didn't experience that with any of the masks.<br /><br />There's enough serum in all the masks that you can use the excess the next day as a serum or swipe over your décolletage.

I'm a flight attendant and it's such a pain to have to take a variety of products when you travel and some countries have liquid restrictions.<br /><br />I used this as soon as I got to my hotel with low expectations that were quickly blown away.  You use wet it with warm water and it takes off all makeup including mascara.  You rinse with water afterwards but it's not overly soapy so you don't have to worry about getting soap in your eyes.  I've used this at home and then used a cotton wool pad with my usual makeup remover expecting some residue makeup but nothing was left.  I'm so impressed with these and as one pad will take off all your makeup it's really good value.,41869,739

Long before they became something you could buy at your local pharmacy so I’m used to reading the adorable translations on the back (see photo)<br /><br />That aside the mask is a little on the small side and I think I have an average sized face. It does stretch though and the benefit is that it doesn’t get in your hair. Lots of serum with this one, or mask juice as I like to call it<br />so at the end of the mask time you have enough to apply extra to your face a neck.<br /><br />I left it for the full 20 minutes and my skin did feel soft and moisturised.  I used it after a transatlantic flight and my skin really needed the hydration. Obviously you won’t see any miracles after one use but do make it part of your weekly or twice weekly routine for maximum effect.<br /><br />Don’t be tempted to leave it on longer or sleep with it. All masks will just dry out and negate the benefits.<br /><br />This is a nice addition to my sheet mask collection.",41869,253
3.0,1664851355160,Cute - works OK - doesn’t get too warm…No directions,This eye massage thing doesn’t come with any directions. Now it’s not rocket science but I would like to know if there’s supposed to be heat in each function - if it supposed to pulse on the blue and the red light etc. I say this because I think there’s only heat when the red light is on. The rest seem to have no heat.  And it is very light - very slight heat as it is. It makes me question is there even heat or has my face heated the crystal up. So I was really expecting it to have much more heat. Also with both the red and the blue light it’s not a constant vibration - it’s kind of like a pulse vibration it goes on and it goes off then it goes on and it goes off.<br /><br />I do like that you can use it without the red or the blue light because the third setting is just a vibration - and that one is a constant vibration. But again that setting seems to have no heat at all.<br /><br />The crystal does seem to be some kind of quartz. It is a clear type of crystal so I assume it’s quartz because quartz is pretty common.<br /><br />It feels pretty nice around my eyes and if you hold it a certain way the red and/or or blue light will not get into your eye - you won’t see it while you use it. And I do like that. So this is OK and it looks just like a tube of lipstick.,41997,2848
4.0,1660680346207,"Easy enough to use – no bubbles without heat, though – Gets HOT!",This thing is pretty nifty.  I do feel that the machine gets hot super-fast – like super-fast.  And I never have to turn it higher than low for the heat – it is that hot.  Can not imagine using it hotter actually. At least I can turn it off if I feel it is getting to hot for me.  But that is where the one missing function is really glaring.  You can not use this thing with just bubbles.  Now at first that doesn’t sound bad at all.  That is until you feel how hot the water can get.  You only get just heat alone or heat and bubbles – again – no JUST bubbles…<br /><br />Being collapsible makes it easy to put away and store.  The remote control is easy enough to use but tends to fall off when you store this – so just be sure not to misplace it.<br />I hope that you have found my review “helpful”. : )  Enjoy your day! : ),41997,2315
4.0,1642112306125,Product doesn’t say it is Vegan : (,"The listing says the product is Vegan but nowhere on the box or product does it state that.  I am not a scientist so am unsure if it truly is.  My experience – especially with most beauty products – is that if they are Vegan they definitely like to tout it on the product.  I am going to assume it is – but it should still say it clearly on it...<br /><br />It is black – so it is definitely “a look” for most people.  If you are goth or something – you will probably love it.  I got it mostly for Halloween.  Especially as it is matte – I can use it on my face as a whole to help with my costume– and not just on my lips.  It is easy to apply and actually applied VERY precisely.  If you wear it alone it is sort of dry on the lips – but not as dry as some others out there.  I like to add a slight layer of a balm first – just to give me some hydration.  It still comes off very matte that way but maybe doesn’t wear as well for longevity.  Even then – it didn’t come off on my teeth – just slightly on a cup I was drinking out of.  Not terrible at all though.  It has a slightly vanilla like scent to it.  It is pretty nice.  It sort of stayed put but was also easy enough to wipe off with a paper towel and some pressure.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks!

I have a problem in that NONE of the contents have ingredients listed, though.  So, although the soap looks beautiful and fancy – I do not know what is in it or what it is made of.  Same goes for the bath bombs – no ingredients whatsoever.  (One I like the smell of – the other not so much.)  Because of this these items definitely come off dollar store-like.  The wine tumbler seems well made and comes with a straw and straw brush.  The candle says it is soy wax which is nice but to me it smells terrible.  The weird part is that the gift box comes with a plastic wine topper.  Now the wine bottle topper “looks” nice but it is 100% plastic – worse than dollar store...  It also comes with what looks like a random decorative metal key that serves no function and does not go with the contents at all.  Yet it is a bottle top opener – for beer…  That is so weird to me and I will be taking this out before gifting this gift set as no wine I know of has a pop top – twist off sure – but beer cap?  For the price, they need to truly step it up in regards to the contents - include ingredients and include a better wine stopper.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.

3.0,1624292570809,Pretty but Catches and pulls out a lot of hair,"This blingy headband is so pretty.  It makes me feel like I am living as a tudor or in elizabethan or renaissance times or something.  Would actually look great wearing to a Renaissance Faire.<br /><br />The problem is that the thing is not made in the best way.  First, when it arrived, it had already lost a stone – although it was floating around inside the plastic bag.  Try as I might, I can not get it to reattach as I think the prongs are now broken.  I will try instead to glue it back in.  Makes me wonder how long it will take for the other stones to also fall out…  Usually with jewelry, it is preferable to have prong set stones but apparently not in a headband as all those prongs grab and catch like every hair available on your head.  It pulled so much of my hair out when I tried simply removing it from my head.  (My pictures of the hair caught was AFTER I pulled most of the hair off the prongs.  It was easily 4 to 6 times as much stuck on it originally.)<br /><br />Because of the issue stated above I can only recommend for like one time use – knowing you are going to lose a bunch of hair because of it.  Otherwise I can not recommend. : (  Maybe if you have VERY short hair that has no way of catching…  (It also came with a freebie hair clip which I will give to a child and a sweet, cute paper origami heart - love that!)<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.

4.0,1614289555351,Very simple yet flirty,"These headbands are pretty nice.  I only have one bad thing to say about them.  The ends of the bands (which are wrapped in coordinating colored cloth which is awesome!) is squared.  This makes the ends of the bands - the actual edge of the cloth) poke at my ears and head when removing them.  Putting on was not a problem as I seem to be more careful.  Not sure if you are truly running around and active where they may continue to poke you through the day - have not worn mine long enough yet - and today is a calm day anyway.  Not sure why they made the pretty end so squared...<br /><br />Otherwise these headbands are very nice. Nicer than I though they would be.  I actually thought they may look far too childish but in actuality they are very nice looking - simple yet flirty.  They do not look infantile in any way.  They also fit pretty well and are comfortable to wear - except for the pokey bottoms.  I also thought that the colors would be an issue as I am not much of a pastel person but because they are thin it really is not an issue.  I think they will go along with a lot of clothes - even if it picks up just a hint of a color that you may have on.  Plus - even though the ends are uncomfortable - I LOVE that they are finished with the same exact color - most bands take the cheap way out and finish all the colors in black or something.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""helpful"" button.

5.0,1611774994202,GOOD button placement - also stays put on your head due to fabric,"I like these mask headbands.  First - the button placement is PERFECT!  Some headbands have the buttons way too high to use - these are set PERFECTLY.  I LOVE that  The colors are pretty nice too - especially for office wear! Not sure how often I will use the print ones - but the other colors are perfect for the office.  And when I am going out with my mask on - I never leave home without a mask headband.  It makes life so much easier and the mask more secure and much more comfortable.<br />The material is GREAT for making sure it does not slip off your head.  The velour makes sure it stays put and grips your hair and doesn't move.  The buttons are very pretty, stylish, and very much color coordinated with some of the headbands.  The only thing - because the buttons are 'so nice' and sort of concave - once you stick your mask on the button sort of sticks out a bit - more so than a flat button.  BUT with that being said - it grips your mask securely.  Some flat buttons let the mask slip off sort of easily.  AND it is just a button so who cares if it does not lie perfectly flat against your head.

4.0,1610473026937,Good to not slip from your hair,"These headbands are completely necessary for me to live my life these days.  I tried other masks extenders but nothing either stayed put, was comfortable, or actually helped with my mask.  I have a few different types of mask headbands now - as I wear one every time I leave my house.<br /><br />These particular ones are pretty nice!  If you have a problem with slicker material ones slipping out of your hair - THESE will stay put due to the velour grip on your head.  They are not too tight either - some bands I tried squish your brain...  The buttons are also the NICEST buttons I have seen on a mask headband like ever.  The ONLY flaw with the pretty and matching buttons that are sort of concave are that because of their pretty design once you put your mask strap on them they sort of lift up and away from the band itself (because of their concaveness) - so sort of stick out a bit.  So the pretty buttons can be a flaw.  But they work just fine - and it is probably me being anal.<br /><br />The buttons are also at a decent placement.  I wish they were the slightest bit lower, though - as that works best for me.  As they are now they are still good - any higher and they would be pulling your nose up by your mask.  The colors (other than the wilder animal print) are muted enough to easily wear to the office as well.  A headband is literally part of my everyday office wear now.

Seriously doubt these are Organic - no marking as such - but there is no info whatsoever anyway - so who knows what is truly in them.<br /><br />I put a ball in my glass mug and poured boiling water anyway.  There is no ""flowering"" like you may get from flowering tea balls.  It just sort of filled the entire mug with flowers - petals and flowers.  Like the entire mug.  It was the consistency of a thick stew.  You might get a few sips for the space that is left after the flowers expand.  I was actually impressed with how much ""flower"" was there from that tiny and light ball.<br /><br />I sipped it and was snot impressed with the flavor.  Light at that and must have been chamomile as chamomile smells like chicken soup to me and I am not a fan of chamomile or this ""tea"".  It was the consistency of soup, though... a hearty chowder.  It was not fragrant in any way either so I think although you get plenty of flowers for a tub - you are defeating the purpose of adding fragrant flower petals to your bath.  Plus no ingredients anyway.  It seemed like all flowers - it really did - but I am not really sure what is in there.  Plus some people are allergic to certain herbs and flowers anyway.

They work well to cleanse a particular area.  You can't use them for like a full body thing while camping in deep woods as you would have to use a few to get the job done.<br /><br />Overall very nice for the occasional usage - ALWAYS good to have!

I was surprised how nice they look on - in real life.  In the box - you are like - they are OK.  But once on - WOW!<br /><br />Now they do not grip the head or hair really - sort of loose on top of my head but they are secure on the sides.  I didn't feel like they were coming out or anything.  They are relatively comfortable to wear as well.  BUT they will not really hold your hair well - either.  These are really just for looks mostly - which is fine with me as they REALLY are pretty.  Are they perfect - no - on two of them the beads are spaced a bit here and there - in your hair you won't even notice, though.  Plus they come in a variety of colors.  I can wear up to three and make it look cute.<br /><br />I guess you could wear these with jeans and a tee for some pizazz and more of a girlie look - but they really are pretty enough for special occasion events and parties, and stuff.

In no way does it smell like mint or rosemary (two scents that I LOVE!).  To me, it smells like a men's cologne.  In fact it smells just like this hand wash that a male friend keeps in his bathroom.

5.0,1601426117821,Ladies (and gentlemen) we have a clear WINNER here - FIVE STARS!!!,"OK - I have to say that since returning to the office and having to wear a mask for about 12 hours a day now - I have pretty much tried almost every mask ear protector out there.  The silicone or plastic things to go behind your head all suck so I moved on to headbands.  My first try in headbands were ginormous and looked like I was wearing a skull or surgical cap...  Other headbands were a bit snug and sometimes uncomfortable - sometimes the buttons were too high and sqooshed the mask onto my nose.  I am now an expert in all these products. : )<br /><br />With that being said - THESE HEADBANDS ARE, hands down, THE BEST OUT THERE!!!!  I recommend you grab some and use them in good health!  The colors may be a bit bold - that is totally true.  But the fit and comfort is totally top notch.  Even with wearing my hair in a pony, bun, or twist these headbands stay securely on.  Yet you do not feel them at all - it is literally like WEARING NOTHING AT ALL.  No pressure on your head at all - sometimes when I close my office door and take my mask off, I actually have to reach onto the top of my head because I feel nothing and want to make sure my headband hasn't slipped off - and it never does!  The buttons are also in the perfect position where you can even put the lower part of the ear loop on your ear if you wanted.  The buttons are not too high like some other headbands.<br /><br />THESE ARE PERFECT!!!!  If I could scream it from the top of a building I totally would.

2.0,1599438103571,NOT spirals in any way shape or form - but did a decent job making some body in my hair,"First off - how these arrive in the bag - like a little roll - is the way they will end up in your hair.  There is no way to make them spiral at all.  More like standard old school curls.<br /><br />I found them a bit hard to use as well - as I found it a big pain to get the stick through the curler.  I ended up squashing like four of five on the stick at a time (since that was the truly painful part) and then using it on my hair one after the other.  Plus even though I cut my hair to like shoulder length - these are actually pretty short - just for the ends of your hair really.<br /><br />With that being said - I tried these one night after a shower - letting my hair dry by at least half.  I put the curlers in while watching TV.  Left them in for like an hour, ran my hairdryer over them until my hair felt dry and took them out.  My hair definitely had some bounce and was sort of curly.  So if you are looking for body - these might definitely work.  If you are looking for tight curls (especially spirals) - probably look elsewhere.  On the plus side - for work the next day - my hair still had some body and felt thicker when I put it up.

5.0,1598233521126,"Surprisingly, it really makes a difference!","I get ""outbreaks"" on my hands sometimes.  Usually when my hands get bad (even just one hand) I have to apply a cortisone rub a few times a day over a few days to make the redness, flakiness, and itchiness subside.<br /><br />I was hesitant to get this because the ingredients seem pretty simple for something that is supposed to make a difference in psoriasis.  Well I am surprised at how effective this spray is.  Instead of touching the cortisone rub at all - I just sprayed this on the backs of my hands.  Granted I was working form home for the entire day - so I pretty much sprayed it a bunch of times over the course of the day.  The redness got MUCH better.  And the flakiness totally went away.  The only thing is my skin on the bad hand looked a bit dry - but I guess that is because this is a spray and not an emollient cream or anything.  To the touch, my hand felt pretty soft with only the slightest dry patches felt.  Anytime I can avoid cortisone (steroids) I consider a really good time.<br /><br />I am happy with this spray and have a feeling I will always have to keep some on hand going forward.

3.0,1632113593678,super cute,The COSYOO Boho headbands set comes with 12 cute hair band. It has different colors and different patterns. The fabric textures are also different. They fits in different occassions. I really like some of the designs. But the size seems runs small. I feel my head is regular size. But it is tight after few houes wearing it. Also I do not understand why there are 2 buttons there which seems does not make it prettier. I hope it can be bigger so I can wear it. Now it belongs to my daughter and she loves it.,42735,381

The one I got is Himalaya Jade which is green. The size for the roller and the gua sha tool is perfect, I can handle it easily. The surface of both tools are very smooth. It is a little bit cold to use it during winter time on the face, so I usually warm some lotion in my hand then apply it with the face roller. The two sides of the roller can cover all of my face. I use the smaller side to massage between my eyes and I found it relieves my puffy eye.",42735,19
5.0,1630627208810,Unique crown,I have tried many different crowns and I am really liking this one because it’s very unique compared to others. The purple color and leaf details make it stand out. The purple looks more like a brown to me but I like it. Jewel encrusted leaves and vines make up the main part of the crown and tear drop shaped jewels spike out from the top. This is not a full circle crown which makes it easier to fit on the head and keep in place. There are holes on each end to fix the crown in place. This crown is not too heavy but does have some weight. It seems to be well made. I would recommend it. Great for a special occasion or costume!,42814,1830
4.0,1627862994215,Pretty clips,I ordered these hair clips for my 3 year old daughter who loves butterflies. This pack comes with 12 different colored butterfly alligator clips.  The alligator clips are fully covered with a matching ribbon so they do not get easily tangled in hair or damage the hair.  The clip is sturdy and stays put when in the hair.  The butterfly wings are made of two layers of a very thin fabric.  They are transparent but the colors are beautiful. The butterfly bodies are different glitter colors which adds just the right amount of sparkle to these clips. I think these clips are very pretty and so much fun for a young child or an adult who enjoys butterflies. They are not the highest quality but I think priced appropriately for a se lot of 12.,42814,1832

My pores are less noticeable and my makeup lasts much longer than without the product. My face looks and feels smooth all day.  It’s so easy to use too!  All you have to do is shake it up and spray your face several times before applying makeup.  I haven’t noticed a scent to it and barely notice the product at all when I spray it on.

Some times if the mist is too much its just too messy. But the mist on this one is so fine I barely felt anything on my face when I was applying it and had to be sure that I was even getting product on my faec and opened my eyes to check. I did use more than the recommended amount, which I found to be a bit on the low side since the size of the mist is so small the amount of product that you get out on a single spray is minimum. After I applied, I watched in the mirror as it dried, and the effects were amazing. My shine do go away and I could literally see my pore getting smaller. I could see myself using this alone on a hot summer day without makeup because the finish it gave was just that great. My makeup also went on very easy and smooth and felt as if it was gliding across my face and not going into every wrinkle and groove. I didn't wear my makeup anything close to 16 hours but I did make it through a 8 hour workday flawless. Defiantly a staple now in my makeup bag.",43738,4074

However, there are other things to note.  First the scent; I'm obsessed with rosewater, and I expected this to have a rosewater scent.  However, it doesn't smell of roses (or like sunscreen) at all;  I actually dislike the oddly medicinal smell, but fortunately it disappears quickly.  Also, it has a slight, small gritty texture (and I have not encountered in suncreen before); this also doesn't linger.  The textured is watery and easy to distribute.  The tint is very much the color of calamine lotion (really), but it's watery and thin so it doesn't show up that color once distributed.  I have fair, neutral skin, and I think the effect is actually flattering.  However, I am not at all sure how well it will or won't server darker skins.  As I only have my own skin to test it on, I can't assess how well it will suit darker skin, just note that the slight tint is pink.",44382,723
3.0,1599100364940,"Comfortable and natural lavender scent, but it doesn't block odors completely.","I was happy to try this deodorant, hoping it would be a natural deodorant that did the job of complete protection against odors.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite cut it.  While it does cut down on body odors, it definitely doesn't eliminate them.  Perhaps cuts them by half.  So, I'm disappointed and won't repurchase.  However, I can well imagine mileage may vary with individual body chemistry, so it may be worth a try if you're feeling like a gamble.<br />The deodorant is comfortable, non itchy, and doesn't leave a lot of residue.

I would definitely repurchase.<br /><br />Face wipes can't compare to truly washing your face with a cleanser; my skin (which needs it's exfoliation) is at it's best and most polished when I wash fully with a cleanser.  But life happens, and last nights happen, and face wipes are 1000% better than sleeping in your makeup.  They're also great for mornings when you don't really need the full cleansing routine, or as pre-wash makeup removed in the evening if you have on a lot of long wearing makeup.  So many uses, and wipes are a staple in my bathroom cabinet.  And these are some of the gentlest ones I've tried.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend for sensitive or dry skin.",44382,1382

It charges via usb which is great and convenient. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I haven't had to charge it again. I probably use it for less than 2 minutes a day.

My wife has tried several brands before, including top-rated wipes, and all of them except for this one irritates her skin slightly.  These do not!  Her skin is pretty tough, and she doesn't usually have reactions to cosmetics.<br /><br />There is a label on the inner package with Japanese writing, that's not translated into English on the package.  It says to make sure to use the plastic box to store the wipes to ensure quality and peel off the sticker completely; don't remove the wipes from the bag; make sure to close the lid after use.  I'd suggest that the manufacturer add a translated version on the package.  The package says to use the entire package within 45 days after opening, so if you don't wear make-up every day, you may not finish the package before they start to dry out.<br /><br />My wife loves these!

Dermatologists said to take Vitamin C 2 for weeks before use, and avoid sunlight; avoid makeup; your skin may peel afterward. So, I was afraid to try it out.  It turns out, that using this is not painful at all.  But when used on my forehead, it looks like it has more pores.  So, I decided to start taking vitamins, and planned out when to try this out, but I avoided trying it out before times when I planned to expose it to sunlight, along with one week before my (wife’s) period.<br /><br />Finally, I had the right time to try it out, and it had no obvious side effects...no pain, no skin flushing, no damage, no problems with sunlight or wearing makeup.  Because this is a device made for home use, it is much more mild than professional devices.  You may be able to use this every other day.<br /><br />The device is light weight, and rechargeable, but comes with batteries, so you don’t have to charge before use; this makes it easy to bring on travel.  I wish I had tried it much earlier.<br /><br />The head is supposed to be replaced every three months at a current cost of $35.  You are supposed to use a new cleaning pad before every use, and it came with 5 pads; the replacement skin prep pads are $35 for 30 pads which will last you two months, using it two to three times a week, which is what the manufacturer recommends.  The minimum monthly cost of supplies is about $38 per month.  You also need to have isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol to use with the provided spray bottle to sanitize the micro-needling head.<br /><br />I would recommend using sun screen after use, to protect your skin.<br /><br />After the first few uses, I haven’t seen much effect, but my husband thinks my face’s skin looks better.",45729,5806
3.0,1654975674908,Good so far,"Love the convenience of this pen, just wish the gel would come out a better way. First off, it took FIVEver to expression the gel out. I think I clicked the bottom 50 times before a tiny bead of gel started to appear, I had to aggressively click and slam the pen onto the counter to get more product out. Once I was finally able to get enough product out, I dried my teeth (after flossing and brushing first) and wiped the silicone bristles onto my teeth from premolar to  premolar on my upper and lower teeth, I used the box it came in to fan and dry off my teeth. I did this before bed time so I wouldn’t have the urge to eat or drink after. The gel will become stringy once your inner lips and cheek touch the gel and there’s a mild taste to it.  So far I’ve used this pen nightly for 4 days and I’ve seen a tiny bit of results. You’re supposed to use it twice a day for 2 weeks. I haven’t experienced any sensitivity from the gel, partly because I’ll use sensodyne toothpaste to brush and the gel is formulated with potassium nitrate that helps prevent sensitivity. Other good ingredients include xylitol and natural antioxidants. Overall good product, just need a better way to get the product out without having to click it.

The packaging is super cute and the product itself displays really nicely too. I'd say it's a fairly lightweight moisturizer that when rubbed in melts like an oil. My cuticles were instantly revived. If they made a jumbo size of this I would use it on my whole body. The scent is great and I didn't need to reapply frequently because it really sunk in.,47609,2256

The bottles are actual glass (which means you can recycle them!) The roller on the oil is really well made too, it never got stuck like some cheaper ones do. I used this kit for about a week and the results were really amazing. My only complaint is the scent of the lotion is EXTREME. I mean I didn't think you could combine rose, frankincense, geranium, AND ylang ylang...but they did. It's really strong and hyper floral so if you're sensitive to scents I might skip out and just get the oil. The lotion does however apply really nicely and sinks in quickly.",47609,448

My boyfriend complained that the scent was overwhelming and smelled like “old lady” perfumes and asked me not to wear it.<br /><br />I also found the packaging to be wasteful, you can’t recycle any of it except for the box so if you do end up liking this sort of scent I would just buy the bottle instead.",47609,79

I’ve been really loving the primer essence for setting my face. I apply about a full droppers worth into my palm, rubbing my hands together, and gently tapping over my face and neck. I really prefer this over setting sprays which feel awful when they blast you in the eyes.

5.0,1602832419784,Opulent oils,You really get what you pay for with these oils. The ingredients are absolutely reflected in the price. I love that you can clearly see everything in the bottle unlike some high end brands that hide their ingredients. Natural skincare is the way to go these days with everything else being a mystery. This oil applies like a dream and soaks right into the skin. Even with makeup on top it leaves a beautiful glow underneath and doesn't slide around. The oil is a drier formula that won't slip or slide and absolutely repairs over time. I've noticed my cheeks are brighter and overall complexion is smoother. The scent is to die for with a musky woodsy kind of scent with very light floral undertones. Would absolutely recommend for a holiday gift!,47609,993
5.0,1602832092348,Luxurious and worth it,"There's something deeply comforting about the scent of this. It's almost like a woodsy scent.

The scent is light, clean, and with a very fair hint of floral. Honestly, it smells like playdough and I'm not sure why. The ingredients are clean and I haven't noticed a single breakout regardless of how thick this oil is. As seen in the video it leaves a gorgeous dewy sheen to the skin so I would recommend this for either nighttime or for those who really love natural glowy makeup looks without foundation.

3.0,1602709937527,The scent is too much,"While a lot of people have an issue investing in skincare I think it's one of the luxury things I like to splurge on. In my quest for switching to more natural skincare I came across this brand and wanted to try everything. This serum absolutely feels luxurious down to the packaging. The serum is lightweight and does NOT clog pores at all. It dries within a matter of seconds without leaving the skin feeling tacky. I notice an overall tightening due to the retinol in the product which lets me know it's working. However, the rose scent is painfully excessive. I have to hold my breath while applying because it will cause me a headache until it dries down, for that I had to take off a few stars. Overall the serum does seem to work well enough to replace my drugstore brand retinol.",47609,992
1.0,1600554439026,Dangerous,"This kit felt very cheap and dangerous. You really get what you pay for. The combs teeth were bent on both sets and very flimsy.

The fabric itself is extremely soft, like a baby blanket. I thought maybe if I wet it and tried it would help, alas my skin broke out and I had to put it down.<br /><br />The packaging is great, the seller seems like an excellent business person and really wants to take care of you as a customer.

It is abrasive and it has a scent that is so distinct and it sticks with you for hours and hours after you have washed your hands. I loathe hospital soap.<br /><br />These little soap sheets are simply amazing. Not only do they pack light - I can stick one little tin in my bag and it takes up almost no space at all, but the sheets themselves are tiny. The sheets dissolve nearly instantly in water, lather perfectly and the smell so nice. They are like a little bathroom oasis at the doctor or hospital. The scent does not linger though, so please do not be worried about smelling like ylang ylang for hours on end.<br /><br />My hands always feel clean when I leave the bathroom and I have even used a sheet to wet a paper towel and wipe my face off.",49129,207
5.0,1618666433403,Easy To Use And Effective,"As a 42 year old woman with shockingly pale skin I thought it would be interesting to try a sunless tanner. When I was younger I used Jergens sunless tanner and unless I was extremely careful and diligent I ended up orange, streaked or some combination of the two. I did not have high hopes for this sunless tanner, so I started with a small area on one leg.<br /><br />First, this lotion does not have any real scent straight out of the bottle, but it does have a smell that develops once it is on the skin. It is not unpleasant and maybe the scent is dependent on the person, but it is there. Second, it is easy to apply. The first application I only put a tiny amount on my right leg and then immediately washed my hands. I let it dry for about one minute and then got dressed. Simple. Third, it takes a bit for color to appear. I started to tan in about 12 hours and by the next morning I was noticeably browner.<br /><br />The second application I put on both my legs just like normal lotion. I tried paying attention to my knees and ankles, but honestly, I did not really. I washed my hands immediately, but must have brushed my forearm. I let everything dry for about one minute and then got dressed. The next morning I was tan and had a streak of brown on my arm.<br /><br />I like this stuff. It is easy to use and the color lasts. My super pale skin accepts the color and I don't look nearly as translucent.",49129,2536
5.0,1614606002668,A Real Lavender Lotion That Works,"I am sort of a lavender lotion expert. I love the stuff. Most lotions that have lavender either smell like nothing or smell like an entire shop of flowers. Those lotions that do get the scent right usually are full of chemicals.<br /><br />I had never heard of Kneipp before but I really like it. This lotion is not thin, but if you are used to a thick cream it will seem thinner. It does take a little work to absorb, but it is worth it. The scent is not overpowering and I think it does not linger, but is just right.<br /><br />One complaint I do have is that the bottle had no safety seal. For $18 I would think the tube would come with a seal on the top. I was not sure if the bottle had already been used and returned. I just decided to go ahead and be brave and I'm still alive. Kneipp needs to add a seal on their tubes.<br /><br />This is not a sticky or overwhelming lotion and does not leave your skin feeling greasy. Sometimes paying a little more for a product that really works is worth it and this is one of those times.",49129,2990

Simple.<br /><br />These masks are however a little different in that they come packaged in a lovely little box, wrapped in tissue paper and would be the perfect gift to send someone. There are 12 masks, including two panda masks(!)<br /><br />I like that there are a couple of each mask which will make it possible for both my husband and I to do a mask together.<br /><br />We already did the panda mask and the scent was not overpowering. There is a lot of liquid for the skin to absorb in each packet and we did notice some dripping. This was solved by simply wiping the extra off with a washcloth. We did not rub in all the extra to our faces because it would not have been possible. The masks did not improve our faces to the point where we were amazed, but they were cooling while they were on and it was a fun Saturday, movie night thing to do.",49129,971
4.0,1608728040658,Fun Pack of Butterfly Tattoos,"These tattoos are fun. There is a ton to pick from and each butterfly is just a little different.

Those tattoos look more like the butterfly is smudged and not 3D. If this is important to you I would simply cut the shadow part off because it truly does look like a smudge.",49129,10016

So far this mask has been one of my favorites.<br /><br />- Extremely hydrating and cooling.<br />-Made my skin very soft and smooth for a couple days afterwards.<br />-Easy to use.<br />-Large enough to cover my entire face.<br />-Enough balm to cover my face, neck and probably my entire body.<br />-Mask did become invisible when I had it on. Not that this is super important, but my husband does a mask that makes him look like a robber and it was just an interesting observation.<br /><br />-Has an insane amount of the cucumber balm - so much extra that I needed to wipe it off before I could actually rub it in after I took the mask off.<br />-The balm took forever to dry after I took the mask off. It was not bad, but my face did feel sticky for hours afterwards and I woke up with a tacky face in the middle of the night. Seriously, it was a lot of cucumber.

4.0,1597153924310,Decent Brush For Thin Short Hair,"As most of us are in quarantine and not currently getting regular hair maintenance, having weird hair right now is just normal. I am growing out a pixie cut, not by choice, but by mandate of the State of Michigan. I have experienced a number of difficult hair transitions during this stay home, stay safe period, all of which I hope to never experience again. Currently, my hair is just too short to tuck behind my ear, so it is constantly falling in my face, but thankfully, I am past the super trendy mullet stage.<br /><br />When I had my pixie cut for seven years I washed my hair and dried it with a towel and went on with my life. No comb, no brush, no anything. It was really nice. Now that I actually have hair that tangles and needs attention I require tools. I have a brush with tight bristles that I like, but it pulls. I use leave in conditioner gel that seems to help, but I still pull a lot of hair. I have a very inexpensive comb that does absolutely nothing and I should probably just recycle it.<br /><br />This specific comb and brush set is definitely not the fanciest around. The comb has some heft to it and it does a good job getting my part straight. The brush is very stiff compared to my other brush, but it does not pull all my hair out when it hits a tangle. I also like that this brush doesn't mash my hair down. I have thinner hair and this brush doesn't make me look like I have thin hair.<br /><br />I don't use any styling products or tools, so I am not hard on my brush. I think this brush will hold up just fine in my hands, but I think if I person were using it with lots of accessories and products it might be a placeholder for a more expensive brush.",49129,2938

1.0,1603130284198,If you sleep alone,"The marketing blurb says, among other things ""this advanced man face care formula features stem cells to help revive the skin and smooth out imperfections"".<br />Well... stem cells, if they were actually somehow harvested, in a cosmetics container, mixed with various other chemicals and ingredients would necessarily be dead and therefore completely irrelevant. And, of course, the stem cells would help address things such as diabetes and repair of heart muscle following heart attack, not zits on one's face. Not to mention that they would need to be live and 'human' cells. So, I am quite confident that the 'stem cells' claim is untrue and, even if it were true, the presence of dead stem cells in a cream would make zero difference.<br />Other than that, the cream is thick and, as other reviewer found, it has an aggressive smell that reminded me of Noxzema. So I would never use it during the day. At night, it would probably be Okay if used by men who sleep alone.",49828,435

However, the manual is not exactly helpful but most of us should be able to figure it out, eventually. Charging is via a custom USB cable but there is no actual charging unit so you need to find one such as your phone charger. You only need to charge it once every couple of weeks if you use it once daily.<br />Overall, a useful item and it does appear to be durable. Time will tell.",49828,146

I couldn't find out a lot of detail about what they were, but didn't feel plastic. The moisturizer is lightweight enough for day but effective enough for night; nothing dramatically anti-aging or anything, but a good quality standard everyday moisturizer. The packaging & instructions assumed I should already know what to do with ""cleansing oil"" and ""facial oil"" packets & what the difference is supposed to be.",51606,2375
4.0,1593714481649,Much easier than glue,"This was my first attempt at using magnetic lashes; there's a small learning curve but oh my gosh - SO MUCH EASIER than the old eyelash glue that comes in a separate tube! They're very comfortable; like any false lashes they feel weird at first but after about 15 minutes I forgot they were there & wore them all day with no issues. They stay where you put them, they DO NOT budge until you pull them off. No glue melting or flaking off into my eyes, obviously that's a big benefit! They look super dramatic with pretty minimal effort.<br /><br />I'm a little confused as to why it's best to apply the lashes when the eyeliner is half-dry but still tacky; is there glue built in to the liner as well as magnets? If you need to reposition them, you have to reapply the eyeliner because the lashes pull some of it off. The eyeliner is very wet when you apply, so be careful - you have to shake the tube before application, and when I pulled the brush out, it spewed eyeliner onto the wall (and it was not super easy to remove). So that's the learning curve part, now that I know I'll avoid those pitfalls.<br /><br />The one unavoidable pitfall is that it is INCREDIBLY difficult to remove. I used 3 different types of makeup remover & still needed to scrub my eyelids for a good 10 minutes to get all of it. Not great for the eyelid wrinkle situation! I slathered on a lot of pampering eye cream afterward because my lids were a little sore. I guess I'm glad it won't wear off halfway through the day, but geez!<br /><br />Anyway, despite the difficulty removing it, I'm pretty smitten. I used to love wearing false lashes but they were just so much trouble that I gave it up a few years ago. Now I love them again & they're easy!! I want to order all the lashes!",51606,2362

This does seem to help a bit, I notice in particular that my cheek color stays on much better. When I don't use a primer, it's like my skin drinks it up within just a few hours. So it definitely helps with that.<br /><br />I really don't see any change in the texture of my skin when I use it, no minimizing of lines or pores or anything like that. I was kind of hoping a nice little mist of vitamins might help (& feel good) even when I'm not wearing makeup, but to be honest it doesn't really feel much different. I tried for a few days & then I kept forgetting all about it - that's how dramatic the difference...wasn't. I'll still keep using it under makeup for performances, when I really need that stuff to stay put, but I probably won't rush to buy it again after I run out.",51606,4074

5.0,1547247024083,This flat iron is MAGIC!!,"As you can see, my “before” hair is very badly damaged: drugstore dye every 3 weeks, regular exposure to the AZ sun/heat & pool chlorine, plus I haven’t gotten a haircut in nearly 2 years so my split ends have split ends. Yet this little flat iron somehow makes my abused, frizzed-out hair look smooth, shiny, and healthy! It also feels very soft, with nice movement & body. The photos have not been edited aside from brightening up my bad bathroom lighting, and I did not use any oils, sprays, or other product in my hair after the usual shampoo & conditioner. It took me approximately 6 minutes to style, not including time for the iron to heat up (it’s pretty fast, I just didn’t time it).<br /><br />I dare say it might even work better than the $129 “professional” flat iron I got at a beauty supply store, though my old iron has been with me for 12 years so it definitely has some wear & tear. Still, it’s pretty impressive considering the very reasonable price for this one! The only minor drawback is the awkward control buttons, which are inside the handle & close to the hot plates, though I have not burned myself using them (yet). They’re also a little confusing and I have no idea what the strip of “infrared” lighting inside one plate is supposed to accomplish. So, I sought out the enclosed instructions and found this paragraph (verbatim):<br /><br />“Amino-bond is produced with the photosynthesis of ambipolar light of 68000Hz(wave length 680nm) and the elemental amino acid made up of the horny layer of hair so that the hair fiber and its elasticity will be restored, the hair squama gap will be densified again and the cellularity and squama gap will be restored.”<br /><br />Sooo...yeah. No idea what any of that means! But I really can’t argue with results. You definitely will not find a better flat iron at this price point. I’d give it 10 stars if I could!",51606,260

Basically you work it by clamping the very end of a streak of hair, then pressing one of the arrow buttons to tell the barrel which direction to rotate. It rotates, picking up your hair as it goes. After a few seconds, just let go of the clamp and you have a curl! Brush it through and you'll get the results in the photo. There really wasn't any kind of kink in the end of my hair either as sometimes happens with clamps (as long as you don't rotate the barrel the wrong way from how you clamped it). One nice thing is that there’s a “home” button for when you rotate the barrel too far from where your thumb is to unclamp the strand - you can see it in the video where it kind of rotates back real quick to line up the clamp release with my thumb. All in all it was really quick, less than 15 minutes to figure the thing out and curl my full head of hair!",53567,3574
5.0,1562558147936,Great toothbrush set!,"This set has everything you need for an electric toothbrush. In total it includes 6 brush heads (in the photo, one was still in the box), a charger, a case to hold the toothbrush and two brush heads for traveling, and the toothbrush itself with 5 distinct modes. Really you can think of it as having 15 modes because each mode can be on high, medium, or low intensity. The instruction manual describes each of the modes - they vary in rhythm and power. I used one of the weaker settings as the manual suggested because this is my first time using an electric toothbrush, which was the perfect amount of power for me! Have to mention that when this touches your lips by accident it tickles like I have never been tickled before, but I think that is to be expected from any electric toothbrush and just takes some getting used to. Overall, 5 stars - the color is also super cute, and you can't beat the very sturdy travel case! Just wish it had a compartment for the charger. Also impressed with its ability to hold a charge!",53567,96
5.0,1562352855964,Works great!,"This is the first UV/LED gel nail polish lamp I've ever tried, but it's been amazing so far! It seems pretty standard, it has options for timing from 10 seconds to 120. The best thing about it is that you can set the setting, and it will remember the setting and turn on when you put your hand in via motion sensors! That's super convenient when you have one or both hands covered in wet polish! It plugs into the wall and has a cord that I've found to definitely be long enough, and it's great that you don't have to rely on batteries for it. 5 stars!",53567,1588

I have been using this Murad Intense Recovery Cream for several nights now.  For me, this thick cream is almost like a balm (though it is definitely a cream), and the scent is light and pleasant.<br /><br />I am using this to soak into my skin (face and neck) overnight, and it works great for that.  I prefer using a serum on my eye area.  Even though I have dry skin, it's a little too heavy for day time use (if I'm wearing makeup).  The five stars is for how well it works for taking care of this particular need of overnight hydration.  I have have used several Murad products over the years, and this is in line with their other high-quality products.",53782,1542
5.0,1608512036299,Helpful for Onycholysis,"I had a bad big toe infection.  Finally, a new toenail is growing in as the rather odd and thickened one grows out.  It's pretty miraculous!  As part of my self-care, I have been soaking my foot once a day; I have been using this product for about a week now.<br /><br />My primary concern is to avoid fungal growth as my toe continues to heal, especially under the old nail that is still growing out.  I find that using a half-gallon of water with about 3/4 tablespoon of product (half the water and product recommended) works fine for me, as I'm just soaking one foot in a small tub.  The scent is citrus; I am scent-sensitive, and it is a bit strong to me.  I think it would be great for someone dealing with foot odor.<br /><br />It's really important to thoroughly dry the foot afterward;  I dab it with a towel and then run a small fan next to my foot till it's completely dry.  This product has tea tree oil in it, which is an excellent antiseptic.  I am looking forward to having a healed toe and a re-grown toenail by next April or May.... Yes, it takes a long time for a toenail to grown back.  I am grateful that this product is helping me get there!",53782,885

Some people say the scent is strong -- but to me (with a sensitive nose), it is quite mild and rather earthy and herbal, rather than flowery.  It didn't seem to leave build-up on my hair.

To me, the eye cream is outstanding -- very moisturizing and soothing, with almost no scent.  I also really like the moisturizing sorbet.  The radiance serum is nice, too, but the size is deceiving, as it actually only contains .33 ounce (as stated on the tube).  So, it feels like the tube is only about 1/2 full. The only product I didn't care for is the ""beauty elixer,"" which is a spray. It is a little sticky and the scent is strong (to me personally, it smells a little like natural bug repellent), too strong to spray on my face.<br /><br />But everyone's tastes are different!

It is a wonderful anti aging serum.  At first I was surprised by the smell.  It’s kind of a plain Listerine Mouthwash smell (the gold color Listerine.)  However, the first time I tried this Serum, I was totally hooked and now I absolutely love this smell, so clean!  After using this product I don’t want to use any other product on my face.  It cleared up my facial redness and gave me such a clear, clean complexion, shrinking my pores and softening my fine lines.  This stuff really lives up to its name of Liquid Gold.

First time I ever used magnetic lashes it took me a few tries, after that, I was good to go. Takes hardly no time and the liner dries quick so I don’t even wait to put lashes on. It still is good enough to wipe off when you don’t get it on even if you work right away. As far as lashes, you can take them off and reposition them. If they are too long for you, just trim the ends a little and they are perfect. I reuse mine quite a few times. You can wash them after each use with shampoo. Sometimes I’m lazy and use liquid hand soap. At first I was just pulling them off. But the best way to get off is liquid makeup remover. All you have to do is take a swab soaked in it and rub along lashes and they fall right off! It’s like magic. As far as wearing them, they last my whole 12 hour shift at work.

The roller is made from real volcanic stone and does absorb the excess oil on my skin without messing up my makeup at all.  (The roller turns darker and you can see that it’s absorbing the oil.)  very simple to use and easy to take to work so you can freshen up your face in the restroom.

I still prefer a higher wattage. But even after doing any nails, they are a tad tacky. This is because with gel polish, one must take a wipe or cotton ball with your acetone, or I prefer alcohol. And wipe over nails gently. This is the very last step after top coat and curing. This takes the tackiness away. Won’t mess up polish either. I wish the bottles showed color on them.

But for the face, they are so smooth and I find it takes less of this as it does other brands. The opening is wonderful and has perfect amount of holes to let powder come through. Even has a small sponge applicator that has a little finger strap. I use this and like it better than brush. They last all 12 hours of my shift without getting a shiny oily face. Even with wearing a mask the whole time. The container is gorgeous and I love the square design. So what’s the catch? I feel like I have discovered gold. I mean look at the price?! How could it be possible to get so much powder at such a ridiculously low price and it be a high end quality? Thank you to the makers for keeping the customer in mind. Very affordable.

Not in a bad way. But the razor shaved nicely. I’ve used it about five times and the lubricant is still on there! It’s almost like a person wouldn’t need shaving cream!

It doesn’t take much. As far as the whitens, don’t let this deter you. I was skeptical at first. It doesn’t really make your face look white. It brightens like a healthy glow.

And it’s not just on the surface or skin. It’s mostly inside where fat is lol. It has to be doing something. No pain, no gain right? But I just can’t take it. I think because I have fibromyalgia and connective tissue disease. Maybe in winter because it would for sure warm you up. So if you can stand the heat and burn, I would recommend it. It literally feels like it’s melting away any fat. I may try it again some day.",55127,30720

5.0,1620372579752,Excellent magnetic lashes!,"I love these. I like that they are mink. And I especially like how they have the little case with a mirror. That’s impossible to find. They work great and stay on my whole 12 hour shift. They are waterproof and you can’t scrub off with just water, not that a person would try. Cold cream works ok. But if you get some lash cleaner or makeup remover and apply to the end of a cotton swab and gently rub along lash, they practically fall off in seconds. At first, I was peeling them off because I thought since it’s magnetic that’s all that’s sticking. But then it’s hard to get the eyeliner off. After using a remover it’s much better. Don’t worry if you have trouble using liquid eyeliner. I promise after practicing a time or two, it will work perfect. If you get out of line, very quickly wipe off excess. It dries quickly. If it takes longer to put them on after applying liner, it will probably still work good. If you put lashes on sooner than you are supposed to and it’s not dried as well as it should be, it still works. It’s just a little messier for the lashes after removing them. I’ve learned to also use my lash remover or makeup remover to clean my lashes afterwards. They will have some liner dried to them and this builds up. I put them in my palm and squirt some on and gently rub with my finger or a swab. I don’t take much effort but get some of it off pretty good. They last me a good 5 or more times depending on how bad I bend them putting on lol. That’s another thing, you don’t have to have a real steady hand to apply them. I use my fingers instead of the holder thing. I normally start in the center but sometimes on the inside. You can adjust them if they are too long on one side. You can also trim them. Please don’t do this while they are on lol. I tried this and cut too much off. I was lazy lol. Most the time I have mine bent good to put on. Well, I should say curved instead of bent lol. They aren’t as fragile as they would seem. I love them. Only thing that worries me, if you ever are in an accident with them on and they take you for an MRI , I worry my eyelids will pull off because of the magnetic particles lol. It’s not funny but something to think about. Surely they would wash them off first. Don’t think about it. Try them. After all, beauty comes at a price lol.",55127,825

At first, when applying it, it seems thick. But it quickly absorbs. Right away actually. It doesn’t have a strong scent. My skin feels great the next day when I wake up.

Also, I’m not good at applying liquid eyeshadow. But let me tell you, I applied this with the applicator. It’s a sponge tip like will come in lipstick or lip gloss. Then I sort of blended it in just a little with my finger. It dries on and stays the whole work night 12 hours. It’s great. It feels a little like when something liquid would dry on skin but not bad and doesn’t show wrinkles. It may be for younger people but this 50 year old loves it.

5.0,1604908215837,Beyond my expectations,"So even though I used to do hair and should know about magnetic eyelashes, I didn’t and I was SO skeptical. I finally decided to try them. These things exceeded my expectations by far! The first time I chose the not so dramatic ones but they were thicker than my own. They did great. They were only a tad heavy. They stayed on 8 hours but I took the eyeliner with me to work and touched them up. I honestly think they would’ve stayed on longer if I hadn’t have forgotten and put regular eyeliner on first out of habit. I do wish this came in another color besides black as I have blonde hair and it’s dramatic. But once I wore them a while I realized it looked good. After work, I removed them easily. My eyes were itchy a little but when I woke up that evening they were back to normal. Another reason I think they didn’t stay on 12 hours was instead of following directions, I read somewhere that a person put the eyeliner on the the lashes while still wet and it worked better. The next night I followed directions. Put a coat on let dry then add another coat. Honestly, it pretty much dries by the time you finish both eyes. Don’t forget to shake it up though. They were very easy and quick to do. The only real time it takes is deciding which ones to use as there are so many nice selections. I realized the ones I thought were too dramatic when choosing actually look the best. I’ve gotten o many complements. And this time they stayed on all night. I think I could sleep in them and they would stay on. I wouldn’t though. The corners might poke your skin on inner eye when you close them but this can be remedied by snipping a tad off with scissors once you try them on and see how they do. I didn’t have to trim mine. Also, I had put a pair on and decided I liked the longer ones better so I took off the first ones and applied the others. I never redid the eyeliner. They still worked and stayed on. There’s magnet particles on eyeliner and the lashes are on a magnet strip. They are easy to remove but stay on like they are real. That sounds crazy. I didn’t want to ruin my own lashes with the glue kind plus I can’t get them on good enough without adjusting them. These you can take off and adjust. This gave me confidence I lacked in doing this. Plus, my hands aren’t that steady. When removing, start at corner and peel off. They won’t hurt your lashes. To remove eyeliner I used cold cream. It worked well. Just water doesn’t work. It is waterproof very much so. So cry all you want with these lashes ladies. You won’t have to worry about them falling off. One last thing, my skin is sensitive but they haven’t really bothered me so that is a big plus.",55127,2289

This wasn't completely clear on the product page, so I want to make note of it. Basically, the mister is a nice thing you can use to cool down and refresh your skin on the go.<br />- Packaging suggests two different types of water for the steamer and mister respectively.<br />  - steamer = distilled water<br />  - mister = mineral water<br />- The steamer's cord is about 2.5 feet long, which is something you will want to consider when decided where you will be most likely to use the steamer.<br />- The little extras like the headband with ears and the pore clearing tools make this a great gift to give someone who enjoys getting and giving facials.<br />- The manufacturer warns that acne which is hormonal in nature will not respond to the steamer<br />- The instructions also advise you not to use the steamer everyday, nor more than 10 minutes at a time. Accordingly, this is not something that is likely to add a lot of time to your daily routine, but rather something you will use once or twice a week.<br />- The steamer itself is cute and compact, so you're not giving up a huge amount of space if you get one, nor do you necessarily have to hide it in between uses, unless you want to.<br />- The steam produced is hot/warm and there is no way to control the temperature; however, you can easily regulate how you experience the heat simply by adjusting the proximity of your face to the steamer.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this facial steamer set as a purchase for yourself or as a gift for someone else who enjoys giving/getting spa treatments at home.<br />I personally like the effect it had on my skin; I felt as though using it has helped with both the cleansing and hydration of my skin.<br />Once you get through all the instructions, procure the right type of water for your steamer, and identify where you want to set it up, you will be rewarded with an easy to use machine that produces copious amounts of steam very rapidly",57381,3583

5.0,1621145702465,Very gentle and leaves my skin feeling really smooth,"This is very soothing and makes my skin feel smoother instantly after using it. Within a few seconds I can feel it clearing up my pores. This stuff is great! No strong fragrances or anything. I have very sensitive skin and this worked out perfectly for that, no irritation at all! Love this stuff! This big bottle will last me forever too.",60590,989
4.0,1620120295336,Pretty moisturizing conditioner!,"This conditioner isn't thick at all, it's more on the watery side. That being said, I cover my hair in it after I shampoo and then wash my body an rinse the conditioner out at this point. My hair comes out very moisturized! I love the metal bottle it comes in too, very fancy feeling. Overall this is a great bottle of conditioner and I definitely recommend it!",60590,32618
5.0,1610316533669,Amazing little bottles!!,My favorite feature on these is the ability to choose lids! I love this because I have some of that vodka smelling liquid sanitizer and I can put that in these and put the spray lid on. I can use the others and put gel in them and put the other pop-top lid on there. Very versatile little bottles!<br /><br />Good quality materials! I absolutely love these little bottles!,60590,1982
4.0,1669127016911,Worked fine,"I was going to use these for Halloween to greet trick or treaters (muah ha haa) but I got lazy and did not end up wearing one. I did apply one just to write this review and it applied the same as any temporary tattoo with water. I first applied lipstick and put the back of the tattoo on my mouth so I could see where my lips would need to open. Then I cut out a little piece for my mouth and that worked well when applying the tattoo. But honestly, they should have thought of that when selling tattoos that go over your mouth. You have to somehow find a way to create an opening for your lips. So, based on the hassle of creating my own opening, I don't think I would order these again. However, overall these tattoos work just fine.",60707,16281
3.0,1651609476132,I really don't like this,"For $40, this is a ""luxury"" price point. I do not notice a difference between using this primer and not using this primer. I think my makeup looks the same and the longevity is the same. I hate the texture of this primer. It's like a whipped gel and I do not think it it applies smoothly. It feels like it ""catches"" on the skin during application. For this price, I feel like the primer should wow me. This is a $10-15 primer, not $40. On a positive note, it is packaged nicely.",60707,14023
3.0,1607210331221,I did not like it.,"I did not like this product.  It's VERY thick and hard to squeeze out in the shower.  The cherry blossom smell I received was not pleasant and smelled more plasticy than fresh or sweet.  The product has the very strange greasy feel left on your skin.  Not oily like a nice body oil, but greasy like butter.  The polish is a nice abrasive texture on the skin, but the thickness, terrible smell and the greasy feel outweigh the polish.  I won't use this product twice and I won't order a different smell.  I just really didn't like it.",60707,2194
3.0,1602873768932,Not impressed,"These took 3 coats to decrease the blotchiness of the first 2 coats, but did eventually go on smooth and blemish-free.  The colors are natural looking and pretty, but my manicure chipped after the 3rd day and I had to remove all the polish.  Defeats the purpose of a ""gel"" manicure if you have to take it off after 3 days.",60707,10017
3.0,1567229423882,It's just ok,I was really excited to receive this product because I thought I might find an easier alternative to blowdrying and flat-ironing my hair.  This brush styler is extremely thick and awkward to hold in my opinion. It has a lot of weight and bulk to manipulate while you are styling your hair.  The buttons are at a weird position making it hard to change the heat levels unless you stop what you are doing and actually move your hand to look at the buttons.  I thought it felt a lot hotter than my hair dryer with less options to reduce the heat.  I liked it better without the brush rotating but felt like it actually took a lot longer to dry with this styler than my blowdryer.  I received a compliment that my hair had more body today but I felt like it was more frizzy than usual.  I like my hair better when I flat-iron it and today I just felt like I had poofy 90's Jennifer Aniston hair.  I'm just not thrilled with this device.,60707,3587
5.0,1566102435698,Sturdy but thin flossers,"These flossers are not ""waxed"" but have a thin floss that does a nice job of getting between the teeth.  It is a sturdy flosser and did not get ""stuck"" in my teeth nor did it break when pulled on.  I definitely recommend these flossers.",60707,1996
4.0,1631922187309,Small bottle but works well,"The body wash is a little bit thicker, probably due to the moisturizing feature, so even though it’s a small bottle, I’m able to get a lot of use out of it. The scent is nothing out of the ordinary, it smells like your average white bar of soap, nothing fancy. Suds well when used with a loofa",62607,2901
5.0,1621218605647,Good for legs,"This wax is elastic and covers large areas well. I have dark course hair, and this worked great on my legs. My skin is generally more on the sensitive side, but I had no irritation from this wax.",62607,8116
4.0,1573313930952,Great hold without the crunch,"I have medium thickness curly hair that is very frizz prone in humid weather, so a shaping spray is a must for me on those humid days. Since I have curly hair, I avoid any products with sulfates to prevent dry hair, so I’m very happy this product is sulfate free. It has a nice scent and does a great job preventing frizz. What I like most is that it doesn’t change the texture of my hair too much- none of that crunchy hair spray feel. It also has a nice scent, but it’s not too strong or overpowering. However, for the price point, I’m not sure I could justify continued use of this product.",62607,1586
3.0,1561248961174,"Comfortable, but loose fitting","These headphones have really decent quality for some budget headphones. The sound is pretty clear coming through and the ear pieces are super cushy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, where these headphones fall short for me is the fit. They don’t fit snug at all, it’s almost as if the ear pieces just hang off the top of my ears. It’s definitely usable, but loose fitting in my opinion.<br /><br />Other than that, they are pretty monster headphones, so just be sure you’re ready to be wearing size huge. I honestly wouldn’t have a problem with the size of the headphones if they fit better. I’m too afraid to make sudden movements because they feel like they will slip off.",62607,2139

She prefers a good old fashion rubber band for ponytails.",65251,445
4.0,1624334609707,Nice exfoliating bar!,"Finally got around to using this bar and I'm glad I did.  It's kind of a small bar, but it's not super lathery, so I suspect will last a while.<br /><br />It's most definitely an exfoliating bar, so use it with some care or you might scuff your skin up a bit.<br /><br />I like the aroma and exfoliation.  I would definitely buy this one again.",65251,134
5.0,1616311642116,Perfect size for cleaning solution,"These bottles are wonderful! Nice and smooth, fit perfectly in the hand, and are a great size and not too heavy to hold. The bottles are easy to clean. Nozzles can be disappointing especially when ordering online but I was so pleased that this nozzle sprayed nicely!  Sprays nice and and evenly. I make my own cleaning solution and keep it in these brown bottles to keep the essential oils fresh and potent. Have been very happy with these and use them  all over my house!",65251,234

I've always keep a few days growth, but I finally cut loose and embrace my inner Moses.<br /><br />A few months into it, I realized a needed something more than a basic shampoo or soap for my beard.  I was pleased to try Mr. Pristine's beard shampoo and so far I've been pleased with the results.<br /><br />First of all, it smells great.  None of the scents are overwhelming or powerful.  The faint mint is nice and refreshing.  Secondly, the lather is fine.  I noticed that if I apply some to my hair and work a lather, it's nice and frothy.  I then apply to my beard and give it a good cleaning.  If I apply the shampoo directly to my beard, the later is noticeably less frothy.  I don't know why this is.<br /><br />At any rate, it's been working well for me and leaves me feeling nice and crisp after a shower.  My only misgiving is the price, which is a bit steep for what you get, in my opinion.",65251,23298
2.0,1538588116521,"Too much packaging, gave me breakouts","I wanted to love this cleanser, but my first disappointment was the giant box it was wrapped in. It's seemed to be like unwrapping an onion, with a box, then a smaller box, and paper. The bottle is wrapped in tissue paper and unfortunately the cleanser had leaked all over the paper and turned it a dark yellow color. This is a foaming cleanser and when mixed with water, the consistency is rather thick. I suffered from breakouts all over my forehead during the week or two using this cleanser which is a very unusual spot for me to break out. I had some other treatments affecting my hormones at the same time, so I can't say for certain that my skin condition was due to this product alone, but it certainly didn't help. When I switched to using Cetaphil cleanser, the breakouts cleared up almost immediately. Unfortunately this was a pass for me.",65251,1967
5.0,1665690536841,Nice Shape,I have received a lot of compliments with these eyelashes. They are not overly big and have a nice shape and size.

5.0,1659004394898,Cool Chrome Effects On Nails,I didn’t know what to expect from this product but I must say it really does deliver a cool chrome effect that can be incorporated with your nail design. It’s at a great price and has a variety of colors you can choose from.

5.0,1657550472772,Great For Duo Forms,"This hard gel/poly gel is great to use, especially when I don’t want to use duo forms. Lately I’ve been attaching shaped nail tips (like coffin or stilettos) and just adding hard gel over them instead of acrylic. This product has worked well for that purpose because it allows you to manipulate and shape the gel adequately over the tips at your own pace. Good buy!<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review and photos of this product.  I hope it has been helpful in providing you with more information.",66101,2825

I hope it has been helpful in providing you with more information.",66101,2488
5.0,1648058341750,Oil Free Sunscreen,I use this sunscreen when I go out walking during my 1.5 hour exercise routine and it is sweat resistant and oil free.

5.0,1648041667568,Great Selection of Reds,"This small set is perfect to add more shades of reds to your collection of gel polishes. Two coats and the color looks rich and vibrant. I also appreciate that it comes with glossy and matte top coats to change it up. I cure the base, color and top coats for 60 seconds each in my UV/LED lamp and it’s lasted for a week without chipping.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read my review and photos of this product.  I hope it has been helpful in providing you with more information.",66101,12600

I hope it has been helpful in providing you with more information.",66101,30709
5.0,1606153023479,Worked perfectly,Got these to use with a poly gel nail kit. Worked really well and did what it was supposed to do. The plastic is nice and thick and doesn’t squeeze your finger too hard. These hold the nail form in place while working on your other fingers and while you cure them in the LED light. Very happy with these little clips.,67445,2196
5.0,1605716461292,Cute set great for adding some fun to your style,Really like this set. I never do anything with my hair so these are an easy way to add a touch of pizzazz! I like that there a bunch of different ones that you can create different looks with. The quality is okay but for the amount that I’ll use them it shouldn’t be an issue.,67445,18747
4.0,1604445185142,Fun and sassy,These are fun and cute I love how sparkly the beads are! If your looking for something to hold your hair tight back these aren’t it. They are pretty loose and have no comb- which is good if your looking for something that doesn’t squeeze your head. I wish they were a little tighter I feel like I’ll have to readjust it a bit during a full day of wearing. I love that they will add a little pizzazz to my hair!,67445,761
2.0,1604173186598,Glue was all dry upon arrival,Really bummed about these lashes. The kit comes with 3 tubes of lash glue and it’s a good thing that it does because 2 of the tubes were super dry and didn’t allow the lashes to adhere at all. The 3rd tube doesn’t really have much juice in it though either after applying the 2 lashes to my eyes there is like hardly any left in the tube. The lashes themselves are really thick and nice looking. Not sure if I’ll be able to reuse them or not. I’ll definitely have to order more lash glue to even be able to use all the other lashes. Once on they are really pretty and I suck at putting lashes on so I’m glad it wasn’t a total flop.,67445,2289
5.0,1667485486951,Excellent Clips,"These hair clips work very well for medium to long length hair. They don't pull, itch, or slide like some of my other clips do. I like the color assortment, as it matches virtually any outfit I wear. Overall great quality and price!",67474,11338
5.0,1647370353712,Works Well,"Great for holding numerous types of massage oils. Warms up nicely, and overall a good product.",67474,27906

5.0,1632334466688,Works well,"These foot peel masks are great to use to help soften up neglected feet. In the spring and summer months, I neglect my feet and often times walk around outside without shoes. This causes the skin to become rough and tough. Great for being barefoot, not so great for playing footsie with your husband. These masks do a great job at softening up that dead callused skin and helps bring it back where it needs to be. Highly recommended.",67474,19874
5.0,1626465531580,Super fun!,"I never thought about needing portable hand soaps, but these are great for traveling! Lots of variety when it comes to scent, comes in a convenient little tin for carrying, and overall a great buy! Super helpful for camping trips!",67474,207

5.0,1621356187534,Excellent waxing beads,"These hard wax beads work well with at home warmers. These are specifically slated for leg hair removal, although I suppose you could use it on other areas.

4.0,1619467157224,Pretty Good,"These 18 inch human hair extensions are easy to apply, are pretty unnoticeable once in, and look pretty good.

5.0,1615921592486,Silky Smooth,"I haven't had a hair cut in over 2 years. Its kind of crazy, but between going through IVF treatments, a pregnancy that we were on pins and needles about, and then COVID hitting, I haven't had my hair colored or been inside of a salon since January 2019. Now that I have a 13 month old, finding time by myself to go is nearly impossible.<br /><br />With that said, my hair is crazy long and healthy. But going through postpartum, I ended up with some hair loss that is now in the process of growing back. I used to love getting Keratin treatments in the salon because it always made my hair feel so good, look super shiny and healthy, and just overall made me feel good. I was anxious to try this at home Keratin system to see if I could get similar results, and much to my surprise, I did! Not only is it easy to do, but my hair looks, and feels so much healthier! It really did wonders on smoothing out some of the frizzy dead ends that need trimmed, and created a sort of gloss look overtop my hair. It brightened up my naturally dark ashy hair color, and was just what I was looking for.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for anyone with long hair looking to revitalize your long locks!",67474,12
4.0,1613679278001,Nice Falsies!,"So overall as far as false eyelashes go, these are pretty good.<br /><br />Magnetic lashes have become sort of a craze here in the last year or so, and I can see understandably why. The key however to applying them is to make sure you have a quality magnetic liner for application, and patience.<br /><br />I'm not huge on wearing false eyelashes or makeup on a regular basis, however for things such as family photos and an occasional date night out, it can be fun to get dressed up and feel a little ""extra"".<br /><br />The lashes themselves are really good quality, the liquid eyeliner goes on pretty well, but my only beef is that it can be sometimes difficult to get the magnet part to stick. But once it does, they look fairly natural.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend people to give these a try. They are priced well for having 6 pairs, can be reused, and the set contains everything you need to try them out. Overall, recommended.",67474,825
5.0,1611261140400,Large and durable,"These amber glass spray bottles are perfect for using around the house. Currently I have one for a mixture of house cleaning products with some essential oils mixed in, as well as water in one to take care of several house plants. These would be useful for a wide variety of things including beauty care, cleaning, and watering plants. Because they are glass, they have a comfortable weight to them, much better than cheap plastic. The sprayers all worked easily and didn't leak, and it was easy to control the type of spray output. Very happy with their quality.",67474,234

She loves doing her nails and makeup, so when I saw this kit I knew it would be the perfect item for her to try out while over at our house. She was so excited when she saw it, and immediately wanted to try it out. Upon opening up the box, there were a ton of nail polish colors to choose from, several nail embellishment options, and even a ""salon"" dryer for her to use. Best of all, it was easy for her to pick off and did not damage her nails! Highly recommended as this is a great kit for kids!",67474,842
5.0,1610384606444,Great DIY kit,"As someone who has been doing at home manicures for several years and trying out several different types of products ranging from acrylics, gel polish, powder dips, and now polygel. Poly Gel nails remind me a lot of acrylics, but are a little bit easier to apply, and you can get good length without having to use artificial tips. I was worried not using tips would make them more prone to breaking but so far I have not had that issue.<br /><br />Using the liquids and the nail shapers, its actually quite easy to put on. I've had relatively good luck getting them to last about the same length of time as acrylics, roughly 2 weeks. This set has some nice color options and seems to be high quality. Overall I'd recommend to anyone wanting fancy nails but to save some money, to definitely try at home manicures at home, using this set is a great place to start. Its important to know though that you need a UV light which is not included with this kit. Regardless, I still recommend it!",67474,1546
5.0,1610382906202,Works well,"It's been a long time since I used a curling iron but I decided to give this one a try and see if it helps change up my look while not adding a bunch of extra time to my day. Much to my surprise, it took about the same amount of time to spiral curl my hair as what it does to straighten it. It heats up really nicely, does not pull out pieces of my hair, and did not make it frizzy. I like the barrel size because it doesn't give me those tight ""poodle"" curls, and leaves a soft wavy flow behind (I have super long hair). Overall for the price this is an excellent value, especially if you are just looking for a tool to occasionally change up your look. Very happy with its quality and the end result.",67474,2158
5.0,1609184111997,Very nice kit,"This eye lash lift kit is perfect for DIY lash lifts at home without the need of going to a salon.

My sister LOVES these types of things at the holidays so if you have a family member or friend that likes to try out beauty products, this is an excellent option.<br /><br />Now as far as the masks themselves go, they stick on to your under eye area very well. I also like how they are cool and make my skin feel great. I did notice a difference in the amount of puffiness I had once taking them off. The little face massager roller thing is nice, it feels good on your skin. Although I'm not exactly certain of what the purpose behind using it is.<br /><br />Overall this is a great little set and I'd recommend it!",67474,15

4.0,1598985512093,Nice Kit,"Overall, this is a pretty decent kit if you want to forgo a trip to the salon. It has all of the products you need to complete your lash perm, however there is a bit of a learning curve to it. Once you get the hang of it however, it goes pretty smoothly. I myself have used several different kits, and this one ranks in my top 5. The results were pretty good and there was noticeable lifting of my lashes. I estimate I will be able to get roughly 3 perms out of this kit in total which is pretty good, especially considering the price. It says it can last upwards of 4 weeks, but I guess only time will tell how long the perm actually lasts. Regardless, you cant beat the price for an at home DIY.",67474,21230
5.0,1598386511721,Excellent value!,"Super cute set of headbands, very stretchy and stay on well.

Doesn’t have a rich smell to it, just a normal lotion like smell and it actually makes it great. It being so close to your nose, you don’t want something strongly scented anyway.

The box’s sides slide outward!! (This actually took me a bit to figure out on my own but mannnnnn was it worth it. It’s adorable!!) The box opens up to 4 sanitizers, all different colors, and a Mickey Mouse logo in the middle… so you know it’s real ;) They sanitizers are all spray, Each a different scent. (Lavender, citrus, aloe and unscented) and each are supposedly worth 500 sprays. I love these. The aesthetics, The style, the scent, THE MICKEY!! Just everything yes!! It is a little pricey but honestly, and I don’t say this much about beauty products let alone hand sanitizer, I’d spend the money for it. 500 sprays && Mickey???!! (Can you tell I’m a Mickey fan?)

It didn't seem to do anything but since the celebrities were raving about it I wanted to try it.  Fast forward to 2019 and now I get to try and stainless steel one and oh what a difference.  It takes getting used to (you have to relax your mouth to get all the way back there) but it really scrapes all of the gunk right off your tongue.  It makes you wonder what have you have been around with in your mouth all these years.  This set comes with four, so I've put one in my travel case to always have it with me, and gave two to my husband.",70583,2939
4.0,1564915854199,A fair diffuser,"I've been diffusing essential oils for almost 30 years, ever since I purchased my first diffuser from Whole Foods back in the 1980s.  This diffuser is not representative of the latest generation of diffusers, but it fits nicely within the last generation.  The latest generation of diffusers are not waterless, cordless (rechargeable) and portable.  I have both types of diffusers in my home and much prefer the latest gen.<br /><br />This is a nice diffuser but is slightly more expensive than it should be, even with the ceramic appointments.  Like all water diffusers you put water in the chamber with a few drops of oil and let it go.  The light is nice but doesn't serve much purpose other than to remind you that the unit is on when you cannot see the cold steam.  I'm not a fan of the whole thing being lit because it does cause me to take a second look if my eyes slightly open while I'm sleeping.  I prefer a thin band of light. Of course on this unit you can turn the light off.<br /><br />It doesn't come with any oil which is actually good.  I find that when an oil is included in with a diffuser it's often the cheapest brand around and smells awful.  It might be enough to turn a newbie off of diffusing if they don't know that high quality oils exist.  I recommend Plant Therapy.<br /><br />I don't buy into the claim that this can be used as a humidifier because the output is just not strong enough.  After shut-off there is always water still left in the chamber.  This is not a good thing because if you want to change oils, you have to diffuse water with vinegar for a couple of run-throughs and then wipe down the inside. Of course there is nothing wrong with left over oil if you don't mind a blend, but sometimes I want one pure smell for a specific purpose.",70583,2208
4.0,1544024775748,Leaves your dry hair nice and soft,"I'd never used TRESemme before.  I've been loyal to the Gold line of Patene products for many years, with sidetracks along the way for some specialty items like Miss Jessie.<br /><br />My hair is very dry Caribbean hair with a 4C curl.  To me basically all shampoos are relatively the same, with the exception of White Rain and Carol's Daughter that turned my hair into a solid block of concrete.  I can't speak for the whole line of TRESemme, but this Botanique line is rather nice.  I love the lather and it leaves my hair nice and soft.<br /><br />The conditioner is really great if you prefer to cowash your hair, which I do frequently.  I love that it has coconut oil because sometimes I give myself a pure coconut oil hair mask treatment and that is extremely messy.<br /><br />There is nothing outstanding and backflip worthy about this shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair nice and clean, soft and tangle free (but I do use a wide-tooth comb as I condition).  I would recommend it to a friend.",70583,150
3.0,1541539856136,It may work?,"I'm a lash-addict!  I have all the really nice mascaras (Chanel, Bobbi Brown, Dior) and for a year I got regular eye-lash extensions twice a month. I really wanted to like this but I can't.  I put it on morning and night for five days straight, and I always woke up (and spent the day) with itchy eyes.  I tried to convince myself that it was something in the air, but when I forgot to use it I was just fine.  So I stopped using it and I was just fine.<br /><br />However, I do believe in the concept.  My family in Jamaica swear by putting coconut (or castor) oil on the lashes daily to keep them supple.  When they're moisturized they don't fall off as fast, and putting on mascaras certainly aid in drying out the lashes.  I try the oil-on-the-lashes thing but I've made the decision to stop using this product.",70583,1095
3.0,1535721737194,Using this cleanser with Clarasonic,"For the price, I have to wonder why this item is not listed under Amazon's ""luxury beauty"" line.  Like many reviewers, I was put off by the sheer amount of packaging that came along with this item. It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't tout how conscious they were of environmental issues, but I've purchased Chanel with less packing, come on!<br /><br />All of the beauty and skin care products I consume are luxury, at the moment I've been using Dr. Gross's skin care line but until I could get back to Sephora, I've been using Purity cleanser.  I was hoping this product would be a suitable replacement but I'm not convinced so let me tell you about the photos.<br /><br />Each night I cleanse my face with Purity using Clarasonic's Uplift with the Revitalizing brush.  I follow this with micellar water (by Borghese) and then a serum and moisturizer.  The whole thing takes about 7 minutes (it's therapy, don't judge!).<br /><br />Upon waking, I swabbed my face with the micellar water and then took a picture of the cotton ball along with an untouched cotton ball for comparison.  And by the way for the uninitiated, micellar water is the best skincare product to come out since mascara was invented.  I was sure that my $349 Clarasonic erased all traces of dirt no matter the soap, but the micellar water never lies.<br /><br />On the second morning, first thing, I used the Clarasonic with the Radiance brush and three pumps of LaClaire Foaming Botanical Facial Cleanser.  Two pumps did not create a bit of lather.  Then using micellar water, I swabbed my face again and there you have the picture of both -- no cleanser and cleanser.<br /><br />You can see that there is still a lot of dirt left behind after using this cleanser, certainly less than no cleanser at all but there is still some there.  There is less dirt left after washing with Purity so I wouldn't call it a miracle cleanser, it's really just ""okay.""",70583,1967
3.0,1561921978190,"Is the the Hyaluronic acid that's doing something, or just the aloe?","Here's the real-talk on this: the first ingredient is aloe, and rubbing it on my face doesn't seem to have much of a discernible effect that's anything other than what I feel like I'd get from rubbing aloe vera gel on my face. Aloe is great, so that's cool... I'm just not sure why you wouldn't just buy a nice organic aloe gel instead.<br /><br />The moisturizing effect with this serum is very mild. It's not sticky or runny, but it's also not super moisturizing. I generally apply it, let it sink in, and then apply straight jojoba oil as my moisturizing. So, as far as effectiveness, I guess if you're super into hyaluronic acid and know it does something for your face, this stuff is probably great? For me, I saw no difference compared to straight aloe.",70711,1826

4.0,1604898243459,Comes Tangled,"I have mixed feelings about this hair.  The twists are beautiful!  This is made from a coarser hair texture so it isn't as soft as I expected Senegalese twists to be.  These are twisted tightly, so based off of the twists alone, I think you could be able to get away with using this hair more than once.  The con of this hair is that the ends come tangled.  I finger detangled this hair for 5 minutes, and yes it did get easier to run my fingers through, I never achieved a complete detangle of the hair.  I think this hair will be difficult to reuse solely off of this aspect of the style.  I think the ends of this hair may have to be combed out daily...maybe even more than one time a day, daily.  This style is very cute I'm just not sure how long it will last since the ends are tangled straight out of the package.  I still believe this hair is gorgeous and worth buying.",71969,36429

The cica pine water helps sooth and moisturize sensitive skin.  The color in the balm comes from calamine powder, which helps cover red areas of the skin.  It is a 100% vegan formula.  The balm comes in a compact with a puff applicator.  The puff is eco-friendly and anti-bacterial.  This is meant to be applied as the last step during the skincare routine and before you apply your makeup.<br /><br />Overall, I found this product easy to apply.  You dip the poof into the cream balm, and then apply it to the skin. It has an almost creamy texture on the skin, and absorbs in quickly.  It has a slight white cast when I used it but that went away as it absorbed in.  I was hoping to use this as a color corrective on red areas on my skin before I applied concealer (I currently do not use foundation).  Overall I think it is nice, but it really hasn't gotten rid of any redness on my skin.  I do like the way it feels though and I think it helps my makeup go on smoother, so I plan to keep using it.",74565,14017
4.0,1633747787469,"Look nice, bright colors","The colors in this kit are super vibrant, almost neon. I love how much they stand out! I have gotten a ton of compliments on them. The picture shows the matte topcoat which I am not sure you can really see well on such bright colors. I am excited about having the topcoat, but for darker colors where the matte would be better contrasted. The gel is not the longest lasting that I've had and I've noticed the matte top coat specifically burns a little on my nails when under UV light. The color will last about a week, though I have had a couple of fingers peel off before that.",74750,1125
3.0,1620702847441,Not for begginers,"Okay, so these are not the best for beginners. I am new to makeup and lashes and I struggled HARD with these. The liner is hard to control and leaks a bit. I have had it seep into the corners of my eyes multiple times and it stings a little bit. The eyelashes stick on well everywhere except for the inside of the eyelid. The last magnet often lifts upward right by the tear duct. It is really hard to keep the whole lash down. I have successfully applied them once. Really would not recommend for beginners.",74750,35207
3.0,1619844689539,"Gorgeous color, not a great part","I love the color and feel of this wig. It is vibrant, flowy, and truly makes me feel gorgeous. However, there is a distinct line across the middle part that I cannot pluck away so there is a clear line at the scalp separating the hair from the forehead. If I could just pluck the wig to have a better hairline, I would rate this higher.",74750,2309
5.0,1608601071025,Lightweight and so pretty!,"I had never crocheted hair in before these, but I had no issues! The hair came with a crochet tool and the loops were wide enough to work with, I only had to expand them a little bit when installing. It took me about 2 hours and all of the packs to do my hair and I love the result! They are much lighter than box braids and very low maintenance. I have gotten a ton of compliments about how they look! The hair also came with some little multi-colored hair jewels to spice up the twists, which was a nice little gift from the vendor!",74750,36429
5.0,1602456050467,Great braiding hair!,"This hair does not tangle much at all! It was great for making small box braids. I sealed the ends with boiling water which worked just fine. It took 2 rounds of dipping my hair in the water to seal them though. The hair is separated into bundles and separated with twist ties. I like the twist ties better than bundles that are separated with hair ties. The twist ties were easier to get off without tangling the hair. I used olive oil, edge control, and hair gel infused with castor oil to braid my hair. All of the products worked well with the hair. I would definitely get this again.",74750,37366
4.0,1599624791468,Great for box braids!,"I was a little worried because the packaging was ripped when it came. And this is the packaging that within the Amazon package. Luckily all 3 packs were there. I was also worried because the hair looked really plastic-y .Once I started using it though, it was really easy to work with! I ended up cutting the hair to make shorter box braids though because it was so long. I would recommend ordering 2 to cover your whole head. I needed 6 packs to do a full head of box braids.",74750,37367
3.0,1599617932243,Not long lasting,"The polygel is very sticky and hard to smooth out on the mold. I used nail polish remover in between nails to make it a little easier. Once the gel was finally applied, I was impressed, but the nails only lasted two days before falling off during daily activities like washing my hair and doing the dishes. And that was after I put dip powder on top of the polygel for color. Also note that this is only the gel, you have to order a mold separately to help put them on.",74750,11372
5.0,1597791354987,"Soft on skin, hard on makeup","This took off layers of foundation and contouring easily, but was soft on the skin while removing them. I like the loops on each pad because I can hook a finger through the loop to keep the pad in place while I wash my face.",74750,7607
4.0,1586548933480,"Decent Pillow, but may not be suitable for Deeper Tubs","I was concerned that this bath pillow wouldn’t attach properly to a deep oval claw-footed tub, but it worked out fine. The suction cups are sturdy and easy to adhere, and they stay secure. However, for a deep tub, the pillow may be a bit short and sits too high, which would probably make it more suitable for a standard-sized bathtub.<br /><br />The bottom part could be a little more padded, but the material is durable, waterproof, and fast-drying. It’s reasonably comfortable and of decent quality, for the price.",74842,1136
5.0,1580668471770,Very Soothing and Excellent for a Quick Pick-me-up!,"I’m loving Neogen products, and these pads are no exception. They’re perfect if you’re not into a big cleansing routine on a relaxed day, but you still want your face to feel clean and fresh. They’re soft and gentle, but they are very capable of exfoliation, depending on the amount of pressure you apply. Very easy to use, and they’re incredibly moist, leaving your face feeling clean, hydrated, and bright.<br /><br />These pads work well as a toner and are very soothing to slightly inflamed skin. There are 60 pads in the jar, and they appear to be larger than others I’ve tried. I think its good value for the current price of $22.00.",74842,747
5.0,1566922474717,Works Fast and the Scent doesn't knock you over...,"This nail polish remover works fast and leaves your nails looking and feeling good. It seems to remove more of the yellow that is sometimes left behind from polish, and my nails feel smooth and ready to paint.<br /><br />I’ve bought this jar/sponge type before as I hate using the bottled variety, but this one appears to have a more considerable amount of remover, and less sponge. It’s a good thing, as I think it works faster this way. Of course, it has a touch of chemical smell at first, but it’s not overbearing and dissipates quickly. And it actually leaves a pleasant scent behind (kind of smells like fresh soap.<br /><br />I like it a lot, and would definitely purchase this product in the future.",74842,9816

It’s almost like they sprout overnight!  These little razors are extremely sharp and will take care of all those errant little buggers. I haven’t tried them for my eyebrows yet but they’re smaller and thinner than the other brand I purchased and find them easier to maneuver. A shorter handle that gives me more control.<br /><br />They really do work well on my little Yorkies faces also. There are no English instructions on the package as it appears to be entirely in Chinese but it doesn’t take much to figure out. They’re sharp, but each one does have a heavy duty plastic guard that’s safely removed. Pretty nice product! Thank-you.",74842,750
4.0,1633559080429,Glides on smoothly and does a decent job on my skin.,"I have really oily skin, especially in my T-zone region. I normally rely on blotting paper but sometimes, I feel like it smudges my makeup or requires me to go through a couple of sheets before it gets the job done. I decided to give this product a try. I have seen an ad for something like this before from Revlon and have been meaning to get my hands on it. This set comes with 2 volcanic balls, a holder, drying mat and drawstring bag. The volcanic ball did a decent job of removing excess oil without ruining my makeup. It took a couple of tries in some areas versus others. I felt a slight cooling effect while using this. This glides smoothly on to the skin. It is very compact so you can take it wherever you go and it can be washed and reused.",75560,2900
5.0,1633043673779,Natural beige is still pretty light,This is a concealer in a cushion powder form. It comes in a compact with a magnetic closure and included sponge. It only comes in 2 colors: light beige and natural beige. I got the natural beige which is still on the lighter side and is best for fair to light complexions. This provides good coverage and blends easily. It applies like a liquid but dries like a powder.,75560,1680

There are 80 sheets in each pack. The sheets are thin and dissolve easily with water. It provides a good amount of lather and smells wonderful. I used the Jasmine & Patchouli scent today and it's pretty long lasting. My hands felt clean, soft, and moisturized afterwards. This set comes with a storage tin so it's perfect for traveling or camping.",75560,207
4.0,1623380130975,Nice combo set,"This combo set comes with 3 different “spa” treats:  a set of eye patches, feet masks and lip mask. It has a you need to pamper you’re self from head to toe. Here  are my 2 cents on each:<br /><br />Lip mask - it’s big and easily for around my entire mouth. Felt nice and moisturizing on my lips. Leaves you unable to talk for at least 20 min<br /><br />Feet mask - smells like eucalyptus… nice and cooling on my feet… there are tabs on the side to hold them in place. Feet felt so soft and moisturized after removal. There was no dry spot in sight. I rubbed the rest of the serum all over my legs.<br /><br />Eye patch - cool and soothing on my face… stays in place even with me moving around freely.",75560,12672
5.0,1621797998179,Beautiful pastel colors!,"This is a great set of 6 bright, pastel colored gel polishes. Each bottle has a sticker on top to mark the color, which is 100% accurate.

2.0,1629744909874,"It's okay, not my favorite","I have oily/combo skin and I am always on the hunt for some good powders. This powder is super finely milled, very soft, and great at setting my face makeup without making it more cakey. Bonus, there is no fragrance whatsoever (you would be surprised how many powders I have come across with a scent). However, this does not extend the longevity of my makeup wear. It did not hold back my oily complexion and it while it did make my skin look soft at the beginning of the day, by the end my skin looked a little more textured than it already does. So, I think for me, this powder is a no-go but someone else may have better luck with it.",75736,30715
2.0,1608581422782,Not really a fan,"I do not think I will continue to use this gadget. For one, like others have said, it is larger than it appears. It is kind of hard to get into my mouth and biting it is not really ergonomic. I followed the directions in the description and boiled it so that when I bit down, the clear bits became an impression of my teeth. However, I did not find that to be much help later on. I used this a couple of times and while I did find my jaw feeling sore afterwards, I do not feel comfortable using it for the long term. My jaw is not in good alignment (something I need surgery for but can't afford) so I got this with hopes that it could help support my jaw and keep it from getting worse. I also have a hard time with jaw discomfort from teeth grinding and my dentist said that exercises can help alleviate that issue. Due to the large size and ill-fit, I fear that it could do more damage to my jaw and bite than help. I think overall this is a lost cause for me but maybe someone else will have better luck.",75736,19174

It keeps your head and ears from getting burned, while it lets your hair glide through the hot slits of the comb. The hot comb can be used for people with any colored hair. I know because I tried it on my slightly wavy thin light colored hair, and to my amazement, it worked! It has a digital display and a 360 degree cord (it can spin in circles without tangling).

They are a hard clear plastic with a metal rod and a metal spring. Make sure when you get yours to check the back end to see if the springs are aligned in the slots. If not, slide them with a fingernail or tool until they go into the slot. The batch that I received have metal springs that barely make it into the slot, which makes the spring pop-out if I open the clips all the way. If the springs were long enough, these would get a 5 star rating from me. As they are, I cannot recommend them. However, I do like that they come individually wrapped so they could be gifted in sets of 5 or 10 and the receiver would know the clips are unused.",77160,2196

I wondered if they would look nice or if they would be too twisted to see the pearly beads on the outside. The result is that they look absolutely perfect!! You don't even have to do anything special to make them look nice. Just put it on as you normally would and the beads show well along with a nicely colored scrunchy hair tie! Good value!,77160,647

Each one is interchangeable when you get them. My pump straws were too long, so I put them in the taller bottles, and put the spray tops on the smaller bottles. The pumps have a neck brace so it can't be pushed down by accident. There is a little funnel, and three lids for the sprayers. However, I did measure the size of the larger bottle with liquid and it holds more than the 100 ml that they advertised (3.30oz). They actually holds about 4 ounces, so keep that in mind if you are limited on space when traveling. The pumps and sprayers work well - they will be used on a future vacation.",77160,1091

However, a little bit goes a long way if you’re just doing an overlay. If you’re doing a fullset, they are not going to last long . It was packaged really well. This is definitely something you would gift to someone.",79277,14006
5.0,1606019728447,Get it!!,This little lamp works really well when I say it works it really works. It dries my nails so quickly like it doesn’t need to even take the whole 30 seconds. This is really worth the cost. This is great for personal use or salon use. You can even remove the bottom part of the lamp in order to do is dry someone’s feet or a dry your hands if it’s being difficult. It was packaged really well. It didn’t take so long to dry the polygel also. This is a great gift to a nail tech.,79277,1549
5.0,1604882168249,Lashes are cute,[[VIDEOID:dc060bc6b210f7abc5be6abc299d2557]] Please lashes are super cute. They are really natural. The glue that come with the lashes is really good. The lashes are not too dramatic. They are really cute for a casual look or a work look. Worth the cost.,79277,33692
5.0,1604880239645,It really works,These facemasks are really good. It really soothe my skin. The mask makes my skin feel so soft. I did not feel any tingles from it. It did not leave any rashes or pumps I didn’t get any reaction from it.,79277,734
5.0,1604261058188,Super cute,[[VIDEOID:3de34f65c626f460a016d968e891ae30]] These headbands are super cute and they are super sturdy. None of the rhinestones fell off of it. They were well-made. They were packaged really well. They are really comfortable. The colors are really cute.,79277,761

2.0,1664459857423,Fun Idea - Just Not Practical,"What you get - 10 horror style mouth covering temporary tattoos<br /><br />Pros - the designs are fun and spooky - definitely fit the Halloween bill and look like they would be a great addition to many horror costumes.<br /><br />Cons - they have to go over your whole mouth which firstly makes it almost impossible to apply well (you know how temporary tattoos can be tricky - this is that but more so because it's over your mouth.  If by some miracle you DO manage to get it on and in a good placement you then can't move your mouth at all.  No talking, eating, or drinking.  I have seen suggestions about cutting a slit in the tattoo - but that just makes it move and fall apart so it's not worth it.<br /><br />Overall - you get 10 for a cheap price - probably better to put them in a separate area other than the mouth and go for a weird look rather than use it like a mask.",79290,16281
4.0,1658521449016,Party On People!,"What you get - A basically ready to go (just add jeans) Wayne's World Look including Waynes World Hat, Mullet Wig (with wig cap) inflatable guitar, and plain black T-Shirt.<br /><br />Pros - While noone even from a distance is going to think you suddenly became Wayne from Wayne's World - this is a fun costume and brings back a lot of fun memories.<br /><br />Cons - The wig is particularly cheap - but it goes under a cap so not a disaster.<br /><br />Overall - for the price you would be hard pressed to get all the pieces separately so for me that counts as a win.",79290,767
5.0,1657476768922,As A Costume Wig You Can't Fault It!,"So I wear and review a lot of wigs and I have started breaking the review down into sections that I think will be helpful.  Note this wig comes with Spider Clip (on large braid in picture), earrings, and a silver necklace (also pictured) - Not pictured - 2 clip in thin braids that I didn't use.<br /><br />Color - Purple and black - obviously supposed to be a Mary Sanderson look from Hocus Pocus (although hers is a little redder) - not named as such though probably for licensing reasons.<br /><br />Styling- This is a take out the bag and put on ready to go wig. There is an adjustable band at the back with minimal adjusment but it was enough to fit it securly.  The style is perfect and ready to go and needed next to no effort to make it look natural.<br /><br />Comfort - Fit well  and would easily be wearable all day. Super light as the cap is very airy because of the ready to go style.<br /><br />Overall - I LOVE this. I can't believe for a costume wig this would be so fabulous. It's instantly recognizable and the accessories were a bonus!",79290,4065
3.0,1655057852424,Convenient but I couldn't reuse them.,"What you get - 4 pairs of ready to wear lashes with adhesive strips already on them (Can be cut to size).<br /><br />Pros - no magnetic liner or glue to worry about. These do give a pretty decent effect although takes a little practice to get them on.<br /><br />Cons - I didn't feel they stayed on as well as magnetic lashes do. I wore them for an hour show and they barely stayed. When I removed them there was no way that I would be able to use them again. They just weren't sticky enough.<br /><br />Overall - might be OK for teens, or people that don't do well with magnetic liner oe eyelash glue but for me they weren't secure enough. For the price though it could be worth a try if you don't normally wear lashes and want them for a special event.",79290,2920
1.0,1652794728853,Did Not Work At All,"What you get - 2 10ml rollers with Vitamin C serum eye treament for men<br /><br />Pros - this is obviously designed with men in mind and it doesn't have any scent so my husband was happy to try it out.<br /><br />Cons - it did nothing even when used for a month. There was no cumulative improvement at all. It seems to be very watered down and you are paying for a lot of filler content and very little active ingredient which is probably why it didn't work.<br /><br />Overall it seems that you are definitely paying for the packaging and the ""male"" appeal. It's like the opposite of the pink tax.",79290,8697
4.0,1650636302421,Nice Gift Set!,"What You Get  -<br />12 oz Rose Gold ""Beauty begins the moment you love yourself"" insulated tumbler with lid.<br />(Straw and cleaner too)<br />Scented Candle<br />Soap<br />Bottle Opener<br />Wine Bottle Stopper<br />2 Flower Petal Bath Bombs<br />Greeting Card<br /><br />Pros - This is a really nice, complete gift set. You can send it directly and it comes nicely presented and all the things look really pretty in the box. Because of the bath bombs and soap it also smells lovely when you open it.<br /><br />Cons - It has a greeting card in it to ""Add your special message"" but if you send it directly from Amazon obviously you can't do that (they suggest adding your own on the Amazon gift option). Also the card is inside the box - so if you had it shipped to you to give to someone you would still have to open it in order to fill it out.<br /><br />Overall - this is on sale at the time of the review for under $20 and for that price it is definitely worth it. The cup and candle alone would be worth that.",79290,374
3.0,1649685689504,Cute Idea But The Horn Isn't Centered With The Ears,What you get - 3 Unicorn style spa-style terry headbands.<br /><br />Pros - these are cute and make a change from the normal bow or cat ear styles.<br /><br />Cons - The ears don't sit equally either side of the horn and they aren't moveable. The bands are also smaller than others I have. Even though they don't say they are designed for children I feel that these may have been designed that way.<br /><br />Overall - a little overpriced for what you get but might make fun teen party favors if they are having a spa or make up party.,79290,2212
4.0,1633965701923,Good - But not great!,"I only recently discovered the trick of using white liner rather than black for some interesting looks. This is a good liner - it doesn't irritate my eyes at all and is definitely good value for money. My only issue is that even with several coats it doesn't look as white, or stay on as long, as some other brands that I have used. Having a 12 pack means though that as I often lose things I have extras on hand which is nice.",79290,7205
4.0,1631102724371,It Has All The Essentials,"I am not a big traveler but this definitely has the essentials all ready to go in an FDA-approved clear bag. The items are decent quality but probably the most useful things are the bag it all comes in, and a little card that tells you all the things that you should be wiping down, a couple of which I hadn't thought of. I also hadn't thought of taking my own pillowcase before but having seen that it makes total sense. Yes, you could probably get all the things in it a little cheaper, but for convenience, this is a win. (I am also noting it as a possible stocking stuffer present for those people that are difficult to buy for and this would be an alternative to those who chocolate of bath products won't work for).",79290,1170
5.0,1629659300005,Perfect For Wigs!,"I have a lot of wigs and crowns and this is the perfect thing to use for styling them! This is the second one I have, and this one allows for earrings to be placed as well (which I personally don't use but I can see how it would be handy for a store display, or if you were taking pictures for selling jewelry). I have named her Rachel, to go with Monica that I already have, and she is definitely a talking point. Great quality, and whilst not the sort of thing everyone would need, cosplayers I think would find her very useful!",79290,770
5.0,1625073681851,Great Set - Especially For Eye MakeUp,I use a LOT of makeup brushes - and yes part of that is because I GET a lot of makeup brushes and I am not a fan of cleaning them but it also means that I try out a lot of different brands.  These worked REALLY well for my trickier eye makeup looks. They are soft but they hold the color well and disperse it evenly without much effort. The brush cleaner is a nice addition but being honest I probably won't use it. I do have an automatic brush cleaner if I need one and that will always be my go to.  For beginners or those looking to get a but more technical these are a great brush choice in my opinion!,79290,208
4.0,1624563949070,A Nice Vibrant Red!,"This lipstick is a really nice vibrant red color and stays on well without being drying. It did have a little bit of an unusual taste, not unpleasant, but enough that I noticed it hence the 4 stars. Other than that the coverage was great, it didn't smudge, and it looked fabulous. I will definitely be wearing it often.",79290,705
4.0,1621267538937,A Little Hard - But Great Color!,This set of lip liners are a great set of Reds - and the colors are great. The only problem for me was that they are a little hard which means sometimes they are a little scratchy and harder to get the perfect lines. For the price though you are getting a good selection with pretty much any shade of Red liner you could need.,79290,18731
3.0,1619896615540,Good not Great,"This definitely moisturizes, there is no question about that. I found that because of the texture (it's almost whipped) that you end up needing to use more product than with many of the options. Not sure that my skin would be stressed - but it definitely goes through a lot with the amount of make-up I put on it.  It is supposed to be fragrance-free and there's definitely not a perfume element - but maybe there should be, It smelled weird to me. I can't put my finger on what it was exactly just that I didn't really like it, but I can be picky over scents so that might just be me. Overall it was good - but not great - but also it's a mid-range rather than a higher price product which should be taken into account.",79290,976
5.0,1619021778529,Such A Cute Idea!,I LOVE Scrunchies - I am so excited that they are making a comeback and this is such a fun way to store them. I mean yes it is a little annoying if the one you want happens to be at the bottom - but not really a big deal. I think it's great that this comes with 8 scrunchies already - that in itself pretty much pays for it - but you can add lots more! If you are a scrunchie person then this is for you. I have mine on my dressing table and I love it!,79290,11914
5.0,1615835103116,Worth The Money!,"I have always been a fan of black eyeliner. I never considered using anything else until now. I LOVE how bright this makes my eyes look. The pencil can be used in various ways but by far my favorite is to use it as an eyeliner. It's amazing quality, and although a little more expensive than I would have looked at before trying - now I'm a convert! I can't believe it took me so long to give it a try!",79290,724
2.0,1615236726204,The Rose Quartz Roller Is Nice ....,"The Rose Quartz roller that comes with this is really nice., and I use it ALL the time. The micro needling kit - not so much. I am assuming that these are supposed to be one use and disposable (as there are NO options for changing/replacing the needle heads) - which could be a good thing in that at least you know for a fact it's clean. I read a lot about this and generally feel that it should be left to professionals! There is no way to tell what shape the little needles are on this (which from reading is pretty important), and there are LOTS of things that can go wrong. I am all about doing stuff at home - but I personally don't think a disposable micro needling kit is one of those things.",79290,28389
5.0,1615049749897,Excellent!,These tweezers are fabulous. They grip even the smallest of hairs with no issues. The larger ones are so good that I haven't really needed the smaller ones (although I did try them just so that I could compare for the review). Very impressed! Highly recommend!,79290,139
4.0,1614180124203,A Good Primer - But Heavy For Regular Use,"This is a great kit, for when you REALLY want your make-up to be on point. The primer gives a really great base and helps the foundation to look smooth and not crack, the ONLY downside is that for me, it doesn't allow my skin to breathe enough and I end up with breakouts if use it more than on the odd occasion which is a shame.  That being said a little goes a very long way, and on the days when I need my make up to be extra perfect then this gives me great results!",79290,816
5.0,1614102575726,Love them!,These are great! I am a big fan of the liquid liner over the pens. Super easy to use and you can have professional looking lashes in 2 easy steps. This set has a nice variety of lash styles from every day to super dramatic which is nice. They say reusable - I don't reuse mine because my eyes are super sensitive so can't comment on that part but I have seen that lots of people do reuse them so it is probably personal preference but I couldn't say how many uses you might get out of each pair.,79290,3686
5.0,1614101793852,It lives in my freezer!,"This has taken up permanent residence in my freezer. It is great when I just need a quick refresh, oh my eyes are tired, or I have a headache.  I have other rollers too but this is larger than most of them so you can hit more area at once.",79290,2334
5.0,1613417525279,Great Pins At A Great Price,"As someone who works with wigs a lot, having various color options is important to me, as these pins generally are only good for one use (although I have used these for a couple of uses before having to ditch them).  Having all the colors in one set is great and very convenient for someone like me - or if you have more than one hair color in the house.",79290,2108
3.0,1613416958396,Very Soft but not good  for longer / thciker hair.,"My daughter has thick hair which sits a couple of inches below her shoulders and takes forever to dry so I hoped these would be a good solution. Sadly although they are super soft, they don't absorb enough if you have longer / thicker hair.  My hair is shorter and thinner than my daughters and although it worked better on that - it still wasn't much better than a regular towel.  Very cute - but disappointing results.",79290,141
5.0,1612546754111,Fabulous!,I love magnetic lashes - they have totally changed how I feel about False eyelashes and I use them ALL the time. This set comes with two liquid liners which I love! The lashes stay all day with no issues at all and the variety of styles means you can have them looking more natural - or super dramatic.  The only thing I would say is that they say reusable - and I know people that do wash and reuse them but my eyes are sensitive and so I only use each pair for a single use.,79290,35207
4.0,1612544411103,Convenient Individual Packets!,"These are very convenient to throw in your purse when you are on the go, especially with everything going on at the moment. Working out at just under $1 a use they are pretty good value for money. They don't have a harsh scent and they aren't drying on your skin which is always a plus. A good product!",79290,2271
4.0,1611783518721,Cute - but not the easiest to style!,"This wig looks super cute once you get it sorted. The bangs are long, and needed trimming, which is pretty normal for me, but this one was a little trickier to get adjusted correctly and I ended up using extra clips to secure it. Short wigs are often harder to work with because there are less places to hide the mistakes, but overall I ended up with a very cute look.",79290,2266
4.0,1610387790100,All About The Purple!,"These are really good purple options. The crayons make it easy to use for underlining the eyes. It was a little tricky to use as a shadow, with more being needed and it definitely took more work to do that, but as a general addition to my make up I was pleased.",79290,977
3.0,1609783299901,Not My Favorite,"The color on these are strong, but they feel a little waxy for my preference. That being said they do stain quite well and there was a variety of red shades which means there would be something for most skin types. Just not one I can see me using on a regular basis.",79290,2492
4.0,1606163343887,Layer Up For Best Effect,I used the copper and the white/silver to create the effect in the picture. I love that the color was long lastig and definitely shimmery.  It didn't flake off as some glitter based ones do.  I found the best effect occurred if I let a layer dry and then added more - to build up the shine but if I didn't wait long enough between layers it did get a little clumpy.  Overall a fun addition for the holiday / party season.,79290,9808
5.0,1603822054876,Super Cute!,"I love these headbands.  Perfect to get me in a good mood while I am doing my make up.  Anyone who follows my facebook page would know that Cat Ears are a HUGE part of most things I wear so these are perfect!  Various colors are included. The grey and pink are definite favorites.  Would be a great present for cat lovers, or anyone who wants something FUN while they are getting ready / doing their skin care routine etc etc.",79290,10452
4.0,1599664195155,Quick and Easy to Apply,"These were one of the easiest mask type products I have used.  The application process literally takes seconds.  Peel off and place on face and they stay there.  I left them on for 15 minutes and could definitely tell the difference afterwards.  As the package describes there is a little residue left when you take them off which yu just dab in.  Over all I was pleased with the effect, but not pleased enough to want to pay $7 for just the one set.",79290,2329
5.0,1663209654101,Great no white cast,This is a great spf where it has 50 which is very great.  There is no white cast on mybskin however I do have lighter skin tone.  It is a mineral sunscreen which is nice because my skin has a reaction to the chemical.  Great sfp,79735,28065
4.0,1659473338522,pretty but does chip off pretty soon,The product is very pretty and has a great look to it.  However the product does chip off pretty soon and does leave the base color below so I don't really love that but it does  look great.  I did my nails on Saturday and already chipped off on Tuesday.,79735,12252
4.0,1654575741042,Good for cleaning paws,The product is very easy to use and easy to clean your dogs feet.  However make sure it will fit your dog feet.  Our 65lb pitbull it worked on however our 92 lbs Doberman feet were barely too big.  However it kinda worked.  Does come with a little towel so they can get clean feet during a bath or after a hike.  Was very useful,79735,2865
4.0,1654570934278,Good tan,It is a great foam that comes out very easy that comes out very dark.  So it makes it easy to apply so it doesnt take a lot of time to apply.  Does give you a nice tan.  However do not put heavy lotion and thick socks on to moisturize you feet because you will end up with a line like me.,79735,3342
5.0,1635691168539,Squeaky clean skin without feeling dried out,"This soap may be better for oily skin as it really cleans everything off, it left my skin so clean it was literally squeaking. I have dry skin and didn't like the overall effect. But my husband has very oily skin and he thinks it is one of the best bars of soap he has ever used. It really got his skin clean without making it feel dry.<br /><br />This soap doesn't suds up to much, it is almost like washing with an ultra fine pumice stone that really gets the skin clean. This would be a great soap to use on very dirty hands. Or as a mild exfoliator in the shower.<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars for its superior cleaning ability, its unique look, and my spouses very high recommendation.",80818,1144
5.0,1618143105350,"Beautiful, well made, non-static sandalwood hair comb","This comb is nicely made with a smooth finish, the etching/carving on the handle is a beautiful intricate design and the wood bristles are gentle on my scalp especially compared to plastic combs. The comb I received has a very light sandalwood smell to it. Wood combs are know for being gentle on the scalp and hair and don't produce any static electricity. This is my first sandalwood comb and I am surprised how gentle it feels on my scalp.  This comb is an easy 5 stars.",80818,222
5.0,1617275653619,"Pina Colada-ish smell, Very Gritty, Good Scrub","This isn't that scrub that you use every single day, its more for those occasional deep cleanings, and exfoliating. Or just for a good at home spa treatment. The size of the jar, and the amount of product is fairly small but it doesn't take much to get a good facial cleansing.  To me, it smells very much like a Pina Coloda, but not over powering just a nice fresh scent.<br /><br />The scrub itself is has a medium sized grit, and its feels fairly ""sharp"" against the skin.  Also, this isn't great for rubbing on and then taking a long soak in a tub, it turns the water black. I was worried it would stain my towels, the floor, tub something, but it didn't.<br /><br />This scrub is fairly specialized and is one of those love it or hate it things. I gave it 5 stars because the quality is excellent, the ingredients are top notch, and it has a pleasant smell. But it has to be tried before you'll know if its right for you.",80818,6015
5.0,1607510011892,super easy to use,"What I like best is this is very easy to setup and use. The timer buttons turn it on and start the timer, press again and time is extended. The buttons are easy to press as well so I was able to get at them with wet nails. One thing that surprised me was the top and bottom come apart and are only lightly held together with magnets. I do wish they stayed together a little tighter, but they snap together easily so in the end its no big deal...I guess. This is my first at home nail dryer and I would say this drys about as fast as dryers at good nail salons, and  its small enough that it stores in a drawer easily.",80818,1549
5.0,1603458217575,A Flutter of Butterflies,"This set is just mammoth...haha Perfect for anyone who is really into butterflies. And the sticky glue on the back of the butterflies is good enough that they can be used on more then just finger/toe nails, like cell phones, school books, lunch boxes, and places you might rather they didn't start showing up.<br /><br />The collection is widely varied with silver, gold, multi colored, and different sizes and shapes, they are all relatively small to tiny, and there are no tweezers included, not that most folks don't have plenty of pairs lying around...<br /><br />The butterfly stick on nail art is an excellent value and an easy 5 stars.",80818,836
3.0,1627411774090,Not great for me,"I can see how these might work well in some hair types, but they aren't great for mine. My hair is very fine and tends to slip right out of these.

4.0,1626632782045,A win,"Slightly browner than expected, but it still is a color that works with my skin tone. It lasts as long as any lipstick, so not forever, but good enough. It doesn't feel too thick on my lips. Overall this one was a win.",81503,705
3.0,1607898949152,Nice Colors,"These are fine. They don't stay very well though, and they make my lips a bit dry, so I still end up adding a lip balm over top, and that sort of ruins the matte finish. The color is good. I like the size of the container as well, like a lip balm.",81503,983
4.0,1601063559848,It Works,"I was skeptical. I am autistic, and I hate the feel of water in my ears, so I use cotton swabs to dry my ears after a shower. This adds up to a lot of swabs and I felt guilty about putting that many into the trash when I could make a tiny difference environmentally. I didn't really think the silicone option would work. The cotton soaks up the water. But the little knobby end actually does pull the water out of my ear canal.<br /><br />The case is fine. I feel like the rubber bit that holds it together will eventually break. It is just flimsy. But, for now, it does its job. I ordered the blue, and it is a pretty dull blue, but the swab works, so whatever.",81503,3372
2.0,1599139732470,Not thrilled,Eh. The color is bit more orange-y than I’d hoped for by the photo. It’s really thick. It doesn’t stay put or feel great on. I might try mixing it with some gloss if I liked the color more.,81503,681
5.0,1595518038113,No Headaches,"I love telephone cord style hair ties. They gather all of my hair into a ponytail or bun easily and, best of all, they don't give me headaches like more traditional hair elastics. These are a pretty combination of aqua blue and white, and they are very sturdy.",81503,2224
5.0,1546974950399,Really Soft,"These are really soft. Also, even when they are soaking wet, they don't feel drippy.

3.0,1644368438344,Temporary tattoo,Cute lot of tattoos.  There’s a variety.  It applied easy but it only lasted about 30 minutes before it started peeling.,81515,4167

5.0,1619268017469,Lemony face wash 🍋,"I just washed my face with this Sia C + Lemon Peel wash. It lathered nicely in my hands and on my face. It has a soft lemony scent. It rinsed well - and this is where you'll feel the difference. You know the phrase 'squeaky clean'? That's what you'll feel. There's absolutely no residue left behind. If you've used Noxema to wash your face, it has a similar effect. Because I'm prone to dry skin, I had to apply cream immediately. The label on the bottle suggests washing with this, then using a toner, followed by Vitamin C. Makes sense as your skin is stripped of everything and is ready for some TLC. I think this is an ideal wash for people with oily or combination skin. For me, this will be a great summer wash to control the shine (oil). If you're skin is dry like mine, then moisturize immediately after using.",81647,393
3.0,1587211864029,Not for dry skin,"The first thing I noticed when I used the product was the delicate scent. It's very nice and stays on you for awhile. So, you pump out the 'gel' which I would call soap except for the fact that it doesn't lather much. Instructions say to pump in your hand then apply to face. I tried that, but my face felt too dry, so I moistened it a little bit and then applied the gel. I rinsed it off well and patted my skin dry. Within seconds I felt my skin drying up. If you have really dry skin, you know what I mean - that taut feeling you try to avoid. I had to get some cream and moisturize right away. I'm guessing there must be something like alcohol in this makeup remover. If you have oily skin or perhaps you're trying to remove a heavy foundation - this may be a good choice for you. But since I wear light makeup and have very dry skin, I can't use this. I'll try it again in the summer when my skin produces more oil as the scent is really nice and makes it worth a second try.",81647,648

I think the price is a bit high for the smaller bottle, but the amino acids may be worth it for you (for cleansing, volume, shine, etc). I'm rating it 3 stars, since I got a really nice body wash a while ago that was priced similarly but was in a pump bottle twice this size, and made in USA. So you may have to shop around a bit.<br /><br />I'm also unclear why it mentions Bath and Body Works, since it doesn't seem to be associated with them?

4.0,1561717369048,Works well- pretty design,"I love the look of this lamp. It almost looks like it came straight out of a salon from the 50s, but also manages to look very modern.  It's relatively small and doesn't take up too much space among my other bathroom appliances beneath the sink.  The plug isn't very long, maybe 4 feet, so wherever you do your nails you will need to be sitting near an outlet.<br /><br />My daughter has sensitive skin, and when she stuck her hand under the lamp she said it bothered her hands a little because of the heat.  I don't think the heat was too intense.  I have a fresh burn on my finger that didn't feel bothered by the light so I'm attributing that to her being younger and more sensitive to heat, but I do think it's something to be aware of.<br /><br />My fingernails weren't completely dry when I pulled them out, and I had to run them through twice as many cycles as the nail polish recommended, but honestly I think it was due more to the nail polish I used than it was a fault of the lamps (for reference, it was China Glaze brand Gelaze).  The nail polish was really super runny and had a watery consistency with very thin coverage.<br /><br />Two days later though (a record for two people who are hard on their nails) my daughter and I both have zero chips in our polish.  I'm pretty happy to have received this and think it would make a great gift or be a good purchase for those who want to save a little money from getting a professional manicure.<br /><br />Just one last note: I had to go to a beauty supply store to find a gel polish that needed a lamp.  It seems like many gels these days advertise no lamp needed.  Personally I feel like those aren't any better than regular polish, but it's something to consider.",82225,1588
4.0,1637619946800,"Soft & smooth, lightweight matte lip cream that doesn't dry out the lips 💋","PeriPera is kinda known for having amazing lip tints & stains. When I saw that they were offering lipstick bullets now, I thought these would have that same effect. I was mistaken. This is a soft textured matte lip cream developed to attain the look of blurred lips, a popular Korean beauty trend. What exactly does ""blurred lips"" translate to in the West? It means skip the harsh lip liner & soften the edges of your lip borders. The goal is to achieve a gradual gradient of color.<br /><br />I got shade n°8 ""City Pop Chili"", which I would describe as a burnt brick red color. It feels very Autumnal and will be best complemented by those with warm skintones.<br /><br />The texture of the lip cream itself is soft & smooth, sorta like a mousse. It's very lightweight, easy to blend, and feels comfortable on the lips. It has a matte finish, with just the right amount of moisturizing properties to keep it from completely drying out my lips.<br /><br />I found that it's best to apply this product straight from the tube. I tried to build up opacity by using a lip brush to apply it, but every time I'd swipe the brush across my lips, it would actually remove product and leave bald spots. The formula isn't as long wearing as I was expecting from a matte lipstick, either. After a couple hours of eating, drinking, and expressive mouth movements, the color wears off entirely and I have to reapply. I really wish this wore down to a stain, but that's not what PeriPera was going for.<br /><br />The frosted, translucent pink lipstick component used for this line of lippies is understated, but pretty. It looks very feminine. The actual lipstick bullet has a slim silhouette and an angled tip. You get exactly one inch of visible product inside the tube. This formula is free of fragrance. There is no scent at all that I can detect.<br /><br />Expiration date printed on my product packaging is Aug. 2024<br />(2 years & 10 months from when I purchased it in Oct. 2021)<br /><br />Full Ingredients:<br />Dimethicone, Dibutyl Adipate, Microcrystalline Wax, Polyethylene, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Ceresin, Iron Oxide Red, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Agave Tequilana Leaf Extract, Diglyceryl Sebacate/Isopalmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Silica, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Propylene Carbonate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Butylene Glycol, Water, BHT, Fragrance, Lithol Rubine BCA, Sunset Yellow FCF, Brilliant Blue FCF, Tartrazine",83938,3570
4.0,1623199074646,My skin went from dry/dehydrated to oily after using this toner 😔,"The sedum extract in this essence was quite intriguing to me.  As someone with chronically dry, sometimes dehydrated skin I thought this toner could help me.  ""Sedum is a succulent leaf known for its intense hydration, vitamins & mineral level.  It holds more hydration than watermelon and is rich in phytoestrogen that further boosts hydration and improves the skin condition.""  When I read that, I thought this sounded like the recipe for perfect skin, but every time I use this essence my face turns super oily.  I have never experienced this kind of change from any of the hydrating essences I own.<br /><br />The scent on this is light, clean, and fresh, very herbal.  You should be aware that this product is fragranced with natural fruit oils & extracts.  A few minutes after application though, the scent dissipates quickly.  My skin is crazy reactive & very sensitive, but I did not experience any adverse reactions to the ingredients used in this essence.<br /><br />There was also a generous amount of samples from Celimax included with this toner.  😀  They sent 2 Noni ampoules, 3 serum packettes, and 2 AHA/BHA exfoliating/brightening pads (labeled for underarms, but can be used elsewhere).  Korean brands are so very gracious with samples!  Thank you, Celimax! ❤<br /><br />Both the package & bottle both come safety sealed.  The bottle is of nice size (150ml) and features a shaker style spout for easy dispensing.  I pour a small amount of the essence into my hands, then pat into the skin after cleansing. Then I apply my serums & moisturizer.<br /><br />Though I don't find this product to be a particularly good fit for my skin right now (during the hot & humid Florida summer heat, when my oil production is already at it's peak), I think this essence may work better for me in the winter.  I do think it's a nice product, so it still gets a 4 star rating from me.",83938,709
5.0,1617149633253,Smells like Hawaiian Punch 😋 Great formula and I love the no-spill pump bottle!,"This non-acetone polish remover from Plant Therapy smells so good! To me, it smells a lot like fruit punch (Hawaiian Punch, to be exact). You can smell it from the outside of the bottle as soon as it arrives. But don't smell it straight from the bottle, or on your cotton round... the solvents themselves have a very strong odor! After you use the product though, the only thing lingering is the fruit punch scent on your fingertips. There is a little bit of an oily residue left behind, but it beats the ashy dryness of straight acetone.<br /><br />The leak-proof pump bottle works amazing! If you knock the bottle over, it does not spill. I love that! The cap on the bottle flips up to reveal the pump dispenser, which you press down to pull your liquid to the top. I did not have any issues during shipment, so I think this bottle will be fabulous for travel. This acetone-free formula removes traditional crème & shimmer polishes with little effort. The solvent base contains Ethyl Acetate & Isopropyl Mistrate. I wouldn't use this as my first defense against removing glitter lacquers, and I wouldn't use it to soak off gel polish at all. (Pure acetone is best for both of those options).<br /><br />Plant Therapy products are proudly made in the USA! 🇺🇸",83938,860
5.0,1617051103309,These flakes dissolve faster than any salt I've ever used 🦆💦,"First off, this bag of Magnesium flakes from Horbäach is huge! I've pictured it next to a full sized bag of Dr. Teal's Magnesium salts, for reference. You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck here. This bag of Magnesium flakes is fragrance free, so you have more options as well. You can scent the portions individually, (if you so choose), by adding a few drops of your favorite essential oils, or you can simply use it as-is. The flakes dissolve quicker than any of the commercially prepared salts I've ever used, which make these perfect for soaking. Skin is baby soft after a 20 minute bath, and muscle fatigue is greatly reduced. Magnesium Chloride soaks have helped my husband's charlie horses become far less frequent. Unfortunately he can't absorb Magnesium from his diet, so we have to supplement. Without this and high quality vitamins, he would suffer.<br /><br />There are some things I didn't realize when I ordered this product, but I found to be very interesting after researching the difference between Magnesium Chloride vs. Magnesium Sulfate:<br /><br />Both compounds contain a similar level of elemental Magnesium, but the key difference between Magnesium Chloride (flakes) and Magnesium Sulphate (salts) is the purity of Magnesium Chloride and the rate of its absorption within the body. It is reported that Magnesium Chloride is more easily absorbed and utilised by the body, compared to Epsom Salts.<br /><br />This seems like a much better choice for our needs. I'm so glad to have discovered that something better like this exists, to help his condition.",83938,3357
5.0,1615139298521,The LED aspect explained & my experience with these masks 🎭 (spoiler alert: I LOVE them!),"THIS IS A LENGTHY REVIEW, BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH THE READ:<br /><br />Avajar is a k-beauty skincare manufacturer out of Seoul, Korea, closely affiliated with the K-pop group, Super Junior, who is the face of the brand. Avajar, as a company, has been making face products since 2019, with a focus on offering quality ingredients at a fair price. In this particular product they have created (a series of) sheet masks that contain the same cream as their LED Ring Light Cream Moisturizer. The original LED Ring Light Cream Moisturizer is pictured here on the sheet mask packaging. That moisturizer actually comes with a mini LED light on top of the jar, which was designed to be used as the product applicator. The LED cream in a jar was a top seller for Avajar, and so they expanded on the delivery system to include sheet masks. With all that being said, these masks do not come with an LED light (but if you already have one of your own, you could certainly use it with this product). I just wanted to pass this info along to clear up the confusion surrounding the marketing terms used on these masks.<br /><br />For context: My skin is dry and dehydrated, very sensitive and product reactive. I have not experienced any issues from using these masks, outside of some temporary erythemia (a.k.a. skin flushing, which I experience regularly). These masks are formulated without any artificial colors, fragrance, silicons, and parabens. This is not to say these masks are fragrance free, because they absolutely have a scent. The smell is rather herbal to me, which I believe is attributed to fruit and flower essences used in the cream. All Avajar products are made in a cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) certified lab. However, I do not see any claims of cruelty-free status, neither on the package nor on their website.<br /><br />I do self care Sundays every week and will wear a sheet mask for 30 minutes while I relax in bed. Putting this mask on is pretty messy. You'll want to apply it over your bathroom sink because the cream is on the watery side and will drip everywhere. There is a generous amount of the cream essence inside the package and on the mask. The sheet mask material is super thin and hugs the contours of my face well. It's a nice size and sticks well, so you can actually wear one and move about, without having it lift or slide all over. After 30 minutes I peel the mask off and massage the remaining product into my skin. There isn't any stickiness and the cream absorbs nicely. My skin feels baby soft, supple, and deeply moisturized each time I use one. These masks come in a box of 5 and there's 3 formulas to choose from - Hydrating {blue} (which is the one I got), Whitening {yellow}, and Nourishing {red}. I have really enjoyed using these in my weekly sheet masks rotation. The price is extremely reasonable for such great quality. I love the results I've gotten and I recommend them entirely! I just purchased the Nourishing set and will definitely repurchase these hydrating masks when I run out.<br /><br />PRO'S:<br />+ Adds moisture to dry, dehydrated skin<br />+ Soothes and calms skin irritation<br />+ Skin feels soft, supple & deeply nourished after use<br />+ No artificial color, fragrance, silicon, parabens<br />+ Mask material hugs facial contours<br />+ Masks don't slip & slide off the face<br />+ Fast absorption - refreshes in 20-30 minutes<br />+ Comes in a pack of 5 at a cost of $1.55 a piece<br />+ Perfect for a relaxing self care session<br />+ Conveniently shipped on PRIME<br /><br />CONS:<br />- None",83938,2361

There's a little bit of everything in this kit - crèmes, full coverage microglitters, jellies, and crelly finishes. They also include a base, as well as glossy and matte no-wipe topcoats (both of which are phenomenal!) The glossy top is super shiny and the matte top looks like velvet.<br /><br />Rosegin curated a lovely rainbow assortment of mini gel colors in this set. You get pastels and primary colors, but no black or white polish is included. The bottles are 5ml; though they look tiny, they're filled to the top and contain enough product for several mani's. I swatched 12 out of the 20 shades in this kit and the formulas are amazing! Smooth and buttery. Beautifully pigmented - 2 coats to full coverage. The glitters aren't thick or clumpy, and don't leave bald spots during application. The brushes fan out nicely on the nail and make the polishes easy to control. There is no offensive odor to any of these and they cured within 60 secs in my LED lamp. I cannot speak to the wear time with these as I always wear a peel-off base or full cover tips with gel polish products.<br /><br />I've shown both the glossy and matte top coats with my swatches. All colors are shown at 2 easy coats. These are fabulous for the price and I wholeheartedly recommend them. I will definitely be checking out other Rosegin products!

5.0,1609995351786,"One coat coverage, buttery smooth formulas & special FX finishes! 😍 Amazing set of polishes!","This set of gel polishes from Pine Gel really blew me away! These cover in one easy coat and have a nice glossy finish. The glitter polish was a little bit thick, but it's packed with glitter so I guess that's to be expected. This set of six shades contains (1) Glitter, (3) Crèmes, (2) Magnetics, and a cats eye magnet wand needed to work the magnetic polishes. All of the colors cure for 60 secs in an LED lamp or 90 secs in a UV.<br /><br />The crèmes are all buttery smooth in application, and self level beautifully. Each dry down to a nice glossy finish. The magnetics are easy to manipulate with the enclosed magnet stick. I was able to do a double cat eye line on my first try! (These are gonna be a lot of fun to play with using different shaped magnets for different effects.) Both magnetic polishes covered completely in one easy coat. The glitter shade is jam-packed with small royal blue glitters and is accented with a sprinkling of medium sized blue hexagons. The depth and sparkle to this polish is incredible. The glitter load makes this shade a little bit thick - but it's still workable. None of these gel polishes have a bad odor. None of them gave me any issues during application or the curing process. I cannot speak to the wear time, as I always use a peel-off base coat or full coverage tips, with gel polish products.<br /><br />Because these are so rich in pigment, (and a lot of them are dark colors), it is best to work in thin coats. They do cure with a sticky layer. All of these (except the glitter) cured for 60 sec in my LED lamp. With the thickness and opacity of the glitter polish, I did a double cure on that one to be safe. All swatches in this review are ONE coat and are shown WITHOUT top coat.<br /><br />I think the coverage, formula, and finishes of these polishes is amazing and absolutely worth the price. I highly recommend these! Thanks for reading. :) If my review and photos were helpful to you in any way, please click the button below to let me know. Thanks!",83938,2537

They are larger than they appear in the photos. They're not high end designer, but they aren't dollar store quality either. A few of mine came with some scratches on the pearls, but since I received this as a sample, I did not reduce my rating. I did, however, deduct a star because on the larger barette clips the pearls are not thoroughly attached. {see photo} On the skinny hair pins, the pearls are wrapped all the way down the length of the hair pin. The larger barettes are only attached on the ends. With that, I have some reservations on how long these will actually last. I suppose with careful handling, and maybe occasional use they should be okay. All in all, they are pretty and I think they are worth the price.",83938,18747

4.0,1605898143424,"Pretty packaging, lovely scent 🌹 The best of Touch in Sol No Poreblem primers in a sample size set","This is a really nice travel sized set of the Touch in Sol No Poreblem primers, which comes in a cute box, suitable for gifting. The products are deluxe sample sizes, which is a perfect way to try out the line and find your favorite. 🌹<br /><br />I will start off with the Priming Water and Priming Essence. Both of these products come in dropper style ampoules. Neither of mine were filled to the top. These bottles are already on the smaller side, so it was especially disappointing to see missing product. For that, I've docked a star. [see photos attached, including one with a nail polish bottle for scale of sizing.]<br /><br />Both the Essence and Water feels like a light oil in texture. They spread easily, absorb quickly, and are meant to be used as the last step in your skin care. The No Poreblem primer in a tube is your silicone based makeup primer. It has that familiar silky finish, and does do a good job of blurring the pores. This is not so much a pore ""filling"" primer; this one works more to smooth them out, and creates a nice base for your foundation.<br /><br />All of the products in this set have a light rose scent, which smells divine. I am not usually fond of most rosy florals because they are always either too strong, smell artificial, or very old lady-ish. This scent is none of those things. Touch in Sol has nailed the rose fragrance - it's lightweight, very fresh, and I really enjoy it. As someone who is skin sensitive to added fragrance, I had zero reactions to any of these products. 🌹",83938,816
4.0,1603747549927,Transfer resistant formula 😷 with excellent coverage! Unlike any BB cream I've ever tried!,"The Fromnature BB cream by Cosmocos is unlike any beauty balm I've ever tried. It has much better coverage, and a thicker consistency than any other BB's I've used (which, until now, have all been Western brands). It almost covers like a foundation, but feels extremely lightweight like a BB. It does dry down really fast, and it was a bit darker than I expected. I am light neutral in complexion and chose the shade ""light beige"". I believe I was able to make the color work for me, but I'm not sure if it'll suit all light skin tones. 👻<br /><br />This BB has a beautiful satin matte finish, but did have a tendency to cling to my dry patches, so be sure to start with an exfoliated, well moisturized, and primed face. I did not use any primer with this product, (since it's marketed as a BB cream), and without the aid of a pore filling primer this product did eventually settle into my fine lines & large pores. I am really impressed with the staying power of this product though, even without primer & setting spray! After a full day of masking against covid in the South Florida heat, there was no transfer to my face mask. 😃 That's a huge, HUGE plus! With that being said, I highly recommend using a really good cleanser to efficiently remove this product at the end of the day.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Great coverage that can be built up<br />+ Very lightweight on the skin<br />+ Excellent staying power<br />+ SPF 50<br />+ Transfer resistant! 🙌<br />+ No photo flashback!<br />+ Fragrance free!<br />+ 1.67 oz of product (vs. the U.S. standard 1 fl. oz)<br />+ 2 sample hair care products included as a bonus! ❤<br />+ Convenient PRIME Shipping<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Dries very fast and can be difficult to blend<br />- Clings to dry patches<br />- Settles into pores & wrinkles (without primer)<br /><br />TO BE CONSIDERED:<br />* Warm yellow undertone may not suit everyone<br /><br />Side Note: There was one other thing I wanted to mention... When I took the manufacturer safety seal off of the tube, I had a volcanic eruption of BB cream that I wasn't prepared for, which made a mess of my tube. If you're like me and don't want to waste precious product, just be aware that it might come spilling out like lava when you break the product seal. 🙃",83938,19175
4.0,1597859345294,Wash them well before using 💀,"A spray bottle is a spray bottle, right? 🤔 Lol, nope!<br /><br />So, here we are... shopping on Amazon, presented with a thousand options for something as simple as a bottle that sprays. 😰<br /><br />My selection criteria was this: (a) The plastic must be able to handle liquid sanitizer made with a base of 60% alcohol (the 91% ISP variety), *without suffering undesirable changes* and (b) Have a good spray nozzle capable of producing a fine, even mist *without getting clogged*.<br /><br />This set of bottles from MOSTOF checks both of those boxes. ✔ I tested them specifically against 2 different types of liquid (not gel) sanitizer.  Initially, I chose this particular set for the larger sized funnels that are also included, and the fact that it comes with (10) travel sized bottles.<br /><br />None of my bottles leak and they spray a fine, even mist without leaving droplets.  After seeing the spray function in action, I decided to use a couple of these for facial mists and essences. I don't know (yet) whether they'll spray every last drop, but the sprayer feed wraps all the way around the bottom of the bottle, which does look promising. 🤞 So far, every liquid I've put in them has been fine; the plastic didn't change and the sprays perform the same.<br /><br />Ultimately, I had to dock a star from my rating because the bottles came filthy inside, 😬 every one of them is heavily scratched up, and one of the bottles I received doesn't sit evenly. ➡️(see photos 3&4: defect (warped) bottle is on the right)⬅️<br /><br />PRO'S:<br />+ Contains everything you need to package liquids immediately<br />+ Includes larger sized funnels = quick flow in filling<br />+ Spray nozzles produce fine, even mist without leaving droplets<br />+ Sprayer feed goes all the way around the bottom of the bottle<br />+ No leaking from the bottle necks or spray nozzles<br />+ Spray nozzles have not clogged<br />+ Caps fit tightly<br />+ No adverse reactions to the plastic (re: high alcohol content)<br />+ Airline approved carry-on size<br />+ Excellent price for ten bottles (and two funnels!)<br />+ Convenient PRIME shipping<br />+ Bonus sheet of labels (they're small, but they work)<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Bottles came really scratched up and very dirty<br />- One of the ten bottles I received doesn't sit evenly<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Ultimately, I think there's some quality control issues that the manufacturer could improve upon. As long as you're not an Etsy seller, or someone that's gonna be gifting these, you may not mind the scratches or the possibility of uneven bottom(s). Provided you wash them out really good, they still do the job! 👍🏼 Should anything happen to change with these as time goes on, I will update this review. Thanks for reading! Stay safe. 😷",83938,10387

4.0,1608518363563,Moisturizing and “plumping” of skin,"This product is quite expensive but it packs a lot of great ingredients. Dr. Denese has a fantastic product line, and I love her magnetic face mask, amongst other things. I didn’t get this product for the anti-aging properties, but more for the moisture and exfoliating base. I use it after I cleanse and tone my face, let it fully absorb for a few minutes, and then apply my serums and/or just moisturizer. When I use it at night I find that my skin feels plumper and moisturized when I wake up. The 2oz bottle can stretch out over a long period of time too, so the product is worth the money, it’s just not quite in my everyday price range. I do like that I can cut out serums at night and still feel like I’m treating my face. I don’t have visible wrinkles yet so I haven’t seen any anti-wrinkle effects, but my skin does feel fuller, if that makes sense. My skin feels tighter in a good way, and my skin looks and feels softer and just overall more even looking.",86845,317
5.0,1608517852718,Controls frizz w/o adding weight to hair,"The scent is very refreshing and mild, it almost just blends with your shampoo/ conditioner. I spray a few pumps on my hair and smooth it in with a comb, and then let my hair air dry overnight and I’ve noticed a significant difference in frizz control. My hair kinda feels/ looks poofy and frizzy after I wash it and this product tames my hair without weighing it down at all. My hair just feels softer and smoother when I use it, but I don’t feel it in my hair at all, it quickly absorbs. I have long hair and this size is more of a travel size bottle for me, even using just a few pumps every few nights, I’m down to the last bit of product. I will likely order it again because it’s seamless for frizz, and I like how weightless it is.",86845,1001
4.0,1608515987036,"Lightweight, compact, easy/ fun to use","This is a decent portable nail lamp. It’s affordable, very lightweight, easy to use, and comes with some accessories and the settings on the lamp are convenient. It takes a bit longer than I was hoping to fully dry, but after about 10 minutes, you’re good to go. I like this because it’s small and light so I can pack it with me anywhere. It is easy to use, and a child could use it (with supervision so they don’t look into the light) because you just slide your hand under the light and it will detect your hand and start the light/ drying process. I have noticed that the lag time seems to be getting longer on the motion detecting light, but it’s not extremely bothersome. Sometimes it takes a few swipes, but it generally works. It’s a great thing to have if you enjoy doing your nails at home, or even just a fun “spa” thing to do with your friends, or kids during winter and/ or quarantine. This is by no means a professional style nail lamp but for the price, it gets the job done.",86845,1556
5.0,1608447867454,Great sheerness and vitamin C content,"I’m not a huge fan of face oils but this product is great! It goes on light and makes your skin feel moisturized while also giving it a natural glow and radiance. The smell is subtle but good, it smells vaguely like an orange, and goes on sheer and not greasy. I love that it’s giving my skin the extra vitamin C that it needs.",86845,81
5.0,1597450424120,Great for a soft clean face & beard,"This face wash is so exfoliating and smells great. It works really well on the beard area and preps the skin for a nice, super smooth shave. It doesn’t seem to strip the face of natural oils, which is great. Overall, it just leaves a really soft, clean, oil-free (the bad oils) look and feel. I would definitely recommend this for a nice clean face, especially for men with bushy beards.",86845,1087

This comb is definitely meant for thick and coarse hair.",87439,41235
5.0,1658967197998,"Citrus scent, hides the hemp seed oil smell very well!","I got this for my mother, who has arthritis and it’s helped her tremendously with her pain. The hand cream smells like citrus, and it’s strong enough to cover up the hemp seed oil smell. It’s also moisturizing and a little bit greasy when it’s first applied. It absorbs well into the skin, despite how thick the cream is.",87439,2102
5.0,1654555612580,Hair repair kit,"The kit comes with No. 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8. No. 1 and 2 are only for professional use, thus why they are not included. Like how the numbers imply, start with No.0 and work upward. Everything included in the kit has little-to-no scent. My favorite has to be No.3. I saw the most change in my hair after using it. Despite my hair being damaged, No.3 made it appear healthier. The items in this kid are small, making them perfect for traveling.",87439,169
4.0,1626367818146,Dropper Bottle Serum,"This is a nice serum that I've been using for a few months now and I really like it. I love the dropper bottle because it's easy to control how much serum you use and helps it last for a nice long time. The smell of this serum is nice and subtle and it feels smooth and not greasy while applying. I believe this does help your skin feel a bit rehydrated and soft after using this serum for sometime. I'm happy overall with the product and think that N.M.F. makes a very nice product. This is certainly worth giving a try, even if you have sensitive skin like I do.",88369,1550
4.0,1622327071540,Leaves Hair Silky,"This Argan Hair Color Mask really leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. I've just about finished the bottle and I might have to order more. I used this twice a week and left it in for about 10 minutes at least each time. It helped my curls and hair feel silky smooth, less frizzy and soft so I was very happy with the results. It doesn't have a scent and is a thick white cream conditioner type product in a nice package. Overall, it's worth the investment for conditioning and softening your hair and is really impressive. I wish the container was a bit bigger because I like to use a lot on my hair and mostly on the ends and that is the only reason I didn't give this five stars.",88369,959
4.0,1613219493561,Nice Hair Straightener,"I've had many hair straighteners in the past having always had wavy or curly hair and this is a very good straightener. It heats up quickly and stays hot for a long time making it easy to section hair and run through the plates. It's not heavy and it's simple to use. I like the way it works on my hair and mostly, that is doesn't dry out or over heat my hair but still straightens it nicely. This cute pink, easy to use hair straightener by Bellezza is worth the investment, especially if you don't want to spend a fortune just to get your hair smooth and straight.",88369,16
4.0,1597795007301,Great Mascara,I really like this mascara. It lengthens my lashes and doesn’t clump like the cheaper brands. The wand and bottle are smooth and sleek and are simple to use. It’s somewhat easy to remove at night and looks good all day. At times it can feel thick on my eyes but overall I still really like this product as I believe that is just because of the silk fiber. This mascara is worth the investment.,88369,1008
5.0,1596586617832,Love The Applicator,"I’ve used a few of these lash growth boosters and this one is my new favorite. It’s not because my lashes grew into fake lash length, but the applicator is the best I’ve seen. I love you can coat your lashes using the mascara wand and use the white fluff tip to apply it to corners and the lash line easier. Having said all that, my lashes are a bit longer since I started using it and they feel strong and well conditioned. The packaging is nice and the wand is great and the product works well, so I highly recommend it.",88369,12462
5.0,1595104350910,Cucumber Smelling That Really Moisturizes,"This cream reminds me of cucumber water at the spa. The smell is light, like the lightweight feeling of the moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and my face drinks this moisturizer in. It makes my very dry areas feel just soft and fresh. Gold Digger makes a nice set of skin line products and this is also a well packaged/bottled item. I love the natural products in it and think it’s a great investment to your skin line items.",88369,323
5.0,1594164596515,Great Retinol Serum For Sensitive Skin,"The Serum by Higher Education is very moisturizing and delicate on the skin. The white cream feels silky, unlike most serums and really helps brighten skins appearance. My skin is sensitive and this doesn’t irritate or hurt my skin at all, instead it makes my skin feel soft and moist. This serum is a great investment and worth the price if you want healthy, moisturized, soft, clear skin.",88369,299
4.0,1579385566999,Works With Time And Patience,"First off, all these new lash growth serums seem to work if you use them consistently, as does this one by Veta. However, I was not impressed with the container and/or applicator. It’s a small tube similar to a thin mascara bottle and it has a black button on top to release the serum. The tip is like a thick wax that gets covered with the serum but it’s difficult to use on the subtle lash line or eyes in general. I prefer the wand versions to apply the serum because they are simple and fast and easier to apply. This lash and brow pen does work though and only takes about two weeks to see a difference.",88369,1165
4.0,1663488364727,"Nice shine, but had no safety seal","I'm torn about this mask. It moisturizes pretty well and gives a nice shine if you use it like a gloss, but I was a bit put-off by the fact that it didn't have a safety seal. It came in an unsealed box (the Amazon package was sealed, of course, but the actual box the tube was in wasn't taped or sealed in any way) and the lid didn't have any shrink-wrap, or foil strip, or even tape.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of scents, and while this one is not bad, it's not great either. It's a little on the strong side for my tastes.<br /><br />Speaking of tastes, this gloss/mask has a bit of an oily/greasy taste. It's not bad, but doesn't match the smell of it. I don't mind it, but I thought I'd mention it since it's important to some people.<br /><br />All that said, it moisturizes pretty well and I like the way my lips feel in the morning, which is saying a lot. My lips tend to get really dry and cracked when the weather changes, and so far, it hasn't happened with our most recent weather change!",88689,68
5.0,1648419438100,"Super cute, though a little small","The photo shows my 4-year-old wearing one of these headbands. I think they run a little small but they stretch quite a bit. They are SO soft and super cute! The bands are comfy and fit a range of head sizes. It's a bit of a stretch for them to fit on me, but I admittedly have a large head. Most headbands don't stay on my head anyway. These would be super cute as party favors or even stocking stuffers. Again, they are so SUPER soft!",88689,2212
3.0,1616477988313,"Beautiful (unnecessary?) packaging, ok taste","I was surprised at the packaging when this tea arrived.  It's pretty elegant, especially for tea.  I would expect a high-end candle to look like this, not a canister of tea!  It's beautiful, but again, for tea.  The box is nice with a soft, thick elastic band to keep the top on.  The jar is a light purple glass with a plastic lid.  They did slap a warning about the horrific smell when you open the cap.  It's pretty bad and strong.  However, I bravely pushed on and made a cup.  It doesn't really smell that bad once it's steeped.  I steep it in 195 degree water for 7 minutes.  It does seem to take the edge off, but the flavor is really just okay.  At $68 (currently) for 50 tea bags, I think the packaging must be really expensive.  I usually drink Yogi Bedtime Tea because it's readily available at the grocery store and I love the way it smells and tastes.  While I think this WelleCo tea seems to be more effective, I really would prefer to just drink a cup of nice-tasting tea before bed.",88689,2262
4.0,1614839809783,Makes a noticeable difference!,"I've been using this sonic facial cleaning brush for a few weeks and tried out both the brush and the silicone heads.  I feel like the brush is more intense and the silicone head is more gentle on the skin.  I can really notice a difference after I use the brush.  My skin is much smoother.  I assume it's because it's exfoliating and removing the dead skin.  There are 2 speed settings and I've found the lower setting doesn't do much so I use it on the higher setting.  I like that it can be used in the shower since I wash my face in the shower.  I just wish it was rechargeable.  I haven't had to replace the batteries yet, but nowadays it seems that most electronics are rechargeable so I guess I'm used to that.",88689,8418
5.0,1614495894454,Just what my scalp needed!,"Changing weather always affects my scalp in a bad way.  I also lose hair easily so I was worried a scalp massager might cause more hair to break or fall out.  Not so!  The ""teeth"" on this scalp massager are long enough to get down to the scalp but are soft and gentle.  Even my 3-year-old daughter can sort of use it herself in the shower.  And she doesn't complain at all when I use it to actually shampoo her hair.  This massager also increases the lather a lot!  It really makes a regular everyday shampoo feel luxurious.",88689,135
4.0,1609740153394,Nice tweezer set - and I'm picky!,"I use tweezers almost every day, mostly for eyebrow shaping and splinter removal (I have 2 young kids so this is a regular occurrence).  I've tried quite a few different tweezers, but my favorite is an old Revlon one that I've had for more than 15 years.  To me, it's not just about the angle or the point - it's the gripping power.  This LeiCare set works well and have become my go-to splinter removers.  They grip well and for the price (currently $6.99 for both tweezers and the case), I think these are a good deal.  My only complaint is with the case.  It's basically cardboard so while it's held up so far, I don't think it will last long.  If you lose the little ""straps"" that hold the tweezers closed, the case won't close.",88689,139
5.0,1597634982910,Very Comfy!,"Our tub is situated so that a wall is about 3 inches from the end of the tub, meaning that if you take a bath, your head essentially has to be either vertical or in the tub.  Sticking a bath pillow to the wall only means that your vertical head has a bit of padding.  This bath pillow has changed that!  Because it's so long and softer than an inflatable pillow, it actually sort of creates that angle so my head does not have to vertical!  After my first bath, I was trying to think of a way to hang it up to dry when I realized it actually has a hook just for that!  I really, really love this bath pillow!",88689,757
5.0,1667178568903,Very Good Moisturizer for Daily Use,"I've never used any product with Brown Algae and liked the results.

5.0,1661471650562,Great Volume and Texturing Spray,"I have been trying products that gives your hair the “textured” look.  I have used regularly during the Summer months and I found  that it did add volume to my hair.  It also doubles as a dry shampoo., as it absorbs oils from your hair.

I sometimes suffer from pain in my wrists due to typing often and found that this brush didn’t bother my wrists at all.  I have never used an Argan infused brush and I did feel a difference between this brush and one without Argan:  I did see that my hair felt smoother and less frizzy.

2.0,1653691939142,Does Not Rinse Off Easily,"I have never used mold remover gel before so I wasn't sure what to expect with this.  I usually spray some bleach cleaner in my tub and use a brush to scrub.  I applied a thin layer on my grout, which was not gross but needed to be cleaned.  I left it on for an hour and then tried to rinse it off with the shower.  It would not rinse off unless I scrubbed it.  Even when I used a brush I could still see a thin layer of the gel on my tiles.  This made me very nervous as the box says that if you touch the gel you should monitor yourself for sickness.  There were no instructions on the box to tell you how long to leave the gel on.  I left it on for about an hour and when I attempted to rinse/brush it off, there was very little difference than when I had started.  I would not use this again.",89381,4086

They stay for a few days (unless you want to scrub them off).  Overall, they are great!  My one suggestion is that the company should put instructions in with the tattoos.

4.0,1630004228560,Wonderful Lemon Scent,"The Lemon Oil Towelettes have a delicious lemon scent.  This comes with 20 towelettes, each individually wrapped.  I don't like this for environmental reasons but I do like that they are wrapped for traveling.  I bring these to work with me and wipe down my hands or face halfway through the day.  I absolutely love the smell.  I am usually very sensitive to scents but these do not bother me at all.  The towelettes leave my hands feeling nice and they do not dry out my skin.  I deducted one star because they are very expensive (I could just use a bottle of lemon essential oil on a paper towel) but I guess you pay for convenience.  If they were priced less I would definitely give five stars.",89381,2242

4.0,1617754155101,Beautiful face palette,"This face palette is so pretty—the blush is the perfect shade for my light/fair skin and blends out beautifully. The blush is not super pigmented, but I prefer my blushes to be blendable so they look more natural. The gold highlighter is gorgeous, it is not glittery but more of a shimmer. It is buildable, so you can make it look natural or blinding. The contour/bronzer is probably my least favorite part of the palette but I still like it. It was a little difficult to blend, it blends out best with a big, fluffy brush. The shade is somewhere between a contour and bronzer, it’s a little too warm for my skin to be used as a contour so I blend it out more like a bronzer. I have really been enjoying this palette lately and have been reaching for it often ever since I received it!",89383,14026

This means I am teaching in person and my remote students log on at certain times for lessons. So I wear this contraption for 30 minutes at a time. I teach pre k and my mask does not allow children to accurately hear me. I cannot take my mask of because I also have students in person.

3.0,1657316741518,Only Got Half,"Unfortunately, I only got half of them, so I wasn't able to accurately review these. I got the lemon, tea tree, peach, and jasmine ones. Since I got the set mainly for the rose and coconut ones, I was definitely disappointed.<br /><br />The four that I did receive do smell decent. The scent is pretty mild. In my opinion, of the ones that I got, the jasmine and the peach smell the best. They do provide some suds, but they definitely don't suds up as well as I had hoped. They are a good size for putting in your purse, backpack, or another bag, and they will work in a clean-up emergency. Even if I'd gotten all eight packages, I probably wouldn't get these again.",93156,23334
2.0,1632155680391,Definitely Not For Oily Skin,"The first thing I noticed about this product was the scent. It's a strong, earthy scent, much like I would expect from a pile of pulled-up weeds that had been sitting around for a few days. The scent lingered to the point that I've had to use scented moisturizer to cover up the smell.<br /><br />For me, the texture was a bit odd considering it's dispensed through a dropper. I'm guessing that's so you get the right amount and so that you don't end up using too much. For me, though, because it's a bit thick, I felt like a bottle where I could squirt the product out would make more sense.<br /><br />One good thing is that a little bit of this product does go a long way. When you squirt the product out of the dropper, you might think that it wouldn't be enough to cover your whole face. Fortunately, it is. That means that even though there is only one ounce of product in the container, it will likely last for a while.<br /><br />I have dry skin. While it's not too bad during the summer, I do use moisturizers specifically for dry skin most of the winter. Yet, this felt a little greasy on my face. It was like it didn't quite seep into my skin. Even a few hours later, my face felt slightly greasy. I tried it without using a moisturizer after putting it on, and it still felt greasier than expected. I think that come winter, when my skin is really dry, this might work without feeling too greasy, but I would definitely not suggest this for anyone with oily skin.<br /><br />While some people may love the smell, that combined with the greasy feeling and a price tag of $62 for an ounce, makes this a product that I would not get again or suggest to someone else.",93156,19186
5.0,1628533234948,Nice Mascara,"These are really nice mascaras. They go on easily and provide nice coverage. Since they are waterproof, I was concerned that it might be difficult to wash off, but it has come off without an issue. For this price, this is definitely a good mascara option.",93156,703
5.0,1614712420174,You Get Used to the Scent,"When I first started using this, I really did not like the scent. I was expected something citrusy, but that's not the scent I got. I'm not entirely sure how to describe it, but I assume that the smell comes from the lemon peels because it's kind of a fermented, musty, fishy smell. As I've used the serum more and more, I've adjusted to the smell. It's not great, but it's not horrible either. Given a scale of 0-10, with 0 being the most disgusting thing that I've ever smelled, 10 being the most amazing thing I've ever smelled, and 5 being neutral, neither good nor bad, I'd give this about a 4.8 when it comes to smell.<br /><br />Fortunately, the smell is fairly mild, and I can get past the slightly unpleasant smell because the product works well. It has made my face feel softer and smoother. I have a few dark spots on my face. After just two times using this, I noticed that they were a little lighter. With continued use, they have continued to fade.",93156,2221
5.0,1611603763666,They Are Great!,"I've tried a few different facial sheet masks, and these are probably my favorites. One of the top reasons is the price. As of right now, the assortment pack of 12 is $1.25 per mask, and the larger packages are under a dollar a mask. For that price, I honestly wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I was surprised to find that these masks are at least as good as the ones that selling for twice the price or more.<br /><br />Another reason that I really like these masks is the way that they fit. While I like the end result of facial sheet masks, they often feel like they are too big for my face. I often feel like I either have to not have the holes for my eyes and mouth matching up, or I have to have weird wrinkles in the mask for everything to line up. With these masks, all the holes line up really well.<br /><br />I also like how moisturizing these masks are. My face just feels really smooth and soft after using one of these masks. While most of the masks look pretty similar to your typical masks, the panda one is also fun to use. I've included some pictures of what it looks like. I think it would be fun to buy the large pack of these for a sleepover, a girls' night, or even as part of a bachelorette party. While all of them would be fun to use with friends, the panda one provides an especially fun photo opportunity. The hibiscus also smells really nice. I don't think I've ever had a facial sheet mask that was hibiscus-scented, so that's also a little unique.",93156,971
3.0,1607543558271,The Smell Is Overwhelming,"I like the smell of lemon, so I really expected to like this hand soap a lot. Unfortunately, it's not a citrusy fresh lemon scent like I would want for a soap or another product that I'd put on my body. Instead, it reminds me more of a wood furniture polish smell. It's a pretty strong scent too. You can definitely smell it as you are washing your hands. Unfortunately, that smell lingers. I could still smell it on my hands about an hour after washing them. It also seemed to dry out my hands a lot more than other hand soaps that I've been using lately. I found that using a scented lotion on my hands after using this soap did help with both the wood furniture polish smell and with my dry hands.<br /><br />This soap does lather up well. I'm not a fan of the texture, though. For me, it felt like I had a slimy film on my hands. While I'm sure that other people will like this soap, I was not a fan.",93156,726
4.0,1607467298298,Small But Nice,"These are fairly small shields of soap. While the scent isn't overwhelmingly strong, you can definitely smell it when you are using the soap or if the soap is not in a container even when you are in the same room. We have a couple of bars sitting next to our bathroom sink, and you can smell them when you walk into the bathroom. To me, the most obvious scent is the clove. The other scents are cinnamon, oregano, rosemary, peppermint, parsley, and eucalyptus.<br /><br />I've liked the soap so far. It lathers up well. It's kind of a weird experience to wash with this. It's not really a scent that I generally associate with cleaning myself. While these scents might remind you more of your favorite Italian dish than what you would normally use as soap, if these are all smells that you generally enjoy, it's worth trying this soap.",93156,729
4.0,1605121665137,Depends on the Item,"This set comes with three different products. They are all in small packaging, but you don't need to use a lot, so they should last a while. My opinion on each product differs a lot, so I'll provide a short review of each item.<br /><br />*Instant Foaming Cleanser: I love this one. It's my favorite. It smells wonderful, and it just feels great going on my skin and after I've rinsed it off. You really don't need much. I found that if I pressed down the top about halfway, I got enough to cover my whole face. For me, the cleanser is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />*Glycolic Peel Mask: While I felt like the mask did its job fine, I wasn't a fan of the smell at all. The best way that I can explain it is to say that it smells like wood to me. It's like I'm sniffing the bark of a tree. I'm not sure where that smell came from. It's not a horrible smell. It's just that I've had other masks that work just as well and have a more appealing smell. I'd probably give this one 3 stars.<br /><br />*Spray Beauty Elixir: This one is the hardest for me to review. When I first used it, I did not like it at all. While I like the smell, it's a bit overwhelming. The first time I used it, it also stung in a few spots. I know that this isn't how it was meant to be used, but I found that for me, it works best when I spray it on my hands and then pat my face with it. After using it a few times, it started to grow on me, and it does seem to moisturize my skin well. I'd give this 4 stars.<br /><br />Overall, this set evens out to 4 stars. It's a nice set, and if, like me, you haven't tried products by this brand before, this is a good way to sample them to decide what you like and what you don't like.",93156,42798
5.0,1604070828404,So Many Butterflies,"There are sheets and sheets of butterflies in different sizes, ranging from small enough for a child's nails all the way up to big enough that I'd need long fake nails to use them. Even though they are all butterflies, there are a variety of styles. There are multicolored butterflies as well as some in a single color. You can really create the design that fits your style.<br /><br />There are directions on each sheet of butterflies, although the directions are the same for all of them. The directions are easy to follow even though they aren't always grammatically correct. My one complaint would be that I wish that there were directions for using the two jars of holographic butterflies. I'm sure that I can figure it out somewhere online, and it's probably pretty similar to how you apply the stickers, but directions still would have been nice. You really get an impressive amount for this price.",93156,836
4.0,1600706072855,Can Be Crumbly,"I feel like these do a good job of making rough skin a lot smoother. After just one use, I did notice that my skin was not quite as rough. Each time that I've used them, I've noticed my skin is a little smoother and softer. I think I've used it five or six times now. I'm used both the pumice stone side and the colored side. I actually like the colored side better, but when using the colored side, it leaves behind a bit of a grimy residue. If you're using it in the shower, as I do, this isn't a huge deal as you can just rinse it off. It does, though, make me wonder how long the colored side will last if it keeps coming apart a little each time that I use it.",93156,2366
4.0,1622407887979,These work pretty well,"I put these on my pimply teens and they seem to work pretty well. One kid had a pretty big zit on his nose and this drew everything out in a few hours.  The pimple didn't disappear; there was still a red spot that needed time to heal. But it did speed up the process.  I think the Tea Tree oil made the difference.<br /><br />They're not exactly invisible, but they're not too noticeable.  The guys didn't wear them to school, but they did wear them out of the house a few times and they didn't seem to remember that they were there.  They're fairly easy to apply and remove.  They were even able to sleep with them on, though they did rub off and stick to the sheets.  I do like that there are different sizes.<br /><br />I wouldn't call this a ""miracle"", but it worked well enough.",93194,25084
5.0,1620680148351,Great for dry skin,"I use this product daily as part of my evening routine.  Not only is the lotion soothing and moisturizing, it also has a relaxing lavender scent. The scent starts out strong - then fades - so it's not annoying.  I wash my hands a lot during the day and wash dishes as well. This has made a difference in how soothed my skin feels in the evening.<br /><br />It seems to absorb in pretty well after a minute or two, which is nice. No greasy feel here.<br /><br />It comes packaged in individual gift boxes, which are OK looking.  If I were giving this to a friend I might take it out of the box and tie a ribbon on it instead.  The tubes are marketed as ""travel size"" and they are small enough to tuck into a bag or a med/large purse.",93194,964
5.0,1618145916769,Skin feels great,"Using this mask feels like an experience,  from the light, pleasing scent to the way my skin feels afterward.  I find that I need to shake the container a few times to make sure all the ingredients are blended. The clay mask spreads easily - the consistency is on the thin side, but it provides good coverage.  There's a slight scent to the clay - but it dissipates after a couple of minutes.  I take the mask off with some warm water and a facecloth or silicone brush.  Afterward my pores look smaller and I've experienced no irritation with this product.  My skin feels slightly dry - but not uncomfortable - afterward, but that is because the excess oil has been removed. I just use my usual product that I apply before bedtime.<br /><br />This mask works great on my combination skin.",93194,430
4.0,1601837265660,Botanical scent,"I've used a few different Vitamin C products on my skin. This one is not my favorite to wear, but it still works well.  It's oily at first, so you need to allow some time for this to absorb and dry before your skin touches anything. After it dries, my skin just feels well hydrated and not greasy.<br /><br />The scent.  It can be off-putting to some.  My kids think I smell weird.  I like the citrus and spice scent--once I got used to it.  There are a lot of competing herbal scents. I think it's the rosemary and bergamot combo that my family is smelling. Though there's also basil extract and white grapefruit.  It fades pretty quickly.<br /><br />I haven't had any skin issues or breakouts since I started using this.  I have combination skin and still get an occasional pimple. This serum has salicylic acid in it which is my go-to for acne.<br /><br />So, while I do like it and it works well with my skin, I think I'd choose something a little less herbal-smelling. However, I will use the whole bottle.  It should last a long time since a few drops is all I need each day.",93194,81
4.0,1653943559752,Good Moisturizer,"This is a nice body moisturizer that softens and hydrates your skin.  It absorbs well and has a nice scent.  The moisturizing effect isn't as long-lasting as I would like, but it's still a good lotion.",93203,2200
4.0,1649544495146,Good Body Scrub,"This is a good body scrub that exfoliates plus moisturizes your skin.  It also smells great.  Although it contains oils, it doesn't leave your skin excessively oily once you rinse it off.  It just leaves your skin soft and smooth.",93203,2796
4.0,1633993026917,Very Convenient,"These towelettes are great for keeping in your car's glove compartment, putting inside your tote bag, or stashing away in your office desk.  They're very handy for times when you can't get to a sink and use soap and water.  They also smell great.  They're a little pricey for everyday use, so I took off one star for that.",93203,2242
5.0,1633905649158,Great Set,"This is a very nice set of sea buckthorn oil products.  Sea buckthorn helps with a variety of skin problems.  My main issue is age spots.  The topical products help right away, by softening and moisturizing your skin as well as reducing any redness or discoloration.  The soft gels help long-term by repairing from within.  I think it's a great idea to have an entire set of products packaged all together.  It's nice not only for yourself, but would make a great gift for somebody this holiday season.",93203,3582
4.0,1622837956115,Good Set,"Avocado oil seems to be good at moisturizing without being greasy.  I have some body lotion with avocado oil and really like that, so I decided to try this shampoo/conditioner set.  It does a very good job of cleaning your hair and leaving it shiny and bouncy.  I still prefer coconut oil for hair, but avocado oil is doing a good job, too.",93203,131
4.0,1619384514410,Good Dry Shampoo,This dry shampoo does a really good job of making your hair look clean and also adding some volume.  It's also a great size for taking to the gym to use after a workout.,93203,711
4.0,1617823112879,Nice Towels,These hair towels are very soft and comfortable.  This set is a good value because you get 5 of them.  They're well-made and should last a long time.,93203,14266
4.0,1614466714088,Very Moisturizing,"This shampoo does an excellent job of moisturizing (and cleaning) your hair.  However, you don't want to use it more than 3-4 times a week, because the castor oil builds up and starts making your hair look greasy.  I alternate it with another shampoo, and it works great that way.",93203,972
4.0,1605390263959,Okay,"I like the twist towel a lot, but I found the shower-cap-like towel to be a little hard to use.  My hair is below shoulder-length, and it just didn't work well for me.  The twist towel is great, though.  I didn't care for the hair ties and won't be using those.  If you have longer hair and just want some twist towels, I would go with a different product because the cap probably won't work for you.  But if you're hair is shorter, this set would be a pretty good choice.",93203,141
5.0,1602449679979,Nice,"This shampoo and conditioner set is very moisturizing, but doesn't leave your hair limp or greasy-looking.  It leaves my fine, shoulder-length hair bouncy and shiny.  The travel size is also very convenient.",93203,250
5.0,1549154115618,Detangles Well,"This is pretty good.  I was surprised at how well it worked for detangling wet hair.  The scent is also nice -- it does not smell like vinegar.  It does help with frizziness, too, on those really humid days.  It also reduces static electricity in your hair on really dry days.  I would definitely use this again.",93203,2314
5.0,1608267941886,"Thank G-d, a company that understands that scents are bad","OK, so I have used ampules for many years, of various kinds, since I started the Korean skin care routine. I cannot speak to the power of the ingredients here, because generally these things take time to show results. But I did like the creamy feel and the way this felt on my skin. I've been curious about trying pro-biotics for some time, and the other ingredients intrigued me, but only time will tell if this changes anything at all. If you are buying this, you are more or less in the same boat. What I DEFINITELY appreciate is that this is scent free. So many products feel the need to load up on supposedly ""mild"" fragrance. Well, NEWS FLASH! A ""mild"" scent can quickly become overwhelming when mixed with other products as you do in the Korean method. Secondly, people who are sensitive to scents (triggers migraines) are more common than you might think. Having a perfume in a face product serves no purpose at all, and I am grateful that this company understands.<br /><br />The label on the bottle is completely in Korean, which means you can't tell what is inside. I had to come here to see. That is a small thing, and did not effect my opinion of the product.",93219,314
3.0,1606764541074,"Cute, but didn't hold well, and cheaply made.","I've never seen a hair band like this before, and I was eager to try something that might give my style a slight upgrade without a lot of effort. The hair band is a cheap plastic, and the clips don't have a lot of staying power, so I doubt these will last very long. However, they aren't more expensive than similar products from the major brands, so if you are going to spend money on hair bands, you already know what they cost. I found the band to be a little loose on my head, and the clips did not hold the hair in place for very long. However, possibly I didn't use enough hair (or used too much?), or my hair is too thick for this to work as advertised. Still, this is cute enough that I would give them a try. Definitely a cute look if you are looking for an easy style.",93219,40517
3.0,1542221081238,"Strong scent; nice feel, but don't know if it really works","I've been using a Korean skin care routine for several months now, and I am thrilled with the results. This is my first experience with a snail cream, so I really cannot compare this to anything else I have been using. The cream feels good going on, and seems to absorb well, but the scent is a little strong for my taste. I can't vouch for any magic wrinkle reduction, but I had no bad reaction to the cream (like others report). My main issue is the scent, which is strong and fruity, although not unpleasant. I just am hypersensitive to odors, and prefer products that keep this to a minimum.",93219,1200
5.0,1536066278590,Amazing! I love this!,"I have been trying the Korean Skin system for about a month and had a Korean water-based cleanser that I used to follow my oil cleanser. I received this product as a trial, and I was amazed by the reults. The pump and foam action makes application easy, and the soap goes on smoothly and feels great. The scent is mild and pleasant, which is a real plus given that I tend to be hypersensitive to strong odors. My skin really felt clean and fresh, and I actually liked this better than some of the highly rated Korean products. I will buy this again.",93219,1967
5.0,1653588357980,My cat digs this brush,"My cat loves this new brush.  Her previous favorite just had wire bristles and I was always afraid they'd be too harsh on her skin or accidentally poke her eye out.  This brush has little rounded plastic tips on each bristle.  She still gets the scratchy sensation she likes with less danger.  The ""fur eject"" button works flawlessly to remove the hair after each brushing.  AND it comes with a bristle cover to keep the bristles from getting bent in storage.  They've thought of everything!",93220,2009
5.0,1648060563289,I'm a sucker for anything citrus,"Citrus is my favorite scent when it comes to beauty products.  Or cleaning products for that matter....  It just brightens up my mood in a way that a floral scent can't do.  This lotion has a decent citrus smell to it with a touch of a sweet undertone.  It moisturized my winter-dry skin well without being sticky.  Sadly, the price puts it in the ""splurge"" category for my budget.",93220,2200
4.0,1609733781545,"100% ""natural"" not 100% Aloe Vera","I got this hoping I'd be able to use it to soothe my skin post-radiation treatments.  Sadly, I did not notice that this is not 100% Aloe Vera gel as was recommended by my doctor.  It is ""100% organic and natural"", for whatever that's worth.  At least Aloe Vera is the first listed ingredient.  It also contains Vitamin C and E which might be OK but  Hyaluronic acid is hardly what I'd want to put on tender, inflamed skin from radiation.  I'm not even sure I'd want to use this on a sunburn.<br /><br />So anyway, I've used it on other parts of my body that weren't zapped by radiation instead.  I like the smell.  It moisturizes well and the pump dispenser is easy to use.  However, it leaves my skin feeling kind of sticky.  Couldn't wait to go wash my hands after rubbing it on my legs.",93220,301

But it does!  I just barely dampen one small section with plain tap water and am able to wipe away liquid foundation, eye shadow and mascara.  I use a different section for the next day and toss the cloth in the wash at the end of the week.  I confess, that I don't normally wash my face at night.  I hate using those prepackaged make up remover wipes.  Single-use disposable products seem wasteful and environmentally unfriendly to me in general plus they are just like a cold slap on your face right before bed.  Even if I use cold water on this cloth, it didn't seem that cold on my face and there is no waste or ongoing cost other than washing.  My pillow case appreciates this product!",93220,100
4.0,1543606158063,Not bad but there are better choices,"This is the 2nd hair straightener I've had the opportunity to try.  The other is the Furiden Professional Hair Straightener Titanium Flat Iron.  I'm going to write this review as a comparison between the two since they are in the same price range.  For starters, both heat up quickly, have variable temperature settings, automatic shut off and a swivel cord.  The Autenpoo (who comes up with these brand names???) brand has a mechanical on/off switch that also serves as the heat selector.  I prefer this over the Furiden which has on/off buttons and up/down buttons to set the temp on a digital screen.  If I want, I can leave the Autenpo's dial set on the temp I want (the lowest setting it has), unplug it when I'm done, plug it in the next day and it will just turn on and go to my favorite temp.  With the Furiden, I have to hold a button down to turn it on and then hit the down button 4 or 5 times to go to the lowest temp.  The Autenpoo also comes with a comb, some hair clips to section your hair during styling and a heat protective glove, and has a slide lock to keep it shut when not in use.  In all other aspects however, I prefer the Furiden.  Autenpoo's cord is super thick bulky, seriously like a vacuum cleaner cord.  It will probably last forever but adds unnecessary bulk and weight which would be especially problematic for traveling.  The main advantage Furiden has is the pointed end.  Not only is it better suited to tight areas close to your scalp or neckline but it can also help section your hair without needing a comb or your fingers.  Furthermore, the plates, which are longer overall, extend into the pointed tip to get the heat right where you need it.  Both of these irons do a perfectly fine job, but I just find the Furiden easier to use.",93220,149

Each color is a different scent, and most scents are nice. Of course, I like some better than others, but that's a matter of personal preference. One sheet was plenty for washing my hands.

The clips come in three colors: black, gold, and matte silver. You get two of each color. I have extremely long hair and I wear it up 95% of the time. The clips hold well – wet or dry hair. They're not huge or bulky. I've tried many clips. As for these, they're perfect! Best hair accessory. I don't leave home without one.",94472,242
4.0,1606859618734,Eyelash Serum,"I've used an eyelash serum before and had some success with it in the past. Hoping for positive results from BEPHOLAN serum. Ingredients are reported to be natural ingredients such as hydrolyzed oat protein, olive glycerides, and sodium hyaluronate. After doing a bit of online investigation about sodium hyaluronate, there is some indication that it can assist in hair growth. It may moisturize the hair shaft and keep it from breakage. Turns out, it could help hair growth. So, does this apply to eyelashes? Hmm. The serum comes in a mascara tube. Instead of applying with a brush, the serum is applied to the eye with a mascara wand. I've gotta say - I thought this would be better applied to roots, but the serum doesn't seem to adhere to the wand as it would to a small brush-on wand. I have to really dig the wand into the container to get the serum to stick to the applicator. My solution is to use my own small paintbrush. Thankfully, it seems to apply to my lashes much better. I've been using this lash serum for less than a week. I don't normally post reviews until I've had noticeable improvements. The product description says that lashes may show improvement within two weeks. I will post an update in two weeks to a month. I believe consistency is key with most of these products. I use it twice a day on days that I'm on top of my game. It's quick and easy. Most days, though, it's once a day. BEPHOLAN Cosmetics suggests taking a BEFORE and AFTER picture of your lashes. Stay tuned.",94472,2491

It rinsed clean and didn't leave that residue that some other soaps leave behind. I felt squeaky clean. Follain gets a ten from me!",94472,295
5.0,1604718908541,MOMENTUM Face Serum,"What woman doesn't love cosmetics and everything that entails? I'm always keeping my eyes open for beneficial face creams and serums. I became obsessed with healthy skin after moving to Puerto Rico. We all of us know about the sun's damaging effects. It's harmful to all skin, not just those with aging skin. Algae can quite possibly reduce the breakdown of hyaluronic acid within the skin. Algae subspecies have anti-aging benefits. Undaria pinnatifida extract is shown to reduce wrinkle depth and improve over-all skin appearance. It also helps to protect the skin's natural stores of collagen and hyaluronic acid. The alteromonas ferment extract is found in deep seawater algae. It has binding properties that help hydration. Salicornia herbacea extract contains good-for-the-skin things – increasing skin barrier and deep hydration. It might even help the skin recover. Caprylic triglyceride reduces dryness and has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal properties. It will not clog pores and is suitable for people with oily skin. Arginine protects the skin from free radicals that contribute to fine lines. Arginine in cosmetics hydrates and boosts collagen production. The parfum ingredient is not damaging to the skin. Maltol and POLYQUATERNIUM-80 (plant-based) is used in cosmetics regularly and deemed safe.  NMF (Natural Moisturizing Factor) components work to keep skin supple and hydrated. The combination of these ingredients is a friend to the skin's health. Understanding what's in our products ensures that we are buying serums we actually want to put on our faces. Knowing all of this, I am 100% satisfied with applying this serum. The smell is reminiscent of cotton candy. It isn't overpowering. In fact, I think it enhances my want to use. It feels indulgent. It smells incredible. It appears to be working well for me. I have nothing to say about this product but great, great things!",94472,1550
4.0,1603223452267,Bouquet Garni Body Shower Gel,"Since COVID, finding soap and shower gels isn't the easiest task. Not sure if people are drinking gels in the shower or just really self-conscious about cleanliness. Either way, I often find myself ordering products online. The selection at physical stores is iffy. Ran across this product and decided to give it a try. After all, the packaging is attractive. If anything it will look nice in a guest bathroom IF I ever have guests at my house again.<br /><br />First, the size is great. Almost 18 ounces! Popular brands offer a hand pump with 7.5 oz. Bouquet Garni is double the size. That's a good thing. Less I've gotta get out. I'm not crazy about the White Musk smell. It's a floral scent. I'm more of a woodsy, fruity scent. On the other hand, my mother loves this scent. So, while I planned to use this as a shower gel, I've decided to use it in the guest bath. Mom can enjoy the rich lather every time she washes her hands.<br /><br />Made in Korea. I'm not sure of the ingredients because the back label is foreign. I'm sure the website offers ingredients if one must know.",94472,296
4.0,1603220967018,Vitamin C Serum,"Not my favorite Vit C serum. While it supplies major moisture, my skin did not appreciate the thickness. When I woke up the first morning after using my face felt greasy. It didn't appear to have that sheer feeling of a clean moisturizer. Afterward, I applied the serum every other night. Four days later, I had breakouts on my nose. I have combination skin. This didn't work well for me, but I can see this working for those with severely dry skin.",94472,81
4.0,1650819508318,"SmoothSkin IPL Hair Remover seems to be working and fast, easy to use","IPL hair removal is not an immediate fix for hair removal. None of them are.  There is a bit to learn before using successfully, so do some homework beforehand and read the manual. And it's important to know it's not for every skin type nor is it a ""permanent"" fix.  You will have to use occasionally to maintain. That being said, this is one of the better IPL I have tried.  Anything that keeps me from shaving is a plus.<br />There is a bit of ""pain"" like needle pricks but after repeated use, it gets less noticeable. There is a precision guard that also helps buffer a bit.  The cord is annoyingly clunky. Not sure why it's so bulky.  There isn't an on/off. Unplug when you're done.  It's a bit large for travel, especially if you're keeping it in the box.  No glasses, surprisingly.  Some small improvements would definitely make this a 5 star review for me but certainly not a deal breaker.  High 4 stars for performance and ease of use.",94729,6007
2.0,1623941481084,Why didn't they include a brush saver and extra brushes?!,"If you don't already have extra brushes and the brush saver, this set is useless after one or 2 nails.<br />Something about these liquids wreaks havoc on brushes and usually after one or 2 nails your brushes are toast. That's why they make the saver and usually include extra brushes.<br />The scent is very obnoxious and should be used in well ventilated area.  I can not recommend this product at all.",94729,2533
4.0,1622310463079,Good kit for beginner or intermediate. Pretty much everything you need.,"First off, there's a LOT in this set.  Pretty much all the tools you need, some better quality than others but overall quite good.  The lamp is big. It has 3 (actually 4) settings.  30, 60 and 120 buttons and when you put your hand in it auto goes to 90.  Big enough to do whole hand or toes at a time. The detachable cord fits snug in the back (not a USB, a real plug).  The cord is about 3 ft long.  Base is attached.  8 color polishes ranging nude to red and brown.  I got 2 duplicate colors.  That may have been a boo boo.  Base coat, no-wipe clear top coat and frost (matte) top coat.  Bottles are smaller than regular size but for the price it's not a deal-breaker. Gloss top coat was surprisingly shiny.  Matte has a velvety look.  Lots of embellishments; seed beads, rhinestones, chunky glitter and glitter powder (which I had no luck with) but no applicators, all in tiny pots and wheel with an opening. I found the wheel to be a bit of a pain and the rhinestones stuck to the top and transferred to the next pot when turning.  The rhinestones are super tiny and difficult to pick up even with the weeding tweezers included. No adhesive so you just have to paint top coat and place before curing. This would be an excellent purchase for a beginner (to intermediate) wanting to try several different looks.  Well worth the price.  Most everything met my expectations. I would be eager to try other products from this brand.",94729,30712
2.0,1618084366762,Feels luxurious but little to no results,"Smells and feels great.  Feels very luxurious. A little goes a long way.  However, I haven't noticed any decrease in wrinkles with continued use.  For the cost/results, I would definitely not purchase.",94729,978
5.0,1609193770770,Sparkly colors and buildable black,I really can't complain at all about this set.  Colors are very pretty.  Easy to apply and cure.  I love the fact it comes with black polish.  The black is sheer but that is kind of a plus with this set because it allows buildable color.  You may not want a dark black behind the glitter.  A couple of the colors are similar and unless they are side by side it's harder to tell them apart but overall I love it. I really love the fact that I can have beautiful glitter nails without the scratchy feel.  I would order Pine products again.  They don't smell bad either.,94729,16372
4.0,1600958826547,"Great toner, great brush.  Full coverage, matte finish","They are a bit too light for my skin tone but they work.  The toner is so silky I wasn't even sure any was going on my skin.  I am almost 52 and have the expected lines in my face for that age.  The toner is a must for mature skin. I tried it without it and the foundation settled in my lines. With the toner it stayed suspended well.  The foundations are a bit thick and it felt like I was painting my face on, but with a bit of work it blended nicely. The kabuki brush is soft and full. No bristles came off.  I believe if the shade matches your skin well, it would be an excellent product. I did have to apply a bronzer over because it was a bit lighter than my skin.  Full coverage, matte finish.",94729,11888
3.0,1598567167869,"Pots are kinda messy. No base, top coat or brush.  Glitter is pretty.","You will need base and top coat and a scooper/brush tool. They are not included. It took 3 coats of the black polish (included) to get full, dark coverage.  The pots are messy to open and quite small, but colors are pretty and sparkly.  Lots of glitter effect with multiple coats.  You will need a brush as well.  The finish feels bumpy (you can feel the glitter).  Maybe multiple top coat would help but I didn't want more layers since I already had base, 3 layers of color, 2 layers of glitter and a top coat.",94729,1555
3.0,1597593538002,Not exactly a starter kit,"The light is small and shallow. Thumb has to cure separately.  This ""complete"" kit is not exactly complete. It has a micro USB cord but no box. Very basic nstructions. No times noted for curing. No color included.  Assuming I cured for the correct time, I had a couple nails that smudged off when I wiped with alcohol.  Most didn't. Top coat is exceptionally shiny.  I have other Red Carpet items that I'm quite pleased with. This kit fell a bit short on expectations. As a starter kit, it's one you'll have to add a few things to (file, USB box, nail color, etc.) so be aware of that.  The Purify cleaner has a light scent, but is a small bottle. I like the top coat.  Kit is decent but not great.",94729,6009
3.0,1595997571540,It's quiet.  Not super powerful,"I do like that the 3 different grit rollers can be flipped right on the head.  It is quiet. I charged it several hours before using it, but it began lagging quickly.  I plugged it in and kept using it and didn't notice much difference while plugged in.  The description recommend only use 2 or 3 seconds at a time but I didn't find any reason why it would say that.  It wasn't very powerful, but I did see a considerable amount of very fine skin.  It didn't collect in the little tray that I could tell.  It claims to work wet or dry.  I will leave the wet testing to someone with less candles on their cake than I.  My feet felt better after using.<br />I believe there are better ones than this at a competitive price point.  It did work so I have to give it at least 3 ☆☆☆.  It was quiet so that's a plus.  The charge cord is very short.",94729,297

2.0,1630715757586,Overpriced,"Honestly, this is just ok. It doesn’t do a whole lot since it isn’t rough. I was looking for something that would better exfoliate. Definitely overpriced. I wouldn’t buy it again.",94959,387
3.0,1628864954140,Expensive,"I have been using this device for a full three months. I can honestly say that I don’t think it’s made a whole lot of difference in my under eye area.<br /><br />The device is easy to use and has different levels. It holds a charge very well. Occasionally I would get a little “zap” but it wasn’t anything super painful.<br /><br />This device is pretty expensive. Weighing the cost versus the results, I personally wouldn’t buy this again.",94959,8
4.0,1620580835851,Great gift,These are very cute scrunchies for a bridesmaid gift. The pack comes with 6 pink and 1 white. It’s a shiny material and looks pretty. These would be great in a proposal box or for the wedding.,94959,220
5.0,1619379061136,Pretty contour,"This is a very pretty contour kit. It has a blush color, hi lighter and a darker contour color. I like that the packaging isn’t huge which makes it good for travel. The colors are very pretty and they last on my face all day. I would buy this again.",94959,14026

This is a bit expensive for what it is, but is a fun splurge.",94959,979
5.0,1604869575656,Value pack,"I’ve used this brand for years so I was excited to find this value pack! The packaging is beautiful and could make a nice Christmas gift.

This is an excellent value.",94959,311

I've used it just in my hands to wash my face really quickly, and I've also used it with my facial cleansing brush to get a deeper clean. It smells amazing. It has a thicker consistency and lathers, which I really like because it makes my face feel extra clean. Would buy this again!",94959,1010

3.0,1615650299739,"Great packaging, no results so far though","I really like this roller... it is so convenient and easy to apply (and also feels good doing it).  I appreciate that I have had no skin sensitivity, and there is no aroma at all (which is important to me because I wear contacts and often a scent will irritate my eyes - no problem with this serum).  The ingredients seem relatively standard other than the addition of caffeine.  While I like the roller and packaging and the way this feels when applying, I am not noticing any results.  The serum applies *very* thinly... you can barely tell anything has come out of the roller at all.  Because I didn’t experience any effect I thought that maybe the issue was a lack of serum actually being applied and so I started applying it more frequently, and still no noticeable effect for me.  It does provide some moisturization, without leaving a sheen, but doesn’t work as well as another serum that I have used (which also has a very similar roller type application).  I will continue to use it and maybe the results are just delayed... if so I will update the review.  Hope this is helpful to you...",94963,8697
5.0,1612621464548,Excellent quality on all components,"These amber glass bottles, and included components, are of excellent quality.  I have ordered glass bottles in the past and while the bottles themselves were always okay, the sprayer was often inferior (plus they usually don’t have the other components such as labels, funnel, marking pen, caps).  The glass bottles are great, gorgeous color and sturdy glass.  Colored bottles are needed for certain liquids (peroxide, for example, always comes in an amber/brown container to protect it from light).  The sprayer is high quality and is sturdy.  The spray action is also great - you can set it on mist or stream.  As I noted, the sprayer has been my downfall on previous bottle purchases, so I am happy to see that the sprayers on these are top notch.  You also get two screw on caps in case you don’t want to use the sprayer (or need to transport them and are concerned about leakage).  It also includes 4 labels and a white marking pen, as well as a small stainless steel funnel.  Every component included in the set is top notch, and the totality of the package makes it an excellent value.  I will also note that the bottles and components were very well packaged to protect them during the shipping process.  Overall a definite winner.  Hope this review is helpful to you!",94963,234
4.0,1601125786051,"Excellent quality glass, ok nozzle, great color","The glass bottles are top notch - the glass is nice and thick, and the color is beautiful.  The ‘look’ of the bottle is so nice that it actually looks good sitting around anywhere (i.e. you don’t feel the need to hide it in a cabinet, under the counter, etc.).  The nozzle is ok.  It works well, and looks nice with the glass, but doesn’t feel particularly sturdy.  Having said that, it is far better than some others I have had where the nozzle sort of swiveled around while you were attempting to spray (VERY annoying).  There are two settings - a fine mist and a more narrow spray/mist.  Between the two settings you should be able to get the spray you want/need.  It also comes with nice blackboard style labels, two small funnels, and two screw on caps.  The caps are nice in case you want to better seal the contents for some reason - for example, if it won’t be in use for a while, packing it for a trip, etc.  Colored glass is needed for a number of liquids that you might have - peroxide, for example, or an essential oil blend.  The blue in these bottles is just really beautiful, and combined with the black sprayer, creates an attractive bottle so you will be pleased with both the functionality as well as the look.  This is the reason I chose these bottles because I use one of them to mix up a ‘spider repellent’ spray (water, peppermint oil, and a couple of drops of dish detergent), and it stays on the screened in porch.  Hope this review helps you!",94963,1815
4.0,1600734728395,"Great ergonomics, doesn’t have beard/mustache trimmer","This razor looks sharp, and has great ergonomics - fitting really nicely in your hand, and making it easier to use.  Because I have a beard and mustache (neatly trimmed) I am using the razor on my cheeks and the under part of my neck, so ergonomics are important and this performs great.  The blades are nice and sharp, giving a nice, clean cut with no pulling.  It can take some getting used to the controls... there are two speeds, and the lower speed isn’t adequate for me, but the faster speed is.  Read the instructions closely to make sure you know how to use (they are pretty good, although REALLY tiny print!).  I like that it can be used wet or dry, and is easy to clean.  The only thing that I wish it had was a beard/mustache/sideburn trimmer, but overall it is a nice trimmer, especially for traveling.",94963,29366
3.0,1598566298759,"Glass bottle is top notch, sprayer is not","I got these to put water/vinegar mixture in one and alcohol in the other, to use for cleaning and disinfecting purposes, respectively.  I wanted glass, rather than plastic, for these purposes.  The bottles themselves are top notch - heavy duty glass, nice size that is easy to hold yet doesn’t require constant refilling.  There are two included cap tops which are also nice - leak-proof if you want to store something in them that you either don’t need the sprayer for, OR, are transporting them somewhere and want to make sure no spillage.  The sprayer on the other hand, is not so great.  I do like that the sprayer tube is extra long... meaning you can get down to the last few drops.  But it feels cheap overall.  Other problems with the sprayer:  the screw on top fits pretty firmly, but the nozzle does not stay in place - it sort of swivels around.  This gets to be annoying if you are squirting multiple squirts because the nozzle keeps shifting.  The other thing that might be an issue for some is that there are only two settings and they are BOTH mist settings.  It appears that one is a slightly finer mist than the other (barely) but I am not 100% sure that is even the case.  This is not a problem for me because of the purpose I am using them... but wanted to point this out in case it might be a problem for others.  Overall the glass bottles are great but the nozzles need some work.  It also comes with 4 black labels - the labels actually are sort of a thin rubbery material and seem really nice... but what the heck am I going to use to write on BLACK labels?",94963,2335
4.0,1596120146707,10” by 15” - larger size wipes,"These wipes are pretty good (albeit expensive).  I like that they are larger (10”x15”) and individually wrapped, which makes carrying them with you easier.  These would be great to take along on a hiking or camping trip, or any time you might want to wipe down your whole body.  I do NOT understand why the ad, pictures, description or box doesn’t include the size of the item - I find that oddly curious.  They have an interesting scent that I suspect some people may not like.  It is the chaparral scent which can smell a little ‘chemically’.  It isn’t bad but it *is* a somewhat unusual scent. After wiping down the scent does linger for a while, albeit somewhat lighter.  The wipes seem to have a lot of wiping power... it seemed that the moisture just remained as I wiped down most of my body.  They don’t feel any more moist than other wipes do, but it seems that the moisture goes a longer way.  Overall a very good product that is a little pricey, but does offer a nice convenience factor.",94963,2516
5.0,1665692193695,"Soft, nice mask",Item arrived securely boxed with all items nicely placed in the box. This eye mask rests against the eyes to provide heat over the eyes for folks who have a problem with clogged glands. My husband suffers from this problem and has been using other products that heat in the microwave but those have a quick temperature reduction. The beauty of this mask is the constant heat provided. It is adjustable and easy to use with multiple heat settings.,95820,8262
5.0,1638667691931,Fragrance is true to description,"This smells just like a peppermint mocha beverage. However, the kind of strong fragrance lessens  rather fast. After application my skin tingles from the mint for about 10 minutes. This is a lightweight moisturizer and it sinks in rather quickly. The cream is housed in a jar so you need to dig your fingers in to get the product. Not my favorite delivery system because it gets under my nails. As a long time body moisturizer user I think this is a terrific gift.",95820,1986
5.0,1637685117026,Impressive Gift,"The sentiment on the tumbler sets the tone for this gift box. ""Beauty begins the moment you love yourself"" is artistically written in alternating script and uppercase print on the dishwasher safe tumbler. The lid is plastic with a shuffle opening. The gift box includes a reusable straw and a small brush for cleaning. A wine plug with a heart on top is thoughtfully provided too. Two nice size bath bombs alsopopulate the arrangement. A single wick scented candle is a nice size for a bathroom and it adds fragrance without being overpowering. A square rose soap wrapped in cellophane finishes the presentation. This all comes in a gift box with a pretty ""Best Wishes"" enclosure card with a blank inside to write a few words of your own. I like that the fragrance is not overpowering when the box is opened, as each scented item is unwrapped you can experience the pleasant aroma of the product. The inside cover of the box says ""Be Happy Forever."" The outside of the box has the company name followed by Thinking of you. This is a perfect generic gift ready to affirm someone who needs it or to celebrate an occasion.",95820,374

5.0,1607745760026,Folds Flat,Personally I like this shower cap better than a more expensive one I already had. It comes flat so if you plan to travel with it it is a good choice.

This fits my average size head without drooping on to my forehead during a shower.,95820,2513
5.0,1561472019203,Terrific Value,"After buying name brand toothbrushes for years I was skeptical to try an off brand. So far both my husband and I are impressed with the quality of these brushes. They are firmer than the name brand brush but that is good because the brand brushes splay out the bristles long before the 3 month recommended change time. He tried this brush first and commented that his teeth felt so much cleaner, when I brushed later I agreed with his reaction. These come 4 in a package with color rings attached. The brushes are not individually wrapped so the extras went into a plastic bag for clean storage.",95820,2915

I'm surprised because I didn't expect to like it but I really enjoy it.  I've been using it after Thierry night cream.  It is really wet when you put it on. The little colored balls rub into your skin when you're applying.  It dries down and soaks into my skin so fast.  Plus it smells really good.  I love that it's a sleeping mask and you don't have to wash it off. I've got dry skin and the night cream alone wasn't enough moisture for me but adding this on top is so much better.,98780,2001
5.0,1662146111977,Love this!,[[VIDEOID:36d4410bf57b9b8fc73b6e62a0e7688b]] I've been dealing with dry eyes for a couple years now and I wear contacts so it can get pretty uncomfortable.  When I saw that these masks can help with dry eyes I had to give it a try. This has quickly become my favorite part of my nighttime routine.  It is so relaxing I think I could sleep with it on. I do wish it got a bit hotter but I guess they don't want you to burn your eyes.,98780,8262
5.0,1661302498636,I'm impressed!,This is my first time using essence eyeshadow and it will definitely not be my last. I never really use drug store eyeshadow and to be honest I don't think I have any in my collection.  But if this is the quality I can expect then that is about to change. I'm so impressed with the performance of these shadows! Most of the shades are buttery smooth and pigmented.  The mattes blend out so easily and I didn't get any patchiness. You do have to build these up but that is not necessarily a bad thing. There was quite a bit of kick up in the pan but I didn't get any fallout at all.  This color story is beautiful and even if you aren't a fan of colorful eyeshadow there's still lots to work with. I am very much looking forward to trying more palettes from this brand.,98780,924

I have to start off by mentioning that it took me quite a while to get them on, not even to my satisfactio. But to simply get them on my nail bed and not sticking elsewhere. Unfortunately I dont know if it is due to lack of practice or shaky hands but these were not professional looking by any means, as they either had tint gaps, slightly crooked, overlapped my cuticle, or something else. I kept them on for a little over 24 hours before I popped them all off due to OCD and aggravation of looking at them all messed up. For reference I can never keep artificial nails from the salon on for more than a week. I just dont like the feeling of fake nails especially when they hurt.

These do the job and stay on pretty nicely but my niece complains that it bothers her behind her ears and she takes it off after about an hour give or take. Now shes never worn headbands like these so I think it will be something she has to get used to and that it's not the product that is the problem. They're cute and get the job done.,98971,230
3.0,1611346576826,Overall I like these,"These have me conflicted on whether I like them or not. They are pretty (at least the darker solids, I threw the other ones away as I'll never use them) and they are a soft velvet and do have button for your mask loops to hook on to. That was the main reason I ordered these because I'm tired of my ears getting sore being in the medical field having to wear a mask for over 8 hours at a time. I do feel lole the velvet helps it stay in place more than the regular cotton or polyester ones but velvet is thick and makes me sweat. Not only that but the way the headband is designed there isnt much stitching to hold the buttons in the position you need them to be in order to hook your mask on. It rolls back on my scalp and then the buttons can get caught in my hair so I have to slide it forward and fidget with it a bit to get it right but for the entirety of my shift I did keep it on and it kept my mask in place comfortably with no problem. I wish the design was a bit different and the velvet maybe a little bit thinner but overall I like these.",98971,2345

With the gel by itself, no black underneath, these are very bright and vibrant colors. When the black is underneath them, boy are they worth every penny. They really do come out beautiful with the sparkles and shine, it is almost like a galaxy in each one of your finger nails. It does take a lot of work, but it is worth it. One thing worth mentioning is that you really need to have a solid black coat in order for the color to look good, 2+ coats for black needed!",98971,16372

4.0,1604812373776,A new favorite!,"These masks are one of my new favorites. Normally masks claim to do a lot and often I'm left let down, that was not the case with this mask. These have a TON of moisture/liquid/balm whatever youd like to call it. I was able to apply it to my face, and it was completely saturated so I decided to rub a good amount on my neck, and then once getting it in place I rubbed it into my hands. The serum I rubbed down my neck did dry a lot faster and got sticky in the crease of my neck. I left it on for 25 minutes and it absorbed extremely well. My face is so hydrated without feeling oily. It was so refreshing while I had it on, it was cooling and helped me relax. The directions say to rub the remaining serum in after you take the mask off, which I did. But it was too much serum to leave on and I felt sticky. So I wet my face and wiped the excess with a towel. The only complaint I have is that the mask is weirdly thin and I had a hard time placing it on my face correctly. The eye holes were hardly big enough and it got my lips wet. I think this has to do with how I put it on but I think they could still be a little bit larger in diameter.",98971,734
3.0,1600928228799,Way too expensive,"I have some qualms with this electric rotary shaver.  My boyfriend says this is nowhere near as smooth as a regular shave but then again not as irritating using this shaver. It is far too expensive for a shave that isnt as satisfactory as a $10-15 high quality razor blade (4/5blade gilette for example). This is a simple shave but not a close shave. Maybe use when you dont have much time in the morning or wherever you have to go, need to save time, or want a new easier experience than a regular razor blade. Definitely wouldnt pay this price though.",98971,29366
3.0,1600342720064,Too much glitter/shimmer,"Very nice eyeshadow, but a bit too glittery for me. This has more glitter than it does pigment.

2.0,1599712288573,Not worth the mess,"My first complaint with this argan oil is the fact that it came in the box leaking as soon as it arrived. They wrap it in a plastic bag for this reason to prevent the oil from leaking out but it still leaked through anyhow. There was at least half an inch of oil missing from the top of the bottle from leakage during commute/delivery. Second complaint is the fact that it really didnt work. Because of the benefits of argan oil with hair, I decided to use this as a mask/soak on my hair from root to tip. I have very thick and pretty long hair and I used the entire bottle to cover my head. I covered my head with a plastic shower cap and sat with it on for over an hour. I showered, shampooed twice and conditioned per usual. I really expected a big difference in the amount of frizz, softness, and shininess of my hair.. and I was highly disappointed. It really didnt tame my frizz at all, made it a slight bit softer and isnt shiny at all. Big let down.",98971,1007

3.0,1598375644726,I wouldnt repurchase,This is another product that I feel unsure about the final results. I have long thick coarse curly hair that fizzes very easily and immediately after every shower if I dont use a product in it. I used this before I used any other products but it did not detangle my hair very much compared to how it normally is. I still had to pull through quite a few knots but it didnt seem to take as many pulls to get through them as it normslly does. So I guess that would be considered an improvement. I feel like my hair is volumized and softer with about 5-7 sprays throughout my entire head of hair. This is a thin spray so it is very lightweight and has the consistency similar to water so I dont feel like my hair is at all greasy from this. I used a curl definer like I always do after showers that helps deter the frizz and keep my curls bouncy and it worked well with it. I dont think this product is worth the money for what little it does do. I wouldnt repurchase.,98971,1001

I noticed while the nails were still in the package that they had odd chinese like symbols in the glue. I figured it might go away once I put them on but for some of them it didnt. It actually made it look worse and scratchy/bubbly underneath. These ""symbols"" should definitely get removed. I'm not one who does my nails often at all so I'm pretty critical of these. I included pictures of the flaws for others to see.<br /><br />Edit: I peeled these off the next day because of how bubbly and gross they looked underneath.

My skin felt good after using it the right way, but it's just confusing packaging.

I have been using this for about a week and the container hasn't rusted or anything either, which is something that tends to happen with products in a metal container.

4.0,1545401359949,Love these towels,"I have been hooked on these makeup removing towels. I went and bought several as presents for coworkers. While this brand of towels do the job, it takes a little bit more wiping and pressure to get the makeup off when I compare it to my more expensive ""Miracle Face Eraser"" brand towel. The texture is very similar but these are slightly more soft. I immediately could feel the difference so I had to see if they worked just as well. My miracle erasing brand is less soft, and has more friction. I believe this friction makes the makeup come off easier. If you want something super cheap, these will get the job done, but just know that they're not the best towels out there. They are still able to remove my waterproof liquid eyeliner and mascara which is exactly what I need them to do. Highly recommend these towels. They save you from ever having to buy moist towelettes and make remover ever again.",101955,100

You just add some distilled water or purified water and turn the steamer on. Since the steam is hot, you need to make sure that your face is away enough from the nozzle. I like how the steam comes from in a direction that covers the chin and the face. There is no option for adjusting the level of the mist but I do not think if it is necessary since the amount of steam is good in this device. There is a manual inside the package that I found really helpful. The water tank is small and for me, the tank size is holding the exact amount of water I need for each usage.<br /><br />The steamer can be used for hydrating the skin. It also opens the pores and is good for deep cleaning. But the thing I really enjoy while using this steamer is that it is very helpful for my Sinusitis. The warm mist soothes and moisturizes my sinus passageway. So, for me, it does not only make my skin hydrated but also unblocking my sinuses.<br /><br />I also like the portable facial steamer. It is chargeable which is great. It is not that much powerful and it is releasing cold mist but, it is a good size for travel. Surprisingly, this tiny humidifier works for about 10-15 minutes. The other things in the package are also useful to have a nice Spa at home.<br /><br />All in all, I like the whole set and to me, each part of this package is useful and works great.",102153,3583

It takes a while to be completely absorbed on my skin and it does not keep any residue on my face. However, it has a long-lasting effect which I can feel for a few hours. My skin becomes smoother when I use it once a day. The cream has a gentle scent. Although I feel some minor burning or stinging at the moment I apply the cream on my dry skin, the feeling fades away after a few minutes. I am also not sure about the impacts of stem cells on my skin yet, as I may need to use it for a longer time to see the promised positive effects on skin wrinkles and dark spots.

I am not sure whether having all these ingredients in one single bottle can be effective in deep hydration of the skin and/or taking full advantage of each ingredient or not, but I noticed long-lasting hydration from this oil on my skin, especially when I use 3-5 drops 1-2 hour(s) before going to bed. The oil has a nice and relaxing smell and does not have any triggering ingredients for my sensitive skin. The combination of red ginseng and Shiitake mushrooms is great for soothing my dry skin and repairing the effects of sunburns.<br /><br />My only concerns with the current facial oil are its slow adsorption and also the price. The oil sits on my skin for about two hours until it absorbs completely. So, I have to use it only at night. I have seen a faster absorption rate for other facial oils that I have used so far. This can be due to the different oil combinations in this product.  Another issue is its relatively higher price compared with similar products in the market.<br /><br />Other than these two concerns, the Laloirelle Deep Face Oil can be a great choice for repairing, moisturizing, and rejuvenation of dry and dehydrated skins and has long-lasting hydration on the skin.",102153,991

Or individual clear totes (so you can see inside). If you do that let them decorate it with stickers. It makes things more fun and takes the fear out of nail trimming for them.<br /><br />I suggest keeping them separate because if one kid gets a nail fungus, athletes foot, hand/foot/mouth then you’re less likely to spread it by not sharing tools.<br /><br />Overall I’m happy with these and would order this kit again.",102171,3265

5.0,1548044231140,Squishy!,These are great for the price... You get 4 with these for about half of the price of the major brand ... where you only get one! This is a no brainer.  Nice and soft and perfect for blending all areas... Use wet or dry. It can be cleaned with mild soap and warm water. Let it dry a few hours and it will be good as new.  They don’t absorb a lot of product which is a huge issue with some makeup sponges.,102188,258
5.0,1548043585886,Nice Make-up Kit Essential,"This works just as good  as other blender sponges I have used, but at a fraction of the cost I have paid.

With my last flat iron I could only straighten small sections of hair at a time and I had to go over that section 3 to 5 times to get it completely straight. Granted, I have wavy hair so I expect it to take a while... this flat iron worked great with two times going over the section of hair. There is an auto shut off feature, which is a must for me. The neatest thing is the design of this iron... if I wanted to curly ringlets, I could by wrapping it around the plate...",102188,1597
4.0,1652854845380,Cute tattoos,"This is a really cute pack of tattoos for kids. Has a wide variety of pictures and animals to choose from. My daughter whose 2 loves doing these. She loves helping apply them as well. It's very easy to do. Just cut out what picture you want, place on the skin and hold a wet rag over it for 15 seconds. She loves counting the numbers out loud. It's a fun little bonding activity we do together. The tattoos themselves look good once on. The coloring is nice and the pictures come out clear. Last anywhere from 2-6 days depending on your activities and water interaction. Otherwise they do wash off easy in the shower/bath with a little soap and scrub.",102198,1677

I have been disappointed with other ones because you can hardly smell them once they are opened or dropped into the water. These are strong enough that it lasts for a while.

5.0,1622354591889,Velvety soft!,I Am very impressed with the softness and quality of these brushes. The bristles are super velvety and smooth against your skin. I like the variety of brush styles this pack includes. I like the feel of the handles and the look of them. So far I’ve been happy with the make up application of each brush.,102198,208
5.0,1618101773404,Soft and nice,"Awesome set of towels!!! I always let my hair towel dry but get annoyed with using a full sized towel. They get heavy, bulky, and tend to slide off. These are so easy to use and don’t add extra weight to my head. I have shoulder length hair and these hold it perfect. The material is super soft!! Love the color selection in this pack!",102198,14266
5.0,1611531918541,Take care of your skin!,This works nicely. I try and use it about once a week. Easy to apply by hand after washing your face. Easy to wash off when you’re done. Leaves your face feeling clean and smooth. I feel like it sucks a lot of the oils or dirt off your face.  I just wait a few minutes and apply  moisturizer after. Happy with it so far! I feel my face looks brighter and less dull by detoxing it weekly.,102198,434
3.0,1611276378303,Poor quality hair,This wig is okay. Fun for dress up but the hair quality looks cheap. It fits okay but again looks like it starts to frizz at times. The color is a soft pink. Definitely won’t be wearing out. More for a fun dress up party.,102198,138
5.0,1604616961568,Beautiful hair!!,"This wig is beautiful! The hair Itself is gorgeous and looks silky smooth. I also really like the color. It’s a lovely chocolate brown with almost a hint of maroon in it. The curls are soft and flowy, and the hair comes all the way down my back. It’s actually very comfortable to wear too. Comes with a hair net. I literally just threw my real hair in a bun under this wig for the photo and it still fit good. This will be fun for dressing up.",102198,2309
4.0,1599149188004,Super easy to use and universal,"I have never owned or used a product like this before, but it is very easy to figure out and use!!<br />It has a ton of attachments and pieces to switch between which is nice. I used it to remove all the hard dead skin around my nails which has been built up for some time! I also used it to remove the work out dead skin I had on the inside of my hands! Made them soft and smooth again!! I used the grinder piece to remove some dead skin on my feet as well! Over all it's a nice little tool to be able to give yourself a quick nail/hand/foot clean up.",102198,2197
4.0,1597993355421,Good selection of colors and comfortable,I really like these headbands. The style is cute and they are a thick nylon feel so they are soft on your ears. I like that they are thick in the back which help hold up all of my short hairs. They each come individually wrapped and have a nice selection of colors. I would recommend.,102198,19475
2.0,1606895323311,Not effective at all,"Overall, I would definitely not recommend this product until major changes have been made. There's definitely a market segment where there is a dire need for a product that can clean pet feet after a wet and dirty walk outside. I have two dogs and live in an area that is muddy and rainy all the time which results in super dirty patios and walkways when we get in the house. When I first saw this product i was actually very interested in first but upon using I was disappointed. The spin speed is in no way strong enough to get rid of dirt and gunk buildup between the dogs feet and just using the dog paw washer is incredibly messy with water spilling out all over the place. Honestly, after trying my best to use this product a few times i'd rather just carry my dogs into the bath tub and cleaning their paws myself.",102210,437
5.0,1605665250936,Perfect for the current pandemic,"These refillable hand sanitizer bottles are so amazing. It makes it more cost efficient to just buy a big bottle of hand sanitizer and fill these small ones up. They come with a keychain so you can put it on your backpacks, purse, or keys so you never forget. They are also small that you can bring them with you. This has been really helpful during the pandemic so that I never forget hand sanitizer.",102210,1982
3.0,1604816535777,Decent scissors and hair clips,"Overall, I would say that out of this small hair cutting package only the scissors, thinning shears, and hair clips are decent quality. The scissors are made out of stainless steel but when using them you will notice that they wont cut as smoothly compared to more expensive higher quality scissors. The shears worked perfectly fine for me and they did the job well.<br /><br />Everything else provided in the package is more like the 3 star hotel freebies that are cheap and poorly made. The cape is only good for a few times before it will most likely rip apart and the combs provided were bend on arrival.",102210,1117
4.0,1604553674395,Wish the nozzle was higher quality.,"Upon receiving the product I was really satisfied with the glass bottle used as it felt and looked high quality. I've been using this with a cleaning solution to clean my kitchen countertops and it worked perfectly misting just enough to clean a large area.<br /><br />My one gripe with this product is that the glass is so high quality but the spray nozzle is made of not so great quality plastic that feels rather flimsy.<br /><br />Other than the quality issue with the nozzle, everything works well and it does the job!",102210,2335
5.0,1600152117445,"stylish, amber color","like this amber color, I used one bottle mixed with lemon essential oil to use in kitchen and family room, and another bottle mixed with lavender to use in laundry room.  very neat and stylish to use.",102210,1814
5.0,1597036126536,Great portable glass spray bottles!,For 5.99 these are some amazing quality spray bottles. I've been putting in hand sanitizer and essential oils in them and they're the perfect size. Good thick glass and a decent spray attachment makes the build quality on these pretty great.<br /><br />if you're putting in liquids that can be damaged from UV light I would definitely suggest going for the amber clear color.,102210,9370
5.0,1595722156139,Great cleansing cloth that is biodegradable!,"Going on those long hiking trips you always dread the smell you carry on the way back and wish there was a convenient way to clean yourself up. With the Allez outdoor cleansing cloths I would say that your problems are solved!<br /><br />The individually packed cloths fold out to a large size and retains moisture while being used heavily. I've used one wipe to clean my face, arms, legs, and back and there's still a good portion of moisture left on the wipe. In addition, with a nice scent to the wipe you feel really refreshed and clean after using them which is an amazing plus. I would say the best thing about these cloths compared to others is that they are well made and don't break apart after using them vigorously.<br /><br />Overall, going hiking and staying outdoors this item should become an essential item in your pack!",102210,2516
5.0,1615511497509,OMG IM IN LOVE!!!!!  but beware....,"I am in love with this lava product!  I love a great exfoliator!  when I leave my job at night, I am soooo greasy, oily, and floury that I just want to rip off the dirty day in the shower with a great cleanser.  I always felt that a scrub couldn't have enough exfoliating power for me, but I may have met my match with this 1.  its super gritty and its DEFINITELY NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN!  at 1 point I thought that it might be to strong even for my iron face.  the product is black and very thick, so u only need a little bit.  I cleansed my face with it, and now my forehead feels baby soft.  the rest of my face also feels AMAZING, but my silky smooth forehead is what is really standing out for me.  I would be sure to be extra gentile when u r applying this to ur skin.  I will definitely be adding this product to my top 3 super take the day off products and I will be sure to reorder it when it eventually runs out.  I hope this was helpful.",102212,6015
4.0,1614171379929,its not really the right size for a cat,id say this is more of a dog brush than a cat brush b/c of its size.  its actually quite large for even my sisters 3 super fat cats.  I always feel nervous about using a wire brush on a cat b/c they are notorious for always trying to bite the brush or rub their face on it.  im always so concerned about poking them in the eye.  all that being said... she LOVED the self cleaning feature of this brush.  I thought the button was just a press and release and the spikes would just keep popping up.  no... u press the button up and it holds it in place while the bristles disappear.  u then move ur finger over the button towards u and the button releases and the bristles pop out again.  I would say that the brush feels quite bulky in my larger girly hand.  my sister was concerned that the button would break over not that much time.  my vote is to use this specifically for a dog and buy a smaller brush with the same concept for a cat.  I hope this was helpful.,102212,656
5.0,1610455513404,is this a lotion or a face scrub?,"Black Wolf always does a good job with their products.  they never seem to disappoint.  this product was a little weird when I 1st opened it in the shower.  when I squeezed it into my hand, it left me wondering if it was a lotion or a face wash.  it looks and smells like lotion.  it is on the thicker side and for that reason, a TINY BIT goes a long way.  u dont need to waste ur money by using to much product on ur face.  I had plenty left on my hands to do my neck and behind my ears after I completed my face.  the thing I LOVE most about black wolf products is that they remember that all eyes are not created equal... yes I said eyes... my 42 year old eyes can not see most directions on the bottles that come in.  these guys must know how I feel b/c they ALWAYS type them in a very large font, which is great b/c it saves me from having to call my boyfriend through Alexa to come in and read them to me!!!

3.0,1609616393264,not his favorite,"ive ordered a lot of soap from amazon to try.  my boyfriend LOVES expensive soaps!  usually I fill his stocking with them, but this year I filled it with special salts instead.  I thought he was going to love these small travel sized soap that come 6 in a resealable bag, but they fell short of his expectations.  he hated the scent!  the clove smell was just to overpowering.  each bar fits nicely in ur hand b/c they r teardrop shaped and at 1 st they r a little gritty.  it has a cross stamped in it and it really feels more like a guest hand washing soap or something u would get for free at a hotel.  thats about the thickness of each bar.  its handmade here in the USA (which I love) in Ohio and it does leave ur skin feeling moisturized, even though it doesnt lather much.  we r going to move the rest of the bars of soap to our guest bathroom for hand washing only.  I hope this was helpful.",102212,729
4.0,1609247318016,foam?  what foam?,"let me start by saying I removed 1 star b/c I had to go back and check the product I ordered vs what I put on my face last night.  the name and the description on the website is nowhere near what I applied to my face in the shower.  it says its a foam and it shows a girls hand with a bubbly foam gently resting in her palm.  that wasnt my experience.  I entered a wrestling match the minute I stepped into my shower.  the stuff was very difficult to get out of the tube.  it has a hint of a suntan lotion smell, which was very nice.  it comes out in a tight, white string into ur hand... and it goes on and stays on like lotion!!!  where's the foam?  where's the bubbles?  I dont know but they didnt attend the party at my shower last night.  with all that being said about the misleading product name and page, the product works.  my face was very clean and not over dried at all.  it does mention that its an exfoliator, but it is a creamy substance with no sand or beads inside.  again, this product does a great job of cleansing ur skin, but dont be surprised when u dont get any bubbles or foam in ur hand.<br />UPDATE:<br />after using it all week I have noticed that there are a couple of tiny beads floating around in the lotion to make its claim as an exfoliator.  I wouldnt say there r a lot in it, but they r in the product.  I hope this was helpful.",102212,433
2.0,1604666212160,I guess it depends on what u wanna do with it.,"10 for $12 is... well lets face it... is pricey.  if u r looking to use this like a wet one at a restaurant or after touching money... u R NOT GOING TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.  if u r going to use it as intended... for ""freshening up"" u might purchase these overpriced wipes.  the package talks about eco friendly and being compostable, but really these things just mean more expensive for the consumer.  its like what the lady at Toyota said to me.  there r 2 types of people who the buy Prius.  ones who only want to save money on gas and the ones who dont care how much something costs as long as its for the environment.  thats how this wipe makes me feel.<br />the consistency of the wipe is soft and WAY thicker then a wet one, but size wise... its about the same.  its definitely not big enough to do ur whole body and it certainly isn't wet enough to even try.  u would have to pick and choose the places u would need it most.  it says that its unscented... but apparently unscented has a scent.  my friend and I wiped our hands last night and decided we hated the scent.  I do like the packaging.  its nice and bright and easy to find at the bottom of ur purse.  I think the box it comes in is a waste of money on the company's end.  its a cube that measures about 3.75"" x 3.5"" x 4.25"".  it has 10 yes 10 prepackaged wipes inside.  they could have easily been compressed down to a smaller package, which would in turn made it more eco friendly.  so in conclusion, im a Prius owner who only cares about the price of gasoline, and these r just way to expensive for me to actually purchase... especially during a pandemic where people r loosing their jobs left and right.

5.0,1601069623647,they remind me of transformers,"In this set u get:<br />5 hard plastic bottles<br />5 carabiners: blue, red, yellow, purple, and green<br />5 pump bottle sprayers<br />5 squeezy bottle tops<br />1 collapsable blue funnel<br /><br />These bottles are designed to hang upside-down using the included carabiner.  They attach easily to any loop, whether it be a purse, belt, or backpack.  I really like the fact that the tops are interchangeable.  Ive never seen that options b4.  I also really like the funnel it comes with.  It doesnt take up much room b/c it collapses into itself for easy storage.  It is a little difficult to fill the bottles, even with the provided funnel.  The bottoms of the bottles are rounded, so u cant place them on the counter to fill them.  It CAN be done with one hand, but it is much easier to do with a 2nd person helping.  I dont like that they are made out of hard plastic.  It doesnt matter if u are just using it as a sprayer, but if u need it to be a squeezable bottle, it is difficult to get every drop out.  When u fill the bottle to use with the mister, u need to pay attention to the included straw inside.  It has to wrap around the area where the carabiner fits in order to get every last drop out of the container.  needless to say, I like this product's versatility, and especially during covid they r a great idea for hand sanitizer.  I hope this was helpful.",102212,1982
4.0,1639396471514,"Pretty Simple To Use, Stings A Little, No Issues So Far, Awaiting Potential Results","So far, I have no real complaints about this NIRA Skincare Laser & Hyaluronic Acid Serum Bundle. I’m still at the point where I’m not sure if I can say it truly works because I need to use it for a longer period of time, but I’ll discuss various aspects about the product that will hopefully help with your decision-making.<br /><br />-Came well-packaged in a small, but sturdy cardboard box. Everything arrived intact. I have continued to use this box for storage of the product.<br />-Comes with the handheld laser device, charger with base to plug into an outlet, and manual<br />-No complaints about the battery life so far<br />-Simple to use: there are two buttons: The power button that turns the device on. Then you can press it to cycle through the various levels of intensity 1-5 which are clearly shown using green light bars. You can then hold the power button down to turn the device off again. The top button can be pressed to activate the laser after you have chosen the level of intensity you want.<br />-The laser only works if positioned correctly over an area of skin. It will give a single negative sounding beep if not positioned correctly, and a positive sounding double beep if it is positioned correctly as the laser works. You wait to move the device to the next area after you hear that second beep indicating that it is finished with that laser sequence<br />-The device has a white, plastic outer shell. It is lightweight while still feeling sturdy and durable. I would still be very careful not to drop this as I’m not sure how it could handle a fall<br />-I would recommend experimenting on the lower intensity settings. The undereye area is pretty sensitive. I feel I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but my eyes often still tear up after using per instructions on the highest settings of 4 and 5. For whatever reason, my left eye is much more sensitive to this.<br />-I don’t want to say it is truly painful, but I suppose the best way to describe the sensation is almost similar to if you were being stung by a rubber band that you pulled back and let hit your skin if that makes sense. It isn’t comfortable, but you do get more used to this and can work your way up to a higher level of intensity. You will probably also feel some warmth on the skin after using.<br />-I know this is marketed for under the eyes, but I have also been using on my forehead and by my smile lines.<br /><br />***The instruction manual is pretty clear and straightforward. You definitely need to read this before getting started. Here is some information that you can find within the manual:<br /><br />-They say all skin tones and anyone over the age of 12 can use NIRA to reduce the appearance of wrinkles around the eyes<br />-You need to clean and dry your face just prior to using NIRA<br />-It can be using morning or night and up to twice daily. They recommend waiting 1 minute before retreating each area and not to treat more than twice within a 1-hour period.<br />-Do not treat the same spot twice in a row, even if the pulse is rejected and you get the low pitched, negative sounding beep<br />-The instructions clearly show you the recommended way to treat the undereye area and the treatment pattern to use<br />-They recommend using the highest power level where you feel warmth without pain<br />-You should use a facial moisturizer after each treatment and a daily sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is recommended. This bundle includes the hyaluronic acid serum which can also be used.<br />-Device should be kept clean and free of dust, especially the glass lens which can be cleaned with a cotton swab. Surfaces can be cleaned with 70% alcohol solution between each use.<br />-They say some potential side effects include: skin warmth, redness, and stinging. Less frequent side effects include dryness, roughness, tanned appearance to skin, swelling, flaking, itching, crusting, bruising, pimple-like rash, irritated skin, blistering, scarring, infection, and skin color changes where your skin may become darker or lighter. I have only experienced the temporary warmth and stinging during use- no redness or anything else.<br />-The company also cautions those who have skin conditions or are undergoing professional cosmetic treatments such as injectable toxins like Botox or fillers- saying to check with your doctor or clinician prior to using NIRA.<br />-Only use on intact skin<br />-Don’t use if pregnant or nursing or undergoing fertility treatments<br />-Do not use if you have a history of skin cancer, any other cancer, or pre-malignant moles<br />-Do not treat if you have tanned skin which is apparently at increased risk of adverse effects with light-based devices<br /><br />Overall, I’m happy with how the product functions and the ease of use. I will continue using and will update if I have any further comments or concerns. I haven’t noticed any real results yet, but I also haven’t been using it that long. One question that comes to mind is this: What is the lifespan of this device? Months? Years? Or does it give out after firing the laser a certain number of times? I could have missed it in the manual, but that is something I’m still not sure of. For the current price of $329, that is something I think people may want to know. I haven’t had any issues with the serum that comes in this package, but it seems pretty simple and basic.",102217,8
4.0,1625107342095,"No Fragrance, Moisturizing, Not The Greatest Value-Improvements Could Be Made","These Doctor Babor Hyaluronic Acid Serum Power Serum Ampoules seem pretty good. I definitely like this better than their collagen concentrate ampoules, but there are things that could have been changed to make me like this product a lot more.<br /><br />-Received 7 glass ampoules with 2ml of product inside each one<br />-Well presented in a nice looking silver display box<br />-You have to snap the glass ampoules open. They do provide a plastic cylindrical piece to aid in doing so. I’m a nurse, so I’m used to breaking open these kinds of ampoules without any issue. I can imagine that some people would not like this though<br />-Watery serum that glides across skin easily<br />-Honestly, a little seems to cover a large area of skin. 2ml may not seem like a lot, but a single ampoule seems like way more than would be needed for one application. I have split one into 3-4 uses to be honest<br />-I’m assuming the company intends for one whole ampoule to be used as one application because each one is labeled as day 1-7, and they provide no way to seal an ampoule back after using which I found to be rather frustrating<br />-Absorbs rapidly and doesn’t feel sticky or tacky after drying like the collagen concentrate did<br />-Their collagen concentrate ampoules also had a heavy fragrance, so I was SO relieved to find that there is no added fragrance with these<br />-Made in Germany<br /><br />So does it really help with plumping, smoothing, and reducing wrinkles? I don’t know. I definitely like the way my skin looks and feels right after application, but I haven’t noticed anything drastic.<br />As I previously stated, the 2ml of serum feels like A LOT to me if you try to put it all on your face at once. Unfortunately, this company also does not provide a way to seal an individual ampoule back for future use since they apparently intend for one ampoule to be an entire application. I remember I tried a set by the ISDIN brand with glass ampoules just like these. In the kit, the company included a top to slide over the opened glass ampoule with a cap to seal for future use. This was awesome and so convenient. I was disappointed to find out that this company did not include anything like that (I took a picture of that top and cap on one of these ampoules so you can see).<br /><br />Anyway, it is possible that this product may provide good results when used long term, but I just don’t really like this being intended for use over 7 days only. If they included a top with cap to seal each individual ampoule so that the product could be used over a longer period of time, I would like it much more. I would definitely prefer a serum in a larger bottle with dropper lid.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know – thanks! I’ll be sure to update if I have any other comments to add.",102217,1535
4.0,1614206681406,"Honestly Strange And Frustrating, But The End Result Is Great","I really enjoy using the Alteya Organics rose water, so I was very excited to try this rose face organic sunscreen SPF 30. This sunscreen is very unique to me in that it isn’t white, it isn’t simply beige tinted, but looks dusty rose/beige tinted.<br /><br />So there are definitely some things about this product that I kind of dislike/ am on the fence about, but ultimately, The end result is surprisingly awesome.<br /><br />What I don’t like-<br />I usually start with what I like, but I noticed all the things I didn’t like very quickly, so I’ll start with that.<br /><br />-The pump dispenser. I don’t know what is going on with this thing, but I opened the box and tried pumping a couple times- nothing came out. I thought nothing of it since it usually takes multiple or many pumps initially to get any product into the pump..... but it never came. I started shaking the bottle and then pumping..... nothing. I almost gave up, but then violently started pumping it by hammering the top with my hand-tiny little bits started to splash out. After some more hammering, it seems to start coming out normally with a simple press. The product it pretty thick, so that could have been a factor I suppose? Now it is easier for it to come out, but still stops occasionally. When I press, the product usually comes out at the very end of a full pump.<br />-Not incredibly easy to spread and rub in properly. It isn’t terrible and I wasn’t too surprised since it is fairly thick and it is sunscreen, but it did require some effort to work it into my skin.<br />-It feels somewhat grainy/gritty when I’m trying to rub it into my skin. I’m not sure why or if it is just the product I received. I can’t feel any granules on my face after application, but it was definitely there initially which I thought was odd.<br />-I had a sensation of wanting to wash my hands afterwards. I could definitely feel it lingering on my fingers.<br /><br />After all that, I felt a little disappointed... but you know what? I really like the end result and the way it makes me look.<br /><br />What I like-<br /><br />-Really subtle natural scent- almost like the smell of clay with a hint of rose. I like it. I do see in the ingredients that there is also lavender oil.<br />-The tinted color... it is like a dusty rose beige. I really like it. I have somewhat tannish olive skin and something about this color is making my skin look good. It is almost like I’m wearing light makeup. Somehow my skin looks brighter and glowy after application.<br />-Doesn’t feel so heavy as I’m wearing. I’ll admit- the product is thick, feels somewhat grainy with application, and is not the easiest to rub in, but it feels light sitting on my face. Yes, even after washing hands, I can feel it is there when I run my fingers across my face, but it feels soft. There is a little bit of friction like it doesn’t feel completely silky smooth, but I’m not bothered by it.<br />-Doesn’t leave a white cast. I suppose this isn’t surprising since it isn’t white to begin with.... but I love that. Does it leaves cast? Kind of, but in a good way. Like I said, I feel like it leaves a very slight color that evens out my skin, almost like light makeup.<br /><br />I really wanted to leave a 3 star rating because the pump is annoying and frustrating, the grittiness is strange, and it isn’t the easiest to rub in, but darn I like how my skin looks afterwards!!! It doesn’t make any sense to me. It almost feels like it would leave my skin feeling and looking greasy/oily, but it doesn’t- my skin looks nice and somewhat dewy.<br /><br />If the company finds a way to make the pump dispenser work properly and possibly make it feel easier to apply then this would without a doubt be a 5 star product! I also wish the bottle was larger than 50ml, especially considering the hassle of the pump.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so. I would love to know!! Thanks!!",102217,723
4.0,1613031769631,Nice Little Open Storage- Not What I Would Choose For Traveling,"This CONBOLA Make Up Organizer is pretty handy for organizing small makeup items. I ordered the white and grey, and it looks quite nice. I would say it looks just like the pictures.<br /><br />The grey is a sturdy and durable plastic. The white inserts are a nice, thick, and flexible silicone. It will separate into 7 different pieces which is convenient and also makes everything easy to clean. You can use it all together or individual pieces separately.<br /><br />The mirror is fine and you insert into place and remove by pulling back out. I do think they missed an opportunity to have this on a detachable hinge or something.<br /><br />I think my favorite part of this product is the silicone insert that you can insert various makeup pencils, brushes, etc in standing up. Most of my brushes don’t fit as well into the bigger sized slots, but it still works.<br /><br />This is cute overall, but I think the biggest improvement that could be made to this other than a hinged mirror would be to make this deeper. As you can see in my picture, there is a standard sized setting powder sitting in the main compartment. It fits there, but not if you wanted to put the mirror/lid down to cover it.<br /><br />Basically this is a cute open storage. Most off the products I have pictured would not fit in this for any type of closed storage. I think the company could make this design into and awesome display/storage case that fully closes with a handle for traveling or something- but it would have to be much deeper.<br /><br />I don’t think this is something I would want to take traveling, because I would have to take everything out and put in a bag or something before also packing this up and that defeats the purpose of it for traveling in my opinion. Some people may like to have this to display and openly store all their items when traveling though, but it just wouldn’t be my first choice since you can’t pack everything inside it when it is time to go.<br /><br />Anyway, this is still a nice little product if you think the size and function will suit your needs. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!",102217,1979
5.0,1611627119713,Interesting Gritty Texture And Strong Clove Scent,"This Spa-Da Immunity Support Soap is one of the more interesting soaps I have tried. You get a pack of 6 small shield shaped soaps in a resealable plastic bag. The soaps are about 2.75 inches in length.<br /><br />The scent is strong when you open the bag and especially in the shower. Some of the oils and ingredients included are cloves, cinnamon, oregano, peppermint, parsley, eucalyptus, and rosemary. If you don’t like the smell of cloves, then do not order this because that is the most predominant smell in my opinion. I like it though- it has a nice spicy kick.<br /><br />The soap definitely feels different than I expected. It doesn’t feel really smooth like many soaps. When dry, they were slightly powdery when I ran my finger across. They are slightly gritty feeling which I noticed more once the soap became wet in the shower. This could be nice if you like a slight scrubby feeling. I typically rub it onto my mesh bath sponge or silicone sponge so I don’t really care about the grittiness either way. I found that it lathers and suds up very well with both my mesh and silicone sponges.<br /><br />I just started using, so I’m not sure how many showers I’ll be able to get out of each bar. Honestly, I thought they might disintegrate and get used up fast simply based on how powdery they felt when dry. I don’t think it will last as long as some other soaps, but I was still surprised that I could somewhat see the outline of where the shallow cross was imprinted on the soap even after my first shower-and I did intentionally scrub my sponges all over that side pretty vigorously. I took a picture of what the soap looked like after one shower compared to unused bars.<br /><br />Anyway, my skin feels very clean, perhaps even a little moisturized after using and I haven’t experienced any irritation to my sensitive skin (I have eczema).<br /><br />I like that this soap is natural and free from harmful chemicals. I also love that it is made in the USA-Ohio specifically, which is where I am from.<br /><br />I’ll be sure to update my review if any issues arise like if I find that the bars do in fact get used far too quickly. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!!!",102217,729

There is no bad taste at all, though I couldn’t particularly taste a flavor. I think it is a great formula- no complaints.<br /><br />The chap sticks are standard size with the usual twist up and cap. They are a little pricey, but you are getting what seems to be a high quality product. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know-thanks!",102217,887

5.0,1665009100033,I❤️the cooling tip on this device👍⭐️,"This device comes in a very nice case for storage. The protective glasses 👓 even come in a very nice case. The directions are quite detailed so there is no need for me to discuss that in this review. If you purchase this device you’ll see.<br /><br />Operating an IPL device is pretty simple if you follow the directions. It’s choosing the level, making sure you don’t miss a spot and having the patience/commitment to follow through with it to get the results you want.<br /><br />I have seen reviews under many IPL hair removal devices that says they used it for a month and they didn’t see any results. Well, it does take time. Like I said, if you are committed, patience and consistent, then any IPL device will work. This particular device recommends using ONCE a week for 12 weeks, and then once a month there after for maintenance. Most people want to see results by snapping their fingers, and that just isn’t going to happen, even if you do go to a professional, and have it done, it takes time. My advice, if you are not in the mood to take the time, don’t have the patience and or not going to be committed, then don’t get one of these devices because you would be wasting your money.<br /><br />It took about 4 weeks or 4 treatments before I really started to notice results. First noticed the hair on the underarms because it had become finer, thinner, softer hair that was growing. My bikini 👙 area had spots that the hair didn’t grow back but other spots where it was finer, thinner & softer hair. Even though I had spots with NO HAIR growing back, I still go over all the areas regardless. My left armpit has no hair growing at this time, but I still do a treatment. Once I get to the proper weeks since I first started the treatments, then and only then I will 🛑 treating areas where no hair grows.<br /><br />My legs 🦵🏼 have been frustrating but it’s definitely working. The problem is that I miss areas each time I do a treatment. There’s no way of getting the entire leg each time. I have come up with a pattern I do that helps me the best. I start at my ankle and go around my leg 🦵🏼 in a circle ⭕️ while spiraling 🌀 up my leg. I found that going up and down is when I was missing the most. Doing a spiral has helped me tremendously.<br /><br />On the days I am scheduled to do another treatment, I shave 🪒 the areas that I’m going to treat. I also exfoliate the areas using  [[ASIN:B099HDG45M Revealer Skin Exfoliator]]. Then about an half hour after I shave 🪒, I start me treatments. KEEP YOUR LEGS DRY, CLEAN AND NO LOTIONS/OILS ETC. NOTHING.<br />ALWAYS WEAR THE PROTECTIVE 👓 GLASSES!<br />Since I shave my underarms first, I start there. Underarms takes about 2 minutes each. Then I do my bikini 👙 area and then onto my legs. If I think I forgot a spot I do go back and do it, but I really try to pay attention so I don’t. Once complete I either apply [[ASIN:B0B1N8Z7BR Reviver Skin Soothing Gel]] or [[ASIN:B073WVKRBN USDA Certified Jojoba Oil]]. Both are soothing, but sometimes I feel I need a decent moisturizer and Jojoba Oil is my go to for that.<br /><br />Well, that’s how I do each treatment. I also put in my schedule/calendar📅 when I’m supposed to do my next treatment. It is time consuming, but the results are so worth it. Think off all the money you are going to save by NOT having to buy EXPENSIVE RAZORS 🪒 anymore. Not to mention the time saved in the shower 🚿.<br /><br />HOPE THIS HELPS others understand a little of how it works. 👍I feel very comfortable using this device and knew going into it, this is a commitment and requires patience.",102220,2823

If you’ve ever had them clogged before than you know the discomfort that comes with it. I’ve actually had a tube put in my right tear duct to clear a blockage and that is dreadful to go through. It has been recommended that I use warm/hot (not scolding) compress to help keep my tear ducts draining. I’m trying this mask to save time. It’s easier than standing at the sink and constantly warming up a wash cloths with the faucet. It’s definitely relaxing and I can feel how it is going to help me.

4.0,1644533380962,Good warming device. Works nicely with massage oil/gel. Bit pricey.,"This device is very similar to wax warming devices. It matches some higher end wax warmers, with the variable temperature control (some low cost wax warmers have an on/off switch only).

The warming/melting pot is very light weight.<br />Wax warmers, with variable temperature controls, range in price $20 - $60 (with some on sale for under $20, and some 'professional' level units considerably more expensive).  So, at $50, this is close to the upper end of the price range.<br />This warmer does heat up and maintains the chosen temperature. We tested the warming device with massage oil, and it does a credible job.  A nice touch is a red light indicates the device is in the heating process to attain the selected temperature. It turns green, when it's at the selected temperature, giving a 'green light' to use the warmed material.<br />Overall, it's a competent warming device that seems a bit pricey.

This is useful for transporting the curling device. And, yes, the compact size makes it very sensible to pack for remote (away from home) usage.  Another key aspect of the product is wireless operation. Evidence: she comments that not having to worry about wires or being close to the wall outlet is fantastic. And, not dealing with power cords means better time efficiency.<br />Operation is fairly easy. A long press of the power button turns it on. When you press the power button again, you advance to a feature you can alter/select, with that aspect blinking. For example, the ""R"" might be blinking. You use the +/- button to change it to ""L"" (R and L indicate the curling direction, creating right or left curls). In this manner, you can change the direction, temperature and timer.  The display also shows the battery power status.  When the curler device has reached proper temperature, it beeps. You can then insert a small section of hair. Curling appearance/tightness will depend on hair texture, temperature and time of treatment.<br />The battery capacity is rated at 5000mAh. It takes 3 - 4 hours to fully charge a depleted battery.

It's a very credible device, with a motor capable of 35000rpm.  So, it has the power. Visually, it has an attractive design with a professional/industrial aspect. The metallic body of the drill body exhibits durability and sturdiness.<br />The top segment of the drill handle twists, with a marker that indicates position respective to the locked/unlocked icons. Obviously, these position are for removing/inserting drill bits. Make sure that after inserting the selected drill bit, the top is twisted and engaged in the locked position.<br />The battery pack also doubles as the control module for the drill.

The button below the display allows the user to change the direction of drill rotation. Under that button, marked Status,  toggles the display from direction and speed to the current power status of the battery. (In the attached photo, P91 indicates Power 91%)<br />The controls are easy to understand, and manage. There's a belt clip on the back of the battery pack/control module. You can opt to have it affixed to a belt or pocket, or place the pack on the table where you can easily make adjustments.<br />in terms of battery efficiency, it takes 2 - 3 hours to fully charge a depleted battery, while affording up to 20 hours of operating time. Actual time will depend on speed and application load. I would expect actual real time use to realize over 10 hours of operation. The charging:operating time ratio is very impressive.<br />I've seen/used prosumer level nail drills, very similar to this product. Those units can range in prices over $100.  Based on comparative costs, this is priced very well in the market genre.

5.0,1627259240050,"Fantastic, amply powered nano mist sprayer/spritzer. Not just water.","At first, the significant other wondered why this was larger than other nano mist sprayers that we own. Then I explained that those other sprayers restrict the liquid to water, and some require distilled water. This fine mist sprayer is described as being akin to an airbrush. ""Works with serum, water-soluble toner, lotion, milk or mineral water for care spa. Not only the skin on the face, it also can be used for the maintenance of body and hair, anti-static and moisturizing."" That perked up her ears, and she said, ""Wow, yeah?""<br />She took the product, after the review photos, and charged the internal battery. A fully charged battery can provide up to an hour of continuous use. Not too shabby.<br />Her report was all favorable. She was amazed at the power, it was noticeably stronger than any of the other nano mist sprayers. We weren't fully sure about the oxygen/hyperbaric process, but she felt the misting was much more effective and efficient.<br />I asked if the size bothered her. She said, no. it's a worthwhile tradeoff, the power and efficacy (as measured by only one application) outweighs the increase in size. Further, she said that this is how mist sprayers should be. You should be able to put any liquid inside the reservoirs, and get a nano/fine misting. Almost all the nano sprayers just allow water. This product doesn't just 'wet' your face, it allows an actual treatment. And that's what is important.<br />And, in terms of size and portability, she said it's well within reason to carry around. But, for the most part, she thinks most will keep/use this at home. And, take it along with other sundry cosmetics when traveling or for special purposes.<br />So, the verdict is that this is a significant upgrade for the product genre. It delivers on the statements in the product details, matching the pictures and description in the product details.  I feel it meets, perhaps surpasses, her expectations of a nano mist sprayer. Based on these initial impressions and performance, this product earns a 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",102277,4055

The glass aspects were fine, with no cracks or defects, though.<br />To be honest, I did not get these for the significant other to use her nail care/projects. Her birthday is coming, and I'll incorporate it into some surprise for her.<br />Based on the cuteness factor, and the overall quality, but noting the slight defect in the felt paper, this glass set earns a solid 4.5 star rating.",102277,777
4.0,1618091104181,"Very nice design, materials. Some issues with the roller surface.","There is much to like about this product offering. You get two boxes, and each has two of the rollers. So, you receive 4 of the massage rollers. In this fashion, you could give one set away as a present, and keep a pair for yourself. Anyway, getting four massage rollers is a nice feature.<br />The handle is ergonomically shaped, and has a sleek appearance. The composite material is lightweight but feels very sturdy, durable. The roller is composed of the same composite material and sheathed in a thin metal veneer.  Overall, it's a visually attractive massage tool. Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br />Examination of the product found that 3 of the four rollers has noticeable defects on the metal covering the rollers.  The fourth had some very minor pittings/spots. These are unfortunate blemishes on an otherwise credible and stylish massage roller.<br />Despite these defects (see attached photos, for three instances of the said defects), the massage rollers do perform as described in the product details. If the stainless' steel did not exhibit the physical issues (note that these were not surface dirt/smudges, but engrained scuff and pitting) did not have obvious defects, this might be close to a 5 star rated product.<br />Again, it's a nicely designed product, and most of the massage roller is composed of quality composite material. Based on observations and considerations, this product set earns a 3.5 - 3.75 star rating.",102277,2203
5.0,1616895762536,"Small encapsulated eyeshadow sticks. Very cute, functional. Good value.","An interesting delivery system for eyeshadow. They look like giant pill capsules, or midget lipstick shapes.  Twelve different colors, shades complete this set, each delivering a rich, luxurious shimmering sheen. Each eyeshadow appears to be composed of quality materials/ingredients. The sizes allow them to be easily kept in a handbag or small clutch. In fact, that is the main feature of this product, the size.<br />In my opinion, these make great liners or to add accent. As a eyeshadow stick/pencil, these serve very well. Thanks to the variety of colors, in popular shades, they should be applicable to most users.<br />When I saw these, I felt they would be an excellent addition to a gift, swag bag (guest bag or gifts for bridal party). They are visually attractive, with a quality eyeshadow within,<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the twelve pieces, with a ruler for size reference.<br />The significant other saw these and loved the mini format. She examined the colors and said all of them are nice, worthwhile. She dabbed a sample on her arm and used a finger to spread it. She said the consistency and shimmer are excellent.  At the current price of $13, she felt it was a good deal: ""Not bad, just a bit over a dollar each. it's well worth it.""  So, clearly, she like the form factor and the quality of the makeup (which I think is the priority).<br />Based on the initial impressions, the apparent quality of the eye shadow makeup, the cuteness factor and the good value, this product earns a solid 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",102277,17756
5.0,1614396527233,"Nice facial steaming product, with handy portable misting device.  Decent performance.","At a spa, people go into the steamroom to relax muscles, open pores and detoxify. This device isn't a steamroom but aims at providing some of the same benefits to the face and neck, especially regarding the skin and pores. This device heats water up to 104F, creating steam which is expelled from the golden rim outlet. Unfortunately it cannot handle the addition of essential oils,  recommending only pure water (or weak alkaline mineral water). This would have been a fantastic ability and function. Oh well. As a pure water streaming device, it is a decent performer.<br />It does not take long for the water to heat, about 30 seconds, and a fine steam mist is pushed out from the device. The optimum range is 6 - 10 inches away from the steam port. It's a good idea to start at a 12 inch distance, and ease your face closer, gauging your skins tolerance.<br />(Note: you can add toner that can fully dissolve into the water. The key is not to have a viscous liquid, or particulates, which will adversely affect the atomization.)<br />We found operation to be fairly simple and easy. Fill the water reservoir, put reservoir back into it's position. turn on the unit, within 30 seconds face gets a spa steam experience.<br />Is this as effective as those face steamers that have a cone that keeps the steam contained? No, because the steam floats freely. But, it's also multiples cheaper than those kinds of facial steaming devices. This is a credible portable device, that is compact enough that it won't take up much counter space. It's minimalist design will allow it to fit in with most decor.<br />It's easy to set up and operate. It's acceptably effective.<br />Also included with this steaming device is a mini misting device,  a headband (with pink ears) and 4 skin care tools (intended to help treat acne and blackheads).<br />The mini misting device does not heat the water you put in it. Rather, via a rechargeable battery, a touch of the button will spray a fine mist. This is very handy in the summer, when you might want a spritz of water to help cool you when outside. It's an apt complement to the facial steaming device.<br />I found the facial steaming device to be capable of decent performance. If you have realistic expectations, you'll enjoy this product. And, I like the rechargeable portable misting device.<br />Overall, a worthwhile product set, which earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",102277,3583
5.0,1614219176207,"Exactly as described and pictured. Lovely, stylish headbands.","These are two stylish, attractive headbands. They have faux pearls  attached in a visually appealing, decorative fashion. There is the appropriate amount of spring inherent to the curvature of the headband. The satiny material (most likely a polyester blend material), has a nice look and feel, and is arranged in a braid-like manner. The headband is covered with a velvet fabric. Overall, it's and attractive pair of headbands.<br />I don't feel they are high enough quality for a formal gathering, but easily appropriate for office and casual affairs. Attached are photos to show real world images, with various angles of the headband. A close-up shows more of the texture of the fabric and the faux pearls.<br />In general, these are functional and attractive headbands. The receive a 4.25 - 4.5 star rating, with a moderately high level recommendation.",102277,16591
5.0,1614054869460,Excellent quality. Very attractive assortment of confetti and glitter polishes. Small bottles.,"This is an excellent assortment of attractive, quality gel polish, with base coat and top coat (no wipe and matte versions). The presentation elevates the worth as a gifting option.  One of the best features of this set is the bottles of gel polish provide actual representations of the contents. On the top of the cap is a sticker with proper identification of the color (including glitter, confetti varieties). Also on the front label is a small circle, under the brand name, that has an accurate portrayal of the contents. Finally, a company gets it. So, this boosts the rating a bit.<br />There are 16 varieties of gel polish, with confetti and glitter. The consistency is perfect, allowing application of a thin coat. An ability to apply a thin coat is essential, mainly due to the size of these bottles. They are 5ml (0.17fl oz), which is one of the smallest bottles of gel polish that i've encountered. This is actually a disappointing size/quantity of gel polish. Based on the size of the bottles of gel polish, I consider this to actually be a sampler set, as opposed to a set of 'normal' sized bottles of attractive confetti, glitter gel polishes. So, i guess one can try out the various polishes and then purchase larger bottles of desired varieties.<br />Overall, I feel all of the polishes in the assortment are visually attractive. The polishes are excellent quality, and produce excellent results. The significant other tested the gel on some fake nails, and i commented that it looks beautiful as is...no need to add any embellishments/decorations. She agreed., but said she'd combinde solid color gel polish with these, and add some rhinestones or other decorations, maybe create a marbled effect. I could see her creative juices flowing.<br />The product does match the descriptions and pictures in the product details. The presentation is effective and top notch. We like the quality and consistency of the gel polishes and base/top coats.  If the bottles were at least the size of the base/top coat bottles, this set would be perfect and worth 5 stars. As currently configured, based on observations and impressions, this quality 'sampler' set earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",102277,1541
5.0,1613951680692,Excellent gel polish. 6 glorious colors.,"A smart presentation elevates this as a gifting option. You receive 6  bottles, 8ml (0.26fl oz), of popular fall, winter colors.  The significant other loved 5 of them, and thought the brown was nice, but doesn't complement her. But, that is would work nicely if she used contrasting decorations on it. So, actually all 6 are attractive and usable, but she was especially fond of the other 5. haha.<br />Attached are photos to show the unboxing, and images of the product. Also a close-up of the gel polish that was being used today.<br />The gel polish is rich and somewhat thick. The significant other said it's really good. That she can use a thin layer and get good coverage. The bottles are numbered, but wouldn't it be smart to put a dot with the actual color of the enclosed gel polish on the bottle top? She agreed, and shrugged her shoulders. Since this seems like an industry standard, of not identifying the colors with...color, the lack thereof does not ding the rating.<br />These seem to be quality gel polishes. The colors are rich and look great after UV curing. Personally, I don't comprehend 'fall, winter' colors, but I appreciate the vibrant color.<br />Based on initial impressions, this set receives a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",102277,3351
5.0,1613265469654,Very nice design/form. Easy base top connection. Provides USB ports.,"This is a surprising UV curing lamp. It has a minor elaboration of the conventional design, allowing for a slightly wider opening, but still having a multi=angle lamp placement. 72 Watts is not the most powerful UV rating for this gel curing/drying lamp, but is more than ample power to do the job in reasonably quick time.<br />That said, I believe that this UV lamp actually normally will output 36W, unless you specifically activate the ""Double Power"" setting. To do this, you select one of the 3 'regular' timers: 10S, 30S or 60S (S = seconds). This sets the timing for the lamp operation. If you then press the last button, which is also the 99S ""Lowe Heat Mode"" button, and hold for about 3 seconds, it will activate the lamp into 72W...double the power. Thus the regular default UV setting is 36W.  If you press the 99S button, the UV power will gradually increase over the 99 seconds.<br />The device also has a sensor to turn the system on/off depending if it senses hand/foot in the cavity. If you need more time, just hit one of the timer buttons again.<br />There is no power on/off button. Once you plug the power adapter in, the unit is 'on' and ready to go, once you set timer and insert your fingers.<br />While the opening is wider than most other UV lamps, it's still a tight fit for both hands. But, I appreciate the slight elaboration of the cavity opening.<br />One new design element that I truly appreciate is the method to connect the top and base. There are small posts with magnets atop them. These magnetically attach to corresponding screws in recessed holes. So, it takes minimal effort to separate them, but easily hold together. Other lamps have a tab in slot method that sometimes is difficult to unlock or match up easily to attach. This improvement is a smart innovative upgrade.<br />Another innovation is the inclusion of USB-A and USB-C ports, located about the power plug port. Both of these USB ports are rated at only 5V 2A. So check the usb specs of any device you connect to these USB charging ports. But, it's a nice addition, anyway. It is a handy port to connect a nail dust fan, or nail drill.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with close-ups to highlight features.<br />On my wish list is a separate power on/off button, and while the display is view-oriented for the person inserting fingers, it would make sense to have the timer buttons oriented in the same manner. I think most people purchasing these lamps are DIY nail artists. It's not too difficult to manage the timer buttons, but it would just be simpler and common sense to have these controls positioned for easy operation by the user. These issues apply to all the UV lamps that I've encountered. It's a personal perspective/opinion, and does not affect the ratings of this device.<br />So, this UV curing lamp is default 36W, with the capability of user option to double power to 72W. It has a nice design and improved magnetic connection for top and base.  it's a very capable and competent device.<br />Accordingly, it earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",102277,8571
5.0,1611199777453,Very nice collection of nail art decorations. Decent value.,"This is similar to being a sampler, but with a nice quantity of most items. In fact, the product details indicates 3 cases, with 12 compartments per case. I received 4 cases, each with 12 compartments. Yes, the compartments are a bit small, but they have a reasonable quantity of glitters, gems, etc. So, getting an extra case full of goodies is certainly a much welcomed discrepancy with the product details.<br />The tweezers are decent quality, not cheap plastic but metal tweezers. The round segmented container, containing what appears to be only tiny gold beads is not as full as the picture in the product details. Possibly they spilled over into neighboring compartments, because while some segments look sparse other are quite full. I will assume if neatly and equally portioned, it would look similar to the pictures.<br />Instead of nice cute butterfly stickers, I got a sheet with strange bee themed stickers. Odd. I seriously doubt that these stidkers will get any use. (Yes, send me the right butterfly stickers. haha).<br />The containers of various foils, the content is not plentiful, but more than enough for a few applications.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the components of this nail decoration set. I feel that it easily met my expectations. The additional case of sparkly, glittery goodies actually gives a slight ratings boost. Based on a very positive impression of the set, the product receives a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",102277,835
5.0,1611190792732,"Amazingly soft brush. Premium quality, nice design.","This long handle brush is exactly as described and depicted in the product details. The handle is bamboo, and appears very durable. The brush is amazingly soft, the texture actually surprised me. The bottom of the handle has a rope loop, to hang up after use (you can also put the loop around the wrist while using it). A nice touch, rope is wound around the lower end of the handle for a more secure grip. This is useful when in the bath or shower, and water could make any handle slippery.<br />The only thing I'd change would be for a bit larger brush head. The diameter is approximately 3 inches. It's fine, but a larger brush head would be better.<br />The brush does lather up nicely, and feels nice against the skin. Time and use will determine the durability of the brush head. However, from initial impression it seems to be quality materials.<br />This brush easily met my expectations. It earns a solid 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",102277,235
5.0,1610165574675,Perfect size. Excellent silicone squeeze bottle with mini-carabiner.,"This set of 6 soft squeeze silicone bottles, with mini-carabiner (ok, they're not actually carabiners; they're belt clips, but similar to being small carabiners, allowing you to secure the bottle to backpacks, belt loops, etc). The bottles come with 3 in clear, 1 blue, 1 green and 1 pink. It's a good mix, and the clear probably being the most versatile, since you'll be able to view the quantity and more easily identify the contents.<br />The silicone appears to be very good quality, is soft enough to easily squeeze, but firm enough to retain it's shape. Plus the tactile qualities of the silicone is very nice. The screw cap has a hinged topper that has a plug that fits snugly into the spout. The cap screws onto a hard plastic threaded piece. It's a relatively simple design that just works well.<br />Using plain water as a test, there was not a single drop of leakage. A very good sign. I did not abuse the bottle, and I'm sure that with enough pressure on the silicone bottle the cap could open, or there could be a leak. But, under normal circumstances I don't see leaks happening.<br />These are ideal to keep handy good quantities of hand sanitizer, hand lotion, creams, essential oils. I like the idea of the belt clip and the general design of the bottle.<br />Examination of the bottles found uniform construction, with no defects or flaws. These are cute and functional.<br />These silicone squeeze bottles earn a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",102277,2830
4.0,1610077020628,"Very good set for a beginner. Excellent color selection, with base and top coat bottles.","The manner of presentation raises it's value as a gifting option. This is a fairly good assortment of color poly gel polishes, including 2 tubes of temperature changing polishes (an addition not usually found in beginner sets). Small jars of base coat and top coat (10ml each) complete the liquid components of this set.  2 nail art tools are included: a two sided positioning pen and nail file board (the rather large pink item in the attached photos).<br />The gel poly polishes come in 15ml (0.5fl oz) tubes. The colors cover the range of popular hues. The gel poly tends to be on the thicker side. For a beginner to intermediate user, perhaps the best approach is to use slip solution or alcohol. Put a small quantity of alcohol or slip solution into a small bowl/container. Apply some gel polish then dip your brush into the alcohol, and smooth out the polish. The alcohol or slip solution acts as a solvent to loosen up the polish, enabling the user to manipulate the polish more easily. It's better to deal with a gel polish that is too thick, than a circumstance of the polish being too loose/thin. Also, gel poly is a different product than regular liquid nail polish.<br />Overall, a very good set for beginners. Intermediate users will find use for the colors, especially the temperature based color changing varieties. And top coat and base coat bottles are always handy to have as additional resources.<br />Based on these considerations, this set obtains a solid 4 star rating.",102277,1546
5.0,1610068366632,Great amber glass spray bottles. Exactly as described and shown.,"These are excellent amber colored glass spray bottles. The capacity of each bottle is 16 ounces. Keep in mind that this is glass, not plastic. There are inherent advantages to using glass, such are durability and environmental concerns. Also, glass will not chemically interact with most liquids (however, caution is still necessary since the spray top and mechanism is composed of plastic). The disadvantage is that this kind of glass bottle is heavier than comparative plastic bottles. The amber color protects the contents from light (sunlight and uv exposure). My view is this type of spray bottle is more on the premium end of the scale.<br />Included accessories: 4 regular screw on tops, 1 screw on eye dropper top, funnel, labels and marker. Each of the bottles comes with the plastic spray top already installed. I appreciate the regular tops, which effect a better seal than the spray tops, which will protect the contents from spills, evaporation and contaminants. I wish they provided at least 2 of the eye dropper tops, but I guess even getting one, when the the product is sold as spray bottles, is a bonus.<br />The sprayer mechanism can actually rotate, it's not a one piece sprayer top, the screw on segment is separate from the spraying segment. This is not a cheap spraying cap.<br />The set of 4 amber color glass bottles fully matches the descriptions and pictures in the product details. At $34, these are a bit pricey, but the glass is substantial, not thin.<br />Overall, these are impressive, and appear to be a premium variation of spray bottle. And priced accordingly.<br />These spray bottles receive a solid 4.5 star rating.",102277,234
4.0,1610065600358,"Cute design, nice colors. Functional misting spray bottle.","Even though these spray bottles look like giant pills (capsules), they are not a pill to operate. The set of 8, 4 of each color, has a clear bootle, with a pastel color (pink and blue) snap on top. In addition, there is a small clear cap that covers the spray head. So, in effect, there are 2 caps that cover the spray bottle. Hopefully, if there is a leak, either one or both caps will contain the liquid.<br />Even though the spray bottle looks like capsule, the bottom of the bottle is flattened, so it can stand upright. I was initially concerned about this when I first examined the product.<br />Using water as a test, the spray bottle emitted a fine spray; perhaps a bit more than a misting. It would excellent for a spritz of fragrance. I cannot say how well it will deal with thicker liquids, like oils. But, the product details state that it's fine for essential oils.<br />These are cute, and individually wrapped. As such, they are perfect for gift bags. They are cute and have good quality manufacture. The set of 8 spray bottles receives a 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",102277,9368
4.0,1608163838948,Small bottles (.25 oz) of beautiful metallic glittery gel polish.,"This would make a great addition to an existing manicure/nail art set. Included in this set are 6 bottles of quality gel polish, 7.5ml (0.25 ounces). While each bottle could do a few maniures, I think of them as being more akin to samplers. For the price, I would have like more quantity.<br />It's winter, in fact we're having a severe snow storm right now. So, perhaps the cold affected the polish. Per the companies suggestion, we immersed a bottle in warm/hot water (not too hot). This had the effect of loosening the consistency of the gel polish. Whew!<br />The polish, with metallic glitter, is like metallic paint on a car, only more shiny and glittery. My original intent was to use this on 3D printed models, or for my crafts. But, the significant other made a convincing argument that it's gel NAIL polish. So, she claimed it (after I restored it via the hot water bath), and took it to her nail art/crafts station. She mentioned that it didn't have the strong 'stink' that some other glitter gel polishes have. Okay...She said that if she does her nails, she can't help me shovel the snow tomorrow. Why didn't I think of doing my nails, first?<br />The price of this set is slightly higher than comparable products (a dollar or two). I can't compare the products, but the quality of this set is very good. Plus, the fact that it needed a hot water bath, I feel the thickness is a positive indication of the quality of the polish. Being thicker means needing less for good coverage.<br />Overall, positive impresseions regarding this gel polish. It garners a solid 4 star rating, with a moderately high level recommendation.",102277,3370
4.0,1607975990055,"Nice supply of files (planks & foam), brush and cuticle cutting tool.","Basically, this is a supply of materials to sand nails (actual nails, fake nails, glues, polishes). The spongy foam has a grittiness, so it conforms to the nail with the intent to smooth out ridges or any 'imperfections'. The emery planks have 2 different levels of grit: 100 & 180. The 100 grit is suitable for artificial nails, the 180 intended for natural nails. The cleaning brush is decent and does an adequate job. The cuticle cutting tool is rather generic, but is functional, as well.<br />At under $6, this is probably priced accurately. 6 dual function emery boards, 6 gritty foam sponges, brush and cuticle cutter for the price seems acceptable. Although if you 're in the market for just emery boards and sanding sponges, you could probably find individual product sets at better values.<br />Overall, it fulfills the goals of the product details. It earns a solid 4.25 star rating, with a moderately high recommendation.",102277,3265
5.0,1607893968551,"Beautiful, precision tweezers. Nice case, with cleaning brush.","This set actually exceeded my expectations based on the pictures in the product details. It easily matches up to the descriptions and depictions in the product details. It is attractive enough, that this would be welcomed as a gift.<br />Inspection of the implements found no defects or flaws, there were no scratches or marks on the nice black surface. The lengths might be a bit on the smaller size, but they are easily manipulated with one hand.<br />The only issue I have is there is no specific slot in the case for the scissors. So, it either rests between slots or shares it with one of the tweezers.<br />Overall, these are excellent tweezers and petite scissors. It merits a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",102277,2904
5.0,1603299307441,Exciting assortment of gels. Excellence!!!,"Excellent assortment of poly gels that will complement anyone's collection. These are nice sized tubes, with popular colors and some pearlescents. This would make a welcome addition to the home nail artist, or to simply add beautiful poly gel polish to the nails. I note that this would make a good addition or complement a collection, because you'll need a UV lamp to cure the poly gel. And a brush is necessary, too.<br />Included in this set are some generic fake nails and some gold foil nail forms to facilitate nail artistry. Also, they include a container of silvery glitter as a free gift. Nice touch.<br />This is a very nice set, and the overall quality (including the presentation) makes this a serious gifting option.<br />Overall, this set earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating with a high level recommendation.",102277,1551
4.0,1598647049457,"Light pink hue, good quality. Bit pricey for one tube 15g.","This poly gel is a light shade of pink. In the product details, the picture what shows a finger/fingernail, the pink is a bit lighter than the tip of that nail. Also, depending on how thin/thick you make the nail will affect the translucent aspect, making it appear lighter or darker.<br />The product seems to be good quality, time will tell how long the nail actually lasts.<br />The main issue is this seems to be somewhat expensive compared to other brands (some of which are well established). There are sets with 4 - 6 tubes, with different shades/colors, at 3 - 4 times the cost of this one tube. (for the mathematically challenged, that makes this tube around 50 - 75% more expensive per tube.)<br />So, it's a good quality product, but the cost ratio affects the recommendation. Thus, it's a 3 - 3.75 star product with a moderate level recommendation.",102277,11372
3.0,1598564297736,"Nice, silicone back 'brush' bit too soft. Good handles.","We gave this 3 test uses for an initial assessment of this back scrubber/brush. It is designed nicely, with handles that make usage very user friendly. If they made this out of elastic, you could shower and do resistance band exercises. hehe. Seriously, the handles work well, and act as convenient loops to hang the device to dry out in the shower.<br />There is an issue with using silicone brush heads, they tend to be soft/flexible. So, if you use this brush, do not expect the same experience as a loofah or bristle brush. And, you have to really work up a lather in your hands and then transfer it to the silicone brush head. Attempts to create foam/lather by rubbing body wash or soap on the silicone just wasn't satisfactory.<br />As mentioned, the brush surface tends to be soft/gentle. The 'scrubbing' side does rub, but nowhere near deep cleaning or exfoliating level. The bumpy side, for massage, does provide a textured rub, but is even less effective for soaping and cleaning your back.<br />Maybe I'm too old school, liking my cleaning brush to be able to really scrub.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br />Did not use the included hooks, because we used the shower caddy that already had hooks for shower accessories. The bonus bath sponge looks fine, but did not use that yet. Again, maybe I don't pamper myself enough while showering. haha. If the significant other uses it, any pertinent information will be added to this review. However, I think the majority of people will be concerned about the effectiveness and quality of the back scrubber.<br />So, the product does match the description and depiction in the product details. However, my opinion is the softness of the brush hinders the effectiveness as a shower back scrubbing device. I do like that it is very resistant to mold and is extremely easy to clean and maintain. Maybe I have to learn to adapt to the softer texture of this type of brush. Based on our experience, this silicone brush garners a 3.5 rating. If you already use and like silicone back scrubbers, this is a quality product worth considering. If you are old school, this might disappoint expectations.",102277,2328
5.0,1656810665977,Moisturizes very well and leaves no greasy feeling,"Love the feel of my skin in the morning, great scent and for me anything with Aloe vera and Green tea extract is a winner. Very nicely secured packaging that makes it look expensive (but it still really is!). The pump dispenser is also cool to use. Approved for purchase next time.",102314,12700
4.0,1656003259365,"Great idea, Comfy and fun","Very much more comfortable than the regular curlers that I use because it is soft and out of the way if you do the bun (I think that's the only way to do it). Unfortunately I just layered my hair and trimmed it so that putting it in a bun is a little challenging now. So I had my daughter try it. She liked it very much because she said that it keeps her hair off her face while sleeping. It is also so soft and wearable without it being a nuisance at night. It is interesting to learn how to do it. Got to have the patience to maneuver it and make it right for you. So far the result is not how she wants it but it might take time to get it right and easy to use.<br /><br />I still think this is a great idea that is comfortable and fun to do for long hair. However, I think it should specify how long the hair should be. It should be past the collar bone , the minimum length is halfway past the shoulder blades to make it work and be effective.",102314,45411
4.0,1634074310280,Soft and simple but attractive design,"hese are very cute to wear and because you have solid colors it will not clash with whatever you are wearing. It uses a very soft material and surprisingly enough, it stays on my head. Most of the time, headbands slide off my hair because they say that my hair is too soft and shiny (I like it that way!!!) . However, it doesn't move when I do yoga or cardio because I sweat a lot and the sweat keeps it stuck where it is and still holding back those little annoying hairs that touch your face every now and then. This soft material also keeps my head cool to the touch and not hot at all. Seems that it is an efficient breathable material., It is also not tight so that it can cause headaches but just enough to be in place.  Have to get used to the design, with the criss cross on top.so you can always make it look nice while you wear it. I washed all of them before I start using them and they came out pretty well.  My only wonder is how long will it last, especially if you sweat a lot and you have to wash it all the time.",102314,376
4.0,1601412703355,"Reasonable value, Works well on first use",I love that this is double sided and the fact that I can hold it in my hands comfortably. It has the right coarseness that can smoothen calluses and hardened skin on mostly by the big toes and the heel. It can also be used in other parts of the body where needed but take care not to scrub hard as it can scratch really well. Having 4 in a pack is a great perk so I can put one in each bathroom for use.<br /><br />Questions:  The questions will take time before I can have answers which means I will be back for an update: a.  How long does each one last if using every other day?<br /> b.  Does this shred  when in use that can possibly clog drains?<br /> c.  Can you put this in the microwave to disinfect?<br /> d.  Do both sides get smoother over time so you know when to change it?<br /> e.  Will these two blocks separate after a few uses?<br /><br />I used to have a simple rough oval rock that I used as a pumice for a long time but then my kid took it and threw it in the lake thinking it was just a rock that has no use sitting in the bathroom. I have not found a good replacement since then.,102314,2366

However this has a very faint feminine scent to it and leaves my skin feeling deeply moisturized. I only use at night, as it is a bit too heavy for day use (for me).

My very first thought upon using it was that it smelled like a dog shampoo. And I don't mean that to be negative, as I still use it and continue to. It just smells more chemical than herbal, for my particular sense of smell. But I do like that it squeezes out as a lather and is super convenient to use in the shower.

""Citrus Souffle"" sounds almost too good to be true.<br /><br />But it's not. First, the scent. I get migraines, and scents are a trigger. Citrus, eucalyptus, and peppermint are OK - perfumes or manufactured fragrances have become a big ""no"" for me. Since a side effect is an extra sensitive sense of smell (which means things I put on my face have to be tolerated), I gravitate towards those I can tolerate. Sometimes even scents I usually like go awry in plastic containers or in a specific cosmetic mix. But this citrus is lovely. Limes, oranges, lemons, all rolled into one. A veritable orchard from this single cream. Wonderful.<br /><br />And the cream? So light, silky smooth, and creamy. From trying other creams, I know that if there's any chance the product will be slow to absorb, that will happen with my skin. This cream was quick to absorb, not heavy or weighing down, and left my skin feeling moisturized, refreshed, and as velvety soft as the cream itself.<br /><br />I'm also delighted that this product complies with the Australian SafeCosmetics Toxic Free Campaign and is listed as a participating vendor. Safer for me, safer for the environment in which we live. Great product, one I enjoy using.",102725,2200
4.0,1634149039100,Seems to Help,"My husband was an acne sufferer before I knew him, and still gets some problem areas on his back from sitting and getting all sweaty in his office chair. I thought maybe this would help. His skin does seem to bring out the big guns when it comes to attacking ingrown hairs and any other perceived foreign substance.<br /><br />And I have to say, upon the two-minute inspection I was allowed, it actually does seem to be helping. Even though it's not like he's using it regularly - actually, he uses it whenever I'm allowed to spray it on him after his shower and before he goes to bed. I'd say I manage to get to him about three times a week. And the impact appears, to me, to be noticeable, and beneficial - there are several problem areas that are now looking quite subdued and normal.<br /><br />I can only imagine what his overall back might look like, if he would just let me do it twice a day every day.",102725,45532

After two squeezes. You get three little dots on the brush with each squeeze, brush those on with the applicator, and wow.<br /><br />Having said that, it is a primer - so it doesn't provide all over color. It does brighten your skin - because it's white - and it does tighten. And you have to be careful (or at least, I have to be careful) not to get it near your eyes or mouth, where lots of lines are, because it tastes dreadful and I'm sure it's not designed for eyes.

This product had all the right ingredients, plus that enticing ""fragrance free.""<br /><br />But this product definitely has a scent to it; perhaps they just mean there's no added fragrance when they designate the product as ""fragrance free."" That scent might be due to the plum extract, but I'm a plum fan, and the smell was a bit dank and musty for that (although this is my super-sensitive sense of smell doing an interpretation).<br /><br />Like 2 billion people (in 2021), I suffer from chronic migraine headaches, and like 95% of those, I'm sensitive to smells. Very sensitive. Too much laundry soap is untenable. I can handle most essential oils, but manufactured scents may actually trigger a migraine. I can't have such a smell anywhere close to my nose, like, say, on my skin (or especially on my face).<br /><br />Although the initial application felt wonderful on my arm, where I test products, the smell was intolerable for me, and I had to wipe it off. I'm really bummed - it felt exceptionally good, but I just couldn't cope with the scent.

I'm not sharing them generously with anyone - they're all for me, me, me.<br /><br />First of all, I like that the products are designed for sensitive skin. Like most people, I have a mix of really delicate skin and skin on which I could get a tattoo and not notice. So I love that these products support my delicate skin areas.<br /><br />And I like that Burt's uses natural origin ingredients - and no synthetic fragrances. I feel like I type this in every review: like 1B (in 2021) people, 3:1 of which are women, I suffer from chronic migraines. And like 95% of those sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell, and for me, artificial fragrances are dreadful. (I've found artificially made ""Honey"" to be one of the worst.) Burt's Bees products consistently have mild, unobtrusive natural scents.<br /><br />That's not to say I like every single Burt's Bees product, but their baby skin care products leave my adult skin feeling baby soft. I especially like the apricot baby oil, which is extra softening, smells faintly of apricot and leaves my skin feeling wonderful.  And I'm so happy that they have the ingredients not just on the products, but listed on Amazon as well, so we know in advance what we're getting. Awesome.

The band is not tight, which is generally -my- major complaint. It's a little large, but rests comfortably behind my ears.<br /><br />And it's SO glittery! the rhinestones are just lovely.

5.0,1623170705691,Love this Hydration!,"I really love this hydrating and moisturizing product.<br /><br />I wasn't sure I would at first. Although the box is in English, and has clear instructions and ingredients, the product itself lacks those things. Celimax comes in a streamlined bottle that looks like mineral water. Aside from the general disaster that could pose with small children, the FDA requires cosmetic products sold in the USA list their ingredients on the bottle in English.<br /><br />The ingredients, by the way, which I wish Amazon would leave a spot for cosmetic vendors to include in their listings, so we would know before we order in case of allergies, are Sedum Sarmentosum, Butylene Glycol, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide NP, Xylityglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Dipotassium Glycrrhizate, Citrus Tangerina Peel Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, Glucose, Phospholifpids, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Caprylic/Capric Triclyceride, Ammonium Acryloylidimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-13 Pareth-9, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin.<br /><br />Having said that, I poured a little bit of the product onto a cotton pad in the evening and dabbed it onto my face, and onto the back of my hands. It initially felt just  a bit tacky, but almost immediately absorbed. I followed up on my face with my nightly cream. My face this morning feels AMAZING. The moisture level is through the roof.<br /><br />I also want to mention fragrance. Like 95% of chronic migraine headache sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell. Anything cosmetic that has perfume (think lip smackers) or added scent has the potential to make me nauseous and bring on a migraine. This had just a faint authentic citrus smell, vaguely pleasant, which thankfully disappeared within a few seconds of hitting the cotton ball. That kind of fragrance is ideal.<br /><br />And the effects are just amazing. I don't see my face all day, but I can sure see my hands on the keyboard. My hands are visibly more plumper, less dry, and  more hydrated. I am loving this product. Hopefully they're in process with getting their bottle properly labelled and safe for distribution in the United States, because this is my new routine. Such results!",102725,709
4.0,1620936304744,Cost Effecctive Mixed Bag,"Like most reviewers, the prospect of 12 lip liners was too tempting to pass up. I use soft crayon liners, or a brush of my lipstick, to create an one-the-spot liner all the time - so this seemed like a great buy.<br /><br />These are clearly imported. The good news is the manufacturer actually lists the ingredients on the box;  I've taken a photo of the box so you can see the ingredients - personally, I don't recommend using products where you can't see the ingredients before you order.<br /><br />The pencils you get are an interesting range, and seem to vary from package to package. Mine were in a variety of colors; the one color I was looking for - a basic nude - was not in my package - but I got a range of plums (which I never wear) and pinks (which I rarely wear).<br /><br />If you've used any of your mom's pencils, you're familiar with carmine, which can flake. You have to be careful with the pressure used to avoid application debris, but it's the best to stop lipstick from bleeding or feathering.

It does have an expiration date, so make sure the product you're using isn't past the date.<br /><br />I have to admit I'm not a fan of the ""feathery"" eyebrow look, but I am a fan of ensuring that what eyebrow you have stays in place and provides a good base to build on, which this product supports.<br /><br />Once you use this gel, you can augment your shaped eyebrows with eyebrow shadow, which can provide a light shaping line, and help fill your brow in with consistent shading.  You can build on that, or use by itself a pencil, to add additional depth or go for that vintage look. This gel just gives you another tool to make your brows more defined.",102725,42189
5.0,1618594985289,Keeps My Face Dry!,"I got these headbands because of that one enticing line: ""perfect to keep the sweat out of your face."" When I'm hot, my hairline starts dripping. Really. We call that a ""glow"" in the south, but it's just plain sweat, and it runs into my eyes, and then my eyes are stinging, my glasses get fogged and wet, and I'm just one huge, damp, panicky  blind mess.<br /><br />Which may be normal when you're working out, but when you're, say, touring the greenhouse or strolling the beach, I'm pretty sure it's unattractive. When you add sunscreen to the mix, dripping down my face, I've actually attracted a concerned crowd in the past, which makes me nervous, and then you can add clammy hands to the list of woes.<br /><br />You wouldn't think a seemingly simple headband like this would do the trick, but it actually has. The headband gets damp; my face stays dry. I normally wear a ball cap when I garden - hoping I won't burn my head while basically risking heat exhaustion - and I put this on first, then the cap.  The headband is a little bit bulky, being double thickness, but not too much so; wonder of wonders, wearing it, my face has stayed dry for the entire time I've been outside. No sweaty face, no drippy mess, no glasses I can't see through (or gnats interested in this new swampy damp visitor). I would wear these if they were hideous, they're so effective, but they're not - navy with flowers or white with flowers - I could wear them as a fashion statement.

5.0,1654442731671,Doesn't accentuate dryness!,"For the first time, I’ve found a powder that doesn’t accentuate my very dry skin. This powder mattifies my face, but does not settle into my fine lines or give me an overall powdery look. This has worked great for setting makeup and reducing shine while still appearing natural! I don’t have any complaints currently about the performance of the product. The size of the container is pretty generous and feels of good quality. A mirror is also included in the compact, which is always a plus!",102936,2007
5.0,1651775500669,Hydrating and blurring!,"I absolutely love this primer! It was a pleasant surprise. It really does produce a blurring effect on the skin and the best part is it doesn’t dry my skin out. It provides a smooth, hydrated canvas for my makeup. If I use a luminous or dewy foundation, this primer really helps achieve a glow without looking oily. Overall, I really do like this product!",102936,14023
4.0,1635608911078,Great value!,"These makeup sponges are a great value for the price. I love that so many come in the set and the assorted colors are a nice touch.<br /><br />The design of the sponges is simple. There is a flat slanted bottom I like to use for patting in foundation and the pointed tip that is great for concealing or reaching small places around the nose, eyes, etc.<br /><br />The sponges are reasonably sized, but when placed under water they expand greatly! I do think these are great for the money, but for foundation I’m not crazy about the finish it gives. The sponge is somewhat firm, so I feel like it can be hard to really sink the product into the skin, but it is great for concealer or using the sponges dry for powder. Overall, I’m satisfied!",102936,196
3.0,1634666051169,Not moisturizing enough for my dry skin,"This is a lightweight cream that is probably more suitable for warm weather. I absolutely love the smell of this cream, it is very fragranced. It has a nice floral scent that reminds me of being in a field of flowers.  Sensitive skin may not enjoy that much. But, it does feel very luxurious and silky on the skin.<br /><br />My cons are that I did not get any dewy effect from the cream and it actually gave my skin a mattified appearance. I think it just may not be hydrating enough if you have skin on the dry side like mine.<br /><br />While I won’t be using this as my every day moisturizer, I did find that it worked well for me as a makeup base before I apply my foundation.<br /><br />The other thing I noticed is that there is a slight hint of shimmer to the cream when looking at it in the jar. It is not chunky and can’t be felt on the skin. It almost looks like the cream has more of a pearlized finish.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this cream to those with oily or combination skin. It just didn’t work the best for my dry skin.",102936,2986
3.0,1633640868862,Lashes feel a little stiff,"I was really excited to get 40 pairs of lashes! That is enough to last me all year! The variety in the pack is great, because there is something everyone can enjoy with these styles.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is these lashes do feel a little stiff upon taking them out of the case. The band was somewhat hard and took some work to fit the shape of my eye, which made the process a little time consuming. I typically prefer a thinner band on my lashes, because it is easier to mold to my eye shape, but the band on these lashes are pretty thick. I won’t say it is a dealbreaker, but it’s inconvenient in a rush.<br /><br />After the lashes are on, the don’t really feel heavy on the eyes, but I can definitely tell they are there.<br /><br />Overall, I will use these lashes, but they aren’t my favorite.",102936,774
3.0,1659033941411,Silicone Cover for Brushes - STRONG GRIP,The order comes with 9 pieces of the silicone makeup brush covers. There are two (2) different sizes for covering different type of brushes. One type for larger brush for like foundation and the other type of smaller brushes like eye shadow. The cover provides good protection over the brush but also protects the bag that would hold this brush from leaving powder or color marks. The protection part is good but I had mad struggle trying to get the silicone cover on my make up brush. It's not easy and it has an extremely strong grip. Once its grips on something it is so hard to remove or slide down to use the brush.,102948,35602
2.0,1655153976115,Gel Mold Remover - Doesn't work so well,The order comes with one (1) mold remover that comes in a bottle. it comes with a cone shaped cap that you replace so you can dispense the mold remover gel. It allows for you to get to the corners and edges where the mold builds up and it's hard to scrub unless you have a thin brush to work with.<br /><br />The gel is clear and you squeeze the bottle for it to come out. It's pretty much the gel sitting on top of a molded sealant in my showers that is supposed to slowly kill the mold and you remove it by wiping it down a few hours later. The gel clumps and it stays there. I have seen it work slowly but it does not remove much of the built up mold.,102948,4086
4.0,1651455087188,Organic Cleansing Oil to remove waterproof eye make-up,"The order comes in a jar of 100 ml in size. It's in a dark glass bottle. It's a cleansing oil to remove make-up. I use the cleansing oil to remove waterproof make-up like the eyeline or mascara that would otherwise need a lot of rubbing around the sensitve eye area with a regular cleanser. After the hard make-up is removed, I use the regular facial cleanser to wash my face.<br /><br />The bottle has a pump that dispenses the oil. The cleansing oil is clear and has a nice scent to it from the cherry essential oil. I love that the product is all vegan and organic and USDA certified.",102948,2488
3.0,1650757821368,Bright Colored Silicone Patches for Sun protection,The order comes with a pack of the under eye patches. There are four pairs in total. I ordered the pink eye patches. They are to be applied under the eyes for sun protection. They are thin silicone patches. It's good for areas that are prone to get sun spots and freckles. You apply it on dry skin. The color is a bit bright to wear outside and go unnoticed. I wish there was one with natural tone but maybe those colors don't help reflect the sun.,102948,13145
4.0,1647272369172,Dual Tip Eyeliner - Fine Lines for Felt and Brush Tips,"The order comes with one (1) liquid eyeliner. The eyeliner has dual tips on both ends, which provides a selection of either the felt or brush tips. Both brushes have fine tips so it's good for drawing precised lines. It glides on pretty easily. I do need to apply a couple layers because it applies pretty thinly. Also, the color can sometimes thin out and it not completely jet balck unless you press down on it.",102948,1712
5.0,1627417003508,Korean Exfoliating Scrub - Better than Loofahs,"The order of the Korean exfoliating bath wash cloth comes in 6 pieces. There are four with the same size and two that are a little bit longer in length.  If you are familiar with the traditional korean scrubs, they are sized much smaller (See attached photo for size comparison. Dark green vs light green from another brand). I love the ones I ordered because I can fit all of my hand and it will cover more surface area than the old one I use. I can scrub away fast and more with this product.<br /><br />The exfoliating bath wash cloths are very lightweight and dries easily. Traditionally, I use them after sitting in the sauna or a hot bath. The dead skin easily peels away using these scrubs. Because I don't live near a Korean sauna, I just use these on the daily in the showers. I prefer using these over any loofah. You feel so refreshed and clean.",102948,2318
4.0,1625948940671,9 Soft Brushes in Pastel Color,"The order comes with 9 brushes in different shapes and sizes. Each brush comes invidually packaged in paper wrap. The handle of the brush is beautiful pastel blue. The brush bristles is also in pastel blue with pink gradient to the tip. All of the brushes are very soft but I do wish there were some firmer ones to be used for my lips or eyebrow. So far, none of the bristles have fallen out and remain in good shape. It would be nice if it came with a travel case that held all the brushes. It's a great brush set for anyone.",102948,205
5.0,1625800228958,Quality Face Roller/Massager - Good Weight,The Sand & Sky Face Roller/Massager Tool comes in a beautiful package. The face massager tool is made out of metal and has a good weight compared to the plastic ones I've used in the past. There are two twin balls that you roll across your face.  They pull and push gently against your skin as you roll. It's an intersting sensation. These balls are also made out of metal and provides this cool sensation on your skin.<br /><br />I use the tool after the base of my skin care routine is applied. It helps my skin absorb without me having to pat on it numerous times. The face roller also helps sculpt your face but also get circulation flowing on your face without having to go visit a massage salon.,102948,373
4.0,1624995008671,Shampoo Bar - Shrinking Fast,"This oat delicacy shampoo bar for fine hair has many positive aspects. I love the smell. It's plant based and environmentally friendly. It's a Garnier product.<br /><br />I have been searching for an item like this because I travel a lot and shampoo my hair daily. Unfortunately, I have a lot of hair and because I like lots of lather and shampoo my hair so often this bar is shrinking fast. They advertise it for two months but I just hope I can get a full month out of it. I love everything about the shampoo bar minus the longevity.",102948,2282
5.0,1624307934053,"Lightweight, High Absorption, Moisturizing Essence for Foundation of Skin Care Routine","The Celimax The Real Sedum Aqua Boosting Essence comes in a clear bottle of 150ml. It's a good size bottle that will probably will probably last me 9-10 months. The packaging is attractive and highly simple and modern. There's almost no scent to the essence, maybe a very faint scent of citrus if I were to pinpoint, which is ideal for people who have sensitive nose.<br /><br />I am not a chemist so the ingredients described have no meaning to me. Though, the essence contains hyaluronic acid which is the main ingredient in the toner that I use for final stage of my daily facial cleaning process. The toner is a lot thicker in content and leaves my skin sticky whereas this essence is very water based and feels amazing after applying. My skin reacted and absorbed the essence right away and left my skin smooth and moisturized without feeling any stickiness. Even my hands got moisturized and I do not have to wipe or wash away after the application. I learned through reading the product description that this essence contains low molecular weight hyaluronic acid, which with its small molecular structure makes it easier for it to absorb into the skin. This speaks true to the application because I use the essence right after I wash my face and this sets the base for my skincare routine and helps maxmize the absorbtion of other products.<br /><br />Without reading too much into it, this is a five-star product that is lightweight with almost no scent, keeps your skin moisturized and hydrated, and prepped for your daily skin care routine.",102948,709
3.0,1623942127933,Spiral Hair Ties in Neutral Tones - Stretch Way Too Easily,"The order comes with 18 spiral hair ties in various colors of neutral tone. I perfer the spiral hair ties over the regular black scrunchiis. They do not leave any crease in the hair and also feels much more comfortable to wear. However, these hair ties are on the lower quality. They stretch way too easily and does not retain the elasticity for too long. After a few uses I ended up using a new one. I lose hair ties all the time so it's a good replacement until I have to buy a new pack.",102948,840
5.0,1623703543568,"Beautiful, Elegant Pearl Headbands","The order of the pearl headbands come in six, packaged individually. Each headband have different sized pearls and design on them. They are so pretty and elegant. The headbands are versatile and can be worn for both casual and formal occassions. You can wear multiple headbands together or separately.<br /><br />The headbands fit comfortably. They're not too tight around my head which is average sized. I have not had to take them off during the day, where some headbands leave me with headache and pain behind the ears. Depending on the headband style, the end piece either has the pearl or velvet wrapped.",102948,19178
5.0,1620761176566,Good Face Mask for Moisturization,"The order of the face masks come packaged in a box. There are 24 face masks individually packaged. The mask comes with a clear plastic layer underneath that's folded up with the face mask. This allows for the face mask to be easily removed andn opened, because other products just have the face mask folded up by itself and it's always a struggle to unfold them.<br /><br />The face mask is a perfect fit for my face. There are plenty of face masks out there that are oversized or does not have the slits in the right place to fit the face form, but I could tell the fit would be perfect the moment I put them on.<br /><br />The face masks are soaked in hyaluronic acid and there was plenty left in the package after the face mask was removed, for me to squeeze additional gel onto my face. I left the face mask on for about 15 minutes. The area around my nose and cheeks still had plenty of moisture on it but the edges near the chin were dried up. The face mask seems to harden in the areas that are dried up.<br /><br />After the application, my skin did not absorb all the serum and it was still wet. I gently tapped around the area to get it evenly spread and dissolve. The skin felt moisturized. It wasn't sticky nor did it dry up my face. I am satisfied with the result and the product.",102948,1133
4.0,1620101164451,Pretty Set of Scrunchies for Bridal Party,"I ordered the set of scrunchies for a friend's bachelorette party. The order comes with 7 scrunchies total. There are six pink for the bridal party and one white for the bride. The pink is a dust rose color more than the pink but it's very attractive. The set is adorable and can be used for many different occassions.<br /><br />The material is soft, shiny and looks super chic. Because the material has a sheen, you need to tie it pretty tight so your hair stays in and there is no slippage.",102948,220
5.0,1617336326078,"Slim, Comfortable Headbands For Every Color of Your Outfit","The headbands come in 12 colors. There are so many colors to choose from. I have been wearing one to match my outfit each day. The headbands are thin and have the different colored fabric wrapped around them. Some headbands when wearing for the whole day make my head hurt, but these headbands were comfortable to wear, not tight around my head and kept my hair in place and looking fabulous.",102948,230
4.0,1615160405039,Microfiber Towel to Cover Entire Length of My Long Hair,"I have long and thick hair and it's always a hassle to dry them. I have been purchasing different types of microfiber hair towels and I want to say this is one of the best out there. First of all, many claim that their product works for long hair but when I try them I usually get a good length of hair sticking out. The towel is never long enough to cover the length of my hair. However, I was so happy to find that this microfiber towel covered my entire hair. The towels are absorbent and keeps my hair drying nicely without the use of a hair dryer, which tends to create a lot of fizz. The only thing is that because the towel is longer and larger than usual, it tends to slip. I recommend wrapping the hair before tying on to the button to keep the towel tightly wrapped around your hair. Other than that, I have no complaints with the product.",102948,14266
5.0,1615158696650,Quality Shower Cap to Prevent Moisture on Styled Hair,"This is a quality shower cap I have been looking for. I have long, thick hair and sometimes after straightening my hair I just want to wash my body, I would have to tie or clip my hair up. But unfortunately, water still ends up wetting my hiar. The shower cap material is good quality. It is thick and waterproof. The cute, floral design is a plus and there is a cute bow in the front. Inside there is a silicone band that will hold the cap in place so I don't have to worry about the cap falling off. I have worn the cap around the house just to keep hair out of the way and it doesn't hurt my head. It has been super useful keeping my hair dry and style intact.",102948,223
5.0,1611428350374,Effortless Auto-rotating Curling Iron with Three Sizes,"The automatic hair curling iron is an excellent tool! I have tried an automatic curler from a differet brand but this I love because it comes with three different curling irons for the different curl thicknesses. Instead of having three separate curling irons, you have one device with the option to switch out as you choose.<br /><br />It's an easy set up. You just push down the curl iron of choice into the barrel, then rotate the tip of the wand to lock it in place, then change the heat temperature from the bottom knob. You will notice the color change to red when it heats up, but the color will stay green when plugged in even if you ""turn it off.""<br /><br />Most curlers are already heavy and tiring enough to hold and rotate up in the air, but this hair styling tool eliminate the need. All you have to do it hold it up and make it rotate. You slide a section of your hair in between the crowns and press the rotate the button to the left or right, depending on the direction of the curls you want to shape. One thing I love about this device is that, instead of having to clip the hair with standard curling iron that literally leave the end of your curls ""clipped,"" this allows for more natural look as it curls it to the end.<br /><br />I was absolutely happy with the results and the effortless time it took to style my hair. The curls also lasted throughout the day with no problem.",102948,974
4.0,1606331965024,Portable Hand Sanitizer Silicone Tubes,"I am using these for hand sanitizers. The order comes with 3 white, 1 pink, light blue, and blue. They are silicone tubes with white plastic caps. It comes with black key chain holder so it’s portable. Each tube holds 60 ML. I put high alcohol content hand sanitizer so it’s more liquid than gel. Unfortunately I have to be extra careful for the liquid to not spill out when using. Otherwise the tubes should be able to contain the get and you’d just squeeze the tube. The bottle itself is spill proof. The cap is sealed tight. It is easy to refill through the wide mouth opening to fill up with any content.",102948,2830
4.0,1606083616947,Basic Color Gel Nails - no color indication,"The order comes with six different colored gel nail polish. The strange thing is, there are no colors labeled on the bottle. There’s a sticker for you to apply the gel and cure on sheet of white circle stickers to put on the bottle yourself. I found this strange and did not like it at all. The color swatches that I applied the gel polish to had the colors coming off of the sticker so I have to open the bottles to check the colors..<br /><br />There set comes with six different colors -<br />15 - black<br />16 - white<br />17 - dark purple<br />18 - dark brown/grey<br />19 - light beige<br />20 - red<br /><br />I like the basic colors. The gel quality I would say is average. Make sure you use the base and top coat that works because it makes a world difference. The first time I applied, the gel coating peeled off in a matter of few hours of application. I used a different brand of coating and they have so far lasted 1.5 weeks. I applied the gel nail polish just as I do every two weeks - dehydrate nails, base and top coat application with LED/UV lamp.",102948,10017
5.0,1598036424116,"Sturdy, Quality Bamboo Brush","I ordered this BF Bamboo brush after trying their Bamboo Steel brush. If you are looking for a sturdy brush that provides relief while brushing your hair, look no further, this is it! It’s hard to find quality brush at stores. Usually the products they offer have brushes where the color coating ends up peeling off or the brush bristles are just not made with quality. This brush feels strong where not too much pressure or weight is required to detangle. The bristles on this brush are round and feels so good against your head. I have thick hair so I need something to get through the hair jungle and this brush does the job. The order also comes with a black comb which I gave to my dad to use as it will just get stuck in my long thick hair.",102948,2938
5.0,1597860306445,"Simple, Lightweight, Motion Detecting UV Lamp","[[VIDEOID:387349b9b035106729d3ca1d6b5d9718]] I ordered the UV lamp because my smaller lamp took forever to dry and was not efficient. At first I thought the product was cheaply made because of how plasticky it felt but I love how lightweight the lamp is. It is convenient to carry to any room or house of preference. You honestly do not even need a tutorial or instruction because of how simple it is to use. Simply plug in the lamp and it will automatically motion detect your hand and foot to trigger the lamp to dry. The default timer is set for 120 seconds but there are four other settings you can change to - 10s, 30s, 60s, 99s. I always have trouble with nails because it never dries fast enough and I’m impatient and end up messing up my nails before it dries. With this lamp, I went through two cycles and they dried up to perfection. Highly recommend this product for anyone seeking a UV lamp!",102948,1556
3.0,1596769782161,Cleanser for Make-up Removal,"I ordered C'est Moi Gentle Cleansing Water for when I need to quickly remove my make-up. The product is similar to Micellar Cleansing Water and works well as a cleanser. With a few drops on my cotton pad, I was able to remove my make-up with no residue. Be careful when you dab the water onto the cotton pad as it can pour out. Though the product is described as a no-rinse cleanser, I would recommed washing your face after using the cleansing water. I worked out after removing my make-up with the cleanser but the product got in my eyes and it irritated them like when soap gets in your eyes. It's a good product for make-up removal but not enough to change my cleansing routine.",102948,1838
3.0,1646875288475,Quite sticky (interesting consistency); smells exactly like the ingredients (coffee and salt!),"EDITED: Tried to be descriptive in the title. This scrub is very interesting to me, because it is MUCH stickier than I thought it would be. I previously was using the Terre de Mars coffee/aloe scrub and I got GREAT results (soft, matte skin after washing off with near complete resolution of my frequent forehead breakouts), so I wanted to give this coffee product a try when I saw it for comparison. From a smell standpoint it's fine (like sweet coffee but with a saltiness to it), and texture-wise it does have some grit behind it to feel like you're getting a good scrub when you apply it (can see the sea salt). As I noted earlier though, it is QUITE sticky, and the dark color of the coffee can be a bit difficult to get off your skin (I follow the scrub w/ a cleanser and thorough rinse after which gets it all off without too much mess). I haven't used it long enough to say it's really making a big difference, but the few times I did use it I did feel like my skin was softer than before, so that's a good sign.",102962,2316
4.0,1631069081660,Cute but flimsy,"These clips are exactly as pictured -- they are quite cute, and perfect for a little girl's accessorizing. They are made of a sheer material that resembles the kind of stuff that sheer tops are made out of (but like, pure craft material). I like the colors and I like that the clips themselves are wrapped in ribbon so they won't easily tear at hair, but they do look and feel rather... cheap? The wings of a couple of the clips are permanently creased because they were folded on themselves inside the little plastic wrap when they came. Overall, I think it would be better if they were a bit smaller, but made of a more sturdy material like satin or silk? I think they would be very cute, and might even look professional for a woman's use!",102962,1832
4.0,1607557731528,Seems like the real deal!,"I was really curious about this product so I decided to give it a try. I've only used it once since it just arrived today. I don't see a difference in my face contour or anything (again, granted, I've only used it once), but honestly I will keep using it if for no other reason that the fact that it feels nice on my face! I also tried the scratch test on this, and there isn't a single mark on the roller. So I do think it's actual rose quartz and not the fake plastic stuff!",102962,28389

You put it over the brush end without bristles and slide it up over the bristles. You can slide it down when you’re using the brush so you don’t have to take it off. There are also covers for applicators for lip gloss. They have a little suction cup on the bottom so you can keep it attached to the container so you don’t lose it.

4.0,1650945436680,Good hold,I have tried hair flyaway gel before that comes with a mascara wand but this one comes with a wand that looks like it would go to a lipgloss. I feel like the wand itself makes it messier to apply because you are just rubbing it on your hair instead of brushing it to catch all the flyaways. The gel itself works well but you just have to apply a little more pressure with the wand to get it to go where you want to go.,102977,14024
5.0,1650839964770,Great for applying foundation,These make up blenders are soft and great for applying foundation.

It fits perfect, its VERY well made, I get the feeling that it will last, the jewels seem very well attached, I dont feel like they're gonna fall off, and it is absolutely beautiful! About the heavy, it has some weight. Perhaps heavy is a bit ""heavy"" of a word, but I want to stress with that heavy tonation that its not super thin and cheap, and its not a dollar store quality! You can tell when you pick it up that its a VERY NICELY MADE PRODUCT!<br />In addition to all that, it comes with a small chrome shiny tree branch pin. There may be another term for it, but thats what Im calling it. The pin is a VERY nice touch, and looks great with the headband!

Enter this electric trimmer.  First of all, it comes with a number of attachments which seems great.  However upon further use it seems that it's just not great at shaving things, especially when the facial hair trimmer is attached.  I wasn't expecting it to be as smooth as a blade but I wasn't expecting to be left with full patches of stubble visible when I ran it over my face.  As much as I wanted to like this, it's just not a great performer for the face.

The amount of use you'll get out of single charge for instance is quite impressive (although this will depend on how long you've been using it per brushing).  The fact that it comes with a number of spare heads is also good, so you wont be left wanting more.  However the brushing action is simply a vibrating action that will get your teeth cleaner than a regular brushing but not quite as good as an oscillating rotational design BUT considering this toothbrush is about half the price of the competition, that's not too bad.

5.0,1667850807629,Superb Bakuchiol cream,"This is a lovely Bakuchiol cream. Bakuchiol is a fantastic natural alternative to retinol. It’s safe for sensitive skin and pregnant women! It’s not photosensitive (unlike retinol) so it can be used both am and pm. The packaging of this product feels simple yet luxurious. The glass jar packaging reminds me a lot of herbivore products.<br /><br />This cream is lovely to use. It is a thicker heavier cream so, it does take a little longer to absorb. It’s non greasy and although it is a thick cream it does feel light weight once applied. As the cream absorbs it does give a nice radiant dewy glow to my skin tone. I can easily see how this cream would help with anti aging and fine lines with repeated daily use. I’ve been using this cream for about almost a week now and I love seeing my skin so well nourished and hydrated.<br /><br />The ingredients in the cream are delightful. There is one ingredient that I always acknowledge. This cream does use a silicone ingredient polysilicone-34. I honestly don’t know much about this silicone ingredient and it might be the first product I have used that includes this particular silicone. This cream is gentle and effective even for sensitive skin but I do always acknowledge silicones in the ingredient list. In the week I have used this cream I have not noticed any close comedones, millia or any other adverse side effects from adding this cream to my skin care routines.<br /><br />I love how deeply nourishing, refreshed and hydrating this cream is for my skin. Even though it takes a while to absorb when I use this cream in the mornings its still easy to apply my make up once this cream does absorb. I don’t wear foundation most days but occasionally I do wear a finishing powder to even out my skin tone if need or to help blend out my highlighter or blush. This cream doesn't sit heavy on my skin or interfere with my make up application or longevity.<br /><br />I am very happy with this cream and would absolutely recommend it to those who have sensitive skin (as long as you tolerate silicone okay), or to those who prefer a retinol alternative that can still yield good results.",103332,39080
5.0,1662875195861,Surprisingly fantastic foot cream,"I personally have callouses on both of my big toes and coarseness along the edges of my feet as I love to be bare foot and wear flip flops. I was a swimmer and lifeguard for half of my life or so. So I have spent countless amount of time being bare foot, in and our of pools, and loving feeling the ground on the soles of my feet. I live in a warm climate for most of the year so I wear flip flops for 75% of the year. And my feet reflect that. It’s easy to see how dry my feet are. I have tried a foot mask treatment from this company that did not help with my callouses BUT, this cream is incredible. It immediately softened my two callouses. This cream doesn’t have a scent and it has phenomenal ingredients.<br /><br />Upon first use my feet feel and look instantly and deeply moisturized. I must admit I rarely moisturize my feet. I have hard floors so, I usually don’t consider moisturizing my feet because I don’t want to slip. This is a heavy cream. You really don’t need much to coat both of your feet. For me, a dime size for each foot or quarter size for both feet works perfectly. I’m actually shocked how moisturizing this feels on my usually tough feet. You can really feel the coconut oil in this product. It feels like a really rich and intensely moisturizing cream. I would highly recommend this to any one who loves to be bare foot or spends lots of time bare foot or in flip flops. ☀️🩴",103332,2228

It does a wonderful job massaging in serums and whatnot to promote better absorption as well.<br /><br />If I'm being nit-picky, the only problem I would have is that due to the angled rollers, going one way vs the other feels different and if you don't rotate the roller, it will give you an uneven massaging experience.<br />Also, the price point probably would be an issue as you can potentially get a lesser quality roller for way cheaper.<br /><br />Overall, quite happy with it.",103606,373

2.0,1647120847113,"Left a brown film on my skin, had to rewash after using","I used this body scrub while in the shower. It smells like chocolate, so I like the scent. The product is fairly thick with lots of gritty stuff in it for exfoliation, though I found I needed to mix it up with my finger before using it since it had separated a bit. It's definitely messy, so I'm glad I chose to use it in the shower. I initially liked using the scrub and how it felt, but then I had issues rinsing it off. No matter how much I tried to rinse, there was a dark film on my skin, which was very noticeable on my fair skin. Even scrubbing with a washcloth didn't help. I ended up needing to use soap to get the product off, which seemed frustrating because I had already washed before using the scrub, since the directions indicated my skin should be freshly cleansed before using it. I think in the future I will use the scrub, then get washed so that I don't end up with the dark film on my skin. It seemed like such an expensive product shouldn't leave me looking dirtier than I was before I got into the shower! In good news, my skin can be sensitive to some products, and this scrub didn't bother me at all.",103631,2316
3.0,1605407780120,Worked well but caused a rash,"I hate that normal deodorant has so many ingredients than can be harmful, so I was excited to try this natural alternative. This unscented stick really doesn't have a smell to it at all, yet it works really well for keeping oder away. As expected, it doesn't stop perspiration since it's not an antiperspirant, but most of the time it didn't bother me. The stick is a little harder than typical deodorant, but it applies fine after holding it to your skin for a few seconds. I don't feel like I have to use as much as I would with other products. Unfortunately, after I used this product for a while I started noticing that I was getting rashes where I use it. I'd use my old product for a few days and it would go away, but the rash returned when I used this product again. I'm not sure what it is about this deodorant that bothers me, but it looks like I'm going to have to stick to my previous brand for now.",103631,2538

I previously used cotton rounds, but liked the idea of using something that would be a little more friendly to the environment. The set comes with lots of pads, so I never run out, even when I fall behind with the laundry. They are so easy to care for - they come with a mesh bag that they can be washed in, though I've also had no issues just putting them directly into a load without it. The pads are made with a very soft material that feels nice on my skin but also is effective for cleaning. After several uses and washes, they show no wear, so I feel like they are going to last a long time. 5 stars!",103631,7607

The sanitizer dries quickly and doesn’t seem to irritate or dry out my hands... if anything it makes my hands feel softer. The 2-pack is convenient so I can keep one bottle in the cup holder in my car and the other at home by the front door.",103631,85

I figured I'd concentrate on using this product in those areas, and I'm amazed that my skin looks almost normal now!  My skin is so much softer and healthy looking.<br /><br />This scrub is creamy with Himalayan pink salt acting as the scrub.  I like that the scrub is made with a material that is natural and environmentally friendly, unlike microplastics.  It has a pleasant smell that isn't too strong, and it is non-irritating even on my sensitive skin.<br /><br />I'm rating this item 5 stars: I love it!",103631,895

Job well done",103727,2234
5.0,1653758520739,Provides enough traction to not be to slippery,"Works great as a message lotion.  I saw some reviews it was kind of sticky or tacky as a complaint, the thing is with a massage lotion that’s what you want.  Most lotions are very slippery, and the problem there is that it’s hard to dig in or go slow and you can slip right past the problem areas before you’ve even had a chance to “find the lay of the land” and identify one focus on key areas. Usually you’d just use oils over lotions and yes you do want something you can reduce friction for a smooth seven pass, but not really slippery, there has to be a happy medium.  The smell is mild and leaves you open to pairing with a complementary aromatherapy to go with that relaxing message.",103727,191
5.0,1647272557824,Best one I’ve tried out of a few brands,"This thing is legit. I’ve been trying a few different brands so far this is a clear winner.  Not only can you feel and smell the difference the results are much better.  Couple things at Seth this apart from other models I’ve tried first as speed I’ve tried another models it takes about five seconds between flashes to recharge and reset to the next flash this one just keeps on ticking it has a fast mode for larger areas at a lower range but I don’t even think it’s necessary it works fast enough without having to switch to that setting.  Also what’s really cool is it measures your skin tone with each flash and adjust for the proper settings, if the skin is too dark or it’s not against the skin properly it won’t flash.  Unfortunately as with other things IPL‘s there are a couple skin tones and hair colors that are not compatible.  So far the results are pretty good I still have several weeks left in a treatment. If this continues to go well I feel sorry for my wife because my back is next lol I’m not Chewbacca hairy but I still hate hair in pretty much my whole torso and I’ve been contemplating waxing for a while, but all the TikTok videos of dudes getting destroyed by waxing I think I’ll stick to this method.

The bubbler and music work great although I do wish there was volume to turn down the music. It's easy to use for they to do on their own if they wish. I to think over all the accessories for it are geared to older kids because the stick on nails were too big for my 8 year old. The toe dividers and flip flops are huge and seem more sized for adults. The nail polish is quick dry which is great for kids who are impatient and file works fine.,104255,10917

Ive read a couple other reviews that say it doesn’t dry and I did have that issue at first, but I figured out that you need to use really thin layers and to leave you hands under the light for about 15-20 longer than the instructions say. That’s colors are really pretty and I can’t wait to play around with the gems that come with it.<br /><br />My complaints are that the colors aren’t labeled so you have to open them to see the colors. Also the colors smell horrible! They are very strong and sting my nose. The top and bottom coats are labeled and don’t have a sting smell.

I will say I have oily eyelids and noticed that they don't last more than a couple hours.<br />I think these would make a great gift for adults, teens, or even younger kids who want play makeup.

The bottle is so soft that you have to really be careful with how you squeeze it. It easily splurts out blobs that are too much for just hand sanitizer.

That one expires even sooner - on Sep 2020.<br /><br />I don't know what Amazon's policy is on expiration dates for skin care products. But, if I were purchasing this from a physical store, I wouldn't get something that expires in less than 3 months. I expect a product to be good for at least a year. Granted, expired doesn't automatically mean that a product is unusable. However, customers don't like getting old stock especially when a customer still has to pay full price for it. I didn't it but, if I were, I'd be annoyed enough to return the item.<br /><br />I also don't know if Higher Education regularly sends soon-to-expire items to Amazon or if they're just doing this to Vine purchases. Either way, that's really not good practice. For a facial scrub that costs $25, I don't expect the seller to pass off expiring products on me.<br />UPDATE - After going through reviews of the two Higher Education products, it appears that they regularly send soon-to-expire products to customers.

So a thick soap or sanitizer will not be able to effectively be dispensed. I dilute the hand soap with water as a solution. The canister can hold a lot and this is great as the dispenser is not too big nor too small. I usually take two dispenses to wash my hands. What I don't like about this is it does not have a sleep mode on to conserve battery life. It just keeps on with flashing light indicator.

The quality also differs from one another, some are really well made, some are loosely fitted and not well attached.

Its application is easy, the clay spreads into a thin layer, BUT this mask is not for everyone. I am part of that ""not-everyone"". I have oily combo skin and somewhat sensitive skin...this mask upon application stung/burned. So the ingredients may not also be for everyone. But lets talk about the packaging and the quantity of the mask it self. The tin came all scratched up and ""worn out"". When I examined it, it looked as if it's old, and sat around for a while. (not a giftable appearance). Quantity and price is a joke. If you refer to my pictures, the small jar is about 30% full. Where is the other 70%? Or at least another 30%? This mask goes on your face in an even but thicker layer as all clay-masks do. So there is definitely no value here.",105138,731

4.0,1606288126194,Cakey but nice coverage...,"The BB cream works just as well as a foundation. Really concentrated and thick/creamy, and you can definitely feel the sunscreen in it, cuz it makes it more thicker than most other BB creams with low levels of SPF. The color selection is SUPER limited, but I chose the lightest one and I am normally like a 120 Ivory in Maybelline (Matte version) drugstore foundation. It blended out very well. You need only but a small amount of it so it lasts a long time, and it has a pleasant smell to it (at least for me). The only and only thing I dislike is the cakiness of this foundation that forms in creases (around the mouth, eyes, forehead, chin area etc.). Primer no primer, lotion or no/lotion, setting spray or no setting spray - or just on bare cleansed face. Cakiness still forms for me in about 30-60 minutes. This happens even with super little application - which is annoying. But the quality of coverage and texture is there if it wasn't for the cakiness I experience every time I use it.",105138,19175
5.0,1603690611815,Very luxurious foaming wash and scent...,"I don't typically like musk as its very strong and powdery.. But this body wash altered my perspective a bit. One small pump of this body wash covers your entire body. Is that not cost effective or what? The consistency of the soap it self is very dense and thick and not droopy and watery like most body washes out-there. The smell lingers for a few hours until you bathe again so its like wearing a perfume without a perfume (if you like the scent of course). The foam is also very rich if using this soap with a sponge. Sadly, everything about this product on the label (beside the name) is in Korean. But would totally recommend and acquire again in the future.",105138,296
4.0,1596091939884,Pretty and lots of fibers but smells funky,"The mascara is packaged in a very pretty box and tube. Very unusual and I haven't seen mascaras like this one before which makes it very visually appealing. The wand is silicone or rubbery. The mascara is very black and bold on the lashes (I have brown lashes and it pops in color). The fibers are there, there are very many of them and wand builds on those fibers very very well with every application stroke. There are two things that make me uncomfortable about this mascara. First is the smell of it. It is a very strong / pungent chemical smell that does not smell like your average mascara from a drug or department store. Second, it is made in China. Maybe I am paranoid, but learning a little of how cheap cosmetics are made oversees, the smell reminds me of all the descriptions from those documentaries. On the bright side (aside the smell), my eyes did not sting upon application, the mascara did not shed, and removing it (although it is waterproof) was very easy with regular miscellar water and a cotton pad. Because of the smell, not a product I would purchase again or give as a gift. But overall very pretty and definitely builds the length + volume with the fibers that are part of the mascara.",105138,1088

But, I have heard many things about Rice Water and I have used it before. I just wonder if this is better and easier than making it myself like I used to.<br /><br />Rice Water is supposed to have many benefits to hair. It Detoxifies, Moisturizes, Promotes Hair Growth and Make Your Strands Stronger. So, it's great for all hair types no matter what issues you have.<br /><br />What I like about this kind is that it doesn't have any tangle smell or smells bad in particular. It's very floral and fragrant, definitely would make your hair smell like it just had a wash.<br /><br />It comes in a spray bottle with two caps. (One regular cap and one spray cap) I can just change the caps so it doesn't leak when I store it, so that's a plus as well.<br /><br />It's easy to use. It's not super thick either, so it sprays well and has decent coverage. It also sinks in well and deeply, feels good in hair, and moisturizes pretty great.<br /><br />I don't have any complaints about it. It's good for your hair and feels great in it. Plus, it has many other great attributes such as Chemical Free, Preservative Free, Sulfate Free.<br /><br />Of course, growth is gonna take time, but I'm along for the ride.😁<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews.",105150,13988

It’s hint of soft red is really gorgeous. It gives me supple lip looking vibes. Very seductive and alluring. As for the texture, I can say it does feel soft. I can’t compare it to others because I don’t really seek out this type.<br /><br />But, it spreads nicely and feels very soft on the lips, especially with a little layer of lip gloss, this just pops. But, it doesn’t have lasting wear as much as I’d hope. If you avoided eating, drinking, or even touching your lips, maybe it would stay longer, but it just doesn’t.<br /><br />It’s quite easy to rub off even after it sets to me. But, Top Tier Hazel is a gorgeous color, very bold and beautiful. It just doesn’t last without reapplication. And for colors like these, it’s very easy to notice smudges in your lipstick. Otherwise, not bad in the other areas.

That seem to be firm but the bristles can be super hard and painful, really hard to find one that is soft.<br /><br />This one is the opposite. The handle is quite long about 16’. It easily reaches to the middle of my back and easily hits any spots I need to get with a tad bit of stretching. The brush head is super soft, almost angelic. I’m surprised the bristles was made of nylon, the texture reminds me of a soft and durable cotton. When wet, the brush acts as a gentle exfoliating sponge. With small nodules making slight caresses across your skin, getting it clean with little effort needed at all.<br /><br />It doesn’t hurt at all, if anything it gives the sensation of a gentle massage and a polisher for your skin. Very soothing and really makes your skin shine in the best way possible. My skin didn’t feel sore, worn or even stung after using this. It looked and felt very bright, relaxed and soothed.<br /><br />Definitely the best shower I had in a minute without having to rely on a loufa for any exfoliation.<br /><br />After all of it, it even has a string so it can be hung up anywhere you like either in your bedroom or bathroom. Very convenient storage and dries quite fast and easily as well.<br /><br />Either way, out of all the brushes I have tried this takes the cake as the most handiest and softest of them all. Everyone should have one, your skin would thank you for the extra TLC.<br /><br />I even included a picture of it when wet, it clumps making it better for scrubbing<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews.

It can take off your edges and make a mess on your head when you sweat. I try to avoid it less and less due to this.<br /><br />I am a fan of wearing my wig naked because of those issues, but I am glad that there is a more natural alternative now. I never knew these existed or I would have tried them much sooner.<br /><br />This set came with a transparent clear wig band and a tan one. I mostly wear the tan one because it blends better with my lace. But, putting it on is very easy and it has a decent tightness. It grips well, but not enough to be super tight.<br /><br />The band is very stretchy and easy to maneuver. Yet, it has a decent thickness as well. The bubble like grips really help it do its job well. Very durable and strong plastic bands overall.<br /><br />The band, plus the combs in my wig makes my wig very secure and tight. I haven't had any issue with it slipping or sliding back without me having to move it no matter what I'm doing. When I'm sweating it doesn't move and it fits my head very well overall.<br /><br /> So, I am super glad to have found this.

Installing this hair was easy for me because installing so many different hairs that I became a master, of course, I think it will not be difficult for someone who is not a professional, it may just take a while. One of the good things about this hair color is that I ordered this hair precisely because of its color, because the hair turns blonde and spreads well in the hair. Some time ago, I went to the bathroom with this hair, and then I said to myself, maybe hot water will cause the hair to lose its color or its design to be damaged, but I saw that nothing new has happened.

The length of the extension is the same as what is said on the site, but its width is a little less and not as wide as shown in the image.

I used it three times so far for different gels like Poly gel, gel polish and builder gel and it worked for all of them. Compare to other same product the price is so reasonable for a couple of reasons. First, the power is so high because I used to keep my fingers under UV for 2 minuets with other LED lams but this one just needs 90 seconds. The longer you keep your fingers under UV the more your skin get darker and also is not good for your health. The main purpose that I got this UV lamp was my pregnancy which I really did not want to go to the salons because I think the smell of so many chemicals in the salons is not good for my baby health. The quality of the lamp is not so good. Once it fell off on the carpet and it became a little bit loos however it is still working.<br />To put everything in a nutshell it is a good purchase if you are not a nail artist and you do not want to use it in your profession.<br />Pros:<br />1.

When I take it in my hands, I realized that it has a nice quality and makes with acceptable materials. However, with every advantage that this product possesses there is some disadvantage that I will mention them in the following.<br />The only problem is that its surface is so small, and I have to spend so much time flatten all off my head, and its wire is not long enough for me, and I have a hard time dealing with it. Because at the end my hair will not become as straight as I want. I guess the temperature does not go as up as it should go. Or still, my first point that I state, the small surface is the main suspect.<br />One major issue that I had with this product was that my hair got kind of stuck in it and tore my hair.

The sheets smell far too musky, strong, and more like men’s cologne on my hands. Not a fan of that one, but glad the smell doesn’t last long after the hand washing. The bergamot and Ylang ylang, and the jasmine and patchouli both smell nice but it is mild. I would say the bergamot and ylang ylang is a neutral smell, while the jasmine and patchouli are more flowery and a bit more feminine. Like I said, both are mild and after drying off my hands I can barely smell them already. One little pack fits into all my regular little inside purse pockets.

I’m not one to get much pimples and it’s an easy way to tell when a product doesn’t work for me. I’m so glad to have finally found one that absorbs into my skin but doesn’t clog my pores!

I’ve also tried it with other sets of base and top coats and it works fine with those too. The sets lasted a few weeks no problems. The only thing that I’m not a fan of, is the colors. It supposed to be the color that it is on the tube. I find that the colors look a bit different from the tube to the dot that I made on the stick, and then even bigger difference on my nails. For instance, the red tube. Looks like a lighter red on the dot. Then on my hands, it turned red orange(not color changing either). I didn’t finish with a top coat before I took a picture because I didn’t like the color at all and I ended up painting it over with gel nail polish. Really that’s the only on with such a big difference. The others are not a big difference but a bit more sheer than I expected. It is still good quality, so if you like the colors then this set is for you. A bit on the expensive side for the amount of poly gels you get, and I’m not a big fan of the colors so I wouldn’t reorder this.",105450,1546

I’m actual surprised this is a body wash. I think it has the consistency of a cream facial cleanser, and the bottle looks like one as well.

The next day the ring finger one broke in half. 🤦🏻‍♀️ This is my 7th set(of different sets and brands of polygel trying to find the best). Not my first rodeo. I know what I’m doing with polygels. Am I a professional? Nope. Just a mom doing my own nails at home. I love polygels as it gives me beautiful salon nails from home and can stand the abuse a regular mom can put it through (like cleaning and washing dishes without gloves,etc).<br /> I tried 4 different colors. They gave me an insight about the quality of this set. You only see 3 colors in the first pic, I know. But that’s because the clear is what I originally tried ( I really did try) to put on my middle finger instead of one of the glitters. Putting this set in the forms(I don’t use the forms from this set as I don’t like them), using solution to spread it in the forms was like any other polygel I’ve used. It’s when I turned it over and put it on my nails did something different happen. It basically started to ooze out of the forms way more than normal,it was getting messy. Putting it under the uv lamp to set it quickly. But as it was setting under the lamp the nails were falling a bit and setting that way. But it was the “clear” color that was the worst of the bunch. Oozed out so fast that it was un-salvageable. The way it oozed made me think of Buitee’s Starry sky set. But at least those were the specialty set, their regular ones were SOLID(even if I didn’t like some of the colors, that’s nothing on their quality). This set will probably work on nails like polish or something, but I love using the nail forms and this just doesn’t work, and didn’t stay ON. I don’t recommend this.",105450,1551
3.0,1602694040622,Complete set not for beginners,"This is a complete set, not a full kit. There is a big difference. Saying that this is everything you need to make the nails if you have everything else. That means you already have the UV lamp, the base and top coat, and the solution and brush kit. From my experience, this kit is not for beginners. The glitter set aka starry sky set is messy and requires a lot of filing similar to biutees cat eye set. By hand, but filing with a nail drill is better. I was trying different looks to see if I can make some awesome looking Halloween (witchy) looking nails. This set alone is not it though. I might try experimenting with mixing this with biutees poly gels that might make it better and more manageable.",105450,1555

In order to use this for long nails you need nail forms, a solution, a container for the solution, and the brush with scrapper, and the UV lamp. Also the base coat and most likely a nail drill and some nails files (not shown in picture). ***Important*** You have to use a gel nail base coat before the poly gel in order for it to stick, otherwise they will pop off. If you don’t have these things, I would suggest you don’t get this for the first time. There are nail kits for that. And lots of YouTube videos to show how to do it. It’s how I learned to do mine. With a full set of long nails, and enough for extra nails and some fills, this one bottle could last for at least a couple months.

The top half of the ingredients which take up most of what it is made of is made of: polyethylene(man made plastic), a chemical, acrylic or plexiglass, a few man made silicones, and chemical fragrances(some of them are really long words so I just put down the laymans terms.)

5.0,1659118853385,You want metallic? You got it!,"What a gorgeous color! This is a true metallic in a gorgeous, rich coppery bronze, not a wimpy little watered down frosty lipstick your gran would wear. The quality is on par with other brands of liquid lipstick like KvD and Black Moon. I find the formula and staying power similar to Black Moon, as KvD always tends to dry a little gummy on me and starts to flake the minute my lips move. Beauty Bakerie's liquid lip is unnervingly sticky for a few minutes while it sets, then it is very dry. If you wear a lot of liquid lipsticks, you know this is par for the course. If it really bothers you, add a tiny bit of balm or gloss (just a touch of Aquaphore will do the trick), but it will affect the longevity. There is no flavor (hooray!) to this lipstick and the split doe's foot (can I call it a cloven hoof?) applicator is super easy to control. And as someone else mentioned, with a color this bold, control is key. Despite it being a dry formula, it doesn't collect in your lip cracks and make your mouth look dry like an old fashioned matte lipstick does. I'm a pasty white middle-aged woman and this color looks awesome on me. I don't have any feathering or running of color, I don't need a lipliner, and the dry formula doesn't bother me because I've been wearing matte lipsticks for years. The price is right in line with similar products by other indie brands. I am so happy with this color and this formula, I can't wait to order Royal Tea. Would love to see this in a ruby slipper red!",105535,2133
5.0,1642637470179,Whose skin is this?,"In the winter, my skin turns in to scaly, flaky paper. I started using Liquid Gold almost two weeks ago (just in time for a cold front and a huge snow storm) and I don't recognize my skin. I use Liquid Gold in the morning and right before bed every day. A little of it sits on the surface of my skin, but it never offsets on my pillow or clothing. After a half hour or so, it's completely absorbed. I'm 56, so I've been watching my skin go through all kinds of hormonal acrobatics, from rosacea to acne to uneven texture and coloring. Does Liquid Gold eliminate all of these flaws? No. But it DOES alleviate them and help improve my skin texture (no painfully dry papery skin! Blast the heater in the car-- I don't care!). The proof that this stuff works for me, though, is that I feel comfortable enough in my own skin to go out without makeup on most days. I'm not afraid of getting older and I'm not looking for a miracle cure, I just want my skin to look happy and healthy. It does.<br /><br />The packaging is simple yet effective to prevent breakage during storage and transport. The bottle is in a muslin bag, which is nestled inside a thick cardboard cylindrical box with a snug lid, which is also nestled inside a cardboard box. A lot of care was taken with the package design to reflect the organic, down-to-earth approach that Auntie and Me takes with their products, and it is effective in preventing breakage.<br /><br />If I'm being critical, I have to say that I really dislike the bottle itself. The glass bottle with a slick label and a dropper than dribbles and leaks is a disaster story in the making. The very first time I used the product, the dropper spilled a little on the outside of the bottle and it has been slick and hard to hold ever since. Some sort of texture on the bottle or label would be a very nice addition to prevent dropping an eighty-dollar bottle of oil.<br /><br />I was brave and ordered the original scented version and I love it. I immediately picked up the camphory notes of the lavender with the resinous after notes of frankincense coming along afterwards. It's nothing overwhelming. Unfortunately, while I happen to love the smell of this version, one of my dogs won't come near me. She actually stopped sleeping in my room once I started using it. If I buy another bottle, I will go with the unscented version, unless I can get her to appreciate how good it smells.",105535,30711
4.0,1615914239771,"Look great, easy to apply, hard to remove","I'm a false eyelash beginner and I have to say that magnetic lashes are far easier to apply, in my opinion, because the magnetic pull as you get the lashes close to their intended destination help you place them properly. They also seem to be a little more forgiving than traditional adhesive lashes if you need to slightly reposition them. This set has a great variety of styles and lengths and comes with two tubes of magnetic liner and a pair of eyelash calipers to help set them in place. If you're just starting out with lashes, this is a great way to do it.<br /><br />However, there are some downsides. First, I find the eyeliner extremely irritating to my eyes (and my nose, as it is heavily scented). It is also really difficult to remove (I have to soak my eyelids with Bi-Facil on a cotton pad at least twice and then follow up with micellar water and MAYBE that will get all of it off). Be prepared to soak your lashes, because that's the only way this stuff is coming off. Second, I find the lashes somewhat uncomfortable. They feel heavier on the lid than adhesive lashes and I can often feel the metal on the band. I tend to remove these long before I remove a pair of adhesive lashes because I am never NOT aware of them on my lids. Third, if you use a tweezer/caliper thing to place your lashes, do yourself a favor and just buy a decent one. This one is plastic and has no tension, so you have to manually open it to fix the lashes in it, then fiddle with it again to take it away from the lashes. For me this was a bonus, because I got so frustrated with it, I just learned to do it with my hands with much better results.<br /><br />Despite my problems with this set, I would totally recommend trying this out to see if magnetic lashes are for you. The variety of styles will give you a lot of options to experiment with different looks, but do take care of your eyelids and make sure you have appropriate product to remove the tenacious eyeliner. Happy lashing!",105535,3686
3.0,1613596757942,I liked the idea better than the product,"With four cats and a large dog, I am always looking for good grooming tools. I liked the idea of this brush, but the actual product really wasn't all that. First of all, this thing is much larger than any other slicker style brush I have. This is a great feature for my large dog, but it was just ridiculous trying to groom my cats with this large, unyielding wire brush. So, not a good choice for the cats.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not a good choice for my dog either, as she has a short coat with little to no undercoat and she was really uncomfortable with wires dragging on her skin. She's more of a rubber curry comb type gal, I guess. Besides the size and wire bristle problems, the plastic itself felt a little brittle and cheap and when you add in the mechanics of retractable bristles... I think higher quality material would have been a better choice because that slider for the bristles is very basic. Finally, while I loved the idea of the easy-to-clean retractable bristles, they really aren't necessary and if those wires become crooked or bent it will cause all kinds of problems with the retraction. I've made it decades by just pulling the fur out of my slicker brushes-- it literally takes 2-3 seconds-- and while the thought of retractable bristles is nice, it totally isn't necessary. It's not a practical tool for me and doesn't work for any of my animals due to its size and the wire bristles. It also doesn't seem terribly well-made nor is it made of high-quality materials, and for the price it should be.",105535,656
5.0,1610302025013,"Perfect for key chain, purse strap, belt loop","These little bottles are exactly what I wanted for hand sanitizer on the go. The silicone bottle is durable and thick, but so easy to squeeze. It isn't going to break and crack like a hard plastic bottle. The cap fits securely and the snap-top stays in place. The carabiner is small, but it's strong enough to keep the bottle where it needs to be as long as there isn't serious weight constantly pulling on it. So far, so good.<br /><br />The thing I worry about most with a little bottle like this is what happens if you put a lot of pressure on it (sit on it, lean against the wall when it's in a pocket or on a belt loop, etc). I was concerned that the flip top would pop open and I'd end up with hand sanitizer all over the place, but I tested these little guys full of liquid before filling with sanitizer. The pliability of the silicone doesn't allow a burst of pressure to push off the flip top-- not even close. Plus, the top screws tightly into place. It's not going anywhere.<br /><br />I've been using one of these hanging from my purse strap for the last few days and it is super easy to flip the cap, squeeze out product, and flip the cap closed with one hand. Wish there were other color options, but the functionality and design of these override any concerns about color. I'm so glad I ordered these! They are totally worth the price.",105535,245

I will say I used a UV lamp I already had after applying I’ll update when I try it without the UV lamp and as the days go by to see how they hold up.,105586,1160
4.0,1630548508124,An effective cleanser but awkward applicator,"This product certainly looks high-end with its black and gold packaging, the twist cap that turns through 180 degrees for on/off, and the raised ‘fingers’ for scrubbing your face, but that part doesn’t work too well.<br /><br />The surface area of the head is too small, and the little bumps that are supposed to scrub can’t really be felt. Also, the dispensing hole is small, so it takes some effort to squeeze any product out. I found it much easier to put some on my hands and then massage directly onto my face - you’d be there all morning if you tried the applicator.<br /><br />Other than that, the charcoal cleanser itself is high quality - it’s made in the USA (Seattle), the results feel as good as a scrub even though it’s not abrasive like a scrub, I'm told it does remove make-up properly, and it smells OK - not a strong scent, and I think it smells a bit like playdoh. Overall, I like it and will continue to use, but the brush system may need some rethinking.",105590,25061

It looks like good quality hair - very soft and straight, and has varied shades of brown and blonde running through it. The clips are easy to open and shut, but there was a little trouble with the clips slipping - that may be due to lack of experience using extensions. Once in, they provide a noticeable boost to volume and really pretty highlights. The extensions did come with extra fastening clips, care instructions, and a decorative hair clip. For reference the images show the 16 inch extensions, in Light Blonde/ Highlighted Golden Blonde color.",105590,7855
3.0,1623617675807,Acceptable results; good value for money,"This self tanner lotion was just okay. The first thing I noticed was that the label on the tube was crooked and had bubbles in it - and where first appearances matter, this was a little disappointing. The 8oz tube will last you through several tans - at $20 it’s a fair price, but it can go as low as $9, which is exceptional.<br /><br />None of these products has a great appearance right out of the tube, and this is no exception,  however this brown gel does provide a decent tan, thankfully not the obviously-fake ‘orange’ that can result  from similar products. It does have the typical self-tanner odor to it. I was able to apply the tanner and avoid streaks but my teenage daughter was less successful avoiding streaks and patchiness. This I attribute to operator error. I applied the cream to my arms and shoulders and found that it did stain my clothing, despite the claim on the label to be non-staining.",105590,2536
4.0,1616559999987,Fair value and performance,"This foam cleanser is from a company in Seoul, South Korea. Its in the middle of pack with regards to price….some quick research shows that 8 or 9 dollars is ballpark for about a 4 to 5  ounce item of this kind, and remember this has traveled a long way, so there's a cost element to that! You can get more ounces for the same price from household name brands and you can pay a lot more for niche products.<br /><br />The tube comes wrapped in plastic for protection and there's a foil cap under the lid. Once you're in, the product is like a thick paste, but not difficult to squeeze out. You don't need a lot, a pea-sized amount foams up well once you've added water. The packaging only refers to an 'appropriate' amount, whatever that means, but a little goes a long way. The smell is very pleasant, a natural and subtle lemon. The foam feels like it cleans thoroughly, my face felt less oily. The Vitamin C that's included claims to improve uneven skin but I didn't notice a big change there.<br /><br />I like this product - its an honest, unpretentious cleanser that doesn't make any unrealistic claims, it smells good and it would work for everyday use, for the whole family.

I used a brush cleanser, some water, and then swirled them on the owl. You would have thought I had never cleaned these brushes. This suds were brown and it grossed me out.

4.0,1622137078942,Easy use,"I like having my nails done but I have no patience with painting them and letting them dry.  Even when I go to salons, I rush and at least 1 nail gets messed up.  That being said I have started to use nail strips recently and love them.  I usually use color street but I decided to try out these ones.<br /><br />First off, I love the color, it looked just like the picture online. The blue is a calming baby blue, almost like a light wash denim. They were easy to apply.  I did have to trim one of them because I have a more boxy nail shape on one of my fingers but that's nothing a pair of scissors can't fix. The alcohol prep pad was very thick and easy to use.  The nail file was also solid quality for a disposable file. The strips were able to be applied removed, and readjusted without messing up the strip or your nail.<br /><br />Now for some negatives.  Most of this stuff is not bad, its just coming from someone who has been using color street for a few years now.  First off, these are single sided nail strips so you cant easily get 2 uses out per side. Separating the nail strips from each other is a bit of a challenge since the protective plastic is a little thick.  Overall these strips were a little thick, so filing was hard. Lastly, the blue almost seems printed on, if you stretch the nails a little, the color shows up more white and it looks printed and not solid nail polish.<br /><br />With all that in mind, I would say none of the negatives are deal breakers.  I just wanted to list them so you knew what you were getting into.  The sunflowers are nail stickers that I bought off Amazon.",105593,44437
5.0,1599592353886,Easy to use and clean,"These little make up pads are very easy to use and clean.  I used marykay makeup remover and everything came off easily and didn't stain the pads.

But to be fair it does not say that you should use these with nail polish.",105593,7607
5.0,1661450779446,Great Value,"This is a pretty little palette, small enough to use for traveling. Contains 12 pans of both shimmer and matte shades. Doesn’t come with a brush, but no matter, i have plenty of those. It does have a mirror though. The packaging is reminiscent of London, with the Phonebox, and Big Ben printed on the front.<br /><br />The texture is very blendable, and the shades are very wearable. I’m not a fan of the “natural look” makeup, i like a bold eye, and you can have that with this palette. I particularly love the Red, Dark Blue, Gray and Black shades. And if you find that you want the red to look darker, you can add a bit of black into the crease, and deepen it. I always want palettes to have a black pan - it’s useful for other things like lining, and smoking out.<br /><br /> If you choose to use an eyeshadow primer (or even just a concealer or foundation) then the colour payoff is more intense. If you don’t wear a primer, you might need to add more on top. I always wear a primer, because it makes sure the eyeshadow stays on longer, and prevents it settling into my crease.<br /><br />Essence have some very good products, i first bought their products way back in 2007, in a bricks and mortar store, and they were so affordable, and such good quality. And they have really upped their game, and expanded their range of products over the years. To be honest, i don’t really often buy drugstore brands any more, and it is a long whole since i shopped Essence, but when this popped up, i was drawn to it, like a moth to a flame, as i love eyeshadow palettes almost as much as i love shoes and bags.<br /><br />I am not at all disappointed with the quality of the product, the price, and the cute packaging.",105597,924
5.0,1660325631155,Beautiful brush,"I’ve had many of these types of brush (with holes in the barrel) over the years. They really do help with air flow when your are blow drying your hair. I wouldn’t use any other kind of brush actually.<br /><br />But this is my first experience with an Argan Oil Infused Brush, and i am impressed. It’s the perfect size to blow dry my bangs/fringe smooth and silky looking, and give it an impressive curl. I don’t blow dry the rest of my hair with a brush as it’s curly (i use a diffuser on it.) I have a longer section at the back that requires blow drying with a brush, to curl it under a little bit, and because I’ve just recently freshly dyed my hair red, the shine is superb with this.<br /><br />It’s excellent quality, and yes it may cost a little more than your average barrel brush with holes, but in my opinion, the results are worth it.<br /><br />It’s such a pretty colour, and very ergonomic and lightweight in your hand, and comes in a nice box, that it would make a nice Gift.",105597,788

(I love Jeffree Star’s formula best) and I exclusively wear them because of the longevity, i do not like to have to keep putting lipstick on. If you’ve tried a lot of liquid lipsticks, you’ll know that formulas can be hit and miss. Some are very flaky when they dry, some smudge. Some are a perfect consistency, and i can’t say I’ve found many of those. But this is one of them.<br /><br />The colour is fantastic and looks amazing on my 56 year old freckly face. It’s a doe foot applicator, and is fairly easy to apply if you're confident with liquid lipstick. It’s richly pigmented, and one coat was enough.<br /><br />I did not find this to be flaky when it dried. It did take marginally longer than some other brands, but once it dried, it’s properly smudge proof. It looks great as is, or with a gloss on top if you like that look. I have Beauty Bakerie’s Enchanted Jelly gloss, which is shimmering with iridescent fine glitter, and it looks awesome.<br /><br />And now that Fall is coming, this is going to be worn a lot. I love it. I see more tubes of this colour coming my way. I’ll get anxious when my tube starts to run low.<br />And as with all Beauty Bakerie products, it’s beautifully presented, and makes your heart race just to receive it lol.",105597,2133

Normally i like a creme finish, because for lighter colours that have a frost or shimmer, it feels old fashioned to me. Still doesn’t stop me hoarding them though lol.<br />I find this leans very golden on me, and less pink, and does look pretty metallic.<br />It stays on well, which is exactly why i got it. I hate re-applying lipstick.<br />This colour for me, is more of a summery colour, and goes well with the light golden and freckly look I’ve managed to acquire this year.<br /><br />It’s pretty, long lasting, looks good with a gloss on top, i do recommend it.",105597,2133
5.0,1657835375676,I’d give these 10 ⭐️ if i could,"I have been buying these little soap dispensers with soap sheets in them for a while now (cos of the pandemic) and this pack is probably the best value I’ve ever had. I’ve paid $5 for one filled dispenser, with a generic scent one time, and i still thought that was a great thing to have. With this pack of 8 different scents, for less than $16, you’re getting a package for less than $2.<br />To say they are handy is an understatement. They are a Godsend. I don’t know how often I’ve gone into a bathroom, and the soap dispenser is empty. I was recently camping, and their soap dispenser in the toilets was empty during our whole stay. One thoughtful camper, left a bar of soap in a clear plastic cup, but it was a bit grimy with hairs on it, and i didn’t want to use that. With these handy pocket, or purse sized dispensers, you have a fresh sheet of soap each time. And they lather up very easily, as soon as they get wet.<br />They are small enough to put into the smallest purse, even your wallet, or pocket, and you’ll never be caught it out the ability to wash your hands.<br />These will last a while, as I’m not planning on giving any away. I might offer a sheet here and there, but not a whole dispenser for goodness sake. I’ll tell them where they can get their own.<br />I’m currently using the Tea Tree and it’s very fresh.

They look great over a Matte Finish Lippy, or just on their own, of the three flavours (grape, bubblegum, and strawberry) my fave is the strawberry, which has a reddish pink tint, but isn’t strongly coloured, and goes on sheer. It wouldn’t affect the colour of any lippy you were wearing underneath.<br /><br />They aren’t sticky, and i no longer have long hair that clings to such products, so i can wear them without that happening anymore.<br /><br />I like this set a lot, it’s a beautiful presentation, as are all Kopari products I’ve had, and could easily be gifted to any Lip Gloss lovers out there, of any age, in my humble opinion.",105597,2233
5.0,1650815698537,Great texture,"I was fooled by the look of this in the tube - it looked dark. So i was somewhat surprised when i squeezed some out onto my hand and it’s actually colourless.<br /><br />Upon application, it smooths instantly into my skin, and transforms to a perfectly powdery finish, silky almost. Pores are minimized definitely, and it makes applying make up afterward, an absolute breeze.<br /><br />I was using Tatcha Primers - i tried both their Liquid Silk Canvas, which is much lighter in texture than their Silk Canvas which i always found a little difficult spreading evenly.<br /><br />This Grown Alchemist Anti Pollution Primer reminds me of a favourite i used - Benefit Porefessional, with a similar texture to that.<br /><br />It does minimize my pores. It makes my skin feel great, and ml for ml works out cheaper than Benefit’s, so that’s a win win situation.<br /><br />And whether i apply foundation or just a powder on top, both go on super smoothly, and nothing settles into the cracks.<br /><br />I’m very much enjoying this primer.",105597,14023

I feel like someone with thicker hair might struggle getting one in.<br /><br />I really like them, as they give me a messy, sort of updo kind of look, without it looking like a formal ponytail. Which is impossible for me anyway, with my layered curly thinning hair. In fact the only way for to achieve a smooth head of hair is to use a flatiron and a ton of product, and i just don’t do that. It looks unnatural on me. I like these for the ability to look casual and unstructured. When i had longer thicker hair,i used the original invisibobble spirals, which were a game changer.

It works very well because of my curls. I did used to used the bigger spiral hair ties from this brand when I had thicker, longer hair, but those are too big for the amount of hair i have now.

I find these are effective at removing any B.O. and ""freshen up"" after a sweaty workout. The scent is light. I LOVE that it is light and not overpowering. I tried the Dove wipes before these ones (https://www.amazon.com/Fresh-Deodorant-Wipes-Cucumber-Green/dp/B07V399T26/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=cucumber+body+wipes&qid=1606102057&sr=8-3) and YUCK the smell was so overpowering, fake, and gross.

3.0,1600827031589,Love and Hate this Scrub,"I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this scrub. What I LOVE about it is the delicious, robust coffee scent. It is STRONG and packs a powerful punch in the morning, which helps to wake me up. I also love the serious grit it has to it. The texture varies from fine grounds to courser grounds, with a higher ratio of course grounds. Each scrub feels like it's getting deep into my skin. I feel like I'm scrubbing off layers of dead skin, dirt, grime, etc. when I'm using this. My skin feels smoother and softer after I use this scrub. I apply lotion straight out of the shower and my body is soft as a cloud!<br /><br />What I sort of hate about this product is how messy it is. It just falls apart and gets everywhere. I included photos of what a hot mess my sink and shower look like after using it. Other scrubs I've used in the past have some agent that keeps them together to prevent it from going everywhere, but this doesn't. One I tried recently that I loved was JOON X MOON (https://www.amazon.com/Watermelon-Exfoliating-Moisturizing-Nourish-Essential/dp/B0876GX6MQ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=moon+cube+body+scrub&qid=1600826357&sr=8-2), and that is in cube form to start, then breaks down to scrub as you rub it and use water.  It does an incredible job of exfoliating without making a mess of my small shower. If you're not into the cube thing, I also like stuff that B&BW makes and they sell it on Amazon. It's has a paste-like consistency and does a good job at making your skin feel soft like a baby! Here is a Bath & Body Works aromatherapy scrub - I loooove this one: https://www.amazon.com/Bath-Body-Works-AROMATHERAPY-Eucalyptus/dp/B005LZUP36/ref=sr_1_14?dchild=1&keywords=sugar+scrub&qid=1600826921&sr=8-14<br /><br />The other thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the packaging. I have a tiny shower, so it is impossible to take anything in there without getting wet. Every time I take this into the shower, I'm nervous the bag will get soaked and ruin it. There is a waxy coat applied to the bag, which helps protect it, but it still doesn't give me as much confidence as something like a glass jar or tin would. Ideally, the scrub wouldn't get soaked until I'm ready to use it. It has held up through 3 uses so far but I may transfer it into a mason jar and store it that way.<br /><br />The other thing that really bummed me out was that is stained my clothes!!! I towel dried after shower, put on moisturizer, then light gray leggings. There must have been a tiny amount of residule coffee scrub because it stained my leggings!!<br /><br />Overall, a decent scrub to try. Not my favorite scrub, since it stained my clothes and made my shower a mess.",106198,4057

All in all it probably took me an hour to do one eye (I’d strongly recommend doing each eye individually if you’re doing them yourself). The other recommendation I’d give is to watch some YouTube tutorials before starting. The instructions are bad, but they aren’t great and there are a lot of videos out there to help ensure you’re doing things correctly. Overall, my lashes were lifted and I’m fairly happy with the result. It wasn’t as dramatic as I hoped (you can see that with mascara my lifted lashes look the same as my curled lashes) but I do think it looks nice. If you’re looking for a cheap diy alternative to the salon I’d say try it out. But if you have the time and money, I’d opt for a professional service instead.",106198,21230
5.0,1598822463748,Solid Value for the Price,"I saw some reviews commenting that the nozzle moves even when the cap is screwed on. This is true, but I personally don’t think that’s a reason not to get this set. I do think it’s worth noting that you’re getting a REALLY nice quality glass bottle in a 2-pack for under $15. Personally, the nozzle moving didn’t bother me at all and I am really pleased with the quality. Love the amber glass, because as the description mentions - this makes it safe to mix up your own concoctions with essential oils and it doesn’t ruin the oils. I make my own cleaning solutions and these have worked like a charm.",106198,1814
5.0,1597175471374,Cost-Effective Starter Kit for At-Home Gel Nails,"This kit is the most basic starter kit for the Red Carpet gel nails. It has everything you need to get started, except for colors. Be sure to purchase a color or colors as well so you have everything you need. The lamp works great and all products arrived in mint condition and worked as described. Color usually stays on for 2 weeks, if you don't pick at your nails.<br /><br />I previously purchased a larger kit that I liked more than this kit (here): Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 LED Gel Nail Polish Kit Soak Off Starter Package https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00662Z24A/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_MsVmFbXQFB0CA<br /><br />The reason I liked it more is because that kit came with more products and the lamp feels sturdier: 1 color, nail files and “erase” tube (what you use to remove the gel nail polish).<br /><br />However, if you’re on a budget - this kit is probably the way to go. AND you can pick which color or colors you’d like (separately).<br /><br />Even though at first glance this lamp seemed less nice, it works just as well.  My nails were fully cured within 45 seconds. After using it a few times and getting the hang of it, I’m usually able to do all my nails within 20-30 minutes. Easy to do while watching TV or listening to the radio. :)",106198,6009
4.0,1616955502772,A beauty to look at with a strong floral scent,"I received 1 oz. of the brand's Orchid Gelèe Serum. It came beautifully packaged in a tall slender box (which I didn't want to throw away). The component is a peachy colored but clear plastic slender bottle with a plastic shiny gold cap & bottom. The serum has pretty petals floating around in it. The description says, ""delicate vegan petals dissolve on contact,"" however the few pumps that I used had no petals come out with the clear Gelèe serum.<br /><br />The floral scent was very strong & while it did dissipate a bit after being rubbed on my test spot, it did linger, hence the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I'm just not a fan of strong fragrances in facial skin care.<br /><br />The serum rubbed in sheer & was quickly absorbed. I used it first on the back of my very dry hands and didn't see much of a difference when compared to my other hand.<br /><br />Despite the beauty of the component, I don't think I will be using it on my face because I just couldn't get past the lingering scent. I will, however, use it on other parts of my body not so near my nose.<br /><br />Unfortunately I would not purchase this in the future but if you like stronger, floral scents, you might love this.",106203,4062

I was a little shocked at the price of Tula products but years later, after trying lots & lots of other skincare brands, I feel the price point for Tula skincare is worth it.<br /><br />I was very excited to see this ""super-sized"" 3.4 oz tub and I just had to try it. As with the other Tula products I have tried, this did not disappoint. If I could have rated it higher than 5 stars, I would have. It is a thick luxurious cream that glides on your face like silk and is quickly absorbed. It didn't leave my face feeling greasy or tacky,  just soft, hydrated & moisturized. Today is a non-makeup day for me & I am just going to enjoy the way my face feels after using this awesome cream.<br /><br />I will be purchasing this product when it's out, although you only need a little, so I'm assuming this tub will last a long time.

Perfect to revive and rejuvenate dull, tired skin; it also replenishes moisture to give the skin a plump, dewy appearance.""<br /><br />I did my usual double cleanse and applied this product as directed by applying a thin layer to damp skin & left it on for 10 minutes. It sort of tickled my face as it began to bubble a little. I am not sure if my face was damp enough or if I didn't use enough product but the bubbly effect eased up & then the product dried a bit. After my time was up, I rinsed my face with warm water & I gently patted my skin dry. Usually this is when I would apply a toner but I wanted to feel my face once it was dry. I was hoping this product would replenish moisture to give my skin a plump & dewy finish.

It has a very slight hygienic scent that quickly dissipates after application. The product immediately absorbed & left my skin feeling soothed & hydrated and never tacky or greasy. I have very sensitive skin and the cream caused my face no adverse reactions.<br /><br />Directions indicate to apply it to clean face, neck & chest morning and night.

I do not like to spend a lot of money for them while I am in the beginner phase for fear I will ruin them.  I know some cost a lot of money.  These are very affordable, come with several sets of pretty fluffy lashes, a tweezer to apply them and some glue.  My daughter, who is an eye lash guru said they were very good quality and was quite surprised by the great price point.

As soon as I opened it, the thick, sticky liquid dripped all over the bottle and I had to wipe the bottle down with a wipe to prevent it from dripping down the sides of the bottle onto my vanity. I did apply it to the back of my hand & the scent was very off-putting and lingered. It remained very tacky and I would not want to apply make-up on top of it.

I have aged & have dry skin with lots of fine wrinkles appearing around the corners of my eyes and a deep nasolabial fold forming. I am saddened every time Iook at my reflection in the mirror. I absolutely love this 2-step product. I opened one end of the product & applied the small masks to my eyes & around my mouth (4 to a pack) and then applied the whole face mask (step 2) over it all. I left them all on according to the directions and my face felt amazing afterwards. I was so pleased with the way my face felt that I was already looking forward to the next time I used this product.

Here are the cons: This doesn't remove polish! I tried this on my Color Street glitter and solid nail strips. They are regular polish and I also used this on normal glitter AND solid color Sally Hansen polish. Nothing came off. It was like using water. Actually, it was like using oily water.

The metal doesn't bend and cleans easily with remover, followed by soap and water. The files haven't held up too well, however. Maybe I'm just a bit too rough on them, but I've worn through two of them already. I have spares on hand, but I wish they would have held up a bit better.

The boards are thick, file well, and have lasted well with normal wear and tear. They don't bend easy and file corners and edges quickly. Considering how many files come in a pack, this really is a great value. You have plenty to keep on hand and several left to share.",106395,252
3.0,1599608387792,Flimsy curlers that rip easy,"I was intrigued by these spiral curlers when I saw them. I've used foam rollers occasionally in the past with fair results, so I thought these might work as well. These do curl, but they aren't great. First of all, these take some practice to get in. Take small strands of hair, or you will cause tangling. I recommend doing this after a shower. I left mine in overnight. They were easy to remove and didn't cause any pain. The curls were a bit... Overwhelming. It was an 80's nightmare, actually. To top it off, the curlers didn't hold up well, either, and most of them had holes and tore after one use. This probably won't be a curler set I'll be using again.",106395,9809
4.0,1598253699483,Good alternative to travel emery boards,"I try to avoid using traditional files and emery boards on my nails. I take a lot of medications that make my nails weak and brittle, and any surface that's too abrasive wreaks havoc on my fingertips. I can't carry a full size glass nail file with me everywhere, so I was on the hunt for a travel sized file that could fit in my pocket, wallet, or purse. When these came up, I thought I'd give them a shot. The pros are the files are a great size, they're packaged well, and I see them lasting for awhile. The case they come in is a nice touch, and I enjoyed the fact there were two so I could have a spare. They're pretty to look at, if that matters to you. They'd make great little stocking stuffers or gifts. There were a few con's to the files, but nothing too major. The abrasive side is only on one side of the file. I prefer to have options on the level of abrasiveness, so this was a little disappointing. In addition, the abrasive side didn't do all that great a job filing down my nails. It will do in a pinch, and it's not my favorite file, but for emergency use, it will do. If you need a glass file for travel purposes, this is the best option I have found so far, despite the minor drawbacks.",106395,1553

It makes it easier to get the inside and outside lashes. The color is a dark black and goes on well. I definitely recommend!,106621,715

5.0,1603432593966,"Easy to use, gorgeous colors","This polygel set is surprisingly delightful.  When it comes to the gels alone: they have a very nice smooth texture that is easy to manipulate and use.  They fill the dual forms nicely, but also are able to move and smooth well enough to use the nail extension wraps instead.  The have enough give in them to allow for some self leveling, and dry easily in about 60-90 seconds a side (I always dry under LED on the top then flip the finger and get the underside of the extension just to make sure it solidifies perfectly).  Once dry, they are able to very nicely file down and smooth in place, which is great considering some are truly jam backed with various sized glitters.  They need a good wipe down with alcohol after cooking though, having a fair amount of tacky surface, but that's fine with me.<br /><br />The cremes are fairly solid in color, and opaque.  I love the various pinks, and the white is a nice solid color that isn't too harsh making it perfect for a nice soft french tip.  The #03 pink is a great neutral and classic pink color, which is great for either a base color for extensions or for turning into a french tip with the white.<br /><br />As for the glitters, they are nice and shiny.  My only complaint is I wish the matrixes had a touch more color added to them.  The various colors of glitters make it clear what the effect/color  should be, I just think they would pack a bit more punch if there was a bit more dye in the matrix.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice set.  Keep in mind, all the bottles are small except for the #3 pink.  But its a nice little starter kit, and the glitter is a nice addition.  I'll definitely keep these in mind going forwards!",106735,1551
5.0,1603278520698,Hello curls!,"I have major issues with curling my hair.  I am TERRIBLE at it.  I struggle with a curling iron, and never seem to get uniform curls.  I also have very straight and fine blonde hair that does not naturally hold any sort of shape besides straight.<br /><br />These curlers do the trick, and they aren't uncomfortable to sleep on like I was expecting.  Now I take a shower before I go to bed, apply the curlers with the easy to use wand, and go to bed.  By the morning I can pull these out of my hair easily, and find that I have beautiful tight curls that I can set with hair spray or brush lightly before applying spray.  If I do not apply spray they last for about 2 hours, but if I apply a good light weight hairspray they last the entire workday.  I also do not have any issues with any kinks or lines in the curls, even at the top, which is a HUGE plus.<br /><br />Overall these units apply easily to my damp hair using the attached wand, and curl the hair nicely.",106735,9812

On one hand, they are very cost effective, and you get four rhinestone pickers instead of one which is a huge plus.<br /><br />However, I find I go through the soft end of the rhinestone picker faster than I do other units.  For instance, I have one rhinestone picker from UberChic beauty which I have had for over 6 months, and it still maintains its original shape and is only showing slight dulling at the tip.  However, these units are very soft on the white end, and have actually chipped/worn away quickly.  In a month and a half I have already used up one and the majority of a second.<br /><br />They do a good job at what they are meant for, and I have not had any issues at all with picking up rhinestones.

I wished the forehead part was narrower. I found the button placement fine for my mask (but it would be easy to adjust to your liking with some basic sewing skills). I like that the headband is snug but not uncomfortable. It does slide up a little in the back after a while. Something anti slip on the back would be nice to help keep the headband in place. It may be too tight if you have a larger head. The only thing I don't really like is the large logo.

The lights go around the entire inside of the dome so you don't have to worry about your hand being flat. It has 3 different settings on the top for 30/60/90 seconds. I just watched the timer on the top of the unit that counts up every time you put your hand or foot in. I like that the entire unit is plastic and not metal. The light also shuts off when you remove your hand. Very nice and look forward to doing my nails again!",107399,8571
4.0,1610542409313,first time,"I have seen a ton of social media posts about these poly gel kits and figured I would give it a try. I am not a professional at all and can barely paint my own nails. I watched a couple of YouTube videos before giving this a try and I didn't do terrible! Here are some pointers for those of you that are trying this out for the first time.<br />1) you need to have a uv/led curing light. You start with the clear base and cure it before applying the gel. Apply the gel and cure, then apply the top coat and cure.<br />2) thick but not too thick!- If you make it too thin, the tips will just bend and break off. You need to make sure that you are putting it on about the consistency of the plastic nail that you use to apply the gel.<br />3) Don't forget to fix the bottom of the nail tip before you cure. If you don't do this you will have a giant glob of hardened get that you will need to file down.<br />4) If you don't want an ombre effect, you will need to make sure that the thickness is consistent from the top to the bottom of the nail.<br />5) Have a few disposable nail files. The giant one that comes with the kit isn't my favorite because it is quite bulky. I used a few coarse nail files to really get the shape that I wanted.<br /><br />The kit itself is nicely put together, I just wish there were directions with it. You will need to have a lamp, nail file, cuticle cutter, and nail trimmers to accomplish your finished nails which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.",107399,1546
4.0,1599086555735,The extras make it worth it,My favorite part of this is the sticky hooks that come with it. I tried putting body wash on it but it's a bit tricky to do.

This one was only wrapped in a plastic bag and it shows because the product arrived bent way out of shape and could easily been broken due to its poor packaging. I was able to bend it back but it seems like those spots are particularly weak now and could easily be snapped off. I would recommend buying things like this from other parties who package the product correctly, otherwise you may end up with something as pictured or worse.

It’s not as thick as you’d like it to be but not thin enough you’re seeing the wig cap. The wig cap is the standard size so it’s not to small or tight but mine sat weird and tried to bubble a bit on my head. It had to be left on a wig head inside out for days to correct it.

5.0,1626758924969,Cat eye gel nails are amazing!,"Pine gel nail polish smells great, looks amazing, and lasts a long time.  The dark blue is our favorite color and we love that you can get the deep color with great glitter and shine using just one coat, on top of the base coat.  There are no base or top coats included, but as long as you have them, the set, along with a nail clipper and file is all you need to have salon quality manicure and pedicure.  The magnet included with the kit is rectangular, as shown, and is effective at making long streaks on the nails.  With some practice, you’ll be able to create very defined cat eyes, but make sure you keep the cure lights right nearby, or you’ll lose the streaking.  Additionally, make sure that you buff the nails lightly, clean the nails thoroughly, and run full cure times if you want to have the nail polish last more than two weeks.  Following this simple procedure will hopefully give you a high quality and long lasting finish like I have experienced.  I recommend Pine Gel Nail Polish and am sure you’ll be super happy with the results.",107617,2537
5.0,1626758859813,Dark and glittery finish that provides top notch nails!,"Pine produces great gel polishes that last and that look amazing.  The gel nail polishes also smell great, like I’ve been working on a Christmas tree.  The colors in this set are some of our favorites.  The dark green and the dark glittery blue are our favorites.  We find it best to apply more than one coat, although Pine is not incorrect in advertising that one coat is essentially equal to two of those from other companies.  The chameleon set’s colors look amazing and although not exactly like the stickers on the top of the polishes, they still are good enough to tell which is which.  The different colors are a great combination and allow for salon quality finishes.  I have found the Pine gel nail polishes last a very long time when you properly prepare your nails before application, and when you allow the polish to have sufficient cure times.  I have also found that my nail beds are less beat up when using the Pine products.  The color options and long lasting finish of Pine is hard to beat, and I strongly recommend this product and brand.",107617,16372
4.0,1604163791789,"Color Kit 3- Beautiful colors, long-lasting finish, but poor marketing job","Manicures and pedicures are a routine event in our home, especially with restrictions on public outings.  With younger children, picking nail polish is a given, so despite the gel’s potential to last for up to two weeks, they manage to remove it in just a few days.  For them, though, it means another nail session and new colors, so no big deal.  The gel nail polish was hopefully our answer to increase the duration and longevity of their finished nails.<br /><br />Anzuo Gel Nail Polish offers attractive color kits.  We received the Kit 3 set, which contains black, red, white, and three shades of tan to brown.  Like others have commented, the lids only contain numbers, and the kit includes stickers where the user has to create the swatches.  This is an inconvenience, but not the end of the world.  We found it to be a good test to see how the gel polish would actually apply and then finish.<br /><br />The gel was rather thick, even after keeping it at room temperature, and rolling it to ensure sufficient mixing.  With thinner and increased coats, the polish results in deep, beautiful colors that we really enjoy.  The white looks like white-out, even with a top clear coat, though.  The black and red are the favorites in our home.<br /><br />The main problem we experienced and shared with others is the inconsistency and deficiencies in the product’s marketing.  There are typos, poor translation and grammar, and worse yet, is the inconsistency in the cure times advertised by the company on the Amazon site and the actual shipping box.  The box says cure time is 10-30 seconds by LED/UV lamp, but the website says time frames up to 120 seconds.  That is a huge difference that seriously impacts the quality and life of the nail finish.  We cure using time frames of 60-120 seconds, depending upon the wattage used by our lamp.  With these longer cure times, we have been able to keep the polish looking well and intact for over a week now, even on our children’s nails.<br /><br />If you can overlook the need to label the bottles, disregard the spelling and grammatical errors, and then utilize your own cure times, the Anzuo gel polish is worth using.",107617,10017
4.0,1601660902017,Beautiful blue bottles but nozzle cap turns loose,"We are always looking for a plain water bottle for use on clothes or hair, and these blue glass bottles are the perfect solution!  The two-pack of spray bottles both provide a consistent spray mist, and also a targeted spray, based upon which setting the tip is turned to.Tight seal on caps, until you try and turn the spray nozzle.  When you turn it, it loosens the cap, and occurs on both bottles. The black labels stay secured through washing and the black color doesn’t detract from the deep blue color of the bottle.  We have been using both for water, but we are going to make one be an air freshener bottle using our essential oils.  After a quick test run with the oils, made extra convenient using one of the plastic filters that comes with each bottle, as long as they were diluted, the spray nozzle was able to provide an even and broad mist.  With two sprays in the playroom, it smelled like a citrus orchard, but didn’t leave the carpet feeling saturated.  We are happy with the bottles, except that the lid comes undone when adjusting the spray nozzle.  Just be careful to re-secure so you don’t spill water or whatever else you may put in the bottles.",107617,1815

All of the layers cured in two minutes each with my lamp.",108445,12600

5.0,1610222282054,Great gift for the little ones!,"I loved the fact that these are water based polishes! Very easy to apply and to take off as well. There is an odor to them, but its very low and smells like bubblegum. The shimmer shades are barely noticeable...I assumed they are meant for topping the colored base polishes.

I knew they were flakies, but I didn't expect these to be so glittery and holo! Beautiful as a topper on over the black base provided or if you like the see through look then these would be amazing on their own. Very easy to work with and the instructions were easy to follow. You will need a base gel and top coat, but if you have used gels before then those are things you should already have in your polish collection,  if not I recommend purchasing a base/top coat before purchasing these.

Ive used other nail drills that wobble when i turn up the speed, but i did not have that issue with this file.

5.0,1557108954407,Very pretty cat eye effect!,[[VIDEOID:5805559d998217b36ec87dea0c9e0296]] These Magnet cat eye polish are exactly as described. The cat eye effect is very pretty and I love the fact that they reflect duo chrome with the perfect amount of sparkle. I had to play around with them a few times to get it right. First of all MAKE SURE TO BUY  A MAGNET as these polishes don't provide one. Second of all you will need to apply a black or dark base for the effect to show. If applied to the bare nail it won't work because the polish by itself is super sheer. After I applied the polish I placed the magnet above it for about 15 seconds....this is a very important step since this is NOT GEL it does disperse fast. All in all I had a really great experience and can't wait to show off my mani!,108914,6063

I am by no means an expert, but the poly gel is the only thing that did not work for me.  I could not get it to cure.  Even after the full polish it still felt like it could crumble off at any moment.  I only did by thumbs, pinkies, and ring fingers, and the gel was broken on all of them in a couple of days.

It grabs, and holds hair in place while brushing and drying my hair, and combs through all the strands. The bore bristles are a wonderful addition that helps to smooth and soften.

I literally had to push my hair between the bristles with my other hand to brush it.<br />I love boar bristles, but knew I needed stronger bristles incorporated with them so they can catch my hair.<br />I have longer, straight hair, and have always preferred paddle brushes. When I saw the BAR;SOO paddle brush it had everything I was looking for. Large, wide paddle mixed with boar and nylon bristles. The coating on the handle felt silicone like and was easy to grip.<br />When I use this brush the bristles catch every strand of hair. The cushioned paddle along with the bristles feels like my scalp is getting massaged. This brush leaves my hair incredibly soft and doesn’t cause static electricity or leave my hair standing up like other boar brushes. This is by far my favorite brush!",109407,6027

I didn’t want to wash it off, I just wanted to keep massaging it into my skin. With every step you take after washing it off, you can feel the air hitting your open pores. My face feels so smooth. Neither dry or overly hydrated, it feels just right. I don’t even want to apply any of my other skin products after washing it off because it feels perfect.

Either way it is a lot fuller and larger than others of these I've had.  I would probably have a hard time holding onto it if it weren't for the elastic hand strap.  It works well though.

The description and images leaves the impression that this is a powder product, in reality, the texture is closer to ELF's putty primer. When I applied it to dry bare skin using the puff it pilled slightly, I did get better results blending it with my finger tips. It leaves an overall light green veil of color on bare skin that's not overly noticeable and leaves a matte finish. Don't let the matte finish fool you though, it melts into your skin leaving it moisturized without feeling greasy.<br /><br />My skin is only slightly sensitive and when irritated doesn't react with major noticeable redness or heat. It did calm the redness I sometimes have around my nose and chin.  I've not yet tested this over or under foundation and wonder if it would work well as a primer?

5.0,1626725876602,NOT A SKINCARE GIMMICK GIVES AMAZING RESULTS,"My first thought was that this was another gimmick but being a skincare junkie had to try it. I'm so glad that I did as it exceeded my expectations to the point that I've overlooked a few things I'd normally dock it on.<br /><br />First use: My usual routine is to wash my makeup off and immediately apply HA [Hyaluronic acid] to relieve the resulting dry tight feeling.  I filled this sprayer with HA serum and at first, didn't feel anything but cool air hitting my face and wondered if any serum was even coming out. Then suddenly the tightness was gone and my face felt like it was covered with a moisture mask. When applying HA with my fingers it always took a minute or two to soak in, not so with this sprayer the results were immediate! Although the Nano mist is so fine its impossible to see, the end results is an amazing feeling of soft fully moisturized skin.<br /><br />With this sprayer you can chose to use serums, toners or water so your not limited to only water like other Nano sprayers. This sprayer is well made and the USB cord is included, the liquid chamber is small [perhaps two tablespoon capacity] easy to fill and it only used a tiny amount of serum to cover my face and neck.<br /><br />The only Cons are the USB port's location on the bottom so it must be laid on its side to charge {that's weird} and the instruction booklet could use a little help. But, as stated at the beginning of this review I'm so impressed with how my skin feels I'm forgiving the aforementioned transgressions and giving this a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't normally get excited about skin care tools but this one is an exception and its made me a Nano spray believer. Highly recommend.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.",110261,4055

I encourage you to research this ingredient for additional information for informed decision making.<br /><br />Right now, I'm skeptically giving this 3 stars for seemingly falling into the Cosmeceuticals [cosmetic products that claimed to have medicinal or drug-like benefits]<br /><br />11/29/20 Update:  I've used this for a few weeks now and my smile lines, although not doing a disappearing act,  they are less noticeable. I've not had any adverse reaction to this gel and have added a star due to the results I've seen. Note : a little goes a long way.",110261,735
5.0,1595522699168,WORTHY OF A TRY FOR STAYING POWER ALONE PLUS- No Racoon Eyes!,"First off I wear contact lens and so far I've had no adverse reaction. I've only tried it once and it stayed put for 24 hrs, even though a shower! Now that's what I call really waterproof! I don't normally sleep in makeup of any kind but wanted to give it an ""all night"" durability test. Woke up the next morning....was still there! Expected at least some ""mascara"" marks on my pillowcase but there was nary a mark. But my biggest surprise came when I awoke without ""racoon eyes""!!! I usually wear ""tubing"" mascaras as other formulas end up under my eyes within a few hours, I actually expected this mascara to do the same.<br /><br />Volume and length? It definitely added length.  I use Latisse so my lashes have stayed long as I've aged and this mascara provided additional length.  As to volume,  not so much.  However, I only used one coat so it may indeed give the volume advertised with another coat. I really did not notice any ""fibers"" and being a lens wearer perhaps that's not a bad thing.  The formula is not thick so it applies smoothly without leaving clumps. It was fairly easy to remove  with a cotton pad soaked in micro-cellular water.  All in all, if you are looking for staying power this mascara is worthy of a try.<br /><br />The packaging is unique! Hans Holbein's portrait of a young Princess Elizabeth [later Queen Elizabeth I] just caught my eye. I found the square shape vs round tube a lot easier to hold and the brush is a standard design found on many other mascara brands.",110261,1088
5.0,1607533269651,Excellent pack of hair towels!,"I have curly/wavy hair that I like to use microfiber towels on because it reduces frizziness. These towels are EXCELLENT, I really really like them. Both designs are really great for ""plopping"" if any curly-haired girls are familiar with the term. And my hair comes out so great when I let it initially dry in one of these. I finish it off with a blow dryer with a diffuser but this gets out all the excess moisture and being able to put it up really keeps it out of my way. It came with a couple of scrunchies as well. And the gray and white stripes are really cute. I'd definitely recommend this towel pack!",110393,141
1.0,1600726019995,Do not recommend,"Maybe it’s just my hair, but this was impossible to use. I had freshly washed, wet, combed through hair and could not get a small piece through one of these things. It was SO painful and tangled halfway through. It did not work at all. I tried several times to just do one before giving up so I can’t say how well they curl. Maybe someone with very thin hair this would work but I still think the shape of the curlers is all wrong, the opening is entirely too thin to be effective. I liked the idea of no heat curling by just letting your hair dry inside of a curl shape but I do not recommend this product at all.",110393,9809
5.0,1600389105510,My new favorite hair ties!,"I have seriously replaced all my old hair ties with these. They are the best! They have just enough stretch to make it easy to do a bun but are not too stretchy that they stretch out. They easily retain their original size. I absolutely love the variety of colors, most hair ties come in just brown and black but these are so versatile! They also come in an excellent bag that keeps them all organized instead of just randomly in a drawer, and the box is nice enough that it could be a pre-wrapped gift. Excellent presentation. I highly highly recommend these and will never buy the ""normal"" kind of hair tie again.",110393,1161
5.0,1600388788122,Makes a regular ponytail look fancy,"I love these hair ties! They really enhance the look of a boring ponytail. The pearls add some dressiness, and I love all the different colors. I find that besides just being pretty, they're functional too. I have very thick hair and these hold my ponytail great. I also love the little case they came in, I'll definitely be using it to keep them organized instead of scattered all around in a drawer. I use these all the time and would buy more colors!",110393,647
5.0,1596567280062,This kit is EXCELLENT!,"I love this kit! I was a little skeptical when I ordered it but figured it couldn't hurt to try. It more than exceeded my expectations! I love everything it comes with - 4 gel polishes plus base and top coat, 3 ""extension"" gels that I haven't tried yet but seem awesome, nail foil in a variety of patterns, an LED light, file, buffer, brush, design tape, glitter, plus the case to keep it all neat and together. I tried out the polish and it works awesome! Easy to apply, and dries instantly. I feel like I went to the salon but for so much cheaper! My nails really look great. If I have one complaint it's the the light has to be plugged in to use, its not rechargeable. But overall I am so so pleased with this kit. It's going to be hard to go back to regular polish after this, and the price point makes it hard to justify going to the salon. Highly recommend!",110393,2835

My first impression was that it was very greasy and oily feeling. But then I looked at the ingredients and realized it’s literally made of all natural oils so I did chalk this up to be expected. I used about eight pumps and rubbed it all over my face and neck. Once I was greased up like a pig, then I rinsed my face with a damp, warm towel. To my surprise, I did leave my face feeling very hydrated, and I didn’t have any greasy residue at all. The smell was reminiscent of essential oils",110900,2488

They are quite voluminous and thick. They have a good sized thicker band which is something I always look for when considering eyelashes and their quality. They seem to stay well with my (Kiss aloe glue adhesive) and last fine throughout my daily life. They can be used more than once - the wider band helps them significantly when reusing. They are long and have a curly-like look which is good if that’s what you like. I found mine to be a bit more dramatic than I was hoping for but still happy with these nonetheless. I do think the current set value - when it comes to the overall quality and quantity make this an excellent deal and worth the buy.,111002,3169

Includes (1) wig cap, wig, inflatable guitar, black Wayne’s World Hat, and a single plain black tee. Everything seems to be of nice quality - the wig does tangle if not carefully handled. The guitar inflated just fine and would be easy to carry throughout the night or even to a party. Overall it’s exactly what it claims to be and I’ve been happy with it thus far. As far as the current set value of $35.99 - I do feel it would be more fairly set at $30 given the quality and quantity of items.",111002,767

I added photos to show one side With this mascara VS Without it stays on really well and actually made me consider switching from false lashes to this product - which is crazy to me because I’m pretty set in my ways when it comes to my beauty routine.

5.0,1668894033789,Great product!,Product feels great on my skin. Doesn't feel thick and heavy like some other sunscreens I've used it the past. it absorbs pretty well and has a very light scent to it that's actually pleasant. I love the shape and size of the bottle as it make dispensing the product easy and mess free. I hate those flip cap bottles because you always risk spillage when traveling with that type of bottle in your luggage.,122546,17746
5.0,1663179453192,Like little candies suspended in a tube,Pretty cool product. The colored dots (which I assume are what the vitamins are contained in) are suspended in a clear gel. I decided to apply it on my face after my shower. Then I applied my usual nighttime mositurizer over it. The colored dots would pop as I work the product into my skin and eventually everything absorbed right in with no problems. It's smell light and sweet and didn't irritate my skin. It gave my skin a little extra boost of mositurizer which is absolutely what I need. I constantly get flaky dry skin. A great addition to my skin care routine that doesn't require me to wash any product off after leaving it on for so many minutes.,122546,2001
5.0,1660058076640,"Slim, sturdy and pretty",I initially got the tortoise shell one for my nephew as a gag gift because he's 16 and now ALL about his looks and hair. But it was so cute that I had to come back for one for myself. I'm  not a huge fan of tortoise shell print but this pink one is super pretty! It's a thick sturdy plastic and isn't flimsy. Think of it as a scaled down shower comb. It's good for getting some tangles out of your hair while on the go (not so much for fine tuning your hair style). It's a small enough size where it doesn't take up much room in your purse. It also comes with a decently made carrying pouch with a snap closure to prevent the comb from getting entangled with other items in your purse.,122546,11909
5.0,1658194696886,Luxury clips!,I didn't think sections clips could ever be a luxury item but here we are! There is a moving piece inside these clips that helps prevent your hair from getting indents in them while styling your hair. They hold my hair up well when I'm doing a face mask or applying makeup. They are quite pretty and don't look or feel cheap either.,122546,15521
5.0,1656906655423,Along the lines of Vaseline,I grew up using vaseline so this product is very similar to it in that it's a grease-like consistency but much thicker. It's good for spot treatment of small dry patches. I wouldn't recommend this for an all over body usage because you WILL stain your clothing! Otherwise this is an amazing product. Plus I already love the scent of tea tree oil as I have a small bottle of it that I used on my zits. So that's what drew me to getting this butter in the tea tree oil scent.,122546,2896
3.0,1653704954140,Not as pictured,"Everything about the product I received is the same as the listing EXCEPT for the color... I get getting maybe an off-white colored cream but what I got was like a blue grey instead of the white in the listing. This would have made me question the integrity of the product because it didn't come with a safety seal or inner cap like most beauty products have nowadays. But I think that is the norm for this brand product because I tried one other product by this brand in the same type of packaging and that also did not have any type of safety seal. So for that I guess there is no issue to the product integrity. The consistency of the gel cream is pretty much the way that they describe it, it's thickness is like that of a cream but does feel cooling like a gel. I had applied it while my face was still slightly damp after a shower so it didn't absorb too quickly due to the moisture already on my skin. It did feel soothing once I smooth it all over my skin. It had a fresh clean scent to it and it did not irritate my skin. But once it dried and fully absorbed into my skin, I still felt like my skin was a little bit tight and still needed extra moisture. So I did end up adding another layer of facial moisturizer of a different brand that I normally use. Although my skin did feel soft and smooth after this product had dried, it just did not feel like it was fully moisturized. So I'm not really crazy about this product as I would probably not recommend it for someone who has very dry skin.",122546,188
3.0,1623876247488,Cute but not worth it,I don't know why I even tried with this wig. The part is nice but....yeah....too white to look like a my hair part color.

Didn't frizz or shed much but just not for me.,143623,37097
5.0,1608945729168,Simple kit with pretty colors,This poly-gel kit was so easy to use and apply. It comes with everything you need and is easy to mold onto your mail or with the nail mold. The slip solution works well. The base and top coats are a nice consistency to where you can build on them. It cures really quickly and has a nice gloss to it from the top coat. I tried to blend the two pinks and it didn't turn out exactly as I planned but that's okay.,143623,14006
3.0,1607388606585,So disappointed,"I'm disappointed with this poly gel kit. I tried using the clear one first and had so much problems with trying to mold it into the nail former with slip solution. Then I tried the deep pink and didn't like how it came out. I did the light pink and it came out super nicely, but less than 24 hours later 9 out of 10 came off. Didn't do anything differently with my nail prep or the base coat I use so I'm confused and overly disappointed about how and why 9 of them came off my nails. The poly gels are thick and really easy to use. The kit comes in really pretty colors including 2 glitter poly gel. I just hate that it didn't last long.",143623,1551
5.0,1607219001039,"Love it, growth and curling at the same time.",Such a great eyelash serum and I so love that it's in the form of an eyelash brush versus the thin brushes I've used in the past. I feel like using the eyelash brush is way better and applies more evenly than anything else and I'm able to get my lashes from the root to the end of the lash with the serum. Be careful though because I low key poked myself with the brush in both eyes once lol. I've noticed growth since using this eyelash serum and I've been using it for the past 2 weeks twice a day. I also like how I'm killing two birds with one stone by using the serum and also curling my lashes at the same time. I've used it with my contacts on and had not problems with the serum or brush.,143623,2491
5.0,1606464976319,Thick polish but not too thick,"These polishes are thick and only truly require one coat to cure and be done. I love that the colors are on the top of the bottles for you to know which one you're using. I forgot to use the magnet to get the cat eye effect but will try it later before curing the polish. I like the various shades of blues and purples in the set. Despite how thick it is, it only took one time to cure and dry which is a huge plus since you have to wait a while for a thick regular polish to dry.",143623,2537
5.0,1604607333431,Love it,"These tips were so easy to apply, file, and shape. I love using them. I needed them to cover my nails so I can use the min dipping powder. They worked exceptionally well. I was able to file them down to look like my normal nails would and the powder was able to apply and bond to them well. I also tried gel nail polish over a few of them and the gel also bonded to the nails well. They felt really light and very flexible once I clipped and filed them. Pretty sure I can use these for a lot more versus the full cover nails. BTW that's my pointer finger not my middle finger in the single finger picture.",143623,16373
5.0,1604606732158,Nice hold,I used this on an older wig and a newer one. It held both wigs in place fairly well. It wasn't too tight around my head and held everything together but I wouldn't want to wear it for extremely long periods of time. I didn't have to worry about my wig flying away because it was too windy outside. Moving my head around while it was on took a little adjusting to but after about 30 minutes I was fine and forgot I even had it on. What I really like about this is that I don't have to worry anymore about the back of my own hair getting clipped or stuck on the installed wig clips and elastic latch. I have this issues even with regular wig caps. The band prevents that from happening which is a plus for me because the latch can sit over the band.,143623,13373
5.0,1604187564286,Nice spray bottle,"Used this spray bottle with water in it to iron clothes. Initially I thought it only had a stream and off option despite what the descriptions say, but if you turn the nozzle slightly from the off position, you'll be able to get a mist from the water bottle when you spray. I used this for ironing and if I were to use the bottle for cleaning, I'd use the stream option. Be careful not to turn the nozzle too much or else when you spray it, it will stream, but water will also sprinkle out from the bottle's nozzle and run down your finger(s). I like the size and shape of it as I can store it in the laundry room and not have to worry about it taking up too much space. The color of the bottle is nice also.",143623,1135
5.0,1603656341557,Nice sturdy emery board,"I was able to use this emery  board on both my natural nails, poly gel, and acrylic nails when I wanted to shape or file them down. Very comfortable to hold and use. I was able to use one side for my natural nails (180) and the other side for the acrylic and poly gel nails (100). There are a lot in the pack so I'll be using them for a while without having to worry about running out of them. I like how the 100 side works really well to file/shape the acrylic/poly gel nails and the 180 side is gentle enough for my natural nails. Definitely a must have for your manicures.",143623,252
5.0,1602440961657,Love these glass spray bottles,"I'm used to putting my hair oils in plastic bottles and notice that a lot of times they leak out, how I'm not exactly sure. I was a little concerned that if I put my hair oil in one of these glass spray bottles it may not spray like it should and I'd have to figure something else out or continue to have leaking plastic bottles. Little did I know that these would work and work well. I love the idea of the tiny funnel which helped make sure none of the oil spilled and went directly into the bottle. I like the little chalkboard like labels which I used on both bottles. I used to other bottle for my leave in moisturizing conditioner and it works like a charm. I have to be a little more careful with the bottles as they are glass and I'm not used to using glass spray bottles. The spray nozzle has the option to stop it from spraying and two ways it can spray, shower or stream. The bottles are very lightweight even after you add content inside of it. You can use either the spray nozzle or the cap to keep things sealed, options for your desired use. Love these.",143623,1815
5.0,1600718129570,Such a nice color,"I like this poly gel a little better than the one I've used previously. I will say I'm disappointed because according to the description/title this is supposed to be a kit. To me a kit comes with more than just one item. Well all I received was the poly gel. Aside from that, I love the color, although I could have used a little more on a few of my nails. The tube is rather small, but I still have enough left for at last two more manicures....I think. I ended up using gel polish over the poly gel but next time I think I will just wear it by itself. It took well to the polish and looks fabulous.

Putting too much pressure will cause it to stop in place. There are three different  grinder heads from soft to rough, but I didn't feel as though one was more effective than the other.

5.0,1596151466643,Very effective,"I used the foot peel mask exactly two days ago. As you can see my feet are already peeling. My thumbs and pointer fingers began peeling yesterday because I used them to open up the socks to put my feet in. A pair of booties come attached so you have to carefully cut them apart and then cut them open before you can separate it to put on. You have to make sure there's a cotton like barrier on each side of the booties before you put your foot in. Hence my thumb and pointer fingers peeling. I must say that this peel mask is way more effective than the one I used twice from Walmart. This one works a lot faster than the ones I've used before. I also like the fact that you get two pairs of them and they even include a callus shaver tool. I love the smell of lavender when you open up the mask even before you put them on. There's a tab on the side of the booties to peel and fold over so that the they are securely on your feet. Pretty nice idea considering the last feet mask, I used you had to put socks on over them to make sure 1. I didn't fall while moving around and 2. they don't slip off. The tabs make sure they stay in place and I was able to walk in them with my house shoes on. I wore them for an hour and washed the solution off my feet which were very soft afterwards. I did notice that my feet were a little dry feeling after a while but still soft. This is going to be added to my pandemic self care routine....and probably post pandemic.",143623,143

5.0,1667673774664,"Beautiful, Gentle Cream - So Simple & So Nice - Great For Dry Skin & Sensitive Skin","(Ingredients list is at the bottom of this review.)<br /><br />I am really loving the TINAZANA Vegan Bakuchiol Comforting Cream (2.7oz / 80ml). Only 9 ingredients. It is so good. Truly comforting and non-irritating. Even when my skin is already in an irritated state.<br /><br />This is a beautifully thick, rich, white moisturizing cream. Yet, somehow it feels decently lightweight and comfortable on the face and neck. Not lightweight like a gel cream, by any means. But comfortable. This cream glides onto the face and neck smoothly, and it soaks into the skin quickly; But it doesn't disappear. It leaves a lasting, soothing, comforting layer of moisture and hydration on the surface of the skin. It helps to lock-in the moisture and hydration from the previous steps in my skincare routine, and leave my skin feeling so lovely and comfortable.<br /><br />The scent is extremely slight. It is herbal, but it's almost undetectable, unless you're really seeking after the scent.<br /><br />The packaging is a beautiful yellow glass jar with a beige twist-off lid. It feels very nice in the hand, and the cream feels luxurious on the face. Much more expensive than it is. The 80ml size is excellent for the price.<br /><br />The addition of gentle, anti-aging Bakuchiol is also a big win with zero irritation. Plus, Shea Butter for maximum moisture. I layer gentle, hydrating, soothing, calming toners and serums underneath this cream, and I get excellent glowy, dewy results.<br /><br />I use this cream day and night, as I have dry, sensitive skin. I imagine many skin types might like this for day or night, especially during colder months.<br /><br />If you have sensitive skin, and you cannot use most skincare products (like me), this is likely going to be for you.<br /><br />Overall, I'm highly impressed. Why did it take me so long to find this? This cream is so beautifully simple. It's truly an amazing find for someone like me, who struggles with sensitive skin. I will definitely repurchase, and I'm looking forward to trying more simple, gentle products from Tinazana.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cream to anyone and everyone.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Butylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Polysilicone-34, Isononyl Isononanoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Ethyhexylglycerin, Bakuchiol.",167006,39080

I also tried the Celleanser Clean Toner Mist, and the Celleanser Clean Serum. They all worked nicely for my dry, sensitive skin, and they worked nicely together.<br /><br />This cream has a thick and creamy texture. It is very smooth and soothing to apply to the skin. It soaks in well, but it doesn't disappear. It leaves a nice layer of extra hydration and moisture on the skin. Though, it is lightweight and breathable. Not heavy at all. It is not sticky, and it layers perfectly with other products. The scent is sort of lightly herbal or earthy, similar to many Korean skincare brands.<br /><br />I will say that the finish isn't my go-to. It isn't really dewy or glowy. But I wouldn't call it extremely matte either. Maybe somewhere in-between, but more toward the matte side. I typically like to use dewy, glowy skincare, so I would probably use this product at night for that reason.<br /><br />The packaging is a nice 60ml tube with a flip-top cap.

5.0,1663108117688,"Lovely, Glossy, Buttery Lip Balm That Lasts On The Lips","(Ingredients list is at the bottom of this review.)<br /><br />I'm so glad I ordered the Frankies Bikinis Lip Butter Gloss in Lilikoi. It's a really nice, smooth, emollient, buttery lip gloss/balm with decent staying power. It lasts on the lips, and doesn't require too frequent re-application. It also has a comfortable, smooth slip to it, and it is not sticky. The balm is yellow, but it goes on sheer. It doesn't look tinted on the lips.<br /><br />The flavor is lilikoi, which is apparently another way of saying passion fruit. I'm not usually keen on passion fruit flavor, but this one is surprisingly nice. The flavor/scent is sweet and pleasantly fruity. Like a sweet, very lightly floral-perfumed fruit. It's really nice, and not at all off-putting or overpowering.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent. The graphics and colors are beautiful. I also really like how the applicator is dome-shaped, with no sharp edges or openings to damage the lips. It makes it very easy to squeeze out the lip balm and apply it quickly. The formula and applicator also makes it difficult to squeeze out more than you intended, and that's important. I have found that feature lacking in some other lip products, and I've wasted a lot of product unnecessarily.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really happy to have this lip gloss/balm, and I will continue using it. I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice glossy lip balm to try.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Rhus Verniciflua Peel Wax, Rhus Succedanea Fruit Wax, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Natural Flavor, Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Tribehenin, Sorbitan Isostearate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Tocopherol, Copernicia Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil, Borago Officinalis (Borage) Seed Oil, Hippophae Rhamnoides (Sea Buckthorn) Fruit Oil, Rosa Canina (Rosehip) Oil, Monoammonium Glycyrrhizinate, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Carmine, Tin Oxide.",167006,68
4.0,1659037277055,GLITTERING burnt orange,"This review is for the Emilie Heathe - Lip Atelier Lip Color in the ""Shimmering Burnt Orange"" shade, which I believe is the only ""shimmery"" color offered at the time of this writing. It comes in a super-chic understated black box, and the tube itself is also black and square with a magnetic lid.<br /><br />Calling the shade ""Shimmering"" is an understatement - this shade is GLITTERING. The pigment itself is a really pretty Sienna / rust color that's very flattering on my pale, warm-undertoned skin, and it has a LOT of coppery-gold sparkle. It glides on my lips smoothly and puts down a good amount of pigment (and glitter) in a single swipe. It does feel a little bit gritty from the glitter, but doesn't leave my lips feeling dry at all. It does have a little bit of a scent that smells floral to me.<br /><br />My problem with this particular shade is that the pigment fades (as all lip colors do) throughout the day, but the glitter does NOT. The glitter just migrates outside of your lips and you end up with it all around your mouth. So I personally wouldn't order this shade again. However I like the formula overall, and the fact that it's made in the USA from clean ingredients, so I'm sure the other (non-glittery) colors are amazing and would be right up my alley!",168737,2006
5.0,1658184213125,Taming mustaches and planting trees!,"My husband has a ridiculously oversized, extremely thick and wiry handlebar mustache. He started growing it several years ago as sort of a joke / challenge and it somehow became his signature look and now he can never shave it off.  He's tried lots of waxes to defy gravity and hold his hair in his desired shape. He really likes Death Grip and the old-fashioned Clubman soft wax that comes tinted in a tube.<br /><br />This Tree-Topped Mustache Wax is solid in a little tin like the Death Grip, but it's slightly softer - soft enough you can dig some out of the tin and apply it just with the warmth of your hands without having to warm up the whole tin in hot water or with a blow dryer. But since it's a little softer instead of a rock-hard wax, it's also has a little less hold. I'd call it a medium-firm hold.<br /><br />Absolutely love that it's simple, clean, and UNSCENTED! And that they're planting trees for each tin sold! And they even give you the recipe if you want to whip some up and refill your tin yourself. I absolutely will be ordering from this company again!",168737,24635

They're individually wrapped in cellophane, which seems wasteful but also may have something to do with how perfect they look.<br /><br />The stitching is all neatly finished and looks good-quality, it looks and feels like real mulberry silk, and the colors are all exactly as shown in the product images. The only downside is that there aren't more color options! I would love to see some more vibrant colors instead of the assorted neutrals, or the option to get 6pcs in the same color - I have dark brown hair and would absolutely buy a 6-pack of just the dark brown color!",168737,187
4.0,1649204221072,Nice organic cleansing oil,"This cleansing oil comes in a GORGEOUS box - even the inside of the box has a pretty kaleidoscope paisley floral pattern! Then you pull out the nice-sized brown glass bottle of oil which has a beautiful sophisticated minimalist label on it - the whole presentation is excellent.<br /><br />The bottle has a pump top and it's the style of pump that I hate because it's hard to control the amount of oil you're getting - it's a whole pump worth at a time or nothing. I much prefer glass droppers, I feel like I can dispense a more precise amount of oil that way. The directions say to use 8-10 pumps of oil to cleanse your face & neck, which seems EXCESSIVE. I can accomplish my oil cleanse with HALF that amount.<br /><br />The oil has no added scent, so it just smells like oil. Mine smells like good-quality oil with no sourness or rancidity.<br /><br />This oil is currently priced at $42 for the 3.4oz bottle - if you're using the full 8-10 pumps of oil per cleanse like the directions say, you're gonna burn through a LOT of expensive oil. It is certified USDA organic though, so if you use less and don't burn through it so fast I think it's a great cleansing oil with a great blend of skin-friendly ingredients.",168737,2488

Babies have rashes and little cuts from their own baby fingernail-claws and this will STING them! I sprayed it on myself and had a scratch on my chest from my cat and OUCH! I think this is perfectly safe to spray on their clothes, but please don't spray it directly on a baby's skin.<br /><br />Anyways, it smells good and I think I will honestly spray it on myself more than on the kiddos, which is fine.

It's a very unpleasant medicinal smell.<br /><br />But then once you apply it, the smell transforms to something very different and frankly very unexpected. I'll give you 99 guesses.<br /><br />Did you guess carrot cake? I didn't think so.<br /><br />It smells like frosted cake and cinnamon. I don't think I've ever smelled a product like this. Honestly I don't know if this will make you look younger overnight or just attract ants. Time will tell.<br /><br />I should mention that my wife has naturally freckly skin and doesn't wear much makeup, so there wasn't anything else for this to adversely interact with. Regardless, my advice would be to apply it to clean skin before bed instead of in the morning mixed with other products.",194576,324
2.0,1562704122349,Low quality,"I was suckered in by the seeming bargain of these brushes, but they really stink. I've used one for about a month now and I'm just about to switch back to the legit Oral B brand brush heads. I can be thrifty in many areas, but I can't afford to cut corners with my oral health. I've spent too much time and money keeping my mouth healthy.<br /><br />These heads are smaller than the name brand and they don't cover as well. When I'm done brushing, I feel like I need to start over and get after some of those tough spots again. I've really tried to give these heads a chance, but they just don't measure up.",194576,2915

5.0,1666053196001,"Coco’s Conclusion: Natural Ingredients, Vegan, No Animal Testing","This product comes in a paste. It has dual qualities as it is an exfoliating scrub and facemask. You can use it for any skin, whether that be oily, combo or normal. It has natural active ingredients, which is my favorite part. It goes on like a paste and has a great scent. I felt like my skin was very hydrated and glowed after use. There are only about 2 1/2 ounces of product in the container, which makes this fairly pricey, but sometimes that is the case with skincare products that work.",194596,13613

This one is the first painless one I have had.<br />Everything is packaged well and comes in a nice case. The machine itself is very easy to use. Once you turn it on, it automatically turns on a cooling mechanism that makes it more pleasant on the skin and less likely to overheat, I would imagine. I would recommend that you read the directions or watch a video on how to operate it. It has different settings that you can change by clicking the right button. There is also a long or short area function on this which is very nice, making it so you can drag the device down a longer area, like a leg, while pressing the button.<br />The directions say to use the device want to eat for 12 weeks and after that, as needed. I will update the review if sufficient hair removal has not happened at this point in time, but I’m already noticing that I have to shave less.",194596,2823

Overall it is a cute little gift set.<br /><br />The mindfulness guide is a just a poster with ideas on how to use each of the items. Everything else is nicely wrapped in blue tissue paper. The scent is very well balanced and doesn't have that odd chemical or synthetic scent that sometimes comes with kits.  There is a very nice balance of the lychee and lavender without either one dominating the other.",194617,2255

My guy has a full beard and can use a tiny amount (about a pea size) on his beard.  The scent is VERY strong but it does smell good and works well with his natural body chemistry.  IF he needs more balm he mixes this with an unscented kind so no one can smell him at a mile out.<br /><br />Overall, its well packaged.  Great quality and works.",194617,1527
5.0,1619189335423,By far the BEST smelling soak,I have used a lot of soaks and this one is the best I have ever tried.  I have a double person size tub and I used the whole bag as recommended.  I honestly figured that the single bag wouldn't be enough since my tub is double the size of most.  Well the 1 was plenty.  This was ultra relaxing.  I did get a large pink rose stone in mine as well.  My skin felt soft and moisturized my muscles were relaxed and my guy was like please order more!  So win's all around.,194617,871
4.0,1618347238636,Nice soap that doesn't overly dry out your skin,It's soap that cleans you and doesn't overly dry out your skin.

I was able to remove standard polish (that is all I tried it on) in super quick time and it didn't stink up my area with harsh chemical scent.  No leaks when it arrived and small amount works for most polish (I had several layers on my toes that it got off) removal.  Priced reasonably well and this didn't dry out my nails at all.",194617,860
4.0,1613169594194,Good glitter set,"I have the 'confetti' set and I have to say I like almost all of the colors.  The colors with the thread in them aren't my favorite due to the texture but the overall look is cool.  Nice thickness on the polish.  Good applicator brushes and normal dry / set times.  You do get base, top and top matte coat.  Really good sized set for price point.",194617,1541
3.0,1610375747687,Tea or bath water works,"These are made from real flowers and do smell good.  BUT its a little hard to determine if they should be a tea or a bath enhancer.  They are NOT bath bombs.  Each mini ball (they are close to a quarter in size maybe a bit smaller) is wrapped in jewel color foil paper.  They do each have a fantastic natural floral smell that did not have a chemical scent, to me, in any way.<br /><br />I have a large 2 person soaker tub.  I would need to use pretty much all of these to get a nice overall effect.  However, a standard bath tub you could probably use 1 or 2.<br /><br />For tea or baking these would be better.  I am not personally a fan of floral flavored food but many people I know are.  In order to bake with these you prep like a tea, strain, press and use liquid for flavor.  Set flowers aside and add to batter once it's been poured to maintain shape.  OR add to mix if only want the color.<br /><br />Its a little overpriced IMO but very good quality.",194617,241

4.0,1610113523862,Nice individual wipes,"I like that these are individually wrapped.  I can toss some in my bag for an over night, my purse or keep one in my desk drawer if I am working late.  The cloths are pretty thick like a high end baby wipe.  No funky or harsh smell when opening.  These don't feel super wet but I had no issue removing basic foundation, lip stick, powder, and eyeliner.  I don't wear mascara often nor water proof makeup so I don't know how well these will remove that type of make-up.  No break outs or over drying out of my face after use.  Would recommend.",194617,239
5.0,1609346824862,Adorable,"This is so cute!  If your child loves frozen and or wants to get their nail's done this is the perfect little set.  The fan (dryer) isn't overly loud and doesn't hurt the ears.  The polish, is scented but not super strong, goes on easy and is listed as child friendly.  This is NOT gel polish but standard polish and it will peel off over time.  Nice colors and everything needed for little ones to get nails/toes done.",194617,842
5.0,1609185575275,Nice balance and weight on these tools,"I like these tools.  For me, the thickness of the tools allows them to be easy to hold and they have nice balance to them.  I don't feel like I need to hold these with a super firm grip.  The brushes haven't shed or lost any bristles.  Nice colors and overall work as designed.  Priced a little higher then some sets but the ultra fine point brush is one of the better ones I have used.",194617,12475
4.0,1607356880355,Nice glitter set,"If you like shimmer/ glitter polish this is a pretty nice set.  You do receive a base and top coat with 6 glitter colors.  The colors, for me, looked best when applying 2 coat.  I did use the provided base and top coat.  No major tacky/stickiness.  The polish itself doesn't have a bad or high toxic ""nail polish"" scent.  Set times are normal.  Overall, the colors are really great.",194617,3370
5.0,1607356658961,Kinda love the colors,"I typically don't like ""earth tone"" sets but something about this set is eye catching.  The polishes are very colorful and just seem to work.  The polish itself goes on well, the applicator brush is decent but square so when the bristles are fanned out it's pretty straight.  Not a negative just a FYI.  Nice even coating and I would recommend 2 normal coats for the best look.<br /><br />The set or cure times are no different then any other gel polish I have worked with.  I used a matte finish top coat on the green (lime) color and loved it.<br /><br />Overall, would recommend to others.",194617,1547
4.0,1606830244219,Super cute and fun,These are pretty adorable holiday ears!  I have a larger head then some lol and a ton of curly hair.  This band fits on my head and the ends rest just to the top of my ears (like where eye glasses would rest).  It does not dig into my temples.  THis is to big for a 2 year old but a 7 year old has no trouble.<br /><br />You can see a bit of the glue/ building materials when you inspect these closely and the minni ears are not as full as a pair you would get at a Disney park but these are well done.,194617,13639
4.0,1606306893831,"Nice scrub, ultra heavy on scent","This is a fantastic scrub.  Feels wonderful on your skin, washes clean and really works.  The scent is really fantastic, but cherry blossom is one of my favorites.  This does lean into the heavily scented category though.  Not everyone likes or can be around super perfumed items.  If that is the case then this isn't for you.  It does slowly fade over the day/evening but it is there.<br /><br />Price point seems reasonable and I do really like the squeeze bottle vs the jars this type of bath product typically comes in.",194617,2194
4.0,1606137323583,Nice colors,"This is a cool set.  If you don't care for the cat eye design you can still use this polish like anything else.  The polish is pretty thick so if you apply a thick coat you can pretty much get away with 1 coat.  The magnets aren't super strong, but they don't seem any weaker then other brands that offer a cats eye effect nail product.<br /><br />Set times are the same as any other gel polish under the UV/LED light.  I do find that even after letting this polish cure for 90 sec, if I don't apply a top coat then it always had a slightly tacky feel.  Not really uncommon but I have used some brands that don't do that so wanted to point it out.<br /><br />Overall, really nice set.",194617,2537
5.0,1605883977540,Can be clear or dark background,This is a nice set of polish for anyone that loves shimmering polish.  You get 5 shimmer polishes and 1 black polish to use.  The shimmer polishes are clear-ish and you can just use the polish for a pastel shimmer or you can apply the black polish as a base and use the shimmer overtop.<br /><br />The gel scent or nail polish smell isn't overly strong but it is there.  The bottles are smaller then some sets but there is enough to do several full sets of nails / toes per bottle.  Polish is thick and applicator brush is okay.,194617,16372
4.0,1604928678511,Good size,"This is a nice nail light.  The width of the mouth is large enough to easily get your foot/hand in without scrapping the sides and ruining all the paint you just applied.  Digital screen is easy to read with bright lighting.  Heat/UV is normal and my set / dry times didn't vary by much.  The buttons are easy to press and it stores very well.  Overall, pretty good quality light haven't had any issues.",194617,1549
5.0,1603891497857,Fantastic amount for price!,"You get so many items in this set.  There are two, hard plastic reusable containers of the silver holographic/ refractive butterfly's.  Then you get a massive amount of sticker sheets.  Not all are the same.  Some are 3d real looking butterflies, some are the moth style with detail work, you get the lace style butterfly shapes (I received various types in Black, Cobalt blue, Gold, and Silver)  plus a ton more.  EACH page or sheet is excellent quality.  By far one of the best collections for this price point in variety I have seen in a long time.",194617,836
4.0,1603547959850,Fun whimsical headbands,"These are cute.  Perfect party gifts, sleep over fun or stocking stuffers.  These are soft to wear and don't fit super snug but stay in place.  Probably would be to large for very young kids, the 2 year old mostly played with hers.<br /><br />They colors are as advertised.  No funky smells when opening packaging.  You do receive 4 of these per set.  Price point isn't bad since you do receive 4.  If you are buying for 1 person though might be a bit over the top.",194617,10452
4.0,1602167637654,WOrks on thick hair,"I have long thick curly hair, these are able to clip into it without any trouble.  They are made from a light weight plastic/resin and the clips are your standard light weight thin metal.  Neither have broken and none of the mini ""twist"" hold clips have come off.  Overall, simple to use , look cool , and price well for adding a quick alternative to standard curly hair styles.",194617,40517
3.0,1598965713810,"Bottle 5 stars, Sprayer 1 Star","The bottles are great.  Nice amber color, good thickness and comfortable to hold.  Hold a reasonable amount and don't take up a ton of counter space.  The labels are even high quality, they have good adhesive and a decorative shape.  I like that they are not attached since some of us just dislike using them.  If I was just rating the bottle and accessory label I would give this 5 Stars.<br /><br />However, the Spay nozzle is trash.  It's decent plastic but to large for the bottle, the connector point between the sprayer and the bottle doesn't close properly so it leaks if this bottle is tilted and DO NOT turn the bottle over if spaying your hair upside down.  Then the nozzle turns , like rotates 360.  I don't know if it was designed to do that and if it was then okay, but it's still horrible.  One of my spray nozzles broke after 1 use, the pin on the inside of the handle must have let go because if you squeeze the trigger nothing happens it just pushes up and stays in place.<br /><br />Overall, I just couldn't give it more then 3 stars because of the issues.  However, if you just need or want the bottles then its a great deal.",194617,1814
4.0,1598445407478,Beautiful colors on the glitter,"I have tried 2 different sets of this bran, so far I like the quality of their products. You get 4 glitter polishes and one standard black polish with this set.  It does NOT include a base/top coat.<br /><br />You can use just as it is. The glitter does really pop when applied over the black or just as a glitter polish.  This brand offers some excellent coloring.  Often glitter polish has a full look, this is rather vibrant.  I did also apply the glitter polish over other brands of gel and had no issues.  You need a base coat if you are applying the black (or other color) gel polish on your natural nails, but if you are applying the gel polish on your acrylic or polygel nails you can skip the base coat.<br /><br />Overall this applies very easily, has standard set times using a UV/LED Light.  I got a little over 2 weeks right at 3 weeks before I had any chips or other issues.  For MY nails and daily activities that is a very long lasting gel.  I am normally happy with 1 to 2 weeks.<br /><br />Price point is very reasonable for what you get.",194617,1555
5.0,1597494092561,Works great for parting/braiding hair,"I like this comb a lot.  I use it to get nice even parts while braiding the girls hair (one is 2, one is 22 and one is 30 lol) or for myself when wearing my hair up.  Nice quality, super easy to clean.  If you have thick / curly hair the comb works great for getting those tiny small knots out.  I would NOT try to pull this through a large amount of hair at one time.<br /><br />In general, this is a very nice quality comb and the tail works exactly as I needed/ wanted it to for nice even lines.",194617,14237
5.0,1597232637558,Great for Sensitive skin,"My guy really seems to like this face scrub.  He works outdoors a lot with his job so sweat, dirt, grease, sun screen, etc is slapped on his face and in his beard daily.  He says he can feel the difference on his skin and in his beard after using this.  Really helps keep any blackheads or clogged pores from forming.  I enjoy the scent on him, it mixes well with his natural body chemistry.  In general for the price point its a really solid product.",194617,1087
5.0,1596726538788,Really surprised at how nice these are,Honestly I was expecting comical plastic brushes.  I received die cast heavy well made brushes!  The little bag for storage isn't the best quality but the brushes more then make up for the bags issues.  Each little wand has some noticeable weight to them.  The detailing is impressive and wraps around the entire brush handle.  The brushes themselves are somewhat small but that is useful when doing fine details.  More then likely these will just be on display more then used.  For the price point super amazing gift for any fan of fantasy.,194617,9811
5.0,1596630639073,Great highligher,"This is a really pretty shimmery powder.  Easy to apply to eyelid, around eye , cheeks, nose ect.  Any place you want a little brightness (not to much) added this works very well.  Washed off easily and didn't smear once set with powder or spray.  No rashes or other skin irritations while using.  Very easy to apply.  Price point is standard for the amount but it is pretty versatile so well worth the price point.",194617,1003
1.0,1595769234982,I am not sure what this is,"This is a super thin argan oil  that doesn't feel like or even smell like any other argan oil I have ever used.  This is ultra runny and has a clear yellow color to it.  Honestly, it looks and somewhat smells like vegetable or canola oil.  My hands smell like fast food french fries.  I don't know what this is but I don't think its 100% Aegan oil at all.",194617,1007
5.0,1595766330149,If you have curly hair these are your new precious,"These are really well made hair ties.  I was a bit hesitant to use anything with coils in my ultra curly hair.  Most hair ties get caught, pull, or even end up ripping out hair.  These don't do that, the slick plastic coating and coils oddly hold my hair, firmly but my hair doesn't seem to knot itself around the little ties!  Also,  if I use a tie and most ponytail holders slowly slide down the back of my skull throughout the day giving me a droopy tail by mid morning. Again, these ties STAY IN PLACE! even when sleeping I woke up with my hair in a high ponytails... there were still fly a-ways and I looked like I had fluffy hair but lets face it these ties aren't going to change my hair, but they did HOLD IT!!!!  I get to full twists using the Large size, and I really like the Caribbean ocean blue color.  Overall, for me and my crazy hair these are fantastic and I will horde them like the treasures they are.",194617,2224
4.0,1594916144403,Not a bad face scrub,"This, for me, has been pretty soft on my skin.  The scent isn't the best, a bit medical/plain but doesn't smell bad at all.  The scrub itself is very soft, my skin didn't feel like it was left raw.  It felt smooth and clean after use.  No breakouts or rashes either.  I only needed a small, in-between dime/nickle size, amount to fully wash my fact and neck.<br /><br />Price point seems reasonable and overall it was nice.",194617,1092
4.0,1594128457865,Easy to use,"I use these with my little foil wraps (both the home kind and store bought) and they work great.  Keeps everything in  place and allows me to move about without having to keep my fingers pointed up while I marinate my hands.  They clips are firm but not so strong that they cut off circulation to your finger tips or hurt.  My 95 year old grandmother used these with me and she is like tissue paper delicate.  She had no bruising or other issues.<br /><br />Overall, these work as advertised and aren't overly expensive.",194617,14238
4.0,1593813249404,"Light weight, bit loud","This is a light weight and pretty great starter shaver for someone.  I do like that is arrives with a charge so you can use it right out of the box.  You get a charging cable but is is rather short and you do NOT get a wall plug so you will need your own connector.<br /><br />The side open trimmer is easy to open and use as well.<br /><br />My largest issue is the noise level of this shaver.  It's about double the volume of other brands I have used.  Additionally, I don't know if this would hold up if dropped in water or on the floor.  Just a FYI the plastic housing unit feel very thin.<br /><br />Overall, for the price point is a pretty decent starting shaver.  However, I don't think you will get years and years of use out of it.",194617,616
4.0,1593604781552,"Last a good bit of time, not overly flat in matte","These are cute.  Thick polishes, depending on how you paint your nails (thick / thin coat) you may only need 1 layer of this polish.  For me, I like to do a single thick coat if possible.  This polish allows that with no major issues.  I did dry / set using a lamp and found that with base coat and 1 coat of this 120 sec was perfect drying time.  (that of course may vary for each person).  I do like the matte look this one isn't so flat that it looks like chalk.  Overall, nice colors, price point is reasonable for what you get.  Polish has lasted over a week with no major chips or peeling.",194617,144
3.0,1593522336195,Nutty scent,"I wasn't a large fan of this product.  The scent, to me, is very nutty (think walnut shell scent) and did NOT mix well with my body chemistry at all.  The oil is thick, like an olive oil, and does spread evenly on the face.  Gold-ish colored flakes/coloring is there but it looks like glitter more then anything else.<br /><br />My skin broke out from using so this just wasn't for me.",194617,1014
3.0,1593521829022,Not 100% pure aloe at all,"I don't like that this is advertised as being 100% aloe when it has additives to it like Phenoxyethanol & Xantham Gum just to list a few.  I get sometimes having to add preservatives but one of these is listed as a seriously harmful skin care product.<br /><br />Now, if you aren't worried about it.  Then Yes, this is a thicker gel like cream.  The scent is actually very nice and it goes on smoothly to your skin.  The absorption is rather quick and doesn't leave a sticky / tacky coating on your skin. Did not stain clothing and when it did get onto clothing washed out completely.<br /><br />Overall, comes down to what you are comfortable using for YOU which is why I gave it three stars.  It isn't for me but it may for others.",194617,300
5.0,1592915894839,Ultra soft,These are really cool / funky patterned headbands.  The material is that ultra soft t-shirt material.  Very light weight.  The elastic is firm but doesn't pinch your head or give you a headache when wearing over several hours.  Each headband was individually sealed/wrapped in plastic (you can see it in the photos).  The front of the band is pretty wide and the back is still about an 1 to  1 1/2 inches wide.  I have washed all of these twice so far and have had no shrinking or discoloration/ bleeding of the dyes.,194617,3361

4.0,1587213604858,Easy to apply and no skin irritations,"This is a pretty nice ampoule.  When looking at it in the bottle it appears a gel like substance, however, it isn't thick when using the eyedropper dispenser.  Goes on smoothly with no oily residue.  My skin did feel tacky for a few minutes while it absorbed.  There is a scent to this, it isn't citrus or fruity I just can't place it.  It's very mild and isn't unpleasant I just don't know how to describe it.  My face does feel soft after using but slightly dry as well.  I have had any irritations or breakouts while using.  Overall, it isn't bad at all and the price point is great.",194617,87
4.0,1585684764217,Does everything I expected,This is a pretty great set to give to someone just getting into styling their hair.  Each brush works well and is rather sturdy.  I have long thick curly hair and am able to use each one without them getting stuck in my hair.  Big big big props for that.  Easy to clean and price point is reasonable.,194617,845
4.0,1585425203547,No irritation and easy to apply,"I can't tell if I am seeing results or if my eyelashes are just happy to be makeup free for so long due to current issues with working from home.  This was easier to apply then I thought it would be, but I must admit I thought that it would apply like a mascara not a liquid eyeliner.  Hasn't irritated my eyes, hasn't caused any swelling or itching.  Overall, no scent, no bad side effects, price point is reasonable and I kinda sorta do see some results.",194617,1021
5.0,1585329736376,"Mild menthol scent , very cooling","There is a mild menthol scent to this body wash.  What is nice about it, is that it doesn't smell medicated just refreshing.

5.0,1596852057956,Nice efile and variety of bits!,"[[VIDEOID:16119f6bd6831ee6c0f93ac06fb53624]] This is a nice electronic nail file.  It comes well packaged and has a nice variety of bits.  The enclosed instructional booklet explains the uses of some of the bits but not all (still don’t know the use of the pink triangular cone one). This drill is great for use on acrylics, gel, dip and (carefully) on natural nails.  The drill does come with a power cord but not a power block/brick so you will need to plug this into a usb outlet or brick to use it.  The cord has a dial that adjusts the speed.  There is also a switch where you can choose which direction you wish the file to spin.  The bits are very easy to insert and remove from the drill.  Great tool!",194723,3348
5.0,1596714105815,Very useful,Easy to use.  Works great for my eye shadow brushes when changing shadow colors.  I like that its a metal tin.  Easy to store as well.  Nice and useful product.,194723,743

She said she found the thumbnails annoying as they had more gems on them, which she though was a bit of overkill.  Fun and cute mani",194723,1160
5.0,1595772886585,Sexy fragrance in a sexy bottle.,"I love the fragrance.  It has a woody/oaky scent to me and is very sexy.  I love that the scent not overly sweet,  a very mature perfume.  My husband loves it.  I am not very good at discerning notes.  This fragrance describes the top notes as bergamot, pear, black currant, pink pepper.  Heart/Middle notes are tuberose, muguet, jasmine sambac, and licorice.  Base notes are described as cocoa, vanilla and tonka.  I can slightly smell the vanilla and bergamot...the others I’m not so good at that.<br /><br />It has pretty good longevity and dries down to a ""warm"" fragrance.  Has decent sillage as well, only one spray will do.<br />Love this fragrance!  It just smells so good!",194723,75
5.0,1594671522792,Lightweight moisturizer,I love using this cream on some dry patches I have on my arms.  I used to suffer from eczema and as I have gotten older it has since improved greatly but ever so often I get these random dry patches on my arms or face.  I love how this cream applies.  Feels like it absorbs well into my skin and my skin feels so soft afterwards.  It is not a thick cream and it very lightweight but that does not mean it has no moisturizing power!  I am very pleasantly surprised.  This is my first time using CICA cream and I am officially won over.,194723,745
4.0,1569270619273,Nice moisturizer,"I have dry/combination skin.  I use this before I go to bed.  The pump mechanism is interesting.  I like how it does not have a cap, you just twist the top and the pump goes up and down, this feature would be great for traveling.  I also prefer pumps when it comes to facial moisturizers as opposed to jars, which can expose the cream to germs/bacteria.<br /><br />I am enjoying this moisturizer thus far, I am sensitive to scented lotions and I was disappointed that this moisturizer was scented.  I just do not enjoy placing anything scented on my face (including cosmetics).  Luckily this has not caused any negative reactions on my sensitive skin.  This moisturizer does moisturize but if you are like me and have a preference/sensitivity for unscented facial products, I would keep looking.",194723,2993
5.0,1631050726919,So Pretty!!!,"Soo easy to use and so pretty!! I probably had both hands done in 15 minutes, so it didn’t take long to do or figure out. Also had it on almost a week and still looks like new. I highly recommend this set, great colors and really easy to apply!",194728,38606
3.0,1625653017083,Nice and quick,"Love these for a quick manicure to go!  I am very lazy when it comes to doing my nails and this is the perfect product for me.  It is fast and easy...don't have to worry about waiting for polish to dry, which is a pet peeve of mine.  These looked pretty nice and lasted a little better than polish for me, but not as long as I'd hoped and for that I did take off.  But for quick and easy, these do the trick!  I did notice that the photo shows them sparkly and mine were not?  These lasted about 4-5 days, but I am also in water a lot and pretty rough on my nails.",194728,44437
4.0,1624120782710,Good Oil...,I like it to use on my hair (just a couple of drops) keeps ends looking nice....and also my skin.  I use it in some of my natural skin products that I make...this is a good oil that does not cause any breakouts.  I do think in comparison to others this one is priced on the high side.,194728,9365
5.0,1607634863144,Nice combo!,"I didn't even know that Invisibobble made this combo hair scrunchie with the coil inside.  I think it is great.  Holds well and looks nice with the velour type fabric.  The only thing is this size might not work well for someone with really thick hair?  Not sure, but my hair is pretty fine and this only wrapped around it 3 times.  So for someone with thick hair it might not work?  This scrunchie really holds well...I wear it all day and overnight and it doesn't budge and feels very comfortable,  not too tight.",194728,78
4.0,1598092067177,Nice set of bath bombs,"These are a good set of bath bombs....that do add oils and scent to my bath.  I like the selection of scents in this set and the fizz is pretty good.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this scent....I like dark orientals and even though this is listed as floral gourmand, it fits the bill as a dark oriental for me.  I definitely get the base notes of vanilla, cocoa, tonka and benzoin....it is very reminiscent of a scent I used to wear a long time ago, but can't quite place it?  Maybe Euphoria?  Not sure, but this is a really nice rich dark scent that is heavier on the gourmand side than floral.  This is for sure a date night scent.",194728,75
2.0,1596197795234,This is a 2 part mask,"I was not crazy about the design of the actual mask.  It comes with a top portion and a bottom portion...which didn't stay in place on my face very well...and was just too much packaging for a face mask.  This is also different in that it is an actual cream, rather than the clear gel type or watery type mask.  I did like the cream ok, but I use these masks when I am bathing, and the 2 part design just does not stay in place properly and drove me crazy.",194728,319
5.0,1594408164038,Very moisturizing...,"This is one of the good kind of masks...you know, the ones that feel sort of jelly like and thick.  It's not watery, but very moisturizing.  I don't recall it having a fragrance to it...frankly most of them don't have much fragrance.  This one is very nice.  It has the paper peel off backing which is extra too.  I would re-order these masks!",194728,987
4.0,1617839484371,Works Wonderfully,I am trying to train my short hair to go over my ear while I what for it to grow longer. gpt2b glued spray wax has worked wonderfully. There is no scent and the spray is light so you don't feel it . The spray top has two nozzles - one for flexible texture and one for a structured hold (which is the one I am using now). It holds my hair in place for about 4 hours and then my strands of my  hair starts to  come out and escape from behind my ear. All I have to do is dampen the palm of my hand with a little water and run my hand over the hair and it goes right back to where I want it to be.,194754,132
3.0,1603842798251,Nice Scent,"The ""TCM Mancode 101 Men's Hair Conditioner"" has a very nice scent, not overpowering just right. I had my husband try the conditioner following all the direction. The directions have you shampooing your hair and towel dry, then taking a palm sized amount to massage ( I think that is more than you need) from ends to scalp. Then comb with wide tooth comb from the scalp upward to the ends and let it stay in for 5 minutes ( this is a negative to me ...5 minutes waiting is too long). Finally rinse thoroughly and style. It is infused with tea tree oil and Chia seed oil. My husband agreed with my thoughts on amount of product and time. He thought it was just okay, nothing fantastic. The product comes in a metal container - the one I received not dings and creases on the outside but no damage in the inside of container.",194754,32618
3.0,1603654596088,Do Not Dispose In Toilet,"These  ""Cosmetic's Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes"" are about 7.5 inches by 6.5 Inches  and the fabric is sturdy and also a bit stretchy. It is difficult trying to get the wipes out of the package as the opening is too small. These wipes are slightly scented and I found the scent to not be pleasant. Once I had the wipe in my hands and on my face I could not get rid of the smell - not even when I washed both hands and face with my favorite body gel - there was still a bit of the wipe's fragrance. The wipes are infused with Vitamin E and made with Argan oil and Hyaluronic. This product is alcohol free and is moistened to just the right level so it not dripping when taken out the package. Do not dispose these in the toilet. I think this product is made in Hong Kong but not sure of that.",194754,2288
4.0,1585958055680,Nice Case For Traveling,Biore Cleansing Oil Makeup Removing Cloths come in a package like most wipes and have a pull tab on the top to open and close the packet. There are 44 wipes in each packet and each wipe is about 4.5 x 5.5 inches (you probably would need 2 or 3 wipes a time if you wear a lot of makeup) and is pre-moisturized. These wipes are to be deposed in the garbage not the toilet and are not to be close to your eyes. Directions state that you should place the cloth on the area that has make-up for about 5 seconds and then wipe off. The scent smells very nice and my skin did feel smooth when done. This product was made in Japan,194754,648
4.0,1585956881192,Love The Guard For The Cap,The Bioré Makeup Removing Moisturizing Cleansing Jelly is slightly like a watery jelly texture and goes on smoothly for washing away dirt and makeup on your face. You simply pump some of the cleaner in the palm of your hand and then massage it gently on your face to clear away the makeup -  then rinse your whole face with water. The scent is mild but very nice. When finished you will not feel any sticky residue. I love the guard on the pump that allows you to put it on the pump when you are not using it so little fingers cannot spread the jelly around when you are not looking nor can the pump squirt out when the bottle falls over or when you are traveling. This product was made in Japan.,194754,648
5.0,1655686568336,It Works!,"My hair is exceptionally fine and fly-away. So, when I saw this, Fly Grl Mane-Taming Gel Wand by Wing, I had to try it.<br /><br />When I saw its size, I really thought it would not be enough to tame all my hair. It is merely the size of a mascara. But it did calm those fly-away hairs! It is clear, so it is not visible when it is applied. All I had to do was apply the product with the wand to the fly-aways, and they were instantly under control. Fly Grl also adds shine.<br /><br />The ingredients are also supposed to condition and strengthen my hair, which is also very welcome. It contains glycerin and panthenol.<br /><br />This handy product is made in the United States.",194759,14024

That is why I was eager to try Sasy n Savy’s Citrus Soufflé Hydrating and Nourishing Body Crème.<br /><br />This ultra-creamy lotion is rich and luxurious. It has a light, refreshingly citrusy smell which is derived from the natural scents of essence of lemon, lime, and orange. This body cream is light but effective. It does not irritate my sensitive skin. I find it very soothing.<br /><br />I also love this product for the healthful ingredients that I know are inside. The Kakadu Plum and Wild Rosella extracts in this cream are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. They are healing, anti-aging, and hydrating. They give the skin a glow and protect and repair it from the effects of the environment. There is also jojoba seed oil in this cream.

So, Codex Beauty Labs Hydration Hero Kit looked like something I could use. I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />There are three components in this kit. I believe there is enough product here for at least five treatments. The exfoliating scrub is finely textured but effective. The texture is made of natural jojoba grains. The castor oil in this scrub really cleans the skin. A little of this exfoliating scrub goes a long way. Next, there is a Bia Hydrating Skin Superfood. It contains comfrey and marsh mallow to hydrate and soften the skin and to prevent irritation. The milk thistle in the cream soothes the skin.<br /><br />Included in this kit are also four sample packets: two are of hydrating oil. This is an oil and takes time to be absorbed, but it is highly effective. The other two are oils to use to cleans parched skin.<br /><br />In short, this is a nice start to healthier skin.",194759,2375

5.0,1547935788376,Durable and Good at Blending,"This makeup sponge does an excellent job of blending foundation and cream blush. I use one side for the foundation, and I use the other side for my cream blush. This sponge does not absorb most of the makeup, like many do. It does spread and blend it smoothly and evenly. The size and shape are good to hang onto. The round, larger end is good for blending the forehead and cheek are, while the pointed end is good near the eyes and around the nose. It does need to be washed and air dried frequently. It is a pain, and it much easier to use disposable sponges. However, this one that Is made durable enough to wash and reuse is better for the environment. This one is durable, and pieces do not flake off with repeated use. I like to keep it in its clear box, so it stays dust free.",194759,1199

Very happy with this!!,194770,2538
5.0,1598923854700,Great quality set,The cape is comfortable and large enough to prevent any hair from falling on me. The case is faux leather and zips open easily. I’m really impressed with the scissors—they’re sharp and heavy. The combs are hard plastic. The clips are metal and durable (they won’t bend). And the cleaning cloth is velvet. Cut my hair beautifully. Very happy with this product. Built to last.,194770,1117
5.0,1598552035484,Reduces frizz and adds shine,"Absolutely love this shampoo. It doesn’t lather like other shampoos but it’s not suppose to. There’s a huge misconception that when a product is super soapy and there’s a lot of bubbles, it’s cleaning. That’s simply not true. You have to read the ingredients to see if those ingredients clean-which this shampoo does.<br /><br />Personally, this shampoo did a great job at cleaning my hair. It took 2 pumps for my hair that’s medium length. It’s a huge bottle that comes with a lot of product. The shampoo itself is thick and clear (no color added). I let my hair air dry and there’s was dramatically less frizz.<br /><br />I was shocked at the results. My hair is soft and shiny after three uses and I love how my hair looks and feels. I think it’s well worth $16 for the quality and quantity of shampoo you get. Very happy with this shampoo and would get again!!",194770,142
5.0,1598399506308,Love the convenient handle,This does a great job exfoliating the skin and it’s a great size. I don’t think it’s too hard or too soft. The fabric side is great to lather up soap. I just flip the elastic band over to use the other side. Convenient to use and great to throw away after it gets old. Very happy with this product!,194770,10905

Each one with tissue paper, a sticker than labels it’s unique scent, all in a bed of paper hay.<br /><br />Love the care and quality that went into this product.

5.0,1597785308283,Thick and sturdy quality,Love the size and feel of this hairbrush and comb. I’m happy that the bristles are wooden as well and feel nice on my scalp. They’re strong too and haven’t come out yet. The comb is a very thick hard plastic and it’s pointed edges help me part my hair when styling. Very happy with this product!!,194770,2938
5.0,1597336488227,Not harsh and smells fresh!,"Got this for my boyfriend who’s not big into using facial products but now he is! He loves this scrub. The texture is thick, it’s a bit opaque and not harshly gritty. It’s a more finer grit and it felt nice on his skin.<br /><br />It smells fresh, like citrus almost but it’s not overpowering. His skin is definitely moisturized after using this and he’s added it to his daily routine. Definitely recommend!",194770,1087
5.0,1596852362442,Super soft and strong,"These are such a great deal. $1.75 a piece which I think is very fair. You get 4 different color silicone ear savers. These stay put and don’t slide around in my hair which is a plus.<br /><br />They’re strong and flexible. They conform to the shape of your head. The masks bands stay put behind the slots. Perfect ear savers that will last forever. Highly recommend these to everyone, so simple to use and so effective in keeping masks stay put!",194770,3374
3.0,1596680380895,Very small,This pillow is a lot smaller than what I expected. Tried it out and the pillow only covers my head and lower neck area. I was hoping it would have more support but it’s pretty flat.<br /><br />It’s still a good pillow for a smaller tub though. It’s plastic mesh inside so it dries very easily. I think it’s comfortable inside the tub but the size runs smaller than expected.,194770,757
3.0,1560418383372,Comfortable Casual Gaming Headset,"Audio is basic stereo, and nothing to write home about. At best, similar to stock headphones you get with your phone or mp3 player.<br /><br />Comfort on the the other hand is another story.<br /><br />Love the padding on ear cups and head rest.  Can wear for extended amount of time without any discomfort.<br /><br />Mic quality is basic. Similar to mic audio on smartphones.<br /><br />In line controls are huge (for some reason). Has volume slider and mute (on/off) switch. Has enough raised texture/grooves that you're able to blind use the sliders<br /><br />Works with any device with a 3.5mm headphone jack. Includes a splitter for PC users. Main wire is not detachable from headset<br /><br />  Overall, one of the most comfortable headsets i've tried. Too bad the audio sucks",194773,2139

3.0,1544003294441,Compared to Water Pik,"First thing to note is that it does not come with a wall charger/adapter. Does come with a proprietary cable that connects via USB.<br /><br />Going to compare this to the Water Pik flosser since it's the one I've been using regularly<br /><br />Only thing this product that has going for it, is that it's portable.<br /><br />Functionality isn't that great.<br /><br />Flow of water isn't that consistent and will have random pulses/pauses. This is especially true when water is running low and/or if you angle the flossier a certain way that it ends that sucks up air instead of water<br /><br />Power plug doesn't have water proof cover, so you have to wait till it dries or risk electrocuting yourself/damaging the device<br /><br />The product is cordless, so you think you have better flexibility...but you don't as you have to juggle with the water and try not to let is angle it to the point where it doesn't suck up anything. Also there is some bulk to it even though light weight<br /><br />Comes with a nice tolietry bag for storage<br /><br />I personally wouldn't use this daily, but makes for a good travel companion if you're one to travel/go on long distance vacation. Just keep in mind you have to work with it instead of it working for you",194773,271
4.0,1646641610450,Pretty,"My wife is new to having gel nail polish at home. She usually goes to the nail salon to have her gel polish professionally applied. This set is very nice and there are only two colors out of five that she will not use, because the colors she feels are too young for her. The gel polish is fairly durable and peels off easily when she wants to remove it. The kit comes with two different top coats... one is very shiny and the other is a matte finish. My wife highly recommends this set.",194783,12600
5.0,1638600656541,Great lengths,My wife loves this 4D Silk Fiber Mascara. She states this eyeliner adds beautiful length and incredible thickness to her shorter lashes. It’s simple to apply.  The mascara remains on her lashes until the next day but must be removed with make up wipes.,194783,5386
5.0,1637765969845,Works great,This soap works great. It has a quick lather and rinses away easily. One sheet does the job right. The light fragrance is a nice touch. I like the tin it comes with. It is easy to toss into a bag and go!,194783,207

2.0,1629030877570,My wife wasn’t happy,"My wife was looking forward to wearing these to work since she has to put her hair up. Yes, her long thick hair fit into the hole. When it was time to twist a pretty bow, it wouldn’t twist tight enough so she couldn’t utilize these items.",194783,39519
2.0,1619354073337,Very tight,My wife didn’t like how these head bands are not flexible. She doesn’t believe these fit comfortably on adult heads. They don’t stretch and are too tight.,194783,19180
4.0,1618360552689,Work great,My wife likes these rubber bands. Her hair is shorter so they work nicely to secure her hairstyles. They are very lightweight. They don’t stretch out too much either.

3.0,1601314273083,Not my favorite but it may be yours!,"I like one side of the loofah, but don't favor the other. The soft side feels great on my skin. It's smooth and doesn't bother me. The hand strap can be switched between sides so you can hold it on either side. I don't like the exfoliating side. Its too rough on my skin. It makes my skin sting even with the lightest touch. The loofah is also quite large for me to grip. I have a regular size hand and it can be hard to hold even with the band around my hand. The loofah holds a lot of water which makes it take awhile to dry even when I squeeze it at my hardest. Finally, the loofah isn't very flexible making it difficult to wrap around my body as I wash.",194783,10905
5.0,1597974808237,For adults too,"My wife loves these. Yes, adults females can wear these casual or dress up. My wife has very thick hair and she can use these to create a ponytail.",194783,647
5.0,1597973673494,Long lasting natural tones,My wife loves this eyeshadow. The colors match the color tone of her skin with a natural look. My wife told me it is easy to blend. This pallet is highly recommended for green eyes...how I love to look into her beautiful eyes.,194783,3352
5.0,1597887980308,Smooth out skin,This polisher is good stuff. The skin is smother and clearer. My face is bright. My wife says my face is softer.,194783,1092
5.0,1597085052898,Easily removes make up,My daughter travels all over the United States. She loves these pads. They easily remove her waterproof makeup. It’s a compact designed container. It is non scented and works exceptionally well.,194783,1012
5.0,1597082870707,Brightens your teeth,My wife and I love these toothbrushes. They feel great. The charcoal is a natural whitener that’s actually works.,194783,890
2.0,1596204325963,Does not lengthen short lashes.,My wife was very pleased with the eyelash curler. However she was not happy with the mascara. She only purchases 3 or 4D mascaras to lengthen her short lashes. This mascara did not add any volume at all. She was left very dissatisfied.,194783,889
3.0,1596100503438,Messy,I ordered these lashes fior my wife with intentions of applying with ease. She was not pleased. The eyeliner was messy. The lashes hurt her eyes. We don’t recommend this product.,194783,2362

I love rubbing it into my grand daughters feet. She loves when it time for her nightly foot rub. She says it feels good on her feet and that it smells good. It does help relax her before bed. It works as intended! My hands feel a little weird after rubbing it in- not sticky but you tell there’s a layer on my palms. I don’t really like that feeling but the other family members don’t mind it.",194783,2336
5.0,1581861200352,Good variety of color,These clips are really nice. I like the color variety. Its great there is more than 2 clips per color so you can use 4 when styling. The clips have been working great. The color hasn't begun chipping so thats a major plus! Perfect for kids.,194783,852
4.0,1567465509897,Nice all metal sprayer,"This is a fully adjustable sprayer nozzle, so there is really more than four spray patterns.  A little buckle can hold the spray handle in the on position so that your fingers do not get tired.  The only thing I needed to do is change the quick connect to the type of quick connect adapters that we use on our water hoses.  We have quite a collection of spray nozzles and this one is the fanciest looking.",194783,8503
5.0,1608145639059,Cute for kiddos,Super cute for kiddos! They're refillable so strap them onto their backpacks or lunch boxes so they use them often! Great for gifting as party favors or even stocking suffers.,194788,35533

5.0,1599407838865,Awesome room sprayer,I used these bottles to make my own essential oil room sprays for the bathroom. They are the perfect larger size to fit on the back of the toilet and last forever as you only need one or two sprays. Sprayer lasts well in addition to the pump. Amber color is perfect for keeping essential oils good for a long time! Great purchase!,194788,1814

5.0,1595307562395,Spreads easily,I like this aloe because it speaks easily and absorbs into the skin quickly. Its so hard to keep still letting it fully dry but this one doesn't take long at all. I like the lack for a strong scent and natural ingredients.,194788,300
5.0,1594702000048,Nice bottle for easy use,We use aloe a lot in our house as my daughter is constantly scraping her knees. This aloe has a nice push too for easy use and it a pretty decent value size. No strong smell and dries fast. Great buy.,194788,301
3.0,1594366934220,Don't stay well,I had to keep reapplying the magnetic eyeliner especially in the corners of my eyes where it maybe got wet from blinking. I didn't feel like I could go out without the eyeliner in my purse to reapply everything I had a mirror. To me that just too much work then and you might as well use regular lashes.,194788,2362
5.0,1584235236575,Perfect for washing face,"These super cute headbands are perfect for washing you face at the end of the night, making sure all the hair stays out for your face, and when I am applying my sunscreen in the morning so it doesn't get in my hair. They are super soft and come in a variety of colors!!!",194788,88
3.0,1582960282089,Way to flimsy,"I was hopeful for this pick but disappointed. First off, it's a super flimsy and you can't use much pressure when pressing against teeth. Also, the pointed end that is supposed to clear put any food from between the teeth isn't pointed enough so you can't really get in there all the way. Last, because you cannot put enough pressure to scrape off gunk, it becomes useless.",194788,254
3.0,1581096759185,Didn't notice any difference,Unfortunately I didn't notice much different with this spray. I think it smells nice and it a great idea to calm kiddos but I fine essential oil rollers on the bottom of the feet to have more contact with the skin making them more effective.,194788,2336
5.0,1580883392859,Great detangler combs,I love these combs not only for myself but for my daughters hair. They are perfect for any hair length or texture as you have a set of 4 from wide tooth to fine tooth. They feel nice on the scalp and glide through hair easily. These are a great deal for 4 of these!,194788,256
5.0,1568561282205,I was skeptical but this is super amazing,"First off, I know it pricey for a curling iron but it actually does the trick and is pretty cool. You clip your hair in the bottom little clipper and I prefer the low speed and it winds your hair for you up the wand! It gets nice and hot and curls did stay well after hrs or wear in semi humid weather. Definitely takes a little getting use to but it’s pretty cool. You do need to take slightly smaller sections of hair to curl so the clipper can hold it but I really enjoyed using this!",194788,3574
4.0,1568387820391,Super heavy duty,This nozzle is super built to last. It’s rather heavy but I know it will withstand the much abuse. My only worry is we have hard water and sometimes that eats away at our nozzles over time. Great product that will last though!,194788,8503
4.0,1619490131389,Great for traveling,"I ordered this because I have a couple teeth that food gets stuck in a LOT and it's super annoying. I was using those picks but not only are they expensive BUT I noticed some of the plastic on it would be gone after using it on my teeth. Where was the plastic going? It was there and now it's not so it must be in my mouth! We do NOT need to be swallowing any more plastic!! I have a regular water pick and tooth brush combo but saw this and thought it would be GREAT travel with! Comes with a nice little bag to put it in which is nice because once you put water in it, unless you take it apart, there will be some water left in there. I squirt out as much as I can when I'm done but it's not totally cleaned out. That being said I think it's probably wise after a couple of months at least if not sooner you should maybe run some vinegar through it to clean it really well. I did that to start with to clean it before I used it.<br /><br />As for the settings.... I would like if there were more than 3 but for a travel one I'm OK with it only being 3. As another reviewer said, you DO need to make sure the light is lit on the setting you want to start off with. I'm used to using a water pick so I like it up pretty high but you may not! If you're new start low.<br />I can get through all of my teeth in my water tank but I have to go fast. If I've had some sticky stuff I may have to fill it back up again for a second go round. I saw some bigger ones but I like how this one is a little smaller. It does it's job.<br />I don't have a problem with cleaning mine after each go round. Someone mentioned cleaning it after each time. I just wipe it off with my hand towel. It's water that came out of my mouth. I have my own hand towel that no one else uses and it's my spit and I wash my hands afterwards so I don't feel it needs to be sanitized all the time. Maybe if you were sharing it but this is mine!<br /><br />I really like how you can charge it in any USB adapter. Super convenient these days.<br /><br />It comes with several pieces. For the normal water picker to blow stuff from your teeth then there's plenty for others in the family or if you just want to use another while one is drying from being cleaned or something. I haven't used the tongue piece yet. I have a tongue scraper I'm fond of so this doesn't appeal to me.<br />I do really recommend this!",194789,25791

2.0,1598920994889,Cute! But not really practical,These are adorable and my 8 year old loves them but they don't work well. One side is just for looks and the other is a file but it just doesn't work well for us. We keep short nails and maybe that's why but I certainly wouldn't buy these.,194789,1553
4.0,1597167940786,Great set except for the cape,"I don't get why the capes are such crap in the these sets. Whether it's an electric razor set or scissors, they are always cheap mess no matter the brand! That's my only complaint. I had to buy a separate cape which was annoying but the scissors, combs and clips are nice! Good value!",194789,2311
5.0,1543698556077,Very soft,This is so soft! It worked great but I don't use a lot of makeup. Just some pressed powder and eye line. I don't know how it would take off liquid and mascara. I like it just as a face washcloth for anytime. It's really soft. My 6 yr daughter really liked it too and wants one to wash her face with since we do that every morning.,194789,100
5.0,1543181505796,Helped my acne,"I've had some splotchy acne here and there. Not like teenage acne but I get little flesh colored bumps in certain areas/patches on my face and neck. I started thinking maybe I had too much bacteria on my face even though I wash it everyday but decided to use dial soap on it. That wasn't helping at all. I heard that serums are really good on your face and if your face isn't well moisturized it will produce more sebum which in turns can cause more acne. This stuff has been great! It's not completely gone but it's a lot better. I didn't take any pictures cause since they were flesh colored you could hardly see them especially in a photo. I feel like my skin glows a little better since I've been using this too. I was afraid ""vit C"" would break me out cause of the acids but Apparently it's the opposite. Those acids are good for your skin. I would certainly recommend this!",194789,97
1.0,1541092997706,No luck for me,Didn't work at all for me. Plus I was really worried about what would happen if it got into my eyes. They made it clear to NOT get it on your eyelids because it doesn't need to go into your eyes. That worries me because I know no matter how careful I am there's probably going to some that will drip down into my eye. Anything that's going on or around my eyes shouldn't be toxic. And maybe they only say that as a precaution and it wouldn't hurt your eye but I don't like to take chances with my eyes.,194789,1095

I've become a real fan of Korean skincare products in general - this facial mask in particular.  It feels so good.<br /><br />It only takes a few short minutes for me each morning to start my day with a spa-like treatment.  These masks come well hydrated with  product.  When on your face they feel cool and relaxing.  When removed my skin feels fresh and smooth.  I've tried many other brands of facial masks but, for me, this is the best.<br /><br />The container has a flip-top lid and included a tiny pair of tweezers in the lid that makes it easy to get your mask out of the container.

These are just too cute.",194796,9095
4.0,1616860245072,Lovely facial wash,This product comes out of the tube looking a bit like toothpaste.  After I spread it over my face I used a soft cloth and hot water to lather and scrub a little.  It worked well and my face felt fresh and clean after.  I was hoping it would have more of a lemon scent but it had practically no aroma at all.  Not that that's a bad thing.

It absorbs into the facial hair and leaves them looking well-groomed and smelling really great.  He’s commented that after the first use he got favorable comments about his “manly” smell from many of the girls he works with – when there was nary a comment before.  We both also liked the fact that the advertising copy noted that fact that the product is “Vegan and cruelty-free (no beasts were harmed)”  A plus for sure.,194796,1164

I, personally, think they’re more effective than any of the newfangled facial vibrator/massagers or brushes. The jade is cool to the skin and the rolling helps erase or keep at bay some of the tiny lines that start to pop up as you age.  I think they are especially effective to keep the under-eye looking youthful and plump.<br /><br />I love the pink jade color - it's lovely and feminine.

I like a hint of lavender when doing yoga, so washing my hands before getting started works well. Lather wells and rinses clean without residue or drying. Comes responsibly packaged to contain any leaks that may occur during shipping.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about the black bottle and white label with really big black print. It's not a bottle I would use in a guest bathroom - too commercial looking and nothing decorative about it. The deal breaker: For $20, there are other great scented liquid soaps that come in multipacks. Shop around. I'm not finding this soap to be anything special to warrant the price.",194821,384

However these extenders just made the situation worse. The masks ear loops continually slid off the nodules. The extender itself did not stay up on the head and kept sliding down. This caused the mask to also slide down. When I tried them on my own head, it made my mask feel much tighter than I liked, even on the very first setting.",194821,3374

To be honest, I had no idea these facecloths were even made so I bought a new microfiber dishcloth which worked wonders with just warm water. When I was given the opportunity to try these microfiber makeup removers, I was excited to give it a try. Just like the dishcloth, these too worked wonders. With just warm water, the microfibers whisk makeup away without smearing or leaving traces. There are two small round pads for the eye area, and a longer narrow face cloth. They all have rings to hang and dry. They wash and dry nicely without shedding. For less than $5.00, I’ll save money on products that most likely will not work for my skin.",194821,1198

I have one that I do epson salt soaks in and my daughter kept asking if ai could buy her one. This seemed perfect because of the fun colors,  the bubbles, the music and all the extras. It comes with the little spa sandals, toe dividers, nail polish, press on nails, a nail file, and the machine itself of course,  the machine has two buttons one for bubbles and one for music.

It comes with two viles of the eyeliner, application teasers and 10 pairs of lashes. I love the style of lashes because they're more natural and I can pull them off verses some others that have really thick dramatic ones that are so full, that they make me look ridiculous, these pairs have really thick bands though,  which isn't my favorite but again I shouldn't complain given the price. It also has a decent amount of magnets to get them to stick, they're easy to apply and remove. I love magnetic lashes oi very glue for sure.

4.0,1592499174854,Better than dealing with eyelash glue!,"This a fairly decent set of magnetic eyelashes. I will say I have tried a few different brands. The plus side about these is that they have several small magnets, making it easy to manipulate to your eye shape and have them fit correctly. Some brands only have 3 large magnets and the placing is hard to get a good fit. The second positive about these is that it comes with two bottles of the eyeliner which is awesome since you can keep reusing the eyelashes. I will say that these eyelashes are pretty long. I wouldn't say any of them are ""natural"" looking because of the length. I've toyed with cutting a pair to see if I like them better but am afraid I'll throw off the look...over all though I would say this is a good set.

Now, the sessions will be only once a month until all the unwated hair is removed. The manufacturer recommends using it once every 2 weeks for the first 5 sessions and then once a month after that, so using it multiple times a week won't change the outcome. The areas I use this device are my legs, under arms, bikini area and upper lip. The only difference I've noticed so far is the upper lip hair. It is growing significantly less, like almost 90% is gone. The rest of the body hair still grows the same amount, but the hair started to grow softer. I assume the hair is finally becoming weaker. I am half Greek and half Italian, I have olive skin color with dark hair, so it might take over a year for me to see some results. Overall, the device is very easy to use and it is painless, but it gets super hot to the touch after about 5-10 minutes of continues usage. I use the device on my legs first and then take a break until it cools down, and then I continue using it on other parts of the body and stop to cool it down again.

I thought this would be a bigger deal, but most of the time only part of the file is being used as I am working on the tough spots like the heel or edge of the toe. It doesn't have a lot of power and it kind of slows down a lot. But it gets the job done. I like that it is rechargeable as the Amore went through a lot of batteries.",194947,297
5.0,1563385152774,Working fine,"We have been using this for several months and it hasn't died yet. That shouldn't be a big deal, but there seems to be more and more stuff that doesn't last. It is easy to use and does a good job.",194947,260
4.0,1555780646426,OK,"I had never used one of these before, so I didn't realize how much of a mess they can make.<br /><br />First, I saw that the USB charger did not come with a plug. I have plenty, so it wasn't a problem, but it would have been if I hadn't.<br /><br />The plug that covers the USB port is not attached to the unit and I can see it very easily lost.<br /><br />There is no hose. The whole unit needs to be picked up and rotated to use this item. I found it a little cumbersome, especially when I couldn't figure out which button was the off one when I was using it.<br /><br />If you don't get the nozzle in just right it will come off and you will get sprayed. Again, without being able to see the ""off"", it gets messy.<br /><br />The water canister isn't very big. I frequently have to fill it twice per use.<br /><br />All in all, it is an OK unit. I don't have the expectation that it will still be working in a couple of years. But, it is very nice to use now. I will likely buy another WaterPik type device when this breaks. I just don't know if it will be this brand or if I will upgrade to a better one.",194947,146
4.0,1542042771995,OK for the price,"Well, I do have a setting light. These polishes work fine. I think some of the premium ones, like OPI, work better, and are easier to see what colors are in the bottle. But, for the price they are OK. Gel polish is a pain to use.",194947,101
4.0,1665626355483,These are great,They are bright and colorful and are soft.  They hold hair.  They keep their shape reasonably well.  They're a little expensive but I still like them.,194948,2894
3.0,1656692531194,Its ok,"This mascara caused some irritation to my eyes - a mild burning.  So I would not recommend it for sensitive eyes.  It does stay on without flaking or clumping.  It does seem to be smudge proof and waterproof.  It really didnt add any volume to my lashes.  They seemed slightly longer but not any thicker.  For the price, I'd say it is ok.",194948,2008
3.0,1654557126912,Sort of works,"This stuff sort of works.  If I put a heavy bead of it on, then scrub to remove, the mold comes off.  But, I could do that and for much less $ using bleach.  This stuff works best for small thin areas like grout, or fridge seals etc.  If you have mold on a wall, it is essentially useless.",194948,4086
4.0,1638483479636,Nice set for a teen,"This is a nice set for a teen.  It is inspiration without being preachy.  The quality of the items is pretty good.  The bag holds a decent amount of stuff and the saying is printed on both sides.  I think the script looks a little strange, but it does look pretty much as it does on screen.  The mirror is a great size and I like that it magnifies a bit.<br /><br />Pretty sure my teen is going to like it.",194948,194
1.0,1633307391633,"No, Just, no","These looked a little strange in the listing pic but I thought they'd be better in person.  No, in fact, they look worse.  The fabric reminds me of some old velvet curtains my grandmother had when I was a child.  The are ridiculously thick - almost 2in thick.  And they are super wide.  But the worst problem is that the bottom of the headband - the part closest to your head is even wider than the padding so it pokes you in the head.  My hair was braided when I tried it but I'm pretty certain that if my hair were loose, it would get caught in the edges.<br /><br />Honestly there is nothing redeeming about these headbands.",194948,10743
4.0,1632448441709,Sort of 'meh' about it,"I'm really on the fence about this one.  It is mostly unscented which I like.  It is also fairly moisturizing.  I just do not feel like it cleans especially well. Certainly not as well as my normal soap of choice.  It is also, in my opinion, terribly expensive for the small bottle that I got.<br /><br />For something that is touted as being for sensitive skin, there are too many ingredients that I can neither pronounce nor identify.<br /><br />There isnt anything wrong with it, and I'll continue to use it but I do not love it.",194948,2901
4.0,1629756123602,Purple does not look like purple,"So, I primarily got this because I liked the purple.  My daughter wanted a rainbow set so I figured it would work out well.  Best intentions....  She is happy with her rainbow - I do not like the purple.  It is more of a pink color....  does not look at all like purple!  And I only wanted the purple, so I'm disappointed.  BOO!<br /><br />The polish seems to last a decent amount of time.  The matte finish looks a little weird - sort of like a crayon exploded on her fingers.  But, she's happy so I guess that is fine.",194948,1125
4.0,1624932770524,Great travel set,"I forgot to bring a moisturizer on my trip so I requested this.  I like the moisturizer. I find it a little heavy as I put it on but it actually absorbs very well.  The eye cream burned a bit and my skin actually felt drier - perhaps it is tightening the skin rather than providing moisturizer?  Everything but the mask has minimal to no scent.  Overall, I like this set but I cant imagine paying $60 for it.",194948,1525
2.0,1624502485357,Hate it :(,"My daughter has white blonde hair so I got this for her to share with her silver haired grandma during a trip.  She complained bitterly about it.  Said she could not wash it out, it made her hair blue and made her face greasy.  I thought it was tween drama ..... then I tried it.  Yuck.  While it smells GREAT without being perfumey  but it was like conditioning my hair with glue.  It made it super sticky and tangled.  And it stained the tub.<br /><br /> 2 stars because it smells nice",194948,2929
5.0,1619831564351,Natural looking,"These are the nicest looking lashes I've gotten.  They are quite natural looking.  I've tried a couple of other sets and they have all looked like hairy caterpillars.  In terms of whether they're easy to apply, I'm guessing it takes practice.  The tweezers provided are decent.  I do not find them easy to apply but they arent any harder (or easier)  than other similar sets.  I'm starting to think I'm just terrible at it.",194948,2881
4.0,1614399595468,Flattering colors,"The colors on this polish are really pretty and quite flattering.<br /><br />Its so annoying that the color of the polish isnt clearly indicated on the bottle.<br /><br />Other than that, this polish seems slightly runnier/thinner than others we've tried.  It is just a bit messier and 2 coats are definitely needed.  An led/uv light is definitely needed to cure the polish.",194948,3351
4.0,1611877546017,Decent beginner set,"My teen has started doing her nails during the pandemic and I got this set for her.  It has a nice array of items though it definitely seems more like a sampler than a full set of items.  I found the tweezers a bit awkward to use but I'm not the target demographic.<br /><br />There are no instructions included and rather than the pretty butterfly stickers pictured, I received stickers of bees!  ?!?!<br /><br />I'm probably being slightly generous in terms of stars but anything that can amuse my teen for a bit during a pandemic is welcome right now.",194948,835
4.0,1611805020604,Gentle on skin not so much on hair,This brush is gentle on skin.  It isnt the gentlest on long silky hair.  The plastic feels a bit on the brittle and cheap side.  The self cleaning mechanism works well.  The tines are short and spaced close together and it tends to pull more on the topcoat than the undercoat.  I'd say this brush is better suited to larger dogs with shorter hair like a shepherd rather than dogs like my spaniels.,194948,656
2.0,1610660623324,Why???,"I was excited to get this because my girls are at an age where they like to play with hairstyles.  I tried using this on my youngest who has thinish straight hair and it basically 'crimped' her hair.  No curls.  Just flat straight lines where the iron ended and a slight wave in between each line.  Also, it only has 1 temp setting - high making it is easy to damage your hair.<br /><br />So, yes, this thing is small and you can tuck it into your suitcase but I'm not sure why anyone would bother since it is essentially useless.",194948,137
2.0,1607964973729,Not for me,These really didnt work well for me.  They pull on my eyelids rather than gliding gently.  Also they are too light and do not blend.  The pictures show deep colors and I was just not able to achieve those deep colors or blend the colors together.<br /><br />The formula is supposed to be waterproof and long lasting but these had worn off within hours.  I had a slight glitter effect left but that as it.<br /><br />Perhaps on someone with a different skin tone they would be better.,194948,977
5.0,1600055505019,Nice headbands,Soft stretchy material with buttons that are a decent size without being obnoxiously large.  Does not scream 'MASK ACCESSORY'!  My teenager is very happy with them,194948,2799
2.0,1599530032451,Uncomfortable,"This mask bracket is super uncomfortable - its too hard on my nose.  On the bright side, it does help keep the mask off my skin and helps minimize my glasses fogging.  There is a slot to kind of 'hang' the mask on it but it doesnt work at all with my fabric masks.",194948,7788
4.0,1598306750302,Softer not shinier hair,"I'm not big on shampoo but when I use it, I want to make sure it doesnt dry out my hair.  This worked ok.  Not drying though I did have to use a ton to get it to lather or even spread evenly through my hair.  I'd say my hair is marginally softer,  It is definitely NOT shinier.<br /><br />There is a mild unoffensive scent that does not linger.  Its clear so I dont think it has any added dyes etc.  I'd say this is better than most shampoos for those with naturally curly hair.",194948,142
4.0,1595382074254,I like it but,"I like this hairdryer quite a bit but I feel like the company is trying to oversell it.  Promising to dry long thick hair in 10min is a little silly.  My daughter has a med amount of thin fine hair.  Her hair was mostly dry and it took 10min to finish it off.  That actually is longer than it normally takes.  it is also a little awkward to hold- it is just a bit top heavy.<br /><br />Why do I still like it?  It is on the quieter side for a 2000watt dryer.  It also left her hair very sleek and shiny.  In that sense, it worked better than any dryer I'e ever tried on her.",194948,1557
4.0,1594487401316,LOVE the product Hate the packaging,"I LOVE the product but Hate the packaging.  First, there are no instructions in English on the container.  This means I have to come back to amazon, find the product page and look to make sure I got it right.  Also there are only 15 little pads in this large, heavy duty plastic container.  The pads are dry, some sort of resealable envelope would have worked just fine. I'd even be appeased if there were a refill package available.  But I don't see one.<br /><br />The pads are easy to use.  They do a phenomenal job cleaning - and I used it after taking a 3mi walk on a 90deg day with sunscreen on.  My face felt clean, soft and toned when I was done.  No residue, no slime, pores seemed smaller.  Amazing product.",194948,1012
3.0,1594443518728,Shaver works great,"The shaver works great. Gives a nice close shave and does not irritate the skin at all.  The trimmer on the other hand, does not work at all.  My husband tried it on his sideburns and it basically pulled the hair and nipped at the skin.  The hair was not trimmed at all.<br /><br />The devices feels solid and is comfortable to hold.  If your primary reason for getting it is to shave, you'll be happy with it. If you're looking for a trimmer, might want to look elsewhere.",194948,616
4.0,1593828345707,Similar to other such products,"I find these lashes similar to other such products I've tried .... difficult to use.  I'm starting to think its me!  They are hard to apply correctly but I followed some advice to use 2 layers of liner - which makes them look less natural but they stay better.<br /><br />Given that I've left my house only a handful of times to go grocery shopping in the last 3mo due to Covid19, I cant comment on how long they last - only my initial impressions.  Hopefully someday I'll have somewhere to wear these again!",194948,1430
4.0,1592776888306,Soft!,"I let my teen open the package and she said ""they're so SOFT!""  They are soft indeed.  The colors are wild IMO.  Depending on your fashion sense, they'll either match with everything or nothing.  ;)  But they are comfy to wear.  Very comfy.<br /><br />Some headbands advertise as being able to be used as masks/head coverings..... These will NOT work for that - they arent wide enough.  But as headbands, they're great.  Especially if you like bright bold patterns",194948,3361
5.0,1592170044350,Smells like a old fashioned dr's office,"I LOVE this stuff!  It smells like an old fashioned dr's office.  Clean, antiseptic.  The scent does not last so no worries if you're not as fond of that scent as I am.<br /><br />It goes on cleanly, and leaves no sticky residue.  It is a little thinner than most - more liquid than gel but that makes it easy to rub into my hands.  I seriously think its the best sanitizer I've used.  And I've used quite alot!<br /><br />I got it to put in my classroom, but I think I'll use the cheaper gel stuff there and keep this for my personal stash!",194948,85
4.0,1592087643103,Matches my skin tone perfectly,I was a little surprised but this matches my skin tone perfectly.  It also provides a decent amount of coverage.<br /> It's a little thick on my skin - I think I'll like it better in the winter when my skin is drier -during the summer heat its a little heavy.  I do like the fact that it contains sunscreen which I sadly do not use often enough.<br /><br />I do really like it but it is a bit heavy.  I dont generally wear makeup on a daily basis so that will take time to get used to it.,194948,746
3.0,1587330293010,Mediocre set,"This is a mediocre set.  It isnt especially bad nor good.  The scissor blades don't meet in the middle so they dont cut very well.  One set of nail clippers has a weird angle and leaves ridges on the surface of the nail.  The other does a better job but for some reason launches the pieces of nail far away - not great for keeping the house tidy.  The case doesnt stay shut.<br /><br />Overall, most of the pieces work they just dont do a great job.  I'd have preferred a simpler set with fewer pieces of better quality.",194948,1681
3.0,1587136349352,These are ok,"Oddly enough, the scrunchies are not of uniform diameter.  The various colors fit differently.  One is too small for my hair and the other fits well.  I guess the too small one will go to my daughters.  The fabric looks cheap - especially on the  longer 'scarf' ones.<br /><br />The ones that fit work fine.  The elastics seem sturdy.  I'll just use them while we're on this quarantine where no one can see me anyway.",194948,844
3.0,1585321780312,An ok set,"I'd describe this set as 'ok'.  I did not really care for the scent.  Its not so bad that I'll give the stuff away (as I have for other hair products) but I would probably not order it again.<br /><br />I guess I was expecting more of a miracle - I've heard great things about keratin products - known for smoothing curly frizzy hair.  My hair pretty much looked as it usually does.  Which isnt a bad thing I guess, but no great miracle here.",194948,1022
3.0,1583852051274,OK not great,"Packaging says it's waterproof....it's not!  This mascara is pretty thick so it dries more slowly and gets in my glasses which is annoying.<br /><br />I also the company's philosophy but IMO, $18 for a tube of non waterproof mascara is too much.",194948,329
4.0,1583530695811,Dramatic,"These are dramatic indeed!  They're pretty long - longer than any I've personally seen before!  They are a little poky as in the corners as you apply them but once they're on, you really cant feel that.<br /><br />The curve is natural to my eye so application is much easier than the last pair I tried.<br /><br />They're so long that I could not wear my glasses with them.  The long lashes short lashes is a bit odd to me but they look similar to what is pictured.",194948,2174
5.0,1583303236844,Works for my daughter,"I have only let my teen use deoderants due to health concerns.  I like the ingredients on this product and felt confident in ordering it for her.  The true test came when it arrived - would my picky teen agree to use it?  YES!  She loves 1 sent and said the other 2 are ""ok"".  That is high praise from her.<br /><br />Several weeks after starting to use it, I've heard 0 complaints.  From a kid who complains about everything, this is excellent indeed!",194948,330
4.0,1583300820864,Surprisingly good,"At the current price of $10 for the set, I honestly  wasnt expecting much.  Turns out this set is pretty good.  It fit fairly well in my hand though the handle could have been longer.  It did a nice job detangling my daughter's hair with a minimum of fuss.<br /><br />The set smelled strange on arrival and needed to be washed prior to usage.  -1 star for that",194948,845
4.0,1582679693213,Good basic bath pillow,I like this bath pillow.  I wish the head/neck part were slightly larger but it is decently comfortable.  The back portion is smooth which I like - I like not having any indentations which can irritate my skin<br /><br />Solid performer.,194948,1136
5.0,1582513708021,Amazing,This is an amazing soap.  The packaging and presentation are top notch. The bottle is heavy and will resist being tipped.  It is also refillable.  The soap cleans well and has a great scent.<br /><br />Worth the extra money.,194948,2342
3.0,1578860908024,very thin oil,"When I have used argan oil in the past, it has been thicker and had an 'oilier' consistency than this product.  I did not have to squeeze the dropper - it just dripped off.  I also needed to use a fair amount which is unusual for this type of oil.<br /><br />It smells nice and blends well but I did not find it moisturizing at all.  Strange?",194948,1572
4.0,1564164008533,I like this Primer,"This was my first time trying a primer.  I was having pics taken during 90deg weather and thought I'd try it.  Generally, I do not wear makeup so this was a stretch.  The directions said to spray 8-10 in away from the face - I had trouble spraying from that far away.  When I did manage to spray it, I got it onto my eyes which could be user error but......<br /><br />Once on, it tingled a bit but did seem to minimize my pores.  My makeup definitely went on better and seemed to stay on better in the heat/humidity.  I'm definitely going to keep using it since I seldom wear any makeup.  I'm not sure if I had to apply daily that I would bother.",194948,4074

5.0,1648775555939,"An excellent eye cream that passes my “tests”! First, do no harm…","Forever in search of the perfect skin care products, I ordered this eye cream.<br />I always try it on the back of my hand first to see what it feels like & what it smells like - it’s very creamy but not thick & has no odor at all.<br />Then I dot some on my forehead to see how it absorbs & how it dries & to make sure there’s no reaction on my very dry & sensitive skin - it’s very light & dries quickly. Leaves a bit of stickiness that dissipates.<br />Finally I dot the cream all over my undereye area & hope for the best!<br /><br />In this case, it’s great. I’ve been using it for several days now at night after a shower & again in the morning before makeup.<br />I really don’t expect all the magical things to happen that are listed on eye creams, so suffice to say it’s moisturizing, it spreads easily, & my undereye area feels soft & smooth after using.<br />All good!<br /><br />**Thank you for reading this review & I hope that it’s Helpful!** 👀",194950,2874
4.0,1635255906458,The cream is great! The syringe dispenser? Unnecessary…,"I’d rather pay less for this eye cream & have it come in a simple tube with a narrow tip to just squeeze out a little at a time.<br />The syringe seems like much ado about nothing - I mean, it’s just a way of squeezing out a little cream, too! Except it’s a lot of packaging & fuss. Once the cream is gone, there’s no way to open this up & get all the rest out from inside the container like you can do with tubes.<br /><br />Besides that, the cream itself is great!<br />No scent whatsoever, it glides on smoothly & easily, and it absorbs quickly & completely.<br />It’s nice to find an under eye cream you can use in the morning before applying concealer. I also have been applying at night after I wash my face & my under eye skin area looks & feels moisturized in the morning.<br /><br />So — 5 stars for the cream, 3 stars for the silly syringe brings me to 4 stars overall.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading my review & I hope that it’s Helpful!** 🤗",194950,2868

WOW - is it ever super moisturizing.<br /><br />On my hands, I can rub it in for several minutes & it feels really creamy like a good massage cream. The lanolin must be what makes this happen & the olive oil must be the reason my skin is glistening afterwards. If I need to do something right away, I do wipe my palms off a bit but, at night I’ve been rubbing this in & leaving it to soak in all night.<br />On my feet, I rub this on my heels & balls of my feet after a late shower, then cover them with comfy socks & let this soak in all night.<br />Next morning? New hands, new feet! They feel great.<br /><br />Manuka honey is known for its effectiveness in treating skin issues due to its antibacterial properties, so the combination of this, along with the other ingredients makes this an instant favorite in my book.<br />A little goes a long way & the price is very reasonable for the excellent quality.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading my review & I hope that it’s Helpful!**",194950,1516
3.0,1629644439270,Scrubber feature is better in theory than in practice - NOPE! Cleanser is fine…,"The scrubber tip on this tube of cleanser sounded like a great idea, so I ordered it. I’ve used charcoal face products on my very dry, sensitive skin in the past with no irritation or reaction & this one is fine, too. Cleans, rinses well, moisturizes a bit.<br /><br />BUT — the angled tip has teeny nylon bristles that are actually too short. You squeeze the tube to push some product onto the surface & gently “scrub” your face with it. The problem is that the bristles are so short that it just feels like a plastic disc massage! No matter how gently or firmly I applied it, the result was the same - rubbing creamy gray cleanser across my face with a circle of hard plastic.<br /><br />In theory, this idea is good but the actual design of the tip does not work for me.<br /><br />**Thank you for reading my review & I hope that it’s Helpful!**",194950,25061

I think it’s the way the end is shaped with 4 little tips similar to a fork… the lines that come out aren’t thick & bold, but they can be if you just keep drawing over & over.<br /><br />My daughter is a brow fill-in champ, so I will definitely have her help me next time she’s home but, in the meantime, I will recommend this product since if I can use it, anyone can!<br />I’m timid about big dark brows, but will try a little more each day.

Yes & thank you!,"My daughter has long, thick hair that she colors a few shades darker than her own & is always looking for products to keep it healthy.<br />And this hair mask is a winner!<br />The fragrance is a vague salon-type scent that’s pleasant but not overpowering. The amount of hair she has takes a lot of this, but WOW - you can see the results - her hair is very shiny & soft. It doesn’t have that cheap conditioner greasy softness - it’s a nice, swingy softness. Moroccan argan oil is the secret!<br />At nearly $18 for 8 oz., it’s a pricey treat but also worth it.<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to read this & I hope it’s helpful!",194950,959

I assume it is authentic, but I have no way to confirm.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at how well it blended with my foundation and how light it felt.  It can be used under your foundation or over and looks great either way. It is a nice quality powder that I will be incorporating into my make up routine.I wear this powder over I use as the last step in my make-up routine. Its a great finish it last for hours and looks great.  I have brown eyes and medium olive skin.

The Disney box is really substantial and eye-catching when open.  The 4 hand sanitizers are good sized with a great graphic print.  The scented ones are really nice, and there is one unscented one, too.  The sprayers all work well.  These would be good for teens and up, IMO.

1.0,1627657320824,"Does Not Work, Just a Mess","I had high hopes for this product.  I'm just going back to work after COVID and wanted something to make my morning routine easier.  The video made it look so easy, but now that I have watched the video again I see that they cut away before showing the final bun.  That's because it is nearly impossible to make a neat bun on your own with this product.  You need a second person to help shape the bun and to tie off the ends.  Even wrapping the hair is a mess.  I have long wavy smooth hair and it always looks untidy, messy, and loose with this product.  I made a decent bun for my daughter, but she complained it was pulling her hair.  No way she could wear it to school.<br /><br />The concept is good.  You put your hair through the middle, start wrapping by twisting in 2 directions, and tie it off.  The problem is, you can't do this by yourself and make a nice bun.  It would be ok for a beach day or if you like a messy loose bun, but you can do that with a scrunchie much easier.<br /><br />I would say save your money and your sanity and just pass on this.  Too bad, it looked cute.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",194952,39519
5.0,1618622101752,Perfect for My COVID Cleaning :-),"In these COVID times, we've had shortages of some basic cleaning and health items. I started reading some blogs about how to make some easy cleansers with natural products, like castile soap. Since then, I've been whipping up cleaning solutions like I'm trying to earn a Ph.D. in Potions from Hogwarts :-).<br /><br />These sprays are a good easy size to hold and carry without cramping or hurting hand with the weight of liquid. Not huge like some cleaning bottle sprayers. The nozzles can be turned from mist to stream and everything in between. The tube reaches to the bottom, so there is less waste. The bottles are clear so you can fill them and monitor them easily.<br /><br />These probably won't last a lifetime, but I'm happy with them. Better than reusing old chemical-laden bottles when trying to go greener.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",194952,3369

5.0,1594167960373,"Wonderful to Use as a Shave Oil, No More Itchy Legs or Underarms :-)","I know this is a baby bath oil, but I'm a fan of using bath oils as shave oils.  A little goes a long way, just a few drops per leg (or you can add a drop to your regular shave gel). Helps reduce irritation and you can see where you are shaving! I can't live without it. It's better than any foam, gel or lotion on the market. Truly the best shave experience. I have thick hair and dry flaky skin that is prone to itching and sensitivity. I use this bath oil with a cheapie disposable razor and a few drops of body oil after a shower and my legs are silky for days. Literally days. No razor burn, no irritation, no frustration. I prefer unscented products and this is truly unscented--thank you! Please use caution when using oils in the tub, but I haven't had any problems with the tub getting slippery. Only thing I would change in a better bottle with a pump or dropper top. It's easy to use too much. A little goes a long way so if you're hesitant about the price, don't be, because you'll end up spending more in the long run on something cheaper.<br /><br />Also, used this as a body wash after getting a little too much sun today, and my skin was super soothed.  I think it will help prevent my skin from developing a sunburn--bonus! I may just have to buy a vat of this!<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",194952,267

It's incredibly convenient and a great way to reduce waste and save money in the long run. Admittedly, it does take some time to get all makeup off but it's worth it in the end and it feels like a nice, warm facial massage. I actually add a few drops of facial wash to the towel and it removes all my makeup, even around my eyes. Good for my sensitive skin and great for the environment. The larger towel can be used to dry your face, or as a body/face towel.  I actually love the larger one for the shower.  Can use it on my face and body with just a few drops of castile soap.  Makes a gentle lather that pampers the skin. I wash all of these towels in a delicates bag with my normal bath towels and then hang to dry.  I know you aren't supposed to wash microfiber with cotton, but I throw caution to the wind and it's worked out fine.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",194952,1198

No this, it glides on so smooth, is clear, and is hydrating and cooling.  The pump works well. Not to mention free of chemicals and dyes.

It never leaves my skin oily, it doesn't have white cast (white tint on skin) and is super light weight. It's like an aloe gel with sunscreen.

I love how it totally encapsulates the toothbrush head. Keeps toothbrush nice and sanitary for three months. I use an oral B toothbrush and this fit as well as on a regular toothbrush. Also nice for gifts and when traveling. The biggest drawback to these is the weird smell. I was concerned that it would make my toothbrush taste bad, but it didn't. And the smell does fade some. While I don't have a lab to measure bacterial cultures, this product really seems to work. We feel more secure knowing that it keeps our toothbrushes clean.",194952,2348
3.0,1578935820704,"Not 100% Agran Oil, OK for Hair Use, maybe not skin or face","This is no criticism of the distributor of this product, they do tell you the ingredients on the selling page:  Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Argania Spinoza, Kernel Oil(Argan Oil), Linum Usitatissimum (linseed) Extract, Parfum (Fragrance).  However, you expect this product to be mostly argan oil, and I don't think it is.  First, 100% argan oil usually has a very earthy scent.  This product is heavily perfumed.  And, if you're trying to reduce the 'cones in your hair styling or skin routine, you can clearly see that Dimethicone and Cyclomethicone are one of the first ingredients, before argan oil.<br /><br />I did use it on my hair after shampooing and conditioning.  I'm not a ""no-poo"" person, so I don't mind using this for my hair.  It did make my hair smooth and shiny with blow-drying.  However, there is a lot of fragrance in this product, which stayed with me and on my pillowcase for quite a while.  There is also a coating to my hair, unlike pure argan oil which usually sinks in my hair.  Some people like that coated feeling on their hair, but I only use those types of products on days where I'll be prone to frizzies.<br /><br />This product is just OK for me.  I would use caution using it on the skin because there is a lot of perfume and additives, so spot check first.  I'll just be using it for my hair.",194952,1572

I really liked the idea of a brush that blow dries while styling your hair at the same time. I have used this airbrush several times and always come up very frustrated. For starters, your hair needs to be at least 75% dry for this to even work. That to me defeats part of the purpose of it. Then while I try and give my hair volume by rotating the brush at the roots my hair gets all twisted and pulled inside the brush. I am thinking this may because my hair is just long enough to wrap around the barrel. After spending at least 20 minutes trying to figure out how to not have my hair get tied around the brush and pulled out I do think there is my volume at the roots. The roller also stops working for no apparent reason.  Is it worth the work? To me no. I will stick to the tried and true blow dryer with a manual brush.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",194952,3587

You can take out the dividers between the boxes to make larger areas.  The box makes it very gift-worthy as well.  My two girls have had a blast using this set, recommend!",194952,2142
4.0,1612909424238,Zhaoyun Body Brush; Very Soft (Too Soft); Intended for Delicate Skin; Doesn't Exfoliate Well!,"I have delicate, acne-prone skin.  Lately, I noticed that the skin on my back was breaking out.  Fortunately, I began using the Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush.  It doesn't have sharp bristles that scratch and irritate my skin.  The brush feels as though it has plush fur from a plush animal.  It is very soft, almost too soft.  It feels great when I use it on the bottoms of my bare feet.  This brush, I believe is for elderly people or those with very sensitive skin.  It has a long, durable string for easy hanging in the bath or shower.<br /><br />Despite it not being very exfoliating, the skin on my lower back has cleared up quite a bit.  I've been using this brush faithfully for two weeks.  It is lightweight, manufactured well, and attractive.  I like the bamboo handle, which is smooth and easy to grip.  It doesn't put splinters into my fingers and palms.  I can use this brush all over my body, but I use it primarily on my back and feet.  It arrived inside its own plastic, transparent box for protection and for easy gift wrapping in case you want to give it to someone as a present.  The box can also be used for storing the brush.<br /><br />The brush's head is very easy to clean after it has been used.  I have used both bar soap and liquid soap on the head.  The brush works well with many types of soap.  When using this brush, I always feel as though I am treating myself to a luxurious bath.  I highly recommend this Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush to anyone who has delicate skin.  If you are looking for a type of brush that will exfoliate your skin (sloughing off all those dead skin cells), then you may want to look for another brush.  For right now, I am very satisfied with the Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush.",194953,235
4.0,1596766801814,MBA Night Renewing Serum Helps Reduce the Appearance of Wrinkles Around My Eyes!,"No, I'm not vain, but I don't won't to look old before my time.  I'm a fifty-six-year-old Caucasian male who just retired after 34 years of government service.  Fortunately, I still look as though I am in my forties.  What is my secret?  Simple.  I don't smoke, I don't lay out in the sun, I drink plenty of water, and I moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  Lately, I've also learned the importance of using products, such as facial serums, that have retinol, which reduces wrinkles around the eyes.  I don't believe in plastic surgery but I do strongly believe in using topical products that reduce the appearance of aging.  Everyone I personally know who has had plastic surgery ended up looking like a clown with a lopsided mouth and huge, shocked eyes.<br /><br />  I've been using several Higher Education products as part of a facial cleansing and healing regimen.  The products that I've been using are the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser and the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème.  Both are excellent products; I am quite pleased with them.  Thanks to them, my skin looks healthy and glowing.  After I retired, I moved from Virginia to Tennessee and the change in environment caused my face to become badly dehydrated.  I was waking up with dry, irritated patches of skin on my face that sometimes stung.  Thankfully, with the help of the Higher Education products, I have been able to heal my skin and keep the dry patches away.<br /><br />  I also decided to use the MBA Night Renewing Serum from Higher Education as part of my nightly ritual.  The MBA is to be used only at night.  Also, the consumer is to use it only twice a week and gradually increase its usage as tolerated.  Well, I've been using it every night for two weeks without any issues.  However, I use it sparingly around my eyes.  I've noticed a difference in the three weeks that I have been using it.  Fewer wrinkles and smoother skin.  The serum is light-green and doesn't have a distinguishable scent.  It burns slightly when I put it on but the burning sensation quickly goes away.  I use the MBA after applying my GOAL DIGGER, which moisturizes my skin, preparing it for the MBA.  Like I stated earlier, I've been using the MBA for three weeks and I haven't experienced any ill side effects or allergic reactions such as acne, hives, blisters, or red, swollen skin.<br /><br />  The serum arrived in a 1.7 fluid-ounce pump bottle with a plastic, transparent cap.  For some unknown reason, I keep forgetting that the tube has a pump.  I want to squeeze the tube as though it were toothpaste.  The cap prevents accidental leakage and spillage.  I think it would be difficult to tamper with the tube.  The tube arrived inside a sturdy, cardboard box, which contained company literature.  The MBA is a good product.  My only issue with it is the expiration date.  An expiration date is provided on the back of the tube's crimp and on the bottom of the box.  It reads as follows:  EXP 09/20.  This is not a good date, especially for a product that will probably be in usage for three to four months, if used sparingly.  I expected it have about the same expiration date as the one I found for the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser and the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème, which is 09/21.<br /><br />  I wonder if Higher Education decided that giving products that would soon expire to reviewers from the Amazon Vine Program was a good means for disposing of aging products.  Whenever I review a food or hygiene product, I always look for an expiration date.  Not all hygiene products have expiration dates.  I think they all should in order to let consumers know whether or not they are receiving safe products with fresh ingredients.  I hope that customers who actually purchase the MBA Night Renewing Serum will obtain a product with a better expiration date.  Nevertheless, I believe that MBA is good for lessening the appearance of wrinkles.  MBA won't remove them completely.  I don't think anything will.  However, MBA will help to minimize them.",194953,299
5.0,1596759782871,This Green Vegetable Crème from Higher Education Makes the Perfect Facial Moisturizer!,"I never realized how important, powerful, and essential green vegetable are for maintaining good health until I used the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème from Higher Education.  I am using this product along with two others that are manufactured by Higher Education:  NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser and MBA Night Renewing Serum.  I always use the NO BRAINER prior to using the GOAL DIGGER.  The GOAL DIGGER feels luxuriously soft, soothing, and relaxing as I apply it to my skin.  I use it at least twice a day, in the morning and at night before I retire to bed.  Sometimes, I use it more often, applying it to problem areas of my skin:  beneath my eyes, around the corners of my nose, and around the corners of my mouth.  This cucumber crème is safe to use often because it is made from vegetables that hydrate your skin.  I often saw women putting cucumber slices on their eyes to reduce puffiness.  Now I know that it must work.<br /><br />  When I retired and moved from Virginia to Tennessee, my skin had a difficult time adjusting to the new climate.  Many mornings I woke up with dry patches of red, irritated skin throughout the sensitive triangle of my face where my eyes, nose, and mouth are.  It took about a month of diligently using an expensive high-end moisturizer three and four times a day before the dry, irritated patches of skin went away.  Thanks to the faithful usage of the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème, the dry patches have not returned.  The No Brainer gently cleans my face, leaving it moist and supple, not dry.  Then I apply a liberal amount of the Goal Digger.  At night, I also use the MBA Renewing Serum with 0.5% Retinol around my eyes in order to prevent wrinkles.  I am able to use the MBA every night without it aggravating my skin.  I've noticed a difference since I've been using this product.  All three Higher Education products (the NO BRAINER, the GOAL DIGGER, and the MBA) have worked very well for me.  I highly recommend that they be used together in order to maintain healthy, attractive skin.  I am a fifty-six-year-old Caucasian male.  Friends and relatives tell me that I look much younger than fifty-six.  Many believe that I am still in my forties.<br /><br />  The GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème can be found in a large, flat jar made of very hard plastic that is blue.  It has an easy-to-remove screw-off/screw-on lid.  When I first opened the jar, I found a hard cardboard, tabbed protective seal beneath the cap.  This seal prevented accidental spillage and leakage during shipping and also served as a deterrent against harmful tampering.  An expiration date is provided on the bottom of the sturdy, cardboard box in which the jar was packed and it is also faintly stamped on the bottom of the jar itself.  The expiration date is as follows:  EXP: 09/21.  This is the same expiration date that was also on the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser.  The two products are meant to be used together.  09/21 is a good date.  Both products will be long gone before then.<br /><br />  If you are searching for a moisturizer that will prevent dry, irritated patches of skin from appearing overnight on your face, then I highly recommend that you use the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème from Higher Education.  I've been using it for three weeks and have not experienced any ill side effects such as acne, hives, blisters, etc.  I seriously doubt that you will since it is made primarily of vegetables.  Our moms always said vegetables were good for us.  Whenever I use the GOAL DIGGER, I feel that I am playing with my green vegetables.  Using it is fun.",194953,323
5.0,1596747088508,Higher Education NO BRAINER Effectively and Thoroughly Cleanses My Face without Drying It Out!,"Eight months ago, I retired and moved from Virginia to Tennessee.  The change in environment, I believe, is what contributed to my complexion becoming extremely dry.  In the mornings, I began waking up with red, flaking, irritated, inflamed patches of skin beneath my eyes, at the corners of my nose, and at the sides of my mouth.  After a month of using a very expensive moisturizer four times a day, the patches of damaged skin were eventually healed.  I feared that the patches would reappear after I finished using the high-end moisturizer.  Thankfully, I received the opportunity to review three facial hygiene products from Higher Education:  NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser, GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème, and MBA Night Renewing Serum.  These are strange names for three products that have worked wonderfully.  I have faithfully used them all every day for three weeks.<br /><br />  Let me say that I am a fifty-six-year-old Caucasian male with a raunchy complexion.  I still get pimples occasionally.  My skin can tend to be oily but if I wash it too much it becomes very dry.  The NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser is one of the few cleansers that actually cleans my face without drying out my skin.  After I use it, my skin still feels soft and supple.  In the mornings, I wash my face with the NO BRAINER before I shave.  Then I take a shower.  Even after I step out of the shower, my face still feels soft and supple, not like a piece of dry leather.  The cleanser tends to add moisture rather than take it away.  Also, I can use it twice a day without worrying about it drying out my skin.  When I first moved to Tennessee, my face became so dry that I could only wash it in the mornings and I could only shave every other day.  Now I am back to washing my face twice a day and shaving every day.  I feel cleaner and more ready to face the world when I am clean shaven every day.  Also, I wake up the next morning with fewer pimples if I am able to wash my face before going to bed.<br /><br />  The green gooey substance in the tube is easy to apply to my face and easy to wash off.  It feels luxuriously pleasant on my face.  The cleanser has a faint, pleasant scent that is neither masculine or feminine.  Neither does it linger after I have used it.  The six fluid-ounce tube was received inside a sturdy cardboard box with company literature inside.  A tabbed piece of gray metallic tin foil covered the tube's nozzle.  This foil was intended to prevent accidental leakage and spillage during shipping and to also serve as a deterrent in case someone wanted to contaminate its contents.  There is an expiration date on the bottom of the box and one on the back of the tube's crimp:  EXP:09/21.  This is an excellent date.  This cleanser should be used up long before then.<br /><br />  Most importantly, I have been using this superb hygiene product for at least three weeks and haven't experienced any allergic reactions such as acne, boils, hives, rashes, etc.  I am very happy with it.  If you are searching for a facial cleanser that is soothing, gentle, and hydrating (it won't dry out your skin), then I highly recommend the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser from Higher Education.",194953,1010
5.0,1587561145301,Biore Safely and Efficiently Removes Makeup from My 82-Year-Old Mom's Face!,"My mom turned 82 in March.  She is extremely active for her age.  Before the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020, she would go grocery shopping once a week.  During the pandemic, she went as often as three times in one week.  She was always concerned about us not having enough to eat.  Mom, who is vain, also wears a lot of makeup to conceal her true age.  Therefore, she was excited to obtain the 7.8 fluid ounce bottle of Biore' Makeup Remover.  It is a clear oil with a very pleasant scent.  Mom has been using it for two weeks.  She told me that a little goes a very long way.  She gently rubs the oil on her fingertips and then rubs her fingertips all over her face.  Using a Kleenex, she carefully rubs off the makeup and Biore.  She does not like splashing water on her face for fear of splashing water, makeup, and Biore all over the bathroom sink.  She is very OCD about keeping her bathroom and entire house clean.<br /><br />  The Biore efficiently and safely removes Mom's thickly layered makeup.  She hasn't experienced any ill side effects or allergic reactions from using the Biore.  Her skin is oily like mine.  We don't wrinkle easily.  Both of us look very young for our ages.  Also, I would like to point out that the plastic bottle of Biore arrived with a protector around the nozzle and pump, which is very nice.  The hard plastic protector is transparent.  It easily slips on and off the pump, making it highly reusable.  It protected the Biore against tampering and accidental spillage during shipping.  (The protector covers the nozzle's opening and prevents the pump from operating.)

I generally use a razor for shaving but the two micro screen shaving heads work well for a quick clean up (beware of an occasional pulled whisker).<br />5. For my beard and mustache, the large trimmer used with the gate does a fantastic job.<br />6.

The latter is something I always want in face creams because it does a great job on my aging skin. The aloe vera is a nice touch, as well.<br /><br />I'm usually the one complaining about fragrances, but this time, I'm happy. The  gel-cream has a light (quickly dissipating) scent that's herby, almost minty. Unlike many fragrances, it doesn't bother my sinuses, plus I enjoy the odor.<br /><br />This product goes on clear and soaks in fast. I mainly use it on a dry spot on my face that flakes if I skip hyaluronic for more than a day or two.

It's naturally and deliciously scented and my skin just eats it up.<br /><br />This cream is light and soaks in very quickly. It moisturizes very well and gets rid of itchiness caused by dry skin.  Made with all-natural ingredients including those delicious essential citrus oils, hibiscus, and oils of macadamia and avocado, there's nothing bad in the ingredient list, and it's cruelty-free. It quenches my skin and the pleasant scent lingers faintly for quite a while. I keep a tube on my desk and use it several times a day.

You can use them alone and enjoy just a nice clear gloss over your natural color lips, or you can put it over top of your color and no worry of changing the color of your favorite lipstick. It will add a very nice bit of shine and a little bit of a sparkle to whatever color you decide to slide it over.  I do not notice a lot of flavor to these glosses, but the color is very pretty. I feel that the box is a nice addition if you plan on giving these as a gift. I think this would make a wonderful gift for a young girl or even an older lady. I can’t imagine anybody that wouldn’t enjoy receiving this trio of lip glosses. I felt the price was extremely fair and that the quality of this item was very good.",194967,2233

5.0,1636553153325,Nice feel and Great Color,I really love this color and the feel of this lipstick.  I was impressed too with how pretty the packaging was.  There's nothing nicer than when you take your lipstick out of your purse and everyone sees how pretty the tube is - but I digress.  This lipstick is a great nude color and goes well with just about anything I wear - be it red or pink.  You must always have a good versatile lipstick color in your purse at all times.  Your clothes change but you always take the same purse when you're out and about.  Your lipstick in that purse should go with everything you're wearing.

I think you'll be very happy with how it leaves your skin feeling most of all.

I was so excited about receiving this product because it was so different and unique.  I wanted to learn how to use this product in different ways.  When I received it, I got the bag as pictured above and couldn't figure out what was inside.  There was no description on the outside at all.  I didn't know what was inside till I ripped the bag open. After I opened it, I immediately saw the beautifully colored foil wrapped buds and remembered ""Oh yes, this is the flower buds that I saw that can be used as tea, bath pods and for baking.""  There was no description, instructions or anything inside other than the beautifully foil wrapped buds.  I'm still left wondering how I will use them.  If I use for tea, I suppose I just wing it and drink the tea when I think it's done as there's no recipe for how long to steep to experience the perfect amount of flavor is extracted.  If I use for a bath, I'm sure there would be much more flexibility but it also advertises you can use for baking.  I have no idea how to use it for that.  If I wanted to use it for a gift, it would be incomplete not to mention that in order to even know what I ordered, I had to already open the pretty bag so that would ruin the presentation.  I feel this is a great product with great potential to be a high end gift or luxury indulgence.  They just have one more step to complete in the way of instructions and explanation on the packaging to make it achieve it's potential.  This idea could easily go viral and become very popular.",194967,241

I'm not sure how long it would take to make my cellulite become less visible but I will keep using it for the mere purpose that it does feel good.  I would say too that it would make a good gift because it's so unique.  I do recommend this product and for the price it's a good value for either a gift or keeping it for yourself as a treat.

5.0,1621444058913,Effective and affordable addition to a spa day/night!,"I really enjoyed this set and it’s affordable enough that I can use it regularly,<br /><br />I try to take a few hours one evening a week when everyone else has plans to take some time for myself. This has been really difficult during COVID quarantine so I ended up moving it all into the bathroom, lol! Bubble bath, a nice shampoo and deep conditioner, possibly a sheet mask, then I’m out of the bathroom...usually because someone needs to use it, lol!<br /><br />I knew this set was going to be the perfect addition to my routine. The sheet masks never get right under my eyes or lips so the ones this kit supplies that target those areas are perfect! they supply are great! I’m still getting used to wearing the lip one because I’d never used one before, but there not uncomfortable and they do leave my lips feeling softer. I love that the foot ones aren’t exfoliating, just pure moisture. I put them on and cover them with socks, then inevitably fall asleep wearing them. The next morning I take them off, massage in the rest of the liquid, and they feel wonderful!<br /><br />Not exactly a spa experience, but I’m not one who does that regularly anyway so this feels very indulgent!",194997,12672
1.0,1620075862245,Not moisturizing.,"[[VIDEOID:4eaf048eb55433860172118977ad0ff1]] I’ve used the entire box, exactly as directed and cannot recommend this product.<br /><br />The only things I liked about this product is that it’s unscented and the packaging is kind of fun, but that is absolutely outweighed by the possibility cutting yourself.<br /><br />It does not do what it says. It doesn’t provide “intensive plumping” or”improve skin elasticity” which are just ridiculous claims, particularly when you consider this used for one week and the first two ingredients are water and glycerine. I have pure glycerine and  after mixing it with water in various percentages, I’d be comfortable betting that this product is at least 70% water.<br /><br />I was able to cleanly snap all seven ampoules using the plastic topper provided. Even though my snaps were clean the edges of both pieces are sharp and you shouldn’t touch them. It took me several tries to figure out how to get all the serum out of the ampoules. For three days I was tapping the opening on my palm which didn’t feel great, but I just couldn’t get it to pour out cleanly.<br /><br />Although it is almost as liquid as water, if you get the opening of the ampoules covered with the liquid it won’t come out because of surface tension. If this happens just turn the bottle open side up and blow on the liquid until the opening is clear and you’re good to go.<br /><br />If you can tilt the bottle just right you can get the serum to pour out. It’s tricky, but spend the time doing it that way and you’ll save yourself a lot of frustration. You see me getting it right in the video, but even then I had to blow the ampoule open once.<br /><br />There is also the cost. $50.00 for one week of use. That’s about $200 a month and $1250 a year although it does specify that you should use this daily for six weeks, maximum. Why? Is that concerning to anyone else? Anyway, even if you have money to burn you would do well spending it on a procedure from a dermatologist or a flight to Dubai for vacation. This is absolutely ridiculous.",194997,1535

4.0,1623343278200,Bow holder,This set includes three different color combos. The material is like a stretchy jersey. It allows for plenty of bow storage. I sometimes have to group a bundle of the cords together to make it thick enough to clasp some of the larger bows to. My daughter likes the colors and I like that it helps to keep her hair accessories organized and easily accessible.,195001,34859
4.0,1608829083653,Magnetic Lashes,"There's a little bit of a learning curve with these magnetic lashes, but they're a bit more forgiving than adhesive lashes. You can remove them and reposition them (although you may need to reapply the magnetic liner). Most of the lashes needed to be trimmed just a bit in order to fit my eyes. They do pump up the drama when worn with a bold eye shadow.",195001,2362
4.0,1582425838606,My favorite type of deodorant applicator,"The forest scent is probably my favorite. It reminds me a little bit of Christmas time. This applicator is probably the best natural deodorant applicator I've ever tried. You squeeze the tube and product dispenses through some grooves at the top. You then swipe it in your underarm area to distribute it evenly.<br /><br />I haven't had any issues with irritation to this point. I feel like it does a good job controlling odor in normal situations, but I feel like I was a little bit stinkier than I would have liked after a cardio workout.",195001,2339
5.0,1533845091557,"Compact, hanging cosmetics bag","When I first opened up this toiletry bag, I didn't think that it would hold very much, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was able to easily fit a travel sized shampoo, body wash, and hair products, a full-sized bottle of contact solution, some body spray, make-up remover wipes, deodorant, toothbrush, toothpaste, and some miscellaneous cosmetic items.<br /><br />The bottom pocket is removable thanks to some velcro, so you could take it with you.<br /><br />This cosmetics organizer is smaller than some others that I own, but it is definitely adequate for the basics. It zips up to a nice, compact size and kept all of my toiletries contained and organized on my last trip.",195001,261
4.0,1581898981262,Nice set but not as thick,"I'm a bit torn on this because I really like the four pc set, wood construction and overall size but the individual combs feel a little thinner and less well built than the others I've been using. The tangs are not as thick and overall I don't think these will last nearly as long - also the size makes it more likely to get a bit of a tangle trouble. Still, the set is priced great so it's ultimately a trade off.",195004,256
4.0,1562540983838,Pretty basic but good,"Nothing fancy here - it works fine and performs as expected but there was nothing to get excited about either. Zero problems but if you hide the brand name, no real benefit above lesser models either. This essentially boils down to the price since performance is pretty much standard on this one.",195004,260
5.0,1561316590806,Gets extra points for pretty!,"I'll admit it, what initially attracted me to this is the pink...it's pretty! It also just happens to be a decent toothbrush.

4.0,1546773583765,Gentle but don't like the charger,"Very gentle - which is good - but the usb charger is plain annoying. I'm unlikely to continue using this due to the charger. Very quiet, very gentle and very annoying to recharge. Also, despite the fact this is to be used on children, the person doing the trim is probably an adult so why make this so small? It's hard to handle.",195004,2519
5.0,1607310823585,Full set for $20,"This is a great kit with lots of pieces and paint.  The colors are primary and secondary so colors will have to be mixed to get the natural colors that dinosaurs may have been.  The brushes are the usual kit brushes.<br /><br />This project toy says ages 4 to 8.  My grandson is nine and I'm debating whether to give it to him right now or wait another six months.  He loves pulling out similar toys like this when he comes over. His favorite dinosaur is the triceratops which was the first thing I looked for before ordering.<br /><br />As far as the painting, I really see this for an older child. The play part is definitely more my grandson's maturity level.",195006,17576
4.0,1596324610285,Great Idea of the interchangeable heads.,"This is fine for my heels, but really didn't do too great on my front callouses.  I have bunions, so I get thick callouses easily around my toes.  I definitely like the rechargeable over the alkaline batteries.  I've had grinders with different wheels before and there was more of a difference between the course and fine wheels.<br />I do like that the heads switch out mechanism is easy to use.  I have about half a charge when I got it and it did charge to full less than an hour.<br />Again, my problem is more medical than aesthetic so I'm always looking for a grinder that has a long lifespan.  Because of how the wheel is set up, you only get a use area of 180 degrees.  I like the interchangeable heads on this one.  I have another one with changing heads, but they go on and off.  This is pretty need with them all in one.  I just wish it had a little more power.",195006,297

I like cocoa butter at the beach, not my bathroom.<br /><br />Other than that, this tanner didn't work for me. I have very fair Caucasian skin. Last Friday, I put it on my face after my bath. I really didn't notice any difference, just a tad of color. So last night, I just put it on one leg (it's winter, so only I will know how silly it looks).  Today, I see no difference in color.  They are both the same color.",195006,1568

It is very, very comfortable and even though mine does not have the nose flap, it does block out all light. I am extremely happy with the product. I use masks for dry eye syndrome, not insomnia so I use them every night.<br /><br />The price is $18 on Amazon, which is a great price for a comfortable mask that is large enough to block out any light.",195006,2518

I got a cheap UV light at WallyMart which sounds easy.  They were out and I had to wait a week for a shipment to get in.  Such first world problems.<br /><br />I use the grayish color, not that you can see the colors by looking at the bottles. I did this during the day with a light so I could carefully put it on without getting and on my skin.  That sounds easier than it was, too.  I made a mess on two toes an had to whip out the acetone. When I got the gel right, it was more a user error than the polish, I whipped out the UV light.  I guess it look okay. After it cures, I does have a gel look to it.  I did put on a topcoat of regular polish to get a better shine.<br /><br />Yes, I have to wear shoes and nobody will really see it, but I'll know it's there.",195006,101
4.0,1541795196387,Worked for me...,"I am extremely skeptical of beauty claims.  I tried this eyelash conditioner for two weeks like the claim on the box.  I only used it at night during the week and twice on weekends.  I have to admit that it worked.  That really surprised me.  I am 54 and my eyelashes have never been anything to write about, but in recent years, the skimpiness is more noticeable.  I was worried that the product was going to be greasy like castor oil, since that is all the rage on the web now.  I put it on my hand first, and it dried without being greasy.  I have had to have several eye surgeries in the past and, while also weary of putting unsterilized things in my eyes, this did fine and did not sting.",195006,1095
2.0,1640908773305,Not true to length,The hair is decent. It has nice deep body wave curls. It’s not a silky texture but somewhat yaki. The biggest con is that it’s not true to size. The 22” measures 15” unstretched and 21” stretched.,195022,39605
5.0,1637268858308,Nice,The set is nice and very portable. It is a one-finger UV light that omits he plugged in to operate. It is not wireless. This would be great to travel with as you could easily do your nails using a power bank. The glue works. I find curing it longer than normal helps it to last longer.,195022,13610
5.0,1635447351633,Great cleanser,This is a gentle cleanser for all face types. I have oily skin and I can use this product without it making my face oiler. It feels like it really cleans my skin as though it’s really getting into the pores. I don’t have to wash my face twice to remove all dirt from it.,195022,1858
3.0,1632882509779,Just Ok,I thoughts his mascara would make my lashes pop more but unfortunately did not. It is just like any other mascara. Nothing special and doesn’t make your lashes appear longer or fuller.,195022,25063
5.0,1630523390619,Beautiful,The mannequin head is absolutely beautiful. She has eyelashes and makeup on. She displays your wigs so nicely. I like using her to style my wigs as she shows me how it’ll look once I doll up my face with makeup.,195022,770

5.0,1620674843889,Nice,This is a nice wig. It doesn’t have any combs in the back but it looks nice straight out the package. I recommend putting some dry shampoo to full down the shine and concealer at the top. It’s definitely something that can be worn out the house. The back wasn’t  too short either but that will also depend on how you comb your hair under. I have thin hair with my hair in a ponytail underneath,195022,37097
3.0,1620674136245,Work and customization needed!,"I got the full set with closure and oh my goodness, they did joy watch in color. First, this hair has so much golden-reddish hair throughout it that you’ll definitely need to die this to use it. It is not a natural black hair. I’m not sure if it’s normal for these bundles to have these streak of highlighted hair throughout as I don’t buy much bundles but this is the second bundles I’ve gotten for Amazon that has this throughout. Second, the bundles and the closure do NOT match! The bundles were black for the most part but the closure was definitely brown, you’re definitely going to ha e to dye this! Third, the closure is done for you to have a box-y face look. You’re definitely going to need to pluck this so I hope you have good plucking skills. The hair is soft though and  of good density. Just be prepared to dye the hair or have the hair dye.<br /><br />Therefore, you’re going to need to work with this hair. You’re not just going to wash it and make a wig or sew it it. You’ll need to do some prep work first to get it right",195022,2152
5.0,1619380093126,Pigmented and pretty,"Oh my gosh, I’m so shocked at how well these worked. To try them out, I placed them on my bare eyelid with no primer, concealer or powder and was shocked how the color and glitter popped on my melanin oily skin. They’re small, kinda like pills,  only slightly bigger than my biggest vitamin pills but so easy to use. Some colors are super pigmented while others are not, you’re basically going to to get the shimmer effects with the ones that aren’t has pigmented. I’m darker skin and did a swatch on my arm and you can see how some are pigmented from one swipe while others aren’t but the lighter you are is the more it will show. I know I’ll get lots of use from them as I’m not in full makeup a lot and I absolutely love the color choices and glittery effects.",195022,17756
4.0,1618112347298,Good cleanser,"This is a very good cleanser. It took off all the dirt and oil from my face without me needing to wash my face multiple times. It applies thick and really seems to get into your pores. I have oily skin with enlarged pores so I like that it does a good job cleansing my face. Unfortunately, I had to deduct a star as it seems that my face was slightly drier than normal after washing it with this cleanser. I could see this being a good cleanser to use to wash off makeup from your face to the end of the night.",195022,11969
3.0,1607527628378,It's OK,"The hairspray is adjustable for your spray desire. You can adjust the mist from light to heavy as well as the jet spray is adjustable.  The bottom portion (where water is held) of the bottle material is thicker than most spray bottles you'll find in big brick and mortar which somewhat justifies the higher cost. However, I found that they should have made the top (spray portion) of the bottle thicker with a better mechanism. I've owned several of these types of bottles that I get for $1 in big brick and mortar and know too well that over time the trigger will malfunction so I was expecting a higher quality here but that was not the case. Therefore, unless you simple want a bigger bottle to hold more water over the conventional spray bottles found in the local well-known brick and mortar stores then this may work for you but just know it's the same bottle just bigger with a slightly better material. Just don't expect a better quality trigger than the ones you would've found in your local W or T stores.",195022,27172
5.0,1607526550921,Great Moisturizer and Smooth Skin,"This scrub is absolutely amazing! it leaves the skin super soft and silky smooth. It also leaves the skin very moisturized.  I followed the instructions and bathe normally then applied the scrub with my hands to my body. Immediately, I could feel the smoothing effects on my hands and then on the body part I applied it to. This is great for applying to the skin after shaving, this allows the skin to be silky smooth with no bumpy feeling especially within the bikini area. I also suffer from body acne and while I've used numerous scrubs to tame it, this has actually been the best to relieve the itching and get rid of it within days while moisturing the area. The only downfall to this is it is a hard to get out of the bottle especially when your hands are wet in the shower.",195022,2194
5.0,1607525948399,Great Tweezers,These are precision tweezers that can remove the slightlest of growth hair from my eyebrows.

I have to use them with my headband wig as it’s too big for my head and keep sliding off but with these wig grip, the wig doesn’t move.<br /><br />They have little bumps on them that helps grip the inside of the wig but the silicone material does not destroy the wig and doesn’t make it difficult to remove the wig off your head.",195022,13373

The craftsmanship of these are very poor.",195022,890
5.0,1593364063590,Removes Makeup,I wasn’t sure about this as a makeup remover but this actually worked. I was able to remove a full face of makeup with no issue. The cloth itself is very soft and it was easy to wash off my makeup from the cloth. This will definitely save me in the long run as I no longer need disposable makeup cloths that sometimes dry up.,195022,1198
5.0,1586788584185,Easy and Simple! Works as it should,"This is probably the easier and best makeup remover I've used. I love that this is basically a face wash that really removes all your makeup. I don't have to get a ton of cotton ball and rub down my face like other makeup removers nor do I need to use ton of wipes. This fits into my simple routine of washing my face few times and doing a wipe down with a simple cloth to ensure it did remove the makeup like it said and continue my facial routine then go. It also does not strip the natural oils from my face so after washing my face with this, my face does not feel dry at all.",195022,648

I received a lot of compliments when I wore these and they really popped my face and features though I didn’t have on a full face of makeup. However, these lashes were a bit harder to put on. It took me a few more trials than normal to get them secure and I think it’s due to their thickness. Otherwise, they held up nicely for over 8 hours with no issues.",195022,2175

I got this because my daughter would have a little fly-a-ways when she placed her hair in a ponytail and they tend to be stubborn fly-a-ways at that. Well, I put a small amount on her hair and the hair laid flat and perfect. I decided I would try it in my son's hair and I prefer using it for him and it has become apart of his everyday grooming. It allow me to make his hair look fuller has he has very thin curly hair which makes it so that you can see his scamp in many places because of the tightness of his curls.

I will definitely be buying this product very frequently.",195022,1028
4.0,1579560313313,Nice wig with realistic hairline,This wig is nice. The hairline is realistic and it can easily be put in a bun. The color is flattering and it’s soft and silky. Adding some dry shampoo will help with the shine to make it look less wiggy. It’s free parting and respond well with my hot comb. It’s big head friendly though I wish it was a little smaller in cap size.,195022,784
4.0,1661794229562,Good stuff. Classic patchouli scent.,"Not bad...Large size, pumps a thick tan cream. Fair amount of sud/foam. Pretty strong, classic, patchouli scent.

3.0,1630995941705,Love the ergonomics. Tough to get a close shave though.,"This is a tough one to review...Works great on my neck and face but not so great on my bald head. The ergonomics are fantastic, it's a hefty metal body with nice curves. The blade nestles in the top groove with metal surrounding it...This makes for a difficult close shave from my bald head curves, I like to press down harder and get a close shave but the surrounding metal prevents that from happening. However, on my neck and cheeks, it does well, particularly with a dry shave.<br /><br />The foam is nice but nothing special. Doesn't slick up great but has a nice scent. The holder is okay...Sturdy but holds the blade loosely. Also, as of now, I don't see where I can get replacement blades.",195079,427
4.0,1623744561516,Good if you like cologne.,"If you're a cologne guy, this is more for you...It's strong enough you probably don't have to wear cologne with it. Scent starts off as clean laundry, then comes a little cedar spice, ending with a sweet vanilla...Combined for what I personally wouldn't call ""manly"" but more of a ""man who is trying to smell good""... Has a designer fragrance to it, a little body spray but a bit more classy.<br /><br />Performance is okay. The balm is very fluffy ad soft like coconut butter. It doesn't tame as much as I like but softens and gives a nice glow.<br /><br />Overall I want to hate on this but just can't... I can see why some might hate the cologne smell, it's quite strong and different from the dozens of balms I've reviewed... BUT if you like wearing cologne, you'll love this.

No...But for this price, it is an excellent value for an entry level device. The handle is very ergonomic with an on/off button with +/- temperature control. It heats up quick enough, giving you a temp readout on the LCD display. The iron itself is a little thin and somewhat cheaply painted but it functions nicely. The clasp opens and closes with ease but has good retention. My wife was unsure if she'd like one of these and she is very happy with it and it's results!",195079,2193

The conditioner itself is a thick lotion like consistency, very hard to squeeze out. Scent is a light spearmint that doesn't transfer to my beard well. Disappears after rinsing. End effect left my beard and face feeling dry and chapped, not what I want from a conditioner.",195079,23299

Price is subjective, but you don't feel like you are getting a $50 product. The logo is just a crappy sticker, it feels pretty thin, isn't very powerful and didn't come with a wall plug (only cord, not a huge deal but for the price...). There are similar ones for less.<br /><br />Performance wish, I like it a lot. Coming from a manual one, this makes for much easier work to wrangle my dog an let this do the work. It is not very powerful but that is okay as it doesn't scare my dogs. This is a 4 star product but I feel I had to remove another star for it's price/value.",195079,437
5.0,1598084062304,Amazing scent. Brings out the color in my skin.,"First, the scent is AMAZING...Sweet blood orange with a grapefruit bubble gum undertone, maybe even some jasmine and peppermint, something that awakens your olfactory. Its very strong but not overpowering. Truly one of the best things I've smelt.<br /><br />APPLICATION: Goes on fairly oily and blends pretty well. Immediately brings color to my face, I have medium skin and it starts with an apricot redness but fades back to an awakened tone. I really enjoy that about this, I see others complain about this so maybe it's not best for fair skinned people?.<br /><br />Once dry, I am left with a matte sheen that is well hydrated. You expect it to feel oily but it's more like a raw feel. A really nice balance of hydrated but not wet and definitely softer. I really enjoy this product as well as their others I've tried and will happily continue to use this as my nightly regiment.",195079,81
5.0,1615902129462,Really nice,"I am ridiculously picky about moisturizers. This is definitely up there as a favorite. As far as ingredients, it's not top notch but its not awful. I don't love the addition of dimethicone, especially so high up on the list. Nothing is organic so that's another demerit. I do love how high squalane is so there's pros and cons. My skin is very happy with this so I'm going to stop analyzing the ingredients too closely. It doesn't pill and really seems to sink deep into my skin. Isn't greasy or heavy. Works well under makeup and feel light yet hydrating. The fragrance is light, nothing flowery or offensive. I also like that the big super size jar isn't that bright blue, it's a pretty pearlescent white.

Goes on smoothly and keeps my skin feeling hydrated. A little bit does a great job so this will last a while. My only hang up with some Murad products is the fragrance they use sometimes. Thankfully there is no added fragrance in this cream so I'm very happy. There's a light scent to it but nothing overbearing. No irritations or issues.

5.0,1614176984316,So many options!,"I've never tried this brand before so I was curious to get to testing. Before using on my nails, I did some testers to see the outcome. The confetti ones I did on a white gel color base, one of the glittery ones I did on black. I love the grey with the subtle glitter in it. Everything applied smoothly with no lumps, except for one (not pictured in the testers, but the top left in the company's photos). That one was a bit odd but maybe for someone with more finesse and skill. This set comes with base, top and matte top coat. The glittery ones have good pigment to them, you don't need any color base to make them pop. In my photo, I only did one coat. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. I do my own and some friends' nails on a regular basis. They're super excited to do the green for St Patrick's day and the confetti ones for Easter. This is such a great set, with so many options, I'm very happy!",195087,1541

It's easily blended out with a makeup brush. I like this particular color with my blue/green eyes. I'm not super impressed by the staying power. I applied it around 3 and by 9 there wasn't much left. I'm not an eye rubber so I was bummed to see how much it faded. I don't think I'd get more but I'll use this one, maybe with the addition of another color by a different brand.",195087,724

4.0,1606176617994,A nice set to use before makeup application,"l really like this set! The size is perfect to try something new without buying them individually and obviously, they're great for travel. The entire set is meant to be used together before makeup application for a good base. I like them all but particularly enjoyed the prime essence and priming water. They both feel very light, sometimes I use them without the primer. As for the primer in particular, it's heavy on dimethicone which is something I usually try to avoid in my primers. While it leaves a silky feeling, I just am not a fan. I think it's just a cheap filler that a lot of products rely heavily on. I feel like my skin can't breathe when there's silicone primers on it. But that is just personal preference. I will use it on occasion when doing a full face. Overall I think this is a nice set so I'm happy I tried it.",195087,816
5.0,1605705645693,Deep and sexy,"I really like the idea of these scent wipes, you can throw one in your bag for on the go fragrance. I never understand when people carry around an entire bottle of perfume, seems too heavy and what if your expensive scent leaks? These are the perfect solution. After opening, I left it and reused it again the next day. Put a few drops of water on it cause it had dried and dabbed on my wrist. Still smells delicious.<br /><br /> I'm a total perfume junkie and I really like Gilded Fox. It reminds me a bit of Elizabeth and James Nirvana Black. It has a deep, sexy scent with notes of amber and vanilla-y caramel. Warm and alluring for sure. Not really a floral for me, which is great because I don't like flowery smells. I don't mind some hints of jasmine or rose but overall I like warm, woodsy scents. I'd definitely check out some of their other offerings.",195087,79

It's chilly but feels really nice. I would use something smaller for the under eye area but it does the rest of my face nicely.  I thought the material of the roller would be more of a soft, squishy texture but its not. Thats fine, just a little outside of what I imagined. It would also work well on a burn or sore muscles. Its easiy to wash and rinse clean before putting it right back in the freezer. Overall, I think this is an awesome thing to keep in the freezer!",195087,14606
2.0,1600729040686,Nope,"The premise of these made sense but the execution is lacking. My hair is just a bit beyond shoulder length so I got some hair left out at the bottom that looked nuts after I removed these. They coil up into itself in a roll, so you don't really get a falling curl. More like a jacked up Annie. The silicone at the top and the bottom ripped out my hair when I was trying to remove them. They're too time consuming for me, I'd rather use my curling iron and get the curl I'm expecting vs. these which may leave you with some nutty looking curls.",195087,9809
5.0,1599049202946,"Velvety finish, amazing formula","I am super picky about formulas and colors for lipsticks. I'm on a forever quest for my perfect red - my number one favorite so far is cruella by nars. This is a tight second! It's a much different shade then cruella, so it brings a totally different vibe. It's a beautiful true red falling slightly warmer than cool toned. The formula is amazing. I like that it has a matte finish but it's not a matte that sucks the life and moisture out of your lips. It feels very comfortable, not like a heavy lipstick. You can easily get an undone faded look, like you're not trying too hard(compared to going all out with lip liner etc). I love the way it wears too, it doesn't just disappear in certain spots. Great staying power overall. I'd rank this with more expensive beauty brands, it's an amazing formula. I've got my sights set on the color wine stain next!",195087,681
5.0,1596371154497,Great set!,"This is an awesome set for a newbie to polygel! I've never done polygel before and was curious if I'd like it better than the traditional tips. I don't love those because of the glue and thickness of them and this is the perfect solution to get length without the thickness. Polygel is easy to work with because it doesn't harden until you cure it, so you can make sure it's just how you like it. It's easy to use the dual forms included with the set. Comes with some cute colors, base and top coat a few nail art things to experiment with and the little uv light. The gel polish colors have great opacity with 2 coats. Really, this is just about everything you need(just grab some rubbing alcohol and acetone) to give it a shot! And, super bonus of the carrying case to organize! A fantastic price for what you receive.",195087,12349

I use it in the evening sometimes with beauty gloves to really let it sink in while I sleep. I do occasionally use it during the day as well. Sinks in fast, it doesn't stop me from doing my work. Feels like it creates a nice barrier to hold in moisture but isn't sticky or tacky. No fragrance which is my preference. A nice price point as well.",195087,745
5.0,1592393046940,Perfect for my needs,"I use headbands often to keep my hair out of my face when I'm working, doing yard work, hiking etc. I just don't like fussing with my hair too much if I don't have to. These are really comfortable, not too tight. They don't slip off either which is great.  You can double it to make it a thinner band. Cute patterns and super soft material that isn't too heavy. Especially in the summer, the lighter the fabric, the better. I have cotton ones, but I like the softness and light feeling of these better. I'd get more!",195087,3361

Upon opening, it seemed very saturated so there's no lack of bubbles. Easier to apply, bubbles up and has a nice cooling tingle bubbly sensation. Fit well and adhered nicely, didn't drift at all. I didn't detect any strong fragrance, maybe a light herbally mint - though it does have parfum on the ingredients. That works for me as I don't like strongly scented products. My skin looked calm and felt hydrated afterwards. A great bubble mask!",195087,2207

I thought maybe something leaked but...nope. Fake water droplets that looks really cool. They don't slide down, even when I'm going about my business in the house. They stick really well. They come with a nice little set of tweezers so you can pull out each individual patch. No fragrance which is great. I leave them on for 10-15 minutes as the instructions say. I give it a few minutes after removal and the rest of the serum sinks in nicely, it doesn't just sit on top of my skin. My skin feels soft and hydrated under the eye. They're fantastic!",195087,1027
5.0,1560594891965,I love it!,"I use this after a shower and it sinks in within a minute which is great. An easy to use dropper and glass bottle which is my preference over any plastic containers. It has a thin gel like consistency and I didn't notice any scent. The two big ingredients besides the retinol are aloe and witch hazel which are very calming and good for the skin. It has Jojoba oil, which is a 2 on the comedogenic(pore clogging) scale. 0-1 is my goal since I can have hormonal breakouts on my chin, but so far, so good. Its super easy to use because it doesn't sit on top of the skin, you can continue with your other skin care like moisturizers or oils because it absorbs so nicely!",195087,1826

As I get older(late 30s now) I have more dry skin issues. This is very creamy and dense. A deeply hydrating cream for sure. I use it at night before bed so it has time to sink it. It doesn't sink in fast, but that's fine with me. I love the citrus fragrance. Orange-y and fresh but not overpowering. The jar is heavy and expensive feeling, nice packaging overall. I like most of the ingredients a lot, though there are a few I don't love (dimethicone and butylene glycol) which is why It's 4 instead of 5 stars for me.",195087,1200

It feels amazing going on my skin and smooths on very well—there’s no dragging feeling or feeling as if I have to apply more for good coverage.<br /><br />This feels and looks like a moisturizer rather than a clear serum, so you could use it alone, I suppose, but I apply it in the morning (it does read that it’s a sunrise serum!) and enjoy my coffee, letting it fully absorb into my skin, and then apply my moisturizer. It leaves no sticky or ‘tacky’ feeling.<br /><br />I have sensitive skin with slight rocasea and this serum did not irritate my skin, cause any redness, stinging, or itching. It left my skin feeling soft, and there was a glow to my skin as well, not like a highlighter glow, but a healthy sheen to it, a clean skin healthy glow/sheen.<br /><br />It has resveratrol, which is an antioxidant agent—in a plant, resveratrol ‘attacks’ bacteria or fungi that is attacking the plant, so the idea behind it in skincare is for resveratrol to ‘attack’ bad elements in our environment to keep our skin healthier.<br /><br />I can’t comment on what it really is doing on a cellular level, and it’s difficult to determine what it will do for my skin over weeks, but when I try out serums to review (and I’ve tried out a LOT of them!), I go by: can I afford it: yes!; does it glide over my skin easily and nicely: yes!; is it emollient: yes! does my skin feel amazing afterwards: yes! does my skin immediately look better in any way: yes!

The scent of it would have me use it just to have my hair smell great.<br /><br />As for what it does and how it works: I don’t find this shampoo to be any better than many shampoos I use—I have my favorites that I regularly use that work well with my hair. This Tresemme Botanique shampoo and conditioner didn’t weight down my super baby fine hair, so that was great. My hair was shiny afterwards, so that was great as well.<br /><br />It’s a good shampoo with a nice scent that cleansed and conditioned my hair decently.<br /><br />One thing I wish—since the bottles are so big, a pump dispenser would have been so much easier to use. I think I will pour some of each into a smaller bottle with a pump dispenser and put the bigger bottles in the cabinet. They really are way too big to sit in my shower/tub area. It’s kind of like they are for refillable bottles.<br /><br />If you like the Tresemme brand, then you’ll be happy with this shampoo and conditioner.

4.0,1542892259772,A different approach to my skincare,"When I first looked at this Phytema Anti-Aging Hydrating Serum, I thought it looked so weird for a serum, and then, when I put a little on my skin, I wasn’t so sure I was going to like it at all.  My first reaction was that I didn’t want to use it. Not only did it feel a little thick and sticky, there were those micro-beads in there that felt strange for a serum. I honestly thought, at first, that maybe I’d received a facial wash with scrubbing beads, but when I added water to it, it didn’t lather or foam.<br /><br />I looked up the product online and found the French company who makes this serum and other beauty products. I was a little reassured so I decided to give it another try.<br /><br />I applied a little of the serum on the back of my right hand. What amazed me is that once it sinked into my skin, the skin of my right hand took on a glow. I’m a skeptic when it comes to beauty products—the claims companies make don’t often pan out or are exaggerated—but I could see it, and still do, that glow/illumination on my right hand versus my left hand, and over 30 minutes later it is still there. I love that glowing aspect of it.<br /><br />As for softness, I really don’t see any difference from this product and others but that doesn’t bother me. What I am interested in is how it is illuminating my skin as advertised. As for what other claims the company says the serum does, that’s a little more difficult to determine except with continued use over time, but if I like how a serum feels and if it gives my skin that glow, then I’m happy enough to try it and see what happens.<br /><br />There is no irritation to my skin, no burning, itching, redness.<br /><br />The beads do soften onto the skin as you apply it. Here’s what the company says about how to apply (which is kind of a weird different way to apply it-I still want to do the circular thing!): ‘Apply with the flat of the hand, without making circular motions, but starting from the middle of the face towards the outside of the face, to explode the jojoba micro-beads and to release the vitamins E and C on your skin.’<br /><br />It is a little difficult to apply a serum onto your face with the flat of your hand, but I did try patting it with my fingers and that worked better.<br /><br />It will feel sticky when you first apply it, and you can feel those beads. However, the stickiness goes away and the beads do melt onto your skin.<br /><br />The price isn’t shown on Amazon. I looked up the price on the company’s website and it’s $49.90 Francs (I am assuming it’s Francs), and that’s only about $8 in American dollars. So I don’t know what the final price will be here on Amazon or how they’ll do that. I’d pay a decent price for this serum just for that glow.<br /><br />It is advertised to be partially organic and mostly natural. The company’s advert reads: ‘99.85% natural ingredients of which 28.79% organic. Phytema ™ Skincare Radiance Serum is an ultra-concentrated anti-aging, anti-radical & anti-stain active ingredient. All the effectiveness of white mulberry, cucumber and bearberry, to prevent and fade pigment spots. Natural smoothing agents provide an immediate tightening effect to your face. No phenoxyethanol, no silicone, no paraben.’<br /><br />I’m willing to give this serum a try, and this company I’ve not heard of, Phytema, a try.",195432,97
5.0,1661264356376,Affordable way to make your manicure at home way easier... it works.,"This is a very useful set. This is a must when trying to  get your mani/pedi at home.<br /><br />I compare this gel nail polish remover with another one i had, and i find this one works a little bit better than he other one. Sometimes you will have to use a lot of layers depending on the thickness of the gel. I like to use the file to remove the first layers and then apply the gel polish remover.<br /><br />What i liked the most is the latex. It is just wonderful! I always have this issue when doing my nails, either with gel or regular nail polish. I find it so difficult to avoid going over the nail itself, and this latex works great. Very helpful. You apply it before you apply the nail polish. Once it dries up you can easily remove it by peeling it us, washing your hands. It comes off easily. And as a result... great mani/pedi!",203721,24245
5.0,1657656507448,My skin feels very hydrated and smooth after applying it. I like this product!,"This is the second product I try from this brand..<br /><br />I am very happy i found this products because they have been working great so far. Presentation is cute and simple. It is a plastic bottle that looks yellowish because of the product in the inside.<br /><br />Pump works smoothly. Which i always mention because in so many products I've found that the pump doesn’t work properly.<br /><br />It is made of nutritious ingredients, like hibiscus, hyaluronic acid and niacinamide. This product should help not just with wrinkles but with pimples as well, which is a problem i have. My skin is prompt to acne.<br />You don't need a lot of product to cover all your face, it gets distributed easily and absorbs quickly. It feels very lightweight and there is no heavy feeling left in the skin.<br /><br />I sweat a LOT, and this product feels very good in my skin. Some products make me feel that i sweat more when i use them, but this one just leaves a nice and fresh feeling in my skin.<br /><br />I’ve been using it for a couples of weeks right now, and i can see an improvement in my skin, it feels softer, smoother. I feel i look more rested, it somehow relieves signs of tiredness in the skin.<br /><br />As in the other product i tried before, I am not sure if this is a product i would recommend in 50+ skins, or very damaged skin, because I am not sure if will be strong enough. I am not an expert, so this is just my opinion. But i am really happy with the results on my skin. I couldn’t notice any scent, but since I got Covid-19  i kind of lost it, so I do not really have an opinion about the scent.<br /><br />I really like this product and i am adding it to my skin care routine. I got one for my mother, she has a skin that has been exposed to the sun a lot, plus she is almost 60 years old. I got this for her just because i noticed great improvement in my skin, and i would really like to know if this product will feel nutritious and nice in her skin as well.",203721,1994

Small letters but readable.<br /><br />Instructions are very easy to follow.<br /><br />It comes with sheets that are shaped as a foot. You will put them in your feet and each sheet has some sort of tape in the back that will allow you to secure the sheet on your feet so it doesn’t come off.<br />Before doing this your feet need to be clean, so I did it after taking a shower.<br /><br />You will have to wear if for 30min and once done, you will have to wash it off with water.<br />It is not itchy, it doesn’t irritate, and it doesn’t leave any weird smell either.<br /><br />It took me 6 days to see the peeling, at the beginning I thought it wouldn’t work, but once it did, it did a full peeling.<br /><br />Is great how this works. My feet feel so soft and look so good after this treatment. I will  be continue doing it in the future along with the moisturizer one.<br /><br />This works for sure.",203721,19874
5.0,1609426200296,Works and feels great in your skin!,"It is the first time that I decide to get a roller, mainly, because I wasn't completely sure about its efficiency.<br />First of all, it arrived very well packaged. The derma roller came in a sterilized package itself which gave me a very good impression.<br />I love the Rose quartz roller color. It looks very pretty and sturdy. Each item comes with easy to follow instructions.<br /><br />About the derma roller for the microneedling treatment, I used it as instructed on my face. It doesn't hurt at all, and it doesn't feel very invasive or anything, but at the end of the rolling process I felt my face a little bit itchy. Nothing to complain about, it is normal, and it lasted a couple of minutes. My face didn't get irritated or anything like that.<br /><br />Then, I applied my facial serums using the beautiful rose Quartz Roller. And it was so relaxing. It feels cold at first and while you use it it gets warmer. You have to different sizes, the smaller one is for mouth and eyes, and it feels great under the eyes.<br />The cold stone feels relaxing and the serum was better absorbed in my skin.<br /><br />I feel that my skin absorbed better the serums, under my eyes looked less puffy and it was a very relaxing massage for before going to bed.<br /><br />The next day I looked ad my face and I would say it looked better, not a very noticeable change,  because this things require time, patience and consistency in order to get the big results, but I would say it did a good job in my skin.<br />I am using the derma roller twice a week for now, and I am using the quartz roller every night to apply my serums. I would say it works and feels great in the skin.",203721,756

I happen to really like the scent.",216624,12703

I will likely use it through the summer months where my workout routine might indicate that I need this.

After the chrome I apply a top coat twice that extends a little further than the chrome to help it stay on.  It lasts a couple days before it starts to chip on the nails I use the most.  I know I put a lot of wear on my nails but I am still sad it doesn't last longer.  I have tried a couple brands of polish and still have the chipping problem.

I found taking a little in my hands and rubbing vigorously before applying to warm it up helps to not use too much.  I try to melt it really good in my hands first.  It can be challenging to wash off, so use a small amount and heat it up well with your hands to get the thinnest layer possible for best results.",225211,2896

4.0,1640764201426,Good assortment,These brushes work really well.  The bristles were very stiff until the first use.  They come with covers to protect the bristles.  I noticed each had some bristles that were longer than the rest so I had to cut them down.  The handles are decent and long enough to get good manipulation.  I was able to do some fun designs on my nails with my gel polish.  I also like the variety that comes in this pack so I can find the right shaped brush for what I am trying to do.,225211,792

I know no cream or non surgical option will give me results like surgery would.  The cooper's ligaments once stretched will not suddenly retract from a serum.<br />This serum is light and easy to apply.  It does not irritate my sensitive skin and leaves it moisturized.  I also use a hyaluronic serum.<br />That being said I have noticed a small improvement.  They look a little fuller, not a measurable difference but to my eye they look a little less sad.  This in theory increases estrogen activity locally to increase the fullness of the breast tissue.  This will not replace a surgical breast lift but for minor changes it works for me.",225211,1534

4.0,1610459097912,Cute Headbands and great value,"This was an ok set of headbands for the money and at a good value. The set came with 10 hairbands, which equaled out to be cheaper than buying them individually. I got them to split up as gifts between my daughter and my nieces.<br /><br />My daughter and I love all of the colors and think the knot style is really cute, but I feel that the quality is not the same for all of the headbands. Some are perfect, but some are not. The knots were not in the same spots on all of them. Some had knots on the top in the middle and then some of the knots were slightly off to the side. Also the fabric on some are glued on slightly crooked and some are a smaller size then the others.  So a couple of them were too small for my daughters head. Even though some have a few minor issues, she says she still loves the ones I gave her. So I am at least happy about that. She does wear them all the time and they do look flattering on her. The only thing is the flower print ones she has a harder time matching to her outfits, so she usually wears those ones with a solid color shirt. My nieces are also happy with theirs. The ones that were actually too small for my daughter were the ones that I gifted to my nieces, which turned out great because they fit both of my nieces good. <br /><br />Overall I am ok with this set. They were a great money saver and great for gifting. The hairbands are cute and little girls love them. Even with the few minor flaws I would still get them again.",234691,11858
5.0,1603166022928,Great LED/UV Lamp,"This is a nice nail lamp and it works great. My ten year old daughter and I are recently new to doing nails with Gel polish. We really enjoy practicing doing each others nails. However, the first LED/ UV lamp that we got would get too hot for my daughter to be able to stand on her hands. So I decided to look for a different lamp. I had seen many of the reviews on this lamp that had said it was great to use with children. Plus it had mentioned that it included some accessories. Which made it a great value for the money. So I decided to give it a try. Now we have had it for a little over two months and it has been great. We use it quite often and it's pretty simple to use. You just put your hand inside, and it turns on right away or you can select one of the timed buttons. It cures all gel polishes quickly. My daughter has also been just fine using it. It hasn't gotten too hot for her at all, even when it's been on for a while. It also included some extras. It came with some profesional quality files, a cuticle trimmer, a brush, and a really awesome scraper tool that works so good at scraping the gel polish off.<br />          Furthermore, we are definitely happy with this lamp, and I don't think we will ever go back to regular nail polish that you have to wait for them to air dry.  I also plan on buying another one so that my daughter and I don't have to share just the one.",234691,1556
5.0,1602341559293,Great Rubber Bands at a Great Deal,"These are awesome rubber bands and they are such a great deal for the money because you get alot of them. Altogether I got 1000 colorful ones and 1000 blacks ones. I got them for my 10 year old daughter and she loves them. They are more gently on the hair than most kinds , so they don't hurt as much to pull them out if we don't have scissors handy. They are also pretty durable. I seen other reviews saying that they break easily, but I literally tried to break one on purpose to see how far I could stretch it and it took alot to break it. Also, with the few that I stretched out, I thought that they would stay stretched out and that I would of had to throw them out. However,  after I let each rubber band go, it actually snapped back to the original shape and size. Another positive is that since there are so many , I was able to fill up two snack size ziplock bags (one colorful & one black) for my daughter to have to play with her dolls and make her rubber band bracelets. She still has plenty left to last a while for her hair. The next time we need to get more, these will be the only kind that I buy.",234691,9813
4.0,1601841599081,"Nice, But Time Consuming","   These are nice curlers and they are just as described, but I would say they are more suitable for teens and adults who tend to be more patient.<br />       My 10 year old daughter wanted to try them because she wanted curls without having to use a curling iron. She has somewhat thick hair so I got her two different sets with multiple size curlers so that we would definitely have enough and have the right size. Neither set included any instructions, but it's common sense to know that the hair needed to be wet prior and it was easy enough to figure out how to apply the curlers. However, neither of us realized how time consuming the whole process would be. Half way through applying the curlers, my daughter started to get antsy and didn't want to sit there anymore. She also said that it hurt a little when pulling the hair through some of the curlers. We managed to finish getting the curlers in her hair, but by the time we were finally done she was just over it all. She was no longer willing to even wait for her hair to dry. So within about 10 minute she had starting pulling all of the curlers back out. Which that was another process. You have to be careful pulling each one out because if you start doing it too fast the hair will get tangled and stuck in the curler.<br />      I still think these curlers are nice though and I do think they would have looked great if she would have waited long enough, but they just weren't for her. I would recommend them for someone who doesn't mind being patient for the end result. For my daughter though we learned that it's just better to use a more quicker / instant method to curl her hair.",234691,9812
5.0,1601569129830,Great Hair Cutting Set,"This is a great set for the money.  I got it because I am a hair dresser and I can never have too many hair cutting tools. I also love testing out different hair cutting shears.<br />It comes with everything thing you would need to complete a hair cut.  It's perfect for beginners, while also being good enough for professional use too.<br />Here are the pieces that I received in my set: Hair Cutting Shears, Thinning Shears, A tool for adjusting the tension screws on the shears, a cleaning cloth, two hair dressing combs, a razor comb, black cape,  a sweeping brush, two hair clips, and storage case for the shears and combs. After using this set about 5 or 6 times now, I can say I am pretty happy with it and everything is just as I expected. For the hair cutting shears and thinning shears, they are both decent quality, sharp, and cut well. I love the hair clips too. They hold well and stay put in the hair. I definitely plan on getting some more of those. For the razor comb, I haven't really used that yet, but it looks to be ok quality. When I do get a chance to use it, I will update my review if anything ends up being wrong with it. For the rest of the set, they are pretty much standard quality and as expected.  Overall, I am happy with this set and I have nothing negative to say about it.",234691,2311

This set came with a gel base coat, a gel gloss top coat, a light blue gel polish, a blue gel polish, a dark blue gel polish, three poly nail gels, a mini UV LED nail lamp, two nail files , four mini pots of glitter, fake nails, a few nail foils, a few spools of metallic stripe tapes, and a nice double ended tool that has a nail art brush on one end and a metal spatula at the other end. Everything worked great and was as expected except for the nail foils. I couldn't get a full coverage with them. I do think they would work better by using some type of foil glue .",234691,12349

I originally got the hair to make hair extensions for my daughter, but I found it a little difficult because the hair is a little frizzy and does tangle easily. So we ended up just doing braids and some of the blue hair added into each braid.<br /><br />PROS: Good value for your money. Comes with plenty of hair to work with. It's a beautiful and vibrant color. Works really well with braids.<br /><br />CONS: The hair has a little bit of frizz. It tangles easily and can be difficult to brush/comb through.",234691,37367
5.0,1597737783087,Just As Described,"These clip-on caps are great and are just as described.

They are comfortable to wear and don't hurt at all. Within 3-5 minutes the nail polish comes right off. It makes the process much easier and quicker. They are definitely worth buying, and they can be used for either at home use or for professional use.",234691,14238

It is definitely great for beginners .<br />  It is just as described and as pictured. It works great, it's not loud, it doesn't shake, and it doesn't get hot.

2.0,1613065665996,"Oh Gawd, No.","This wig was just awful. I own a LOT of wigs and never has my twenty year old son busted out laughing when I came out in one. It's decent quality though, seems made well, but they style is just terrible and looked nothing like the pictures. it runs a bit small too so it just barely covers everything when positioned perfectly. But if it slips at ALL, it will show your hair around the edges. It doesn't look natural at all, despite being real hair... again, due to the fit. it looks like I'm wearing a hair hat. Sort of like when you KNOW a guy is wearing a toupee because it's just so obvious... this looks, again, like I am wearing a hat made out of hair. I don't know how else to describe it.<br />Also, to get the volume of the hair style, the scalp is a hot mess. it's teased to oblivion and feels very course and dry.<br /><br />I played around with it for about a half hour trying to make this wig look okay, but to no avail.

They don't brush my lid when I blink and are comfortable to wear all day. I really like them for special occasions!<br /><br />The liner seems fresh.

There are a LOT (238) and my coworker and I had a blast looking through them and picking which ones to use first. LOL<br /><br />They go on easily. No issues releasing from the backing. I've had it on for over a day now and it still looks perfect which is awesome, since it's on my wrist... I've washed and dried my hands at least a dozen times and even accidentally rubbed my loofah over it once this morning in the shower.<br /><br />If you have used many temporary tattoos, so you that occassionally you will pick up some really cheap quality ones that are super shiny and/or stay ever so slightly tacky or something... because they get dirty on the outside edges over time. Not these.

I could pretty much duplicate this scrub from stuff in my kitchen for a lot less money. It's coffee grounds, olive oil, salt and sugar, basically. There are a few other little active oils which I happen to also have around as I make my own soap, so the vitamin E oil, ect, is already in my cupboard as well.<br /><br />The big question though... is it WORTH duplicating (or purchasing again)?<br />The answer for me is, unfortunately, no. It doesn't do much for my skin besides leave it feeling exfoliated, which any scrub can do. As other reviewers have said, the packaging is not shower friendly and it's a loose scrub. So I had to mix this with some coconut oil and clean out an old empty jar to store it in the shower.

They work awesome! They spray thoroughly, evenly, and easily. They haven't clogged or malfunctioned ONCE yet and they are adorable to boot!<br /><br />They come with a caps to seal the bottle off, if for some reason you don't want to store it with the sprayer in it. This could be really nice for limited space areas where the height of the sprayer wouldn't allow the bottle to fit. It would also be really nice for shipping homemade products.<br /><br />They also come with a little sheet of 'chalk' labels.

4.0,1598362693336,Great Starter Kit,"This is a great starter kit to get you going with gel nails.<br /><br />My only issue with this kit is that it claims to have 'everything you need for a manicure at home' but it doesn't include what some might consider the most IMPORTANT tool... a nail file! Obviously this isn't a big deal, most of us already own a file and if you don't, you can pick on up almost anywhere for $1 or so, but it's the principal for me. LOL. I mean, even the cheapest pack of press-on nails usually includes a tiny emery board file.<br /><br />That's such a minor complaint though.<br /><br />Besides that, I wish the lamp were a bit bigger. I'm not very graceful and tend to bump the side of smaller lamps with my wet nails as I put my hand under the lamp. At the same time, I appreciate the compactness of this whole kit... I'm actually keeping it in my desk at work for emergency touch ups so I'm not complaining about the size, just an observation... it's a matter of preference and need.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this kit for a professional/experienced person, but I DO recommend it for a beginner or as I use it - a compact, portable solution for chipped nails on the go (traveling or at the office).",236856,6009

5.0,1647264821976,"Lovely to Use, Great Gift","My wife has been curious about gentle exfoliating products, so when I saw this hydration kit I decided to get it for her to try. It's turned out to be mostly a great product.<br /><br />It comes in a lovely package. The minimalist package coloring, as well as the design of the dispensers, makes a very attractive presentation. The dispensers are also easy to use, and pleasant to hold. It would make a lovely gift.<br /><br />This product is very effective. My wife has now used the entire supply. She says that the wash is smooth to apply, easy to cover her face with it. It washes off quickly, resulting in what she calls a ""renewed"" sensation. Following the wash, she uses the moisturizer, and says it soaks into her skin naturally, leaving a very nice, non-oily feeling. However, my wife does not like the strong scent. She has experimented with the moisturizing oils that come with this. She says they definitely moisturize nicely, and she only needs a couple of dabs of the oils for nice effect. They do better than the scented cream in many ways, but she says they would not be great every day. The best combination would be the exfoliating element, followed by the moisturizing cream, but with no scent. If you don't mind strongly-scented creams, this might be different for you!<br /><br />Overall, this is a terrific set. Except for the strong scent of the moisturizer, I highly recommend it.",236857,2375
4.0,1643472850285,Mostly Very Nice,"My wife and my 13-year-old daughter both like using eye masks, and they have tested numerous kinds.

They are moisturized, but not really wet and gooey like some other patches we've tried. My wife and daughter found them very easy to apply under their eyes. The patches are shaped so that they naturally follow the curves under your eyes. They come to a point at one end, which fits quite nicely right up near your tear duct. A gentle press gets them set.<br /><br />When done using them, my wife and daughter both report feeling a refreshed, smooth sensation right where the patches were used. The effect is good, but not quite as good as some other patches. This seems to be because these masks don't hold on as long as other masks. After about 10 - 15 minutes, they start to peel away. Other masks hold on much longer, so have more time to work.<br /><br />Overall, these masks are comfortable and easy to use, but a bit less effective than some other ones.

The color as shown in the product description is accurate in how it appears on her lips. It applies smoothly, stays on well, and my wife says it gives a nice, moisturized feel. The scent is slight, almost unnoticeable, and there is no strong flavor. The ""gloss"" is moderate, not too showy. Seems like a nice choice. I recommend it.",236857,9180

4.0,1647711761617,The cute isn't a cover up...,"A good number of times when you see something as cute as this little bee-esque slicker brush, the manufacturer is covering up a shoddy product and hoping the ""awwww, it's SO CUUUUUUTE!!!!!"" factor will overwhelm the buyer so much they don't notice and/or care when the product gives up the ghost after only a few uses. So yes, choosing this slicker based on looks probably wasn't the smartest of choices, but in the end it seems to be a good one. This slicker brush is rather nice (and should be for the $20 price tag). It's comfortable to hold. There is weight to it so this doesn't feel flimsy to where the grooming head will break off if you try to comb out a snarl in your pet's fur, or like the body is the thinnest molded plastic they could get away with so it didn't break just removing it from the packaging. Another plus is the end of the tines are tipped/dipped in protective little drops of plastic so the sharp metal ends don't harm your pet. I've always avoided those slickers as they seem like some kind of torture device - how can bare metal ends be comfortable when raked over skin?<br /><br />For taking care of loose hair, this did a bang up job on our two Maine Coons, including the one who absolutely loathes - and I mean to the depths of H.E. double hockey sticks with a side of utter disgust  - being brushed. She was adopted from the shelter as an abused kitty from the home of an older cat hoarder, and whatever happened during her first six years of life there were traumatic enough that she will do her best to eviscerate anyone who tries to groom her long fur beyond the area of her neck. She actually lets us very gently use this on the rest of her back and legs and tail for around 45-60 seconds before flipping out, and that's a big improvement!  Who knows, maybe she's as amused by the itty bitty bee antenna as we are, but this is the first slicker brush (even with the safety tipped teeth) she's let us use on her back, sides, and legs. The other Maine Coon (a big chonker of a guy) lays on his back with his legs stretched out and purrs like a race car when he gets groomed, so it's not a surprise that he loves this slicker as well. Cleaning the hair out is easy. Just press the button, the plastic disk pushes up, and the hair is forced off of the tines for easy removal. A few of the finer hairs may stick to the plastic or around the tines, but nothing major. When the slicker gets dirty between the base and the underside of the plastic disk, one of those super skinny reusable straw scrubby brushes and a bit of dish soap does the trick. We clip a wooden clothespin on either side of the plastic disk to keep it raised so the tines can air dry and not rust from trapped moisture. Since the tines all seem to be securely anchored to the base of the slicker head, we aren't too concerned about one being pulled out while trying to work through a tangle. It's still a good idea to check the tines every so often to make sure they are all there, none are loose, and that none of the little safety tips at the end of the tines have come off.<br /><br />The only thing that could improve this slicker is a price reduction. A pair of googly eyes wouldn't hurt, either.",236935,27041
4.0,1598305706653,Not heavy duty glass,"These two spray bottles are fairly decent for light to medium usage. They are glass, but not thick and hefty as you might expect. They feel like plastic even though they aren't. If dropped, these things are going to shatter. The internal spray tubes are plenty long enough to reach every bit of liquid in the bottle and wide enough to pull up good amounts of fluid. There's no excessive spraying because the amount discharged is so little. We've not had any trouble with the nozzles (going from on to off, clogging up, shooting the liquid off at a weird angle, etc). I don't recommend these for heavy duty work or for use in an area where they are likely to be knocked off to the floor.",236935,1814
5.0,1597003180617,"Amazing as paint brushes, too!","I am truly surprised by how great the brush end is of these nail tools. My prior set of nail art tools had brushes as well, but the tips were definitely NOT as precise as these. The quality of these brushes is definitely comparable to some of my more expensive art brushes I use for minuscule detail work. Even after cleaning, the bristles haven't frayed or bent and the points are still precise. I paint ceramic houses and people each year for my mom to add to the Christmas village I started for her some 30 years ago, and I plan to buy another set or two of these nail art brushes to use instead of my regular paint brushes because these work so much better. They are also a fraction of the cost for art brushes with such tiny tips. The only fault I have with these tools is that the brush end is not glued on. If you pull on the metal portion, it comes right off. They aren't so loose that they fall off on their own, but I did glue them on to keep the brushes securely in place. The ends with the little ball tips don't have this problem and are securely attached to the plastic shaft. I highly recommend these brushes not only for nail art, but for any art or painted craft projects you may have planned. Even with the loose brush caps, I have to give these five stars.",236935,4596
5.0,1594437028531,Love these little pads!,"I was so happy when I saw these little cleansing pads on Amazon! I was a HUGE fan of the just-add-water cleaning pads that used to be on the market several years ago (not sure if it was Ponds or Oil of Olay that made them), but then those stopped being sold. They were the best for traveling since they were dry until you planned to use them. Like these pads from the SAEM, you never had to worry about leakage in your bag, TSA pulling them, or the pads drying out. Just like those old cleansing pads, these also have a smooth side for cleansing and a textured side for exfoliating.  Unlike those other pads, these have a nifty little pocket to slide over your fingers.<br /><br />The cleanser used is pretty gentle, and the exfoliation aspect comes from the pad's textured side. The cleanser used smells wonderful and does a good job at getting off makeup and dirt. The textured side will exfoliate well enough to remove any flaky skin you may have, but if you suffer from acne and/or congested skin and blackheads, you will still need to use a chemical exfoliator to deal with the gunk down in your pores as this won't deal with that. Unlike pre-moistened cleansing pads and wipes, you will need to rinse your face afterwards with water. The soapy foam comes off completely without any residue that makes your skin feel sticky or oily. In fact, the cleanser the SAEM uses is gentle enough that my face didn't feel dry or tight, just clean.<br /><br />These little pads are also handy to have if you need to do a quick leg shave! If you need to do each full leg, one per each works. If you just need to get from the knee down, one pad should work for both. Get your leg wet, later up one of these pads, quickly wipe the pad of a section of leg, then shave. Repeat, then rinse off your legs. Desperate times, desperate measures, but it works.",236935,1012
4.0,1593828220058,Pretty headbands,"This is a nice assortment of headbands for adding some pizzaz to your hair, but they are kind of frustrating when it comes to keeping your hair held back because the inside of the band is soft rather than having the little 'teeth' that help hold your hair in place. Unless you use bobby pins underneath to hold your hair back and use these headbands to cover up the pins, you will be constantly pulling this band off and sliding it back in place to rescuer your hair due to hair coming loose.  Not having the teeth makes these comfortable to wear, which makes these good for little ones who aren't fans of any pokey edges on their hair accessories. The bands are pretty thin, just fabric over plastic, so they don't weigh much at all (another plus) or squeeze your head too tight and cause a headache.  Overall I like them and how they look, but I wish they had at least a few teeth to help keep hair in place better.",236935,46600
5.0,1593468664856,Clogged pores rejoice!,"I'm a wee bit of a skincare addict, and I love trying out products (my husband jokes that my bathroom looks like an Ulta blew up). One thing I am always on the lookout for is a good product to help with the occasional breakout in my T-zone or the god-awful cystic acne that pops up every so often along my chin and jaw. Since my cheeks are on the dry side, I've only used this on my T-zone to deal with some of the stubborn clogged pores there, and so far so good.  I like how the mask warms up a bit to help pores relax (if that's the right word since pores don't actually open or close) and the AHAs help to soften/dissolve the gunk inside the pores so it is easier to remove. Since I've not had to use more moisturizer than normal, this mask hasn't caused any dry or flaky skin. I also didn't leave it on for a full 20 minutes like the directions say you can do, instead opting to wash it off after just 10 (based on my patch test). Between the AHAs and the bentonite clay and the self-warming, I didn't want to push my skin to the point of irritation. The directions also say you can use this up to twice a week, but since I am also using retinol, I will likely keep this mask to once a week.<br /><br />After checking out their main site, I found this line was created by pediatric dermatologist specifically to deal with skin concerns/conditions more specifically associated with those in their early 20’s such as stress breakouts, hormone changes, excess oil, etc., but they also offer products for dry and sensitive skin. I'm in my 40's and still deal with stress breakouts and hormone changes, and it's nice to see a product address the actual causes behind the breakouts rather than only the end result (the breakout itself).<br /><br />The packaging for this product gets its own star. A full set of directions, possible side effects, and ingredient list - all printed in multiple languages - is included in folded pamphlet form along with the product, so no more hanging on to the box 'just in case.'  You also get a little flag shaped card with a positive message printed on it is included. Tacky glued underneath is an information card underneath that says what the product is for, how to use it, what to expect, possible side effects, and a coupon code for either a percentage off or a free product if you decide to purchase directly from their main website.  Additionally, a sample packet of another of Higher Education's products is included for you to try.  You can tell that a lot of thought went into making the purchase and use of this product a pleasant experience.",236935,1004
4.0,1569851394778,Great set of gentle clippers,"This is an excellent set of clippers for more than just younger children. My nephew is on the spectrum and has trouble with various sensations and noise, so haircuts have always been an exercise in patience.<br /><br />Unlike other hair clippers, the sound level with these is lower and less irritating to him. The ceramic blades and guides are also more gentle on skin. He's been nicked before by barbers and stylists, and that has only added to this apprehension of getting his hair cut. The blades on this set of clippers isn't as sharp as what you'd find in a barbershop (probably because they are ceramic versus steel), so you do have to make a couple more passes to cut hair and to get a close shave on the neck, but that's okay because he doesn't fear being cut by these clippers.  The blade covers are also smoother without any edges from the plastic molds or those sharp little nodes from where plastic was injected into the molds or where the guides were snapped apart. It's almost as if they went through a sanding process. It's a little thing, but then again it's not, you know?<br /><br />Battery life is pretty good as well. One full charge is more than enough to get through a haircut even if the person has thick hair.",236935,2519
3.0,1564352311635,Nice but could be made better,"This roller does indeed turn applying skin care products into a spa experience. Pop this baby in the fridge on hot summer days as a way to take your skin from tired to taut. Warm it up to help your skin absorb products more easily. It washes clean and doesn't absorb any of the products. The trouble comes from how it's put together. The metal caps that hold the rollers on each end of the wand/handle come off too easily. They aren't glued or crimped on, nor are the little metal caps snug fitting. Both ends where off when my roller arrived so I actually thought I had to assemble everything prior to each use. If I hold the roller up to where it's straight up and down, the roller that is facing the floor slides right off the handle. In a way this isn't a completely horrible thing since being able to disassemble the roller works better for travel.  Just please be careful when opening your storage bag and pulling out the roller in case yours is the same way. If it were to fall onto a hard enough surface from a high enough height, the rollers could crack or shatter.<br /><br />Aside from the poor craftsmanship, I do enjoy using this roller and not only for applying skincare products. Sticking the roller in the freezer for 20 minutes then using it on my face and neck when I am suffering from a migraine is a godsend. I recommend having two so that you can use one to battle your headache while the other one cools down. The rollers hold cold (or heat) for several minutes, and can be wonderful tools to help relieve pain from stuffed up sinuses as well as headaches. The little gua sha tool that is included is also wonderful for more than applying skin care products. Chilling the gua sha before use can help treat puffy eyes, headaches, small bruises, mosquito bites, foot massages, and so on. Both this and the roller are completely smooth  - no rough edges or bumps.<br /><br />Also included are a black velvet bag for storage, a handy booklet showing how to use both the roller and gua sha, and a hand written note thanking me for my purchase which is a really sweet gesture. All-in-all the tools are nice products, but for the price you'd think the manufacturers could afford glue to keep the rollers on the handle.",236935,19

I will continue using this for myself but I am worried about using it on the baby.

5.0,1596069423900,Beginner friendly application,"I am terrible at doing lashes but I really like having nice lashes, now during pandemic lash salon is out of the question. Before trying these I tried lashes with glue and that was a disaster. Then ai tried magnetic ones and that was a good experience. When these came up for the review I honestly didn’t understand how different it is then a glue? Well, it’s the application process that’s different. With glue you have to squeeze it out and make sure not to put  too much, then you have to make sure to place the lash correctly on the first attempt or you might have glue on your eye lid. This liner serves as a glue! It’s just like regular liner, has that sharpie tip and works like a pen. You draw your line over the eye lid and then place the lashes and they will stick to it perfectly. If you need to reposition the lash there is no mees and glue residue, you just pull and place it back accordingly. I only wish these would be more natural style but for the ladies that like their lashes little more dramatic this is perfect choice.",236960,5645

5.0,1565154435271,"Nice unit, dries evenly","I like this lamp. It cures evenly and it’s base is large enough to take hand or foot without the danger of damaging polish while putting it in. It came with the fingerless glove for hand protection and I thought that was pretty neat. It’s supposed to protect the skin from tanning. I never had a glove before. It also came with the 2 nail files. It’s a smart lamp, when the temperature gets high, it will turn to low-power mode to protect the hand, light kinda dims. When temperature gets down, the lamp goes back to normal work mode. When you out your hand in it automatically goes for 120sec, other presets are 39/60/90  sec. Instruction manual is pretty good.<br />Overall it’s a good lamp and I recommend. Bonus for small details as nail file and the glove.",236960,3585

The extra soft is more like a soft.  Not near as firm as some replacements heads I've tried though.  That's good.  I think they slide onto the motor easier than the originals.

3.0,1562263484540,Not for me,"I'v tried several types of products to remove facial hair: coil groomer, tweezers, electric face trimmer, and these. The coil groomer was the most difficult to use. No matter how much I twisted it, I could only get a hair or two after a few tries. Tweezing was faster and more effective. The electric face trimmer was designed for removing all facial hair, including nose and ear hair, so the cutting tip was very small and the cutting mechanism was gentle on delicate skin. It was great at removing the peach fuzz on my cheeks; I just needed to make several swipes to get my whole cheek.<br /><br />These shavers are well made. Unfortunately, the instructions were all written in either Japanese or Chinese. I figured they looked self explanatory, so I didn't look up videos on how to use them. The cutting tip is long, which should make shaving go faster as it can cover a larger area. However, the larger blade also means that it is more difficult to reach certain areas. I have a lot of small moles on my face, so I made sure to be extra careful while using them. Despite this, I managed to nick myself a few times. What's ironic is that the nicks weren't on any moles.<br /><br />I think my skin is just too delicate and uneven to use these shavers.",236980,750

It's easy to use, just depress the button on the back to dispense serum and apply to lash line. I like that it's not a brush applicator like the others I've tried as they are harder to apply for me. The applicator is more of a soft tube that's easy to swipe along. I love that this is drug free and eye color safe so I don't feel like I'm doing any harm to my eyes when I use this.

The price seems pretty comparable to other products out there and it’s definitely worth the try if I had shorter hair maybe it would last longer I’m not sure.

It blends average, and doesn't stay put for the whole day. I had creases in my lids before 2pm. Maybe primer will help, maybe not.

This cleanser is easy to use and leaves the skin feeling smooth and refreshed.,237068,25061
3.0,1616305312759,Decent product but has some issues,"I have tried many brands of dry shampoo, most I have liked.  This product was an adventure. First off, it is literally dry, not in an aerosol type of container.  You screw open the top (like and elmers glue bottle) and shake onto your head. Well. The little safety piece of cardboard was not attached to the bottle but stuck in the lid.  I did not know this until I tried to use it to no avail. And when you open the bottle be prepared for stuff to fly out. When I did get to the point I could use it, it turned out to be so light colored and obvious on my head I had to work it well into my hair, brush and shake my head so it was not such a glaring product. I will admit it did a great job in ""thickening"" my very fine hair, but it really needs to come in colors; blonde, brunette, etc. so it is not so obvious.  Will I buy it again? Probably not, but it will go into my travel bag for emergency use if I have the time to shake, rattle and roll my head.",237068,711
5.0,1609109016125,Great multi use bottles,"Love these!  I had purchased individual bottles of hand sanitizer long before Covid-19 became an issue, at a pretty dear price per ounce. When the sanitizers became scarce I actually made my own using aloe vera, alcohol and orange oil.  It turned out ok, but I lacked small bottles to divide it up.  I eventually found some 2 oz bottles, but they did not have these great carabiners to hook onto purses, backpacks, belts, etc.  These bottle are really well made, with a good thickness to them and easily loaded.  The sanitizer I have hooked to my purse now is actually in a little rubber ""holster"". I am constantly snagging it on things that make the bottle fall out. This product will take care of that problem, hands down. These would also be great for hiking/camping. Perfect size for hand soap, shampoo, etc, that can be hooked to a backpack and not weigh down the user.",237068,245

4.0,1596346699304,Works great for quick clean ups,"These wipes are great for a quick wash up. Each individually wrapped sheet is about the size of a piece of standard copy paper. They hold up well through the whole wash. I personally don't care for the scent. I felt like I'd rubbed down with a pine tree car freshener, but that's just me. Words of caution.  It says good from nose to toes. It tastes nasty though, so beware when using it near your mouth. Ugh. I'll be keeping mine in my vehicle for unexpected spills and a messy four year old. This would be a great product for hikers with no access to water and a need to freshen up.",237068,2516
3.0,1596055664811,"Love the curler, meh on the mascara","I double applied the mascara just to see a difference. There wasn't much between my natural lashes and the made up ones. I found that my lashes also clumped together. As far as waterproof? In this dismal time of masks I found that i sweat like crazy with it on. My regular mascara is not water proof and inevitability ended up on my upper cheeks. So I had high hopes for this. The odd thing kid I didn't see any mascara running down my face, but at the end if the day I had very little mascara left on my lashes. Hmm. So thus is my take. If you want a really nice lash curler, this would be a good choice. It comes with three additional pads for future use. The handle is held shut by a removable plastic piece. Why, I'm not sure. For packaging? At any rate it works very well. The mascara? I think of it as emergency makeup.",237068,889

3.0,1670449240968,Not Sure What to Think,"Around 6 months ago, we adopted our first goldendoodle. I had heard that their fur was higher maintenance so I researched what we would need to best take care of him. I ended up ordering a big slicker style brush and this one. When we first got him, his fur was badly matted and he wasn't used to being brushed at all. We slowly got him used to being brushed and now we regularly use the slicker brush on him. This brush however, really pulls at his fur. I might have been tempted to think that it was just not the right brush for his fur, but on a recent attempt to trim his fur myself (rather than take him to the groomers) I found that I really needed this brush to get his curls combed out enough for the clippers to easily get through. It is incredibly slow going to even get through a small patch of his fur using this, let alone his entire body (he's medium/large). I'm thinking that we may just need to stick to the professional groomer for most haircuts and I'll just stick to the in-between appointment trims. So maybe it's me or maybe it's this comb or? The other issue I have with this comb is that the actual comb part comes apart from the wood handle. It's not ideal, but it does go back together and it's able to be used, so...?",237099,190
5.0,1655491844968,Perfect for Young Ladies,"This is a super cute set. The colors are cute and great colors to have. The gloss itself goes on easily, has good flavor, and feels good on. I (and my daughter) haven't had any issues with reactions or anything like that. I would say this set is definitely geared more toward girls than for adults (though you could totally wear it if you just want a gloss on for an hour as a woman.) It's not long lasting, but my daughter doesn't really care about that.",237099,2233
4.0,1622656118760,Works Well For Burns,"My mom always had an aloe plant growing up that we used on our sunburns. I still think that's the best way to go, but I also kill every aloe plant I have so this is a pretty good 2nd. It feels very similar to the aloe straight out of the aloe plant although it is stickier. It works well on burns. The nozzle works great and the bottle itself feels pretty well made, so no leaks or issues there. I like the pump aspect of the top. Nice to have hand.",237099,301
2.0,1602177711871,"Spray Nozzles Leak, Glass Is Durable","We are the home where spray bottles go to die. My oldest 3 (10,8, and 6) help with cleaning around the house and they do their fair share of abuse to spray bottles. My 4 yr old likes to hide the spray bottles. This means that I (frequently) buy new spray bottles and have tried quite a few.<br />  These are the first glass spray bottles that I've tried. I've always been leary of glass because I was afraid it would break, but hey, with all the plastic ones we've managed to destroy I figured it was worth a shot. The glass part on these is super heavy. And surprisingly durable. These have lasted quite awhile now and that includes being dropped on laminate and tile floors. I'm impressed. The blue color is pretty striking too.<br />  Now for the bad. The nozzles leak terribly. When you spray them they drip all over your hand and make a mess. We've just kind of dealt with it because we use natural cleaner and I'm not worried about the chemicals, but obviously you don't want to buy something that works like it's already damaged. Maybe a different spray nozzle will fit the tops of these bottles?",237099,1815

They hate getting hair all over them (and since there are 4 of them and I don't plan on stopping the home haircuts anytime soon) I thought it would be worth ordering a cape. I got an adult cape because my 10 yr old is almost as big as me and I know my other boys won't be far behind. This cape is terrible! Hair gets down the top of it and they're just as itchy as if they weren't wearing anything.

However, if you have a toddler and you know they want to do EXACTLY everything they SEE you do! So, I ordered this for my little one to have her own ""perfume"" to use! It is always used in a controlled fashion, and it is not used often. But when she sees mommy using her perfume, its right there so my little miss can use hers! She thinks it is wonderful.

I typically struggle to get a nice thin line and with this liner, it goes on pretty easy. 4 Stars. Hope you find this review and pictures helpful. It stayed on all day without smudging.

Apply the eyeliner - let it set a minute, then put on the lashes. The kit contains a pair of tweezers for application! It is a bit harder to remove the eyeliner; but if you use a good make-up remover, you will be okay. My lashes stayed on all day and night. They stayed in place until I removed them!

Well, I figured I could do the same at home! It is much different than using standard nail polish and remover but you have to put the remover on and wait - the clips seem to really help to keep the Pads with the remover on your fingers.

The thing was very smelly - not quite sure what the smell was but I did not like it!

You only need to use a small amount of the face wash for your whole face and it lathers up really well. My only issue is, it is 5 ounces, so for the price it is a little bit more expensive and although you will not use very much it probably still will not last very long especially if you are washing your face twice a day. The scent is nice and light, not overpowering.",245183,2913

Y’all, I’m a busy mom with a toddler, I do not have the time to disinfect something for almost an hour each time I use it, and by use it, I mean roll it 4-5 times total. So while the jade roller is really beautiful and easy to use in of itself, this derma roller kinda seems...extra. I personally would prefer this to just be the roller; I’m too worried about actually using the roller incorrectly and hurting my skin, so I’ll just leave that type of work to the professionals. If you are looking for a jade roller only, there are lots of other options. If you want the full derma experience, then this option would be great for you.",258941,756

When I first put it on, I was surprised by the warming sensation, since I didn’t realize it had that effect. I liked it! I’ve had masks like that before and they just add another dimension to the experience. I left it on for 10 minutes and washed it right off. Some clay masks I’ve used are hard to wash off - not this one. Face felt smooth and had no irritation afterward. I really like this brand.",258941,1004

Typically I look for a happy medium of thoroughly cleaning my scalp without it being too harsh. While I was using this shampoo, I used a moisturizing conditioner to balance out the stripping nature. The scent has notes of coconut and other tropical ingredients, though it wasn't too overpowering. With a price of $17.99 when I am reviewing this shampoo, I find it to be a little too pricey for 250 ml. I expected more from the shampoo at this price point, but it still isn't terrible.

With many eye patches I've tried sight unseen, I really wasn't sure how these would turn out, but I am overall very pleased with their performance. With ingredients like hyaluronic acid and vitamin-rich algae, they left my under eyes nicely moisturized, brightened, and plumped as though I hadn't stared at a screen for eight hours today.<br /><br />Overall I very much enjoy this eye mask, and it feels that it really does work well in moisturizing the under eyes and with a price of $24.95 for 30 eye patches, it a great deal for now, though I have seen the eye patches at a higher price in the past.",262433,77
4.0,1614452034470,High Quality Masks that Don't Irritate the Skin,"Overall the Karuna 7 Days of Glow mask set has some good masks that do as they say without irritation. While I don't use face masks every day, it has taken me a while to use just a few of them, and specific masks, like the hydration mask, aren't best suited for my face type. Out of the whole set, my favorite masks have been the brightening and antioxidant masks. While I was slightly hesitant to use the antioxidant mask at first due to my oily combo skin, it left me with no clogged pores or irritation, and it brightened and soothed my skin.<br /><br />As I mentioned initially, I don't use face masks too often, and the masks I usually use are pretty cheap. Trying these masks has ruined me a little because it will be hard to go back to my regular masks. The one thing I don't like about these masks is the price. I think $42 is a little bit much for seven face masks, but it depends on how often you use face masks and how much of a splurge you want them to be. in terms of quality, I think the Karuna masks are great.",262433,979
5.0,1612285629099,Great Value Cleansing Balm for any Skin Type,"The Mizon Cicaluronic Cleansing Balm is a nicely hydrating balm that works well as a first cleanse in a skincare routine. With a price coming in around $17, it's hard to beat its value and quality. With an opaque light blue appearance in the container, it immediately turns into oil after rubbing it in your hands. This balm's scent reminds me of a beach scented candle, and I haven't noticed any irritation to the skin using this product. With calming and hydrating ingredients like Hyaluronic acid and Centella Asiatica, it plumps the skin and prepares it for the next step of your routine.<br /><br />While I wouldn't recommend using this cleansing balm alone, it effortlessly removes any product or makeup on your skin throughout the day. With other cleansing balms for double or triple the price that perform similarly, I highly recommend trying out this cleansing balm in your routine. Even if you don't like the balm, you won't feel nearly as bad compared to buying a more expensive balm.",262433,725

Using the mask twice, I am really impressed by the effectiveness of this mask in terms of the smile lines and under-eye concentration masks. I genuinely can see a difference in my under eyes and the tightness of my face when I use this mask. Having tried another one of the 2-step masks, I do prefer the other mask set with the AHA acid peel for my younger skin. This mask, I think, would be a good option for those who have more mature skin, or who naturally have darker undereye areas. I found it really did brighten my under eyes.

I scrape the side of the stick that I'm not using on the edge of the pot to conserve my wax and the round shape makes it tip if I do this too hard.  It only comes with the warmer and the removable pot.  To not come with any more than that i feel like $50 is kind of steep.  (At the time of writing this $39.99 which is more reasonable.

3.0,1665118116641,Good sensation but not worth the time or money,"[[VIDEOID:cf747606acf9b5900867c48bd6720d4]] This under eye massager comes in a conveniently small package that can be easily stored. It comes with three massage settings. The first is the red light which warms the massage stone and provides a pulsating massage. The second is the blue light which cools the massage stone and provides a pulsating massage. The Third leaves the stone at room temperature with no light indicator, and provides a constant massage vibration. Hall of the massage settings feel nice on your under eye area, but I didn’t find that they helped in absorption of my under eye creams, nor did they help with  any under eye discoloration or puffiness. So though the massage tool felt nice on my under eye area, I didn’t find any effectiveness that would necessitate use of this on a regular basis.",280461,2848

On top of my normal skin care routine, this change in seasonal skin needs causes me to need to add another hydration stop to the process. This mask is fun to look at with the colored hydration beads in the clear Gel. I tried this mask last week after derma planing and woke up with the softest, silkiest and most smooth skin ever. This sequence of steps is going to become a part of my weekly skin care maintenance. I don’t know that the mask does a ton. But I do know that it left my skin feeling hydrated and soft, more so than when I just use my normal nighttime skin routine and moisturizer.",280461,2001
5.0,1661103735141,Perfect shower comb for traveling,"Using a wide tooth comb to distribute product through your hair when you were in the shower, particularly when you are conditioning your hair, is very important. The wide tooth comb allows you to pull through and detangler your hair without causing unneeded damage or breakage. This particular comb is long enough to stable hold in your hand and comes in a convenient and stylish travel pouch which keeps any other products that you throw in your toiletry bag that may have wrist straps or other thin straps are chords from getting tangled in the comb. No I am not doing much traveling right now, this comb has found a home in my shower with the rest of my shower products",280461,2232
5.0,1658080960428,Detangling without the hair loss,"The best time to detangle your hair is when you are allowing your conditioner to soak in and sit on your hair while in the shower. That being said, it is difficult and dangerous when it comes to hair loss to try to brush through or comb through your hair when it is wet. This wide tooth comb allows you to easily work from the ends up to the route with short brushstrokes to de-tangle your hair while eliminating, or at least reducing dramatically, any hair loss. Normal brushes will pull hair out or break hair off while trying to do this with wet hair. This brush comb works like the wet brushes by utilizing wide and widely separated teeth to separate the hairs in the tangles. I have found the using a wide tooth comb similar to this, and now using this, removing tangles is easy with the added bonus of helping to pull the conditioner through my hair more evenly, allowing the product to more effectively reach all of my hair for added softness and prevention of tangles going forward. I love my new comb and know that you will love it too!",280461,41235
5.0,1658080582009,Perfect sectioning for styling,"Styling your hair when it comes to curling or straightening it can sometimes be difficult as the thicker your hair is, the less effective a hot tool can be. That being said, it’s important that you suction off your hair in order to get the most effective results from using your hot tools. This also comes into play when you are trimming or cutting hair, as you cannot cut the entire thickness of a section with one pass. It is important that you suction off your hair into thinner bundles so that a hot tool or your hair shears are most effective in trimming or curling or straightening your hair. These suctioning clips are incredibly effective for two reasons. First, the bottom portion of the clip has a somewhat pointed, though rounded, edge to help divide the hair into sections. Second, the top portion of the lab has a padded layer that helps to grab onto and hold the suction of hair in place. With the Number of clips in this package, you have more than enough to work with in order to section of all areas of your hair for curling, straightening, or trimming. I absolutely love these clips already and am incredibly excited that they have helped to cut down the styling time it takes to straighten or curl my hair. If you are a person that regularly use is hot tools on your hair, I would absolutely recommend these to help in your styling as well!",280461,15521
3.0,1607998115635,Better for a lash serum than brows ... but it’s workable,"This eyebrow serum came beautifully packaged beyond anything I expected. The packaging and presentation gave the immediate feel of an expensive and regal product. The actual tube and brush of the serum also are impeccable with regard to presentation. The serum itself is very basic and lacking a little in desired thickness. Using a simple thin brush like the one that is provided makes for a bit of a challenge in applying such a watery textured liquid to your brow. A spoolie type brush would have made application on your brows much easier. Having said that, the brush that is provided is perfect for application of the serum to your eyelashes which, like brows, respond to the same formulas to encourage retention of existing lashes and brows and promote growth of new ones. I have been using this product nightly for nearly two months now and definitely see a bit of noticeable growth in my lashes and some growth, though not as noticeable, in my brows. Part of that could be due to the slow rate of growth of eyebrows and part could be due to the uneven application on my eyebrows with the small liner like application brush. I will continue to use the product until it is finished but will definitely be looking for a serum with a spoolie style applicator for my next brow growth serum.",280461,18081
5.0,1600453363489,Perfect lashes for a beginner or pro!,"This set of lashes comes with five pairs in different styles, a set of tweezers and a liquid eyeliner that also acts as glue. The styles vary from casual day to day wear to dramatic showstoppers. The lashes are synthetic fibers with a medium band that is sturdy and with proper care can be used easily 20 or more times. They are soft and comfortable to wear with a secure hold for all day wear. With the liner functioning as a glue, you eliminate the need for an extra step and instead of putting glue on the lash band, you put it on as you would a normal liner making application incredibly easy, even for a beginner. I love these lashes!!!",280461,5645

5.0,1623217001223,Perfect for Exfoliating for Men!,"The face scrub by disco is the 2nd step product in their men’s facial care lineup. It’s to be used 1-2x weekly and after you use their facial cleansing stick. While the cleanser cleans your face, the scrub exfoliates and removes dead skin and gunk out of your face, leaving you with a refreshing and hydrated feeling. I personally use it once a week after cleansing followed by the face mask that disco provides. I put a smudge on both sides of my cheeks and my forehead and slowly but gently rub it in. This particular product hurts a bit if you rub it in hard in my experience so I go nice and easy on my face while rubbing it in to stop any irritation from occurring. After about 30 seconds I rinse my face off with water and dry it with a dry and clean towel. The product works great in removing gunk from your face and will leave you feeling nice and fresh!",288944,2909
5.0,1623216599234,Works Great!,This Is the first product out of 5 in disco’s men’s facial care lineup. It is essentially a circular deodorant stick for your face. Just rub it on until your face is covered then wet your hands and massage the product into your face which will foam up. I usually like to massage the cleanser into my face for about 20-30 seconds before rinsing my face. My face feels nice and clean after using this. Because the 2nd and 3rd products are used 1-2x a week I usually go for the cleanser followed by the moisturizing product disco also makes once every night after a shower and it works great!,288944,2910

The bottle is medium sized and isn't too big so if you want to travel it would fit just fine in your luggage. The scent really gives me fruity notes. The closest thing I could compare it to is a strawberry pineapple combination, it smells really good! It feels great on your scalp as well, like it's cleaning better than it's competitors! I think it's definitely worth a buy if you're in the market for a new and pleasant smelling shampoo that cleans your hair and scalp well! My hair is really soft after using it!",288944,2279

5.0,1610158498642,Nice replacement to our old scissors!,"My wife cuts my hair, and for years we used a cheap pair of scissors that looked like it was made before I was born. We upgraded to this kit, and tossed the old pair of scissors in the trash. The standard shears cut great and do not pull my hair. In addition, the thinning shears work just like the pro's thinning shears. The gown comes in handy as well. We have no use for the clips, so I can't comment on how they work. I really like that this includes a pouch that can be zipped up, as it contains the supplies as well as rough clippings. This is a sold buy for the price!",300889,2311
5.0,1594661461389,Thin and functional. Batman would be jealous.,"This cape works equally as well as a hair cutting cape as it does as a costume! I (jokingly) ran across the house with this as a cape when it arrived, and my son immediately commandeered it as his own.<br /><br />In all seriousness, this works quite well as a hair cutting cape and keeps the clippings from landing all over you when you are getting your hair cut. My wife typically cuts my hair wet, and I did notice a bit of moisture coming through this, but not enough to bother me. If you are looking for a salon caliber cape, plan on spending twice as much. At this price, this works great for my needs.",300889,783
5.0,1581796729030,Leaves my skin feeling so clean and soft.,"This is my first time using a charcoal scrub and I am hooked. Aside from tasting like a mouthful of dirt mixed with ocean water if you accidentally get it in your mouth, this scrub is amazing. My skin has never felt so clean and smooth. I really love the fact that this is a natural product without harsh chemicals. I use this scrub on my face, neck and chest (all the places the sun hits me most frequently) about twice a week. I have been using it for a few months now and I can absolutely see and feel the difference. I am in my late 30s and my skin has definitely dulled since my 20s. This product helps the new, radiant skin underneath shine through. I have less issues with dryness since using this. I don't use nearly as much facial moisturizer. I can actually see the blackheads on my nose now that the dead layer of skin is exfoliated away and am able to remove them with a simple blackhead tool. I use a fairly liberal amount to cover all of the aforementioned areas each time I scrub and I am still on my first jar (again using 2x weekly). I love this product and will definitely be ordering more.",300889,5389
5.0,1539483950831,Good zippers with great storage options,"I don’t know why, but I pictured this as being sturdier than it is. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not flimsy, but it doesn’t have a shape; it is just fabric. Now that I’ve used it, I actually like that it can be shaped to fit whatever profile you need it to. I just expected something with a bit of shape to it. As a guy who travels light, this is larger than I need.<br /><br />There are plenty of storage compartments to this toiletry bag, and I’ve found the hook to be very useful. The zippers work well, and the material has held up very well. I travel frequently for work, and this toiletry bag has not let me down.",300889,261
4.0,1624320525636,Nice; but not outstanding,"Nice, refreshing.  Mask had a pleasant scent and fit well.  Skin felt nice and was not irritated after removal but I did need to add extra moisturizer because my skin is so dry.  No lasting results so while nice, this is a pass for me.",300892,980
4.0,1624320369577,Beautifully wrapped; nice scent; absorbs quickly!,The four tubes arrived individually packed in cute boxes that looked like wrapped presents.  The hand cream absorbs nicely and leaves hand moisturized without a greasy feeling.  The aloe scent is appealing- light and fresh.  The only thing I don't like is that it feels like it leaves a film on the skin(maybe the mineral oil?)- so I prefer to use it on my hands where it doesn't bother me as much,300892,211
4.0,1616204052662,Immediate hydration!,"Immediately hydrates and diminishes my fine lines.  Still need a moisturizer during the dry winter, but will probably be able to use on it's own come spring.  Over all I really like it, but would like it even more if there was no mica or parfum.",300892,728
4.0,1611799447328,Variety pack with great packaging!,"Great packaging.  I really like how they give you an idea to use each mask.  Not the best for my sensitive skin though...  I totally missed that 3 out of the 4 masks have a warning ""Not suitable for Sensitive Skin"" on the packaging so pay attention!.  You get: Clarifying+ Face Mask, Brightening+ Face Mask, Exfoliating+ Face Mask and Hydrating.  Even the hydrating was a bit much for my sensitive skin.  The Exfoliating... well I really enjoyed the hydrating!",300892,979
5.0,1608000680382,Excellent hydration and fantastic deal!,"You get a full size serum, mini face wash, and mini moisturizer for the price of the serum.  Beautiful presentation makes an excellent gift. Love this set!  I started using these products when my skin was breaking out and upset.  These have completely calmed and fully moisturized my skin.  My skin is now glowing!",300892,311
4.0,1577648869902,Good but application needs work,"It's a good product, not a great one for a primer.  Nothing overly wrong but I've used better.  This one's major flaw is that the spray is hard to keep out of my hair which causes issues on that side of the beauty regime.",300892,2210
4.0,1563329460484,Good generic brush heads,"These are a solid generic replacement for our Oral-B brush heads.  They fit every toothbrush in the house without issue and work well.  They are a bit more angular than the name brand and I can tell, but my wife and kids didn't notice.  My kids love the smiley face on the back of the brush head.  A solid generic replacement.",300892,2915
4.0,1666153692376,"Fun to put on, not to get off","I tried one of these on with the intention of washing it off shortly after. It was easy to apply, and looked awesome, but I had to scrub my skin raw to get it off. These definitely stay put, so plan to have it on for a while.",300914,16281
5.0,1658099595125,Great blow drying brush,"This brush is definitely on the higher price side, but it is worth it. It is lightweight and makes drying my hair so much easier. It's very easy to hold on to and rotate while also holding on to the hair dryer. Once my hair is dry it feels so soft and bouncy. This is a very nice brush, and worth the extra $$.",300914,788
5.0,1654120043150,Great for Barbies,"I know this comb is meant for pets, but I actually ordered it for my daughter’s Barbie’s. The metal teeth are very strong and do a great job of getting out all of the knots. I am sure it works great for pets too!",300914,190
5.0,1651452185683,Fun Color,"The color of this wig is super fun. The hair is soft and brushes easily. It did have a little bit of shedding, but nothing too bothersome. Overall a very fun colored wig!",300914,35849
2.0,1648920296172,Very small,"I don't have a very large head, but these headbands wouldn't even stretch to fit on my head. They do however fit my 3 year old perfectly. The material is soft and very plush, and the colors are great, I just wish they fit my head....",300914,2212
5.0,1647217908556,Easy for kids to apply,"These were easy enough for my 3 year old to apply herself, which was nice. They managed to stay on her for quite a few days even with a bath so they definitely have some staying power. Very cute designs, my daughter was very pleased!",300914,4167
5.0,1645591706211,Kids love them,"My kids love these cute tattoos. There are so many in the pack and a really good assortment of designs. My kids can apply them themselves which is nice. They lasted quite a while on their skin, so I would say they are fairly durable.",300914,1677
5.0,1670202502722,Very moisterizing,This is very nice cream. It moisturizes well. It has a light scent but not too much. I use it at night before bed and it works well. overall happy with this.,300976,2003
5.0,1665805561641,Nice cream,I have been using this every night. It moisturizes well. Leaves my face a little shiny so I only use it before bed. The jar is small and hasn't lasted very long. But I have enjoyed it.,300976,2895
4.0,1648932103608,Works on some hair,"I have some baby hairs, some frizzy hairs and some wiry colored white hair that pokes out of my pony tail and blows up in the wind. This is definitely not for the frizzy or thick hairs. It did basically nothing on those. I used it on my very fine baby hairs and around my face and it smoothed the hairs down well and looked a lot more polished. I could have probably achieved the same result with hairspray. I assume this is for a quick fix and to carry in your purse. It only works on fine hair and not a great fit for me.",300976,14024
5.0,1605808065522,Silky smooth with a light smell,"This feels really nice. I have been using it on my face and neck each day. It has a nice, light smell. I really enjoy it.",300976,312
5.0,1659467248508,"Love these sectioning clips when curling my hair, enough in the pack for me and my daughter!",I love lange products and these clips are no exception. I use them when styling my hair and they work well to keep sections secured while curling or straightening hair.,301023,15521
5.0,1632742082122,Great for my daughter with eczema!,"My youngest daughter has Eczema and struggles with  dry itchy skin. This lotion worked well at keeping her skin hydrated, without causing any irritation. We have also ordered the Gryph & IvyRose Shampoo & Conditioner and it works well for her also. Love this brand!!",301023,2218
5.0,1628510110691,Great for my teen daughters Bacne!,"My teen daughter has hormonal acne all over her back, chest and shoulders. This spray is perfect as she can apply it herself daily after showering. It has improved the clarity of her skin and reduced redness as well without over drying her skin.",301023,45532
5.0,1627990558887,Works great as only a mascara or along with the fiber that is included!,"This mascara makes my lashes look voluminous without clumping and is easy to wash off, but also provides great waterproof coverage. It is easy to apply and looks beautiful, I like to use the fiber when I'm really wanting fuller voluminous lashes like for date night or a special occasion.",301023,5386
5.0,1623670806746,Great quality purple shampoo & conditioner for my daughter's naturally blonde hair with highlights!,My daughter has a natural dirty blonde hair color with some blonde balayage mixed in and this purple shampoo and conditioner really helps to keep her blonde from appearing brassy/yellow. Great for twice a week use and maintenance of her color. Love that it is sulfate free and these bottles are large enough that they will last her quite some time.,301023,2929
5.0,1619610478351,Worked great with my other gel base and top coats!,I love these spring colors in this assortment of gel polishes! They are super pretty shades and these worked well with my other gel base and top coats. It cured perfectly and has lasted well without chipping/peeling.,301023,832
4.0,1614775081089,"Worked well, but finish is a little different than your normal polish!","Overall this kit worked well, but I will say use the directions shown here online and not the ones on the back of the packaging that this kit comes in. On the instructions posted here it goes over which steps need to be repeated and give more detail.<br /><br />This stuff is super strong once it is on and my daughter still hasn't been able to remove all of it completely. We are going to have to look up the best removal method for dip powder, but the top coat does dry quickly and is very smooth and shiny.<br /><br />Looking at the polish you can almost see the granulated powders. It still leaves a pretty finish, but the glitter appears to be more professional looking since you cannot really see that it is a powder underneath the top coat.",301023,961
5.0,1612872651163,Beautiful Amber Glass Spray Bottles!,"I have been slowly switching my cleaning products over to more environmentally friendly and wanted to start investing in glass spray bottles and soap dispensers as well. These are just beautiful, the perfect size and came packaged very well to keep the glass from breaking in transit.<br /><br />These are just as esthetically pleasing as they are practical and I will be purchasing more in the future. I loved the personal touch of the note inside from the seller as I always love to support small businesses. These spray bottles are great if you are in the market do not hesitate to purchase them.",301023,234
5.0,1611838615823,"Great gel polish, perfect shimmer colors to go over a base color coat!",These gel polish shimmer colors are beautiful and perfect on their own with two coats or over top of a base color coat. They cure easily with a UV light and are chip resistant for almost 2 weeks.<br /><br />Very durable polish and great selection of colors in this set!,301023,3370
5.0,1610639660450,Great for exfoliating the skin!,"I love these silicone face scrubbers, they exfoliate the skin so well and are easy to clean. Just place a dab of your favorite facial cleanser on the scrubber and go to work. It helps with creating a rich lather and exfoliating all of the skin.",301023,1243
5.0,1610639563215,"Great bobby pins, Love that you can get them in the gray color!",Good quality bobby pins that hold really well. I haven't seen the gray color in stores so it was really nice that you could order this color on Amazon.,301023,16346
5.0,1605875008718,Great stocking stuffer!,"I got this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter, I will update the review once she uses it if we see any irritation or issues with it. She loves these mask so I'm always trying to find some different ones we haven't tried before.",301023,25561
5.0,1604070918472,"Good quality gel polish, but wish it included the base and top coat!","I should have read the description on this set better, before ordering as they do not come with a base or top coat which is necessary to get the best longevity out of gel polish.<br /><br />However I did order the base and top coat from this same brand on Amazon and it works really well. I love the colors in this set and it seems to last about 12-14 days as long as you prep your nails like you should for gel polish.<br /><br />The color swatch stickers are also nice so you can paint them cure them and apply them to the tops of the bottles and you know which color is which without opening each bottle!",301023,10017
4.0,1663421769430,Does the job,"I did like this product overall, though it just felt a bit lacking in terms of exfoliating as other chemical exfoliants I have used and tried. I’d does work though and I actually really like the smell, it wasn’t overpowering at all.",301028,2005
5.0,1661753121939,I noticed a difference,"I’ve used this warm eye mask for over a week and it has made a difference on dry eyes. I use it  before I go to sleep. it doesn’t get too hot you can set heat as you prefer and it feels so good. With automatic shut off I don’t have to worry about falling asleep with it on and burning my eyes. I’m shocked I noticed an actual difference with my dry eyes after using this, I was expecting it to be a gimmick product.",301028,8262
4.0,1660920337491,Works,"This remover definitely works. This one definitely left my finger feeling that heaviness as others have described, something I haven't experienced with other removers like this. It does go away fast, but I'm not quite sure what to make of this. It does work fast and worked with a variety of my gel polish brands.",301028,24245
3.0,1660285685449,Love the applicator,"The color is beautifully pigmented and actually maintains a metallic look on the lips. I only needed to do one coat. I will say the longevity isn't that great. It lasted about an hour of me just talking and started settling in the lines and cracks of my lips, so it required constant reapplication. Stunning color, but a bit of a hassle. I love the applicator though.",301028,2133
3.0,1654754631828,Good for wigs. The mister is the best part.,"I originally ordered this with he hopes of using this for my own thick hair, but didn't get much mileage from the brushes. The comb was good for detangling before and during my hair wash routine, but the brushes were too pliable for me to get a decent use out of them, I was just getting frustrated. Even after applying product, I was unimpressed. However, I have been using them as wig brushes and they work perfectly for finer, thinner hair types. Hands down, the mister is the best product out of the bunch. Have been using it continuously for a while now and it's worked flawlessly.",301028,47748
5.0,1654305311379,"Good, just nothing special","The mascara does a great job. No clumping or flaking. I was able to go in with multiple coats without clumping as as I wore it throughout the day, I didn't notice any flakes on my face. I honestly didn't notice any extra lengthening or volumizing with this product though. It goes on easily though. It is one of the few mascaras that I experienced absolutely no clumping with, so I'll be a return customer just for that alone as clumping is a huge pet peeve of mine. I recommend, just don't expect miracles. It is a great mascara regardless.",301028,2864
5.0,1609122749816,Nicely etched.,"Nicely, and deeply etched. Loved the french prints most. You get a lot of holiday inspired choices. Easy enough to clean. I did buff my stamper to get a better stick. Overall, works well.",301057,9806
3.0,1608506749586,Came smudged with prints,The mirror came with fingerprints and smudges on it. Looked as though it had been shoved into the box. Theres no directions or suggestions for setup in the box. Things were easy to remove and move around to customize. I just wish I hadn't have had to sit and scrub the mirror to get the prints off. They've obviously been there for a while. It prompted me to also sanitized every piece a little extra just in case.,301057,1979
5.0,1606852370527,Pretty and functional,My family really loved these! They're refillable and they hold a lot more sanitizer than I thought. The colors are vibrant and clear. The clip is sturdy and the bottles seem durable. You get a nice variety as well. I like that the caps are faced upwards instead of down like the ones at the store which means no leaking product. Works with (thinner) lotions too!,301057,246
4.0,1606771120721,Sparkles are very nice,"These sparkles work best with the black as a base. The black is pretty opaque. best if used with 2 coats but ok if used with one. The polish itself was easy to spread. However, I noticed a couple of the glitters were a little runnier than the others. The sparkle polish was very vibrant. Havent had a chip all week. Cured fairly well.",301057,16372
5.0,1605826851037,Doesnt hinder curing,"Did their job! Fit the finger well, did not pinch and weren't overly tight. Had just enough squeeze to it to hold the form on so instead of doing one at a time you can do multiple. Had no issues curing through the clip. I also used it to pinch the end of an acrylic nail as well and it worked nicely for the as well.",301057,2196
5.0,1597448899342,Bigger than most but work great,"Have quite a bit of stretch. They didnt slip down the hair and they seem pretty strong. Love the multicolored ones, they were great to add color to different styles.",301057,9813
4.0,1596052253083,Nice except the light.,"I like that it comes in a case. The colors are vibrant. No strong smell. Only thing that disappointed me was the light. I had to do one finger at a time, flip it twice under it's own time in order to get fully dry. The light did not extend to all my fingers without some odd maneuvering.",301057,12349
3.0,1595734677900,Not a true fiber mascara.,I really wanted to like this. Unlike most fiber mascaras this didnt give me much volume or length. And it flaked off after a full day of wear. I really love the packaging. I think this may be ok on fake lashes but not so great on real or short lashes.,301057,1088

It arrived nicely packaged in a mini “duffel-style” bag plus each pack was individually wrapped inside. The ombré is a tad bit off... it doesn’t fade as nicely as I thought it would, but once braided, I doubt you’ll notice! It does have a bit of a smell, but after I aired out the package outside, it went away just fine. Definitely a great value!!!",301058,46198

4.0,1595720124475,Great Value!! Has a bit of a smell,"I am truly surprised at the quality of this hair!!! It arrived nicely packaged in a mini “duffel-style” bag plus each pack was individually wrapped inside. The ombré is a tad bit off... it doesn’t fade as nicely as I thought it would, but once braided, I doubt you’ll notice! It does have a bit of a smell, but after I aired out the package outside, it went away just fine. Definitely a great value!!!",301058,46198
5.0,1640981627016,Beautiful colors!,Comes with base coat and glossy/matte top coats as well as the colors. The colors are really nice and go on smoothly.,301060,30708
3.0,1625874806742,"Great at getting rid of brassiness, not so great at moisturizing","I really wanted to like this set. My initial thoughts on it while applying it in the shower was ""no"" because it provided absolutely no moisturizing qualities to my hair. The conditioner was more like a shampoo and the shampoo was horribly drying! I ended up having to use a seperate extra moisturizing conditioner after I rinsed this out. I was pretty sure this was going to be given away to someone at that point. Then I got out of the shower and styled my hair and it looked really nice and all the brassiness was gone. So now I'm really conflicted. I may end up keeping it with the knowledge that it needs an extra conditioning step but if that becomes annoying these may be given away.",301060,2929
3.0,1610636223423,"Good creams, glitters are sheer","This set is packaged really nicely and includes 20 polishes plus a  base coat and both glossy and matte top coats. The bottles of color are small, super small, only 5ml! And most of the glitters need 3 coats at a minimum so you won't get much use out of those unless you only use them as accent nails. The creams are nice and opaque though, this was a one coater in the pic. I did like that there was a white crelly even though after 3 coats it still wasn't opaque. Ultimately this is an average set. The small size of the bottles and the sheerness of the glitters makes it a 3 star product. There are too many other sets out there that are better to put this one at the top of the list but because of the number of polishes that also includes base/top coats it's still better than others.",301060,23011
5.0,1608949327453,Nice powerful lamp without being too powerful,"I previously purchased a higher watt lamp with the hopes that it would cut down my curing time for doing gels at home. Unfortunately it did not and it also made my nail beds burn so that lamp went in the trash! This lamp doesn't have quite as high of wattage as that other one but is higher than most standard ones. So far it seems to do the trick for me. Cuts down on the time with no burn! Yay! It has a motion activated sensor so it will turn on to the last setting you used when you put your hand (or foot) in, there are several timed settings that countdown (10,30,60 & 99 low heat) or it will count up without selecting one of those to 120 seconds, and the bottom detaches to do pedicures. Very nice light at a great value!",301060,1549
4.0,1608937090209,SMALL but effective,"Ok, I know the photos of the product show the box that says ""mini-curler"" but nothing in the description indicates how MINI it truly is! I've never owned a 3 barrel iron before so I watched a few videos online while I was waiting for this to arrive. It looked easy enough, though I was questioning the size of the ones they used versus the what I ordered. The barrel is 3/4"" so I knew that would make for a tighter curl regardless and I was ok with that. What I didn't think about was the overall size of the whole thing. It's tiny, like really, really small lol I attached a pic of me holding it, it's like a play curling iron for a child lol BUT it does work! I was able to curl through all of my hair in no time at all and it left me feeling like I got a perm in 10 mins (see pic of my hair straight vs curled)! Not something I'm going to want to do on a regular basis. I think I want more of a relaxed wave for that which means a much larger barrel size, but for special occasions when I do want my hair curly this will do the trick nicely.<br />A separate, tiny complaint is the inability to adjust the heat setting. I have very thin hair and I generally don't use very high heat settings on my other curlers/straighteners but this one was either on or off, no adjustment for heat so I had to make sure to not hold my hair in for too long so I wouldn't risk breaking it off. It's not the most ideal situation but it is a fairly easy fix to just err on the side of not long enough rather than too long.",301060,137
5.0,1607712609311,Thermal gel polish-YES!,"I have quite a few regular nail polishes that are thermal and I love the magic of the changing colors. I really enjoy showing people how cool it looks for the polish to change color right before their eyes! Now having the option to do this with long lasting gel polish is super exciting! I swatched these colors and was able to immediately see the color difference after being under the warm lights of the led lamp so the changing is very sensitive, which is really what you want in a thermal polish. The stickers on the tops of the bottles aren't all that color accurate BUT they do give a general idea of what the colors are so you can have an idea of what you have. I did 2 coats for each color and it's a little hard to tell but some were great with 2 coats and others really could have benefited from a third. The glitter polish is really not a pretty color at all, I kind of wish it was either just a different thermal all together or they had chose different colors for it. The blue and reddish colors were the best formulas, seeming more like regular nail polish (not as thick and much smoother application).<br />The set is packaged great for gift giving. If you know anyone who really likes polish this would be great for them, keeping in mind if they don't already work with gel polishes they will need not only some type of lamp but also a base and top coat since this set does not include those.",301060,46335
5.0,1607711960694,Beautiful fall set,"These colors are perfect for the fall season. They come in a really nice gift set package and include a bas and top coat so your giftee will be all ready to go...as long as they already have a lamp ;) The colors on the bottles are very accurate as to what is inside the bottle, which is really good considering a lot of the time color accuracy is the biggest issue. I swatched one color; it was two coats of perfection. The formula is a lot like regular polish rather than gel, meaning it glides on really well and you don't have to manipulate it to get good coverage. The top coat cured in 30 seconds which I was super excited about. Some other brands I have tried recently have needed 120+ seconds to cure which just makes the process way too long for me. Overall I am really happy with this brand and this set. I wish they had more colors to try. Once they do, I'm sure I'll be making another purchase!",301060,1547
5.0,1607711628586,Fun!,"This set does not come with a base or top coat but DOES come with the necessary black polish that you will want to use under these colors. They are incredibly sheer polishes and to use without a black base you will not be able to get full, opaque coverage. With the black base though these polishes really stand out. They are unique to anything else I have in my gel polish collection and is similar to what you would find in the indie polish world of regular polishes. I swatched them on black swatch sticks and I only needed one coat to get the look I was going for. They were just thick enough to get good coverage but not so thick they were goopy. I'm looking forward to wearing these colors!",301060,16372
5.0,1598387645945,"Long, thick lashes in an instant!","Does a great job of making my lashes look lush and full plus it also makes them look longer. I usually have mascara that does one or the other but not both  so this product is great. It's waterproof but easily removable with a makeup wipe or eye makeup remover. I also really like the square shape of the bottle, it keeps it from rolling around on my counter when I set it down lol Very happy with this purchase.",301060,1088
5.0,1598387584020,Great mascara,Does a great job of making my lashes look lush and full plus it also makes them look longer.

Very happy with this purchase.,301060,744
4.0,1635811822378,Great Relaxing Gift Set,"This is quite a nice gift set to pamper yourself or give to a special friend. I love the combination of items, it is almost like opening gifts on Christmas and pulling out one item after the other. I love the soap bar and the bath bombs. The candle is also a nice touch and smelled amazing! This is probably silly, but my favorite item in the box was actually the bottle opener that is shaped like a key. It is so unique and functional, and something that will last a long time. I was not so impressed with the wine stopper. It looks like metal but is made of plastic. I also don't really like messages on my cups, so would have preferred that to be plain or with a graphic/picture design. The cup itself is good and has a nice sliding lid that fits quite snuggly. The set also comes with a blank card inside. Overall, quite a nice gift set and put a smile on my face when I opened it.",301063,374
3.0,1632837994917,Good Razor But Seller Does Not Offer Separate Replacement Heads,"This razor is different from any of the ones I have used before. I love the magnetic head that pops right into place. The handle is fairly comfortable to hold and the frame of the razor head has a moisturizing coating that gets activated with water and helps lubricate skin for easy gliding. The razor blades are sharp and help achieve a clean shave. This is supposedly good for about 2 months of use, after which the replacement head that comes with the razor can be changed. I also love the ceramic base that the razor comes with and can be stored in.<br />Now for the critical part. Although the handle is comfortable, the slick coating may make it a little slippery if using in the shower. The magnetic razor heads, although a unique and interesting feature, are impossible to find the replacement for. Even the seller's page only lists the razor itself, but not the replacement heads. This means that after the 2 heads that the razor comes with have been used up, you would have to purchase a new razor.",301063,802
4.0,1623410256149,Nice Light Lotion; Mild Moisturizing Effect,"I love aloe and was excited to try this product. This is a very pleasant aloe-based lotion (not the same as the aloe gel). It is supposed to be moisturizing but is very light and non-greasy. It absorbs quickly and only provides a mild moisturizing effect. My skin is not very dry, so I imagine someone with dryer skin would need a much heavier lotion if using as a moisturizer. It does feel soothing and makes my skin feel smooth. I like the mild aloe scent. This is a value pack with 4 lotions in a set. Each comes in its own gift box, which is really nice in case you want to give one to someone as a present. I wish there was an option for a variety pack since it comes with 4 lotions. Overall, this is a decent lotion and is a great value.",301063,211
5.0,1621780887961,Very Refreshing and Smells Amazing!,"I got the Cucumber and Aloe body wash. The smell is amazing! The cucumber also makes my skin feel so refreshed.  The consistency of the wash is thick and creamy. The product lathers very well and creates a rich foam. It feels good on the skin, not irritating, and does a great job at cleansing. I had a hard time getting the pump opened initially. I even looked for instructions on the bottle on how to open the pump. It was almost child proof, but I finally got it.  Once opened, the pump worked well and dispensed the product with no issues. The 2-pack is a great value, with each bottle containing 24.5 oz. I am very happy with this body wash and definitely recommend it!",301063,429
5.0,1609383510239,Nice Manly Shampoo,"I got this shampoo for my husband. He is usually very picky with the shampoos he uses for his hair and does not like products with too many chemicals or strong scents. Although the bottle is not very big, he said that just a small dab of the product was enough to thoroughly lather his hair and achieve good cleaning effect. There is a mild cinnamon fragrance and he said that he did not mind that, especially because it did not make his hair smell too strong or fruity. The design of the bottle appealed to him because of the black color and the manly names used in the product description, such as ""bold"" and ""grizzly."" Overall he was very satisfied with the product, and this comes from a guy who is very hard to please.",301063,3899
3.0,1605973716644,Hair Stays Wet And Wraps Take Forever To Dry,"Got this for my daughter. She has medium-long hair and makes turbans out of regular towels all the time, so I thought that she would enjoy this. The hair wraps are cute and soft to the touch, so they feel comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, some of the strings were loose, so not a very high quality sewing.  Because the product is made with soft microfiber material, it does not work as well as a regular towel to dry the hair. The cap is even less effective than the turban, because the hair stays loose inside and the moisture does not absorb. My daughter complained that she wore the wrap for a while and when she took it off, her hair was still very wet. She told me that the regular towels work much better. The material also takes forever to dry once it gets wet, unlike a regular towel. Therefore, I wish that the product was made of an actual towel material. I think it would have worked much better for the intended purpose.",301063,141
4.0,1598100947640,Nice Make-Up Wheel With Subtle Colors,"This is a lovely make-up wheel. It comes with 9 colors to choose from, 5 of which are matte and the rest shimmer. The matte shadows don't cake and the shimmer ones go on smoothly and are not greasy. I like the blend of the colors in the set, they are nicely matched. I like that the colors are subtle, yet provide a good variety for you to play around with and express yourself. The wheel does spin, but only when it is closed, which is not a functional feature and is just for aesthetics. Once you open the lid, the wheel locks in place. I wish there was a way to rotate it once the lid is open. It also did not come with any brush or applicator, but this is not a big deal because I am sure many of us have our own favorite applicator brushes.",301063,3352
5.0,1680018524421,Too heavy for fine hair but amazing for thick hair…,"This was too heavy for my fine thin hair, it left it looking greasy. My daughter has thick beautiful hair and this conditioner was perfect for her. Her hair is so shiny after using the last couple weeks. It’s healthier, easier to manage and so soft. Her frizz has smoothed out, her hair looks better than it’s ever looked. She has highlights in her hair and they’ve stayed bright since using this conditioner.",301073,425
4.0,1671034477138,Decent brushes for price,"These brushes are good quality for the price you’re paying. They aren’t the greatest brushes I’ve ever used but they’re also a fraction of the price I usually pay. You’re getting a lot for your money. Roughly $7 per brush is a steal for these. They style your hair nicely, the ceramic holds heat to smooth your hair. The bristles do tug on my hair slightly but it’s not a huge issue. They work great on my daughters thick curly hair.",301073,17745
5.0,1661995546134,Comparable to Moroccan oil brushes!!!,"This argan-infused round brush is of excellent quality and comparable to Moroccan oils infused brushes. This is the 4th one I’ve ordered, it’s safe to say I’m addicted. I have 2 different sizes for home and 2 different sizes for my house up north. This large barrel gives my long thin hair extra volume at the roots. I get a excellent blow out, my hairs smooth and frizz free. I won’t use any other kind of brush with my wavy frizzy hair. While the price is high for some I can promise that it’s worth every penny and you won’t be disappointed.",301073,15896
5.0,1661046181767,Comparable to Moroccan Oil brushes,These brushes are of excellent quality and comparable to Moroccan oil argon oil infused brushes. I own 2 of the 43 MM brushes and jumped on the 53 MM brush when I saw it was available. I love the Lange brushes I have but prefer larger barrels to give my long thin hair extra volume at the roots.  These brushes are great quality and deliver an excellent blow out. My hairs smooth and soft with minimal frizz and it stays that way throughout the day. Argan oil infused brushes have been a game changer with my wavy frizzy hair. While the price is high for some I can promise that it’s worth every cent and you won’t be disappointed.,301073,5997
3.0,1658808344736,High pigment but dries out,This is highly pigmented and you only need one coat. I personally think the color cinnamon roll is terrible but that doesn’t mean you won’t like it. It dries very quickly and that’s where it goes down hill. It starts to look dried out and cakey. Giving it 3 stars because it’s definitely smudge proof.,301073,2133
5.0,1658754230375,Nice size tube of cream,"Thus is a large tube, good for keeping in a end table or somewhere around the house. Too big for on the go. It smells nice and moisturizes my hands very well. It’s fast absorbing and not greasy at all. Great price and another great product from Hempz.",301073,2102
5.0,1657504514388,Such a great brush,This is my 2nd argon oil infused brush and I swear by these. My first one was made by Moroccan oil and I had it for years but it ended up cracking from heat. When I saw that Lange made them too I had to order this and I’m hoping it holds up better than the Moroccan brush. I love the light pink color. The brush is solid and high quality. When you blow out your hair with this brush it leaves your hair so soft and smooth. I have wavy frizzy hair and the argan infused brush is seriously a game changer. The price point is spot on. This Lange brush is worth every penny.,301073,788
4.0,1654260217965,Works well,"I was skeptical about this but decided to give it a try anyways. To my surprise it works pretty well. I don’t wear foundation during the summer, only bronzer/blush and highlighter. My skin gets extremely oily and shiny by the end of the day. I put my bronzer and highlighter on and then applied this powder using a powder brush. I would only use the applicator inclosed with it if I had no other choice. I went out in my yard and watered all of my flowers, it was 80 degrees out so quite warm. Came back inside and looked in the mirror and my face was still matte. Went about the rest of my day which included a 2.5 mile walk with my family. When I went to wash the makeup off my face my nose was only slightly shiny, that’s it. I deducted a star because my skin gets pretty bronzed this time of year, it seemed like the powder washed my color out a little bit. It wasn’t a huge difference but enough to notice.",301073,2007

4.0,1608677469259,Good for the price and variable colors,"Cute and classy. While being really soft and flattering, these colors are very pretty. I think some of the colors flatter fair skin better. They are quite sparky and good for everyday use. I would recommend using it like a plus on top of your eyeshadow because on its own you can’t appreciate the true beauty.

I found they are very pretty<br />and add that nice touch.<br />I found the buffers to work well.<br />I liked the cuticle pusher and the trimmer.<br />I believe the cuticle pusher is all stainless steel.<br />It pushed my cuticles back very well.<br />Be careful with the trimmer as it is sharp to<br />cut off the dead skin.<br />I liked the nail brush for residue of powder<br />left over when I file and buff my nails.<br />It is suppose to have a basic scrubbing brush<br />in there to for under my nails and to get them clean<br />before applying any of the gel.  That was missing<br />In my kit so I had to use my own.<br />I liked the nail separator that came with it.<br />I found this to really have everything<br />I need to do my nails.<br />I liked how I received in one kit all the things<br />to get started not going to a expensive salon minus<br />the scrub brush.<br />All the tools that came with it seemed<br />to work well.<br />I do believe this would be a great gift for the<br />young or older person who likes to do their<br />nails at home.

Its the first<br />I have found that does not.  I found the mirror<br />to be plastic.  I had to removed the plastic paper<br />in the back to start the light.  That keep the<br />battery from being turned on during shipping.<br />Also I removed the plastic on the mirror itself.<br />I found all tools were in good shape and sharp<br />enough to do the scraping of my teeth.<br />I liked that that the tools were all metal<br />and had no plastic in the middle like some<br />do.  I found the very sharp tip’s covered in hard<br />plastic for protection.<br />It came in a cute little card board tube<br />and has a little carrying bag to keep the<br />tools inside so they don’t get lost.<br />I drink coffee and my teeth get stain’s<br />and these really help’s with getting the<br />stains off and the tartar.<br />It takes a little practice to get it right<br />and I found these tools to work the way<br />they are supposed too.<br />I am using these for my self but I see no<br />reason you couldn’t use them on an animal<br />if you need too.<br />I liked that I can get under my gum line.<br />I have enclosed pictures so you can make a<br />informed decision based on your own personal<br />needs.<br />Yes I would recommend this product.,301146,782
4.0,1561388375273,No Instructions A Minus,"While there are numerous how-to videos available online, derma planing is something that should be attempted with caution and one wishes the individual blades purchased had reassuring instructions included. As it is, the box is printed in Japanese or Chinese characters which, of course, provide no information at all to the consumer in the USA. The name ""Beautyguard"" is the only English that appears on the packaging. There are a couple of drawings, but these are captioned in characters as well. The blades are very sharp, give a quality close shave, and should only be used on smooth, unblemished skin.",301213,750
5.0,1553460863508,Feels Nice,"There are so many things suggested by the beauty industry to eliminate fine lines and wrinkles. There are and lotions (called serums in today’s beauty parlance). And, there are surgeries and injections, peels and a myriad of other things to try that may or may not work. Fine lines and wrinkles are going to happen, folks. You can work to minimize them, but, short of stretching the skin as taut as a drum, they are going to occur. Now, the gua sha roller and scraper may make a difference. Used after a good washing and a rub of whatever moisturizing emollient followed by rubbing gently with the roller or scraper simply feels very nice. The quartz is cool and soothing to the skin, and definitely stimulates circulation. It is a pleasant routine and provides the luxury of a spa in your own home. If they minimize fine lines and wrinkles, fine, but sometimes feeling nice is enough.",301213,1594
5.0,1546708582748,Quiet and Easy to Use,"This clipper is white and not green, but that is not an important point. The point is that these clippers perform as advertised. They are quiet, not silent, but quiet enough to not alarm a skittish child or nervous poodle, depending on the task at hand. The cute little cape included is just that- cute, but not near big enough to catch significant clippings from a haircut. I like the fact that they charge from a USB port and come with a nice little pouch big enough to hold the clippers and accessories so you can slip the whole shebang in a dryer when not in use. The charge holds long enough for a couple of cuts, and the clippers recharge quickly. They are very nice and will be quite useful for some time.",301213,2519
2.0,1541442309952,Great Idea but Not for Me,"I tried this product on two days and both times, it left my eyelids feeling weird. That tired-eyes, sleepy feeling.  So, I stopped using it. It didn't have a chance to work for me since I feel very cautious about anything around my eyes. I guess caution outweighs vanity in my case.",301213,1095
5.0,1610309993182,Very nice individual packge,"These dried flower petal balls are lovely! They came in individual package. The petals look natural and organic.

5.0,1609712806653,So small and easy to use!,"I never tried this kind of thin curling iron. And the result came work great! My hair is super long and straight. It took me 15 min to curl all of them. This wand is very compact. It's easy to operate with one hand. One tip I could think of is, if you have a lot of hair like me, you probably need to push and hold the clip so the waver holds your hair tightly. It makes the hair curlier.",301221,137
3.0,1606857419945,Misleading name,"I thought the pads were moisturized because it says ""One-step Deep Cleansing Bubble Pad"". The word ""bubble"" is normally used for cleansing wipes. I received the product, tried it, then realized that it's basically an upgrade version of cotton pads. It's definitely not ""one-step"" if you need to use water of makeup remover with this pad.<br />Also it's quite expensive - $15 for 15 pieces. To me it cleans as good as regular cotton pads. There's nothing special about it other than the design where you can stick fingers into and hold it while wiping your face. Overall ok product. Definitely overpriced and need more instructions on the jar. Took me a while to figure out how to use it.",301221,1012
5.0,1605302301365,Nice water bottle for indoor plants,"I ordered this to water my plants. The material is very good. I like the shape of the bottle, very easy to hold. The adjustable head helps adjust the stream. The mist is very fine! The only thing I think could be improved is the bottle color. It would be nice if it's translucent so I can see how much water is left.",301221,27172
4.0,1677295615892,Very soothing and moisturizing,"Really nice and creamy. Blends and absorbs well. Leaves under eyes very moisturized but not too greasy. There’s hardly any scent, if any.",316003,22328
5.0,1659762148916,Big range or colors that stay on a long time,So many colors. This is one of the best collections I’ve owned. The colors are such a big range. There’s nudes and blues and greens. Some even shimmery. There’s something for every mood and outfit. They stay on well and look gorgeous. I highly recommend.,316003,30708
5.0,1657963833435,Make your own scents,"This lotion is awesome.  It is such good quality, creamy, deep penetrating and 100% vegan.  I like to make my own scents with this lotion by separating small quantities in other containers and adding my own essential oils.  I have a jasmine blend going now that’s so unique and awesome smelling. And the scent possibilities you could make with this are endless.  It also doesn’t smell bad on its on!  Pop it In The fridge for a really nice, cool pampering treat on a hot day.  This gallon of lotion is so worth it.  I will never buy expensive store bought lotion again.  This lotion even has arnica extract and aloe added for sore muscles.  Such a great deal.  I can’t stress it enough.  I would highly recommend!",316003,191
5.0,1656456748550,My favorite set!,Love every color! So much to choose from. The odor isn’t bad on these. I think my favorite is the denim blue looking color. You can do them matte or glossy. They stay on well and go on good. It’s one of my favorite sets.,316003,30709
5.0,1654772897230,Love this stuff,"I absolutely love this face serum!  It came very nicely packaged with the serum being contained in a sturdy, pretty round cardboard container.  Inside is the Pure Essential Oils.  The ingredients listed include pure: vitamin E, carrot seed, raspberry seed, Argan oil, frankincense, geranium and Bulgarian lavender- All pure Essential Oils with no fillers!  It is a wonderful anti aging serum.  At first I was surprised by the smell.  It’s kind of a plain Listerine Mouthwash smell (the gold color Listerine.)  However, the first time I tried this Serum, I was totally hooked and now I absolutely love this smell, so clean!  After using this product I don’t want to use any other product on my face.  It cleared up my facial redness and gave me such a clear, clean complexion, shrinking my pores and softening my fine lines.  This stuff really lives up to its name of Liquid Gold.  After I finish off this bottle,  I will definitely be reordering more.  I would highly recommend!",316003,30711
5.0,1654748676128,Lasts my 12 hour shift at work,"These are excellent. There’s a pretty good variety of sizes but mainly pretty natural looking. They are very easy to put on. First time I ever used magnetic lashes it took me a few tries, after that, I was good to go. Takes hardly no time and the liner dries quick so I don’t even wait to put lashes on. It still is good enough to wipe off when you don’t get it on even if you work right away. As far as lashes, you can take them off and reposition them. If they are too long for you, just trim the ends a little and they are perfect. I reuse mine quite a few times. You can wash them after each use with shampoo. Sometimes I’m lazy and use liquid hand soap. At first I was just pulling them off. But the best way to get off is liquid makeup remover. All you have to do is take a swab soaked in it and rub along lashes and they fall right off! It’s like magic. As far as wearing them, they last my whole 12 hour shift at work. No problems.",316003,30670
5.0,1650518364020,Who needs powder when you have this!,"I have such oily skin most the time and thought I would give this roller a try.  I was skeptical but It actually works to keep the shine off my face.  It’s a very well made tool and really easy to use.  You just basically roll it over the parts of your face that get oily throughout the day.  The roller is made from real volcanic stone and does absorb the excess oil on my skin without messing up my makeup at all.  (The roller turns darker and you can see that it’s absorbing the oil.)  very simple to use and easy to take to work so you can freshen up your face in the restroom.  I no longer wear powder, instead I have been using this.  I would totally recommend to anyone with oily skin.",316003,2900
4.0,1646357877487,Great set,"This is a good set. The colors are great and a nice variety. One might think the wattage low on light but consider, it is also an LED light so they are more powerful. I still prefer a higher wattage. But even after doing any nails, they are a tad tacky. This is because with gel polish, one must take a wipe or cotton ball with your acetone, or I prefer alcohol. And wipe over nails gently. This is the very last step after top coat and curing. This takes the tackiness away. Won’t mess up polish either. I wish the bottles showed color on them. It must be a thing with gel polish. To protect from light.",316003,30712
4.0,1641432359532,Light coverage,Nice foundation. It’s light coverage so I only wear it around the house. My daughter loved it. It goes on well enough and smooth. It’s a good price and the bottle looks pricey. The sponge works great.,316003,30714
5.0,1641392632413,What’s the catch?,"Oh my gosh, these last forever! I can’t get over how big the container is. And so smooth and soft powder. Sometimes when my dark roots show, I use this on them at scalp to keep from going to the beauty shop. It blends well and looks light like blonde. But for the face, they are so smooth and I find it takes less of this as it does other brands. The opening is wonderful and has perfect amount of holes to let powder come through. Even has a small sponge applicator that has a little finger strap. I use this and like it better than brush. They last all 12 hours of my shift without getting a shiny oily face. Even with wearing a mask the whole time. The container is gorgeous and I love the square design. So what’s the catch? I feel like I have discovered gold. I mean look at the price?! How could it be possible to get so much powder at such a ridiculously low price and it be a high end quality? Thank you to the makers for keeping the customer in mind. Very affordable. I’ll be purchasing again.",316003,30715

4.0,1635812761260,A little thicker and oilier than most I’ve used,This is pretty good but seems a bit oilier than others I’ve used. Maybe a little thicker? So a little goes a long way. It’s still good and works good to remove makeup.,316003,9365
5.0,1634185262222,It’s like magic!,"I don’t know where to start. This is the best razor and holder! The holder is heavy and feels like porcelain. Very sturdy and well made. Holds the razor nicely. The razor works even better than I thought. The first shave, I didn’t think it was shaving because the lubrication on the pads above and below blades was so much it would sort of string out. Not in a bad way. But the razor shaved nicely. I’ve used it about five times and the lubricant is still on there! It’s almost like a person wouldn’t need shaving cream! I keep looking at it wondering how they did it. It’s amazing! Like magic. It’s very sturdy made.",316003,802
3.0,1633503182908,Great container but not enough coverage for me,This is a great container with a nice mirror. I love this new style of makeup. It’s just not enough converge for me. Someone young would love it I’m sure. But my skin is too uneven toned and spotty for it. If you like light coverage you will probably like it.,316003,1680

4.0,1629939140301,Gives skin a smooth healthy glow,"I’m really impressed with this. It is like a moisturizer and isn’t greasy. It really does brighten face. Especially if you can go with just this and not foundation. It makes face look so smooth. It comes out really well . Perfect actually. It’s a little pricey for my budget though. I use it sparingly. It doesn’t take much. As far as the whitens, don’t let this deter you. I was skeptical at first. It doesn’t really make your face look white. It brightens like a healthy glow. I think the advertisement needs to be reworded. I don’t think they meant to imply it whitens. I could be wrong. Just my humble opinion.",316003,2241
3.0,1628586451178,Holy cow it burns on inside of fat! It’s doing something!,"Not sure how to rate this. In a way, it’s good because you can feel it burning instantly. And it’s not just on the surface or skin. It’s mostly inside where fat is lol. It has to be doing something. No pain, no gain right? But I just can’t take it.

5.0,1620372579752,Excellent magnetic lashes!,"I love these. I like that they are mink. And I especially like how they have the little case with a mirror. That’s impossible to find. They work great and stay on my whole 12 hour shift. They are waterproof and you can’t scrub off with just water, not that a person would try. Cold cream works ok. But if you get some lash cleaner or makeup remover and apply to the end of a cotton swab and gently rub along lash, they practically fall off in seconds. At first, I was peeling them off because I thought since it’s magnetic that’s all that’s sticking. But then it’s hard to get the eyeliner off. After using a remover it’s much better. Don’t worry if you have trouble using liquid eyeliner. I promise after practicing a time or two, it will work perfect. If you get out of line, very quickly wipe off excess. It dries quickly. If it takes longer to put them on after applying liner, it will probably still work good. If you put lashes on sooner than you are supposed to and it’s not dried as well as it should be, it still works. It’s just a little messier for the lashes after removing them. I’ve learned to also use my lash remover or makeup remover to clean my lashes afterwards. They will have some liner dried to them and this builds up. I put them in my palm and squirt some on and gently rub with my finger or a swab. I don’t take much effort but get some of it off pretty good. They last me a good 5 or more times depending on how bad I bend them putting on lol. That’s another thing, you don’t have to have a real steady hand to apply them. I use my fingers instead of the holder thing. I normally start in the center but sometimes on the inside. You can adjust them if they are too long on one side. You can also trim them. Please don’t do this while they are on lol. I tried this and cut too much off. I was lazy lol. Most the time I have mine bent good to put on. Well, I should say curved instead of bent lol. They aren’t as fragile as they would seem. I love them. Only thing that worries me, if you ever are in an accident with them on and they take you for an MRI , I worry my eyelids will pull off because of the magnetic particles lol. It’s not funny but something to think about. Surely they would wash them off first. Don’t think about it. Try them. After all, beauty comes at a price lol.",316003,825

Lately I’ve needed a little more moisture. This is just right. It feels like it would be great for dry skin and oily. Maybe a little too much for oily, idk. It’s not too thick. At first, when applying it, it seems thick. But it quickly absorbs. Right away actually. It doesn’t have a strong scent. My skin feels great the next day when I wake up. I usually apply it twice a day and it’s not too oily. As I learned in cosmetology school, there’s a difference in oil and moisture. This moisturizes without being oily.",316003,710

Also, I’m not good at applying liquid eyeshadow. But let me tell you, I applied this with the applicator. It’s a sponge tip like will come in lipstick or lip gloss. Then I sort of blended it in just a little with my finger. It dries on and stays the whole work night 12 hours. It’s great. It feels a little like when something liquid would dry on skin but not bad and doesn’t show wrinkles. It may be for younger people but this 50 year old loves it.

5.0,1604908215837,Beyond my expectations,"So even though I used to do hair and should know about magnetic eyelashes, I didn’t and I was SO skeptical. I finally decided to try them. These things exceeded my expectations by far! The first time I chose the not so dramatic ones but they were thicker than my own. They did great. They were only a tad heavy. They stayed on 8 hours but I took the eyeliner with me to work and touched them up. I honestly think they would’ve stayed on longer if I hadn’t have forgotten and put regular eyeliner on first out of habit. I do wish this came in another color besides black as I have blonde hair and it’s dramatic. But once I wore them a while I realized it looked good. After work, I removed them easily. My eyes were itchy a little but when I woke up that evening they were back to normal. Another reason I think they didn’t stay on 12 hours was instead of following directions, I read somewhere that a person put the eyeliner on the the lashes while still wet and it worked better. The next night I followed directions. Put a coat on let dry then add another coat. Honestly, it pretty much dries by the time you finish both eyes. Don’t forget to shake it up though. They were very easy and quick to do. The only real time it takes is deciding which ones to use as there are so many nice selections. I realized the ones I thought were too dramatic when choosing actually look the best. I’ve gotten o many complements. And this time they stayed on all night. I think I could sleep in them and they would stay on. I wouldn’t though. The corners might poke your skin on inner eye when you close them but this can be remedied by snipping a tad off with scissors once you try them on and see how they do. I didn’t have to trim mine. Also, I had put a pair on and decided I liked the longer ones better so I took off the first ones and applied the others. I never redid the eyeliner. They still worked and stayed on. There’s magnet particles on eyeliner and the lashes are on a magnet strip. They are easy to remove but stay on like they are real. That sounds crazy. I didn’t want to ruin my own lashes with the glue kind plus I can’t get them on good enough without adjusting them. These you can take off and adjust. This gave me confidence I lacked in doing this. Plus, my hands aren’t that steady. When removing, start at corner and peel off. They won’t hurt your lashes. To remove eyeliner I used cold cream. It worked well. Just water doesn’t work. It is waterproof very much so. So cry all you want with these lashes ladies. You won’t have to worry about them falling off. One last thing, my skin is sensitive but they haven’t really bothered me so that is a big plus.",316003,2289

It’s a bad buy.<br /><br />In those stars I try to include: How closely the product meets the description, Price, How it compares to other products I’ve tried, and Usability.<br /><br />My reviews can be long, so if you want to skim, follow the topic headers. Also-I try to update my reviews, so they may change over time.<br /><br />My nail experience:<br />I am currently NOT a nail tech but I am practicing to become licensed. It’s something I enjoy—but is still a hobby.  I practice weekly, if not daily- on myself, hand mannequins, and other people. Sometimes I’m told to hurry up getting licensed- that I’m ""good enough""—but I’m in no hurry, busy trying out as many products as I can, watching nail content on YouTube and SkillShare.<br />SO--Though I am knowledgeable, I recommend you always trust licensed nail teaches over me.<br /><br />Art liner brushes-- overall look:<br />I'm a sucker for the embedded crystals look that these brushes have. Its a common look for nail brushes- this style is everywhere, but I always find it pretty. The crystals are loose, wiggling around in the open center- sometimes making a faint clicking noise. This style always looks bougie to me.<br /><br />The brush tips:<br />these preform fine- had a few brush hairs I had to get wet and smooth-- nothing bad. after a little forming they do what they are intended to do. If you're new to brushes like these, the long fine lines help create smoother thin lines and the stubby brushes are good for more precise detail.<br /><br />Cost:<br />At the time of this review these brushes cost 6.99. for five brushes that's roughly 1.25 for each brush. Not a bad cost. You can get better brushes- they'll have less imperfections and will cost more-- but these do fine.<br /><br />I see these brushes everywhere-- and the'll randomly pop up at different price points- sometimes even as a free bonus for a more expensive nail kit. So if you want to shop around you may be able to find them cheeper-- but I still think this is a good price.<br /><br />Overall:<br />They are what they say they are.  If you like the look on the page- I don't think they will disappoint.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!",317065,4596
5.0,1597967418816,The magnetic eyeliner perfected--,"Let’s establish this first, everyone rates things differently- this is how I do it:<br /><br />5 stars: The item fully meets OR exceeds expectations<br />4 stars: There could be improvements, but the product is good<br />3 stars: The item is acceptable, but might be better elsewhere OR needs improvement<br />2 stars: Many OR most things are wrong with the item, but it has some redeemable feature<br />1 star: Stay Away!

Also- I try to update my reviews, so they may change over time.<br /><br />My experience:<br />I'm not a makeup expert-- but when magnetic eyelashes first came out, I was a customer- so I’ve watched the market change over the years. At the time of this review you’ll finally find different styles of lashes, but all of them will be a bit stiff, and thick. Not many options for soft natural looking lashes in with magnetic application.<br /><br />The lashes styles:<br />These lashes have a decent range as magnetic lashes go with a few of the wispier, natural-ish options. So far though I haven’t seen any magnetic lashes on the market that look natural.<br /><br />Liner applicator:<br />This isn’t THE best liner applicator I’ve tried, but it is comparable to the best. In my experience the liner is the most important part of the lash set- not just because it’s the “glue” but it’s the item that makes the most difference on ease of application and finished look. Some liners are thick no matter what you do, this one allows a thinner line. (BUT magnetic lashes don’t do well with a pin line application, meaning you must add enough for the lash to grab on to) this made a thinner line work for me., (please note I have wrinkled and hooded eyelids, so everything I do is a little bumpy/ big)<br /><br />FIRST TIME USERS: these work best if you do ONE eye at a time. The lashes apply best when the liner is still a bit wet. NOT fully wet- but given a little time to START to dry. Think of the liner like glue- perfectly wet glue doesn’t hold paper together, and dry glue doesn’t stick.<br /><br />I recommend testing this liner on the back of your hand before your eyes, so you don’t end up looking like a panda as you practice—and the skin on your hand isn’t as sensitive as your eyelid. As you practice, remember that the lashes are reusable BUT can break easily --so practice with the set you like LEAST and be careful as you apply and remove.)<br /><br />Overall-<br />I recommend this set. There are MANY magnetic eylashe sets on the market, and this is one of the good ones.<br /><br />I’ll update this post with eye looks as I use each lash set and change my review if I see anything that should be mentioned.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!!",317065,5645

3.0,1597208143749,I wouldn't start with this--,"This is a beginner set, but it's not looking to help you-- No instructions.<br /><br />Lucky for me--This isn't my first gel kit.<br /><br />At first when I opened the box I liked how much they had to offer creatively. Some kits try to force a look, but this one was open to play with. Maybe not the best idea for a beginner kit- but I enjoyed that.<br /><br />First the good:<br />I like this type of lamp when I'm doing gel- it's easy together both my hands in to hold the nail down when I first start, then I usually pick up the light and rotate it to get a full cure. Yes I have to restart the lamp a few times, but this isn't an expensive lamp so I don't mind.<br /><br />I liked the little box they came in- sure it's cheep, but it was a nice tough to have (almost) everything in once place.<br /><br />Then the annoying:<br /><br />There are a lot of odd little problems, like the Gel itself, two are jelly clear and one is opaque. Opaque gel takes a little longer to cure because the light works a bit harder to travel though the nail. It would have been helpful if they mentioned that, OR only gave you one type of gel-so it doesn't confuse you-- but they didn't.<br /><br />The nail forms were a bad fir for my hand. Thats just an unlucky break- all hands are diffrent- so im not including that in my rating, just something to mention in case they don't work for you too.<br /><br />The colors were a little annoying to use, no color indicator on the bottle. this is common with cheeper sets, but I thought I'd mention it anyway- It can make doing your nails just a little bothersome.<br /><br />The ugly-<br />they don't include slip solution-I ended up using my own from my nail kit, so I didn't have any problems, but that's a huge mistake on their part-- if you're just starting out you'll think gel nails are a sticky mess. Slip solution makes them manageable.<br /><br />Overall- I feel like there are better kits that will give you a cleaner start over this one--<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!",317065,2835
4.0,1596966237071,They'll do,These do the job.<br /><br />There are a lot of these on the market- nothing wrong with this set.<br />They didn't do anything extra- like throw in a few extra wax heads like some companies do- but they didn't need to.<br /><br />Really- the reason to get these is if you like the colors-- the way they look.<br /><br />If you like em- then this is the set for you.<br /><br />If you've never had one of these for placing bling and glitter flakes-- they are so helpful-- the wax keeps picking things up over and over and the other side helps you position things instead of poking them endlessly with an orange sick. There are more expensive ones that don't use wax- but this works.<br /><br />I hope that was helpful.,317065,27855
2.0,1596965574088,Please - just go buy a topcoat.,"Oh my word- no.<br /><br />Okay- so this looked like a wonderful beginner kit. I am not a beginner, but I was excited to have everything in a tiny package- something easy to pull out with friends but with high quality results.<br /><br />I got a friend, we opened the box and assumed I'd be ready to do her nails without getting my nail kit.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />The first sept (as it always is) was to clean buff and shape the nail- nothing included to do that.<br /><br />I thought- okay- no big deal.<br /><br />I got my stuff out and took care of it. I then applied their prep product- Nail dehydrator- all good.<br /><br />I started to plug in the nail light, so I’d be ready after we apply the first coat- but this kit didn't include a plug- just a usb cord. (sigh) I got up again- and got an extra usb plug I had. Now slightly annoyed because this is supposed to be a ready kit-<br /><br />but hey-- really-- not a huge deal.<br /><br />Then I applied the base coat. Whew- runny. I wasn’t impressed with it’s consentaneity. But maybe it’d perform well?<br /><br />Then I tried to cure it. Cue the light--<br /><br />Oh, my word their nail lamp is horrible.<br /><br />It’s very cheap looking- only fits four fingers- not the thumb at the same time, and really feels off- like the break into shards plastic, not the bendy kind. (I was still trying to accept this as a no big deal point but the red flags were slapping me in the face.)<br /><br />I read the pamphlet to see how long it needed to cure- the pamphlet said ""cure for the appropriate time"" or something just a vague. I read the nail polish, to find the appropriate time- nope. I looed over the box- nothing.<br /><br />We used the lamp like 5 times and finally got her base coat cured. Then we had to do the same with just her thumb. I have nail lights that cost three bucks that work better than this thing. I’m not kidding.  In fact- I use single nail lights that only cure one nail at a time—and this was SLOWER!<br /><br />Okay- that was over.<br /><br />Where is the red polish?<br /><br />The box says: “Step two apply polish” and it has a picture of the polish- a red polish, they name it like it’s included.<br /><br />It’s not.<br /><br />This starter kit isn’t much of a START without a polish-<br /><br />but Okay- my nail kit to save the day.<br /><br />I pulled out a blush pink gel that always does me right.<br /><br />But the base coat is weird. The polish is almost clumping on the nail. It applies a tad bit patchy. I get that not all formulas work together—but they DIDN’T GIVE ME a polish to work with so theirs- in theory- should be mostly universal. I didn’t know I was intended to buy-one polishe- AND their kit to make this happen.<br /><br />I try to cure MY gel polish tin their lamp.<br />(thank goodness my friend is a very laid-back person- she was amazing about this, laughing with me--) I was itching to pull out a good lamp but I didn’t, so I’d give this a true test.<br />(Or because I wanted to test my patience. Two birds one stone)<br /><br />Now—here is the saving grace—<br /><br />the top coat is wonderful.<br /><br />It works like some of my best top coats- it leaves that perfect glassy look and it applies like a dream.<br /><br />Later I used the same top coat on my nails- and it worked just as well without the weird base coat and the horrible lamp and a totally different brand of nail polish.<br /><br />THIS WHOLE KIT AND THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE GOING FOR IT IS THE TOP COAT!<br />Now I get why this has good reviews—it’s the gel top coat.<br /><br />No wonder it lasts- I can only guess Red Carpet knows their top coat is fantastic, so they threw a bunch of bad apples in here –aware beginners won’t know any better.<br /><br />Please. You can buy wonderful topcoats for 10-20 bucks NOT 50 OF YOUR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS- This is such a sad waste- and they don’t even throw in a file, or a plug in or red polish?<br /><br />I have more stuff coming from this brand—things I got before I tried this-- that I’m going to be trying-<br />I really hope this is their only issue... we shall see. <br /><br />I hope this review was helpful because I don’t want your money wasted. :(",317065,6009

I like to wash my hair every other day so it doesn't get greasy, and I was a bit hesitant about if these would work because they are rather thin. I think as long as you don't stand with your head directly under the water for too long it works great! Since it is thin it is nice and light on your head and doesn't feel like it is going to fall off. Plus, I love the cheetah print!",319395,2513

That wasn't the end of the world though. The next day I was able to use my pumice stone and a lot of calluses and dead skin came off, my feet are way smoother than they were prior.

This company offers different scent options - this one is rather flowery, with scents like ylang ylang and gardenia. This is certainly somewhat expensive for a deodorant but it is worth paying extra to get something natural with organic ingredients that won't irritate your skin or harm your health. Unlike some products that just spray on scents this item uses baking soda to help absorb odors too.

5.0,1612373312738,Good addition,I love the colors in this kit. They are not super pigmented but gives a subtle shade. I only applied these as an overlay over my natural nail. The product itself seems a bit thin and not so great as a long extension. The poly gel did start chipping from my nails after a week and half. This kit didn’t come with slip solution but used rubbing alcohol instead. It’s easy to use but is missing things a beginner might need I.e. slip solution and dual forms.,319419,1546

When you think you’re being careful by keeping your mouth close while brushing somehow splatter gets somewhere. Then you spit it out and it messes up the skin and walls and mirror.

4.0,1582424991108,So many options,I ordered these chrome nail powders and loved the variety. The jars are doesn’t come with a lot but way better than other chrome powders that I received that came with only a sprinkle of powder. These chrome powders were a bit on the dull side but I applied a rubber base top coat which in my opinion helped the color pop more.,319419,2340

I did deduct one star because it doesn't last long at all but it does smell nice for a short time.

It would also make a nice gift, perhaps as an addition to a gift basket or housewarming.",319509,204
5.0,1619054913014,So natural and easy to use!,"This is my first experience with extensions and I have been SO impressed. First, the highlighted blonde matches my hair 100%. I know this won't be the case for everyone but I was shocked at how close it was to my ""natural"" color.  They arrived neatly packaged and it was really easy to seperate and keep them tangle free. The clips are also a great feature as they pop in and out with ease. I was easily able to work them in without the clips showing through my hair. I washed and air dried each piece after wearing and they was so easy to restyle. The price is a bit steep but considerably less than what I would expect to pay for good quality.<br />If you're a newbie and considering highlights, these are definitely a great place to start. I highly recommend!!",319509,7855
4.0,1599874092094,Moisturizing and easy to use,"This mask feels really awesome! It is easy to use and left my skin feeling very moisturized. Great for a little pampering every week.

5.0,1598566625667,Hydrating serum,"I was a bit shocked at how greasy this serum is the first time I used it. I expected it to absorb a little better and not stay so ""shiny"". That being said, it has not caused my skin to break out or look any oilier throughout the day. I use it in the evenings after washing my face and before my moisturizer. A little goes a looong way so this small bottle will last a really long time.<br /><br />I have only been using it for a little over a week but my skin already looks better.  Definitely more hydrated and smooth. This is a great addition to my skincare routine, I highly recommend.",319509,317
4.0,1593446244710,SO easy to apply!,"Let me start by saying that these are the easiest eyelashes that I have ever used.  I was definitely skeptical but it really is as easy as swiping on the magnetic liner and then sticking the lash strip in place.  THAT IS IT!  No fussing, no dropping, no glue, no 2-piece magnet that you can't ever position properly.  Just swipe and stick.  Pretty much foolproof!  I did find them to be a tad heavy on my eyelid but I imagine that is because I'm not used to wearing false lashes (because I could never figure how to get them on properly...haha) and I'm hoping it will get better with time.<br /><br />Ok...now onto the negative.  While these lashes are absolutely amazing, I was appalled to receive a used tube of eyeliner in my pack.  You know the black thread rings that mascara tubes develop after you have removed and inserted the wand a hundred times?  That's exactly what the eyeliner tube looked like.  A 'sealed' package that contained a used product?  Not really sure how that happened.  Luckily, the kit contains 2 tubes of eyeliner so I went against my better judgement and decided to try the tube that was obviously (maybe I should say hopefully) not used.<br /><br />Other than receiving a partially used product, these eyelashes are AMAZING.  So easy and fun, I highly recommend!!",319509,2362
5.0,1592490290849,Great find!,This sanitizer is a great find!  It did not dry my hands out or leave them feeling sticky.  The package arrived quickly and both bottles were tightly wrapped.  I have not been able to find sanitizer in stores and was so excited to find it on Amazon.  Very pleased!,319509,85
3.0,1568657527045,Didn't work well for my hair,"Let me start by saying that this straightener is very pretty.  It is a lovely rose-gold color and has a sleek design.  Included in the package was the straightener, a comb, two clips, a heat-resistant glove, and a storage pouch.<br /><br />There is a digital temperature display that shows the current temperature, which is a really helpful feature.  There is also a power button, up/down temperature control, and a barrel lock to keep the clamp closed.<br /><br />I did find that this straightener heated up really quickly.  It did not, however, straighten my hair very efficiently.  I had to go over really small sections multiple times to achieve the desired results.  That cannot be good for your hair and it took forever!  My hair is very thick and on the coarse side so it may be much better suited to someone with finer hair.  Overall, this is a definitely a decent straightener but it just didn’t work well for me.<br />*I received this product at no cost in exchange for a fair and unbiassed review.",319509,2344
4.0,1654823410648,Does The Job; Could Be Cheaper,"While this is a decent costume, it doesn't take much creativity to put it together and comes at a somewhat high price tag. It's $35 at the time of review, which comes with the shirt, wig, wig cap, guitar, and hat. None of it is overly amazing. The hat is pretty cheap while the others are as expected. The shirt is probably the best. Turns out, it's a little more than cotton. It's nice and stretchy. It does fit true to size unlike most tee shirts these days. The mullet looks decent, although you don't need a wig cap for it. It stays on just fine without it. It will make an easy, but somewhat cheap costume if you are in a bind. That said, it does the job.",319582,767
5.0,1632590993676,Works For My Crocheting,"I probably use this for a different purpose than those who typically order, but I needed something to display my fiber arts on and this was the perfect size for what I need. The mannequin comes without a wig, but I had one on hand to make my art more realistic. It's very proportional to a normal head circumference. I like that it has the shoulders so I can use a scarf and hat to show off.<br /><br />For $65 at the time of review, I really can't complain. It's so realistic, that you can use it as a display or you can use it to train yourself I'm hair. It even has a spot for earrings too. Overall, I have zero complaints. It stands perfectly because of the size and shape. It has a good base. Whether it is for hair design or a display, this will work well!",319582,770

There is no way you will catch me buying this at $34 for a ONE TIME USE bag. If this was less than $10, it would be great. You use the entire bag and try to relax. It's like a detox in a way. But, it's not worth the price point. It comes with a stone inside ""yay!"". Still not worth $34. It's epsom salts with some essential oils and moisturizing oils. That's great and all, but have we forgot that it is still a one time use bag that costs more than buying the ingredients and making them yourself? Especially since I didn't notice a difference compared to other similar packaged salts. Smells lovely, but not worth the price.",319582,871

Depending on what kind of hair ties you are using, this could hold anywhere from 8 scrunchies to 50 hair ties. It literally comes fully assembled, ready to be used right out of the box. The scrunchies are cute and functional! All the rage these days with youth. The only thing I notice that is different about this one than others is that it doesn't have the open cylinder at the top. Most of the others have an open top for bobbie pins and clips. However, that is not a negative as it literally is perfectly sized and comes with everything needed. And even better, it's the perfect less than $10 item for birthdays or gifts at $9.99 at the time of review.",319582,11914

Most face masks that dry out your skin fall around the same price, but these actually restore and calm without drying. The masks fit nicely, not too small and not too large. They are unscented which is glorious because I can't stand a mask that smells like perfume while trying to relax. The aloe is really calming and you feel well hydrated overnight. There are multiple styles with two of each and they each have different effects. They don't leave behind a greasy residue at all either. The packaging is also nice, so you can gift these to someone as is or open them and have a spa day at home. I would 100% buy these if you need a new face mask routine.",319582,971

It comes with so many options for nail colors, stickers, and the dryer. You definitely want 2AA batteries handy for the dryer. It doesn't come with them.

Once you understand the twirling left and right (depending in which direction you want your curls), you'll be on your way to curls that look right out of a beauty pageant. I don't say that in a negative way. They are very beautifully curled. Little girls would love having these curls.<br /><br />You can curl them and then brush them out a bit to give them a more natural look. The two barrels are easily interchangeable so you can do large curls and small curls. I have very thick hair and found these to be fun to wear without needing that hair cut.

May not be the prettiest, but its about being creative. The mat is the perfect size and the paints are easy to clean up. They are washable so the hands can be cleaned up after. It comes with the paints and brushes, so no need to buy some. It also folds into a storage box, which is excellent for keeping the mess contained. You want to fold the velcro in, not out.

I still just prefer to leave my hair wrapped up until bed and deal with the messy curly consequences the next morning. This is by far the BEST hair wraps I've ever used. It is made if microfiber and is soft as blankets. The turban is great for just throwing your hair in there, while the hair towel wraps up nicely and has a good button and band on it to hold it in place. The two hair ties are nice, but not needed. Still useful though! The towels themselves absorb all of the water and hold it in place. So, once you take the towels off, they are soaked for hours, unlike your hair.

It’s pretty simple to use and has some extra features that are not necessary, but so make it nicer to use like the cooling feature that helps the quick zap not feel as harsh.

The powder was securely pressed when manufacturing, so there wasn’t any loose powder rolling around inside.<br /><br />As far as how well it works, I love it! The powder doesn’t kick up a whole lot, yet you still get a good bit on your brush. It doesn’t leave my face looking at all cakey or powdery, but it does take the shine away and lasts for most of the day. I do have to reapply sometimes if it’s a really long day, but not a huge deal.

From the blades and the curve of the handle, to the stylish holder. It oozes style and luxury. That is until you actually want to use it…<br /><br />Just as they claim the handle is alloy and has a good bit of weight to it. But what they don’t tell you is that with wet, sweaty, or shaving foam covered hands this feels like a bar of soap in the shower or one of those slippery snake toys we used to have when I was growing up. The razor head is fixed in what they call an “optimum angle”, except it’s really not. Imagine trying to keep your grip on one of those slippery snakes, while trying to maneuver your hand at all kinds of odd angles to get that “optimum angle”, while 6 nice and sharp blades are around your jugular….<br /><br />Unfortunately this looks great, but functionally it doesn’t perform.

And personally I think this TIANG one works even better!<br /><br />First you can actually put an watery essence in this TIANG one, unlike the Flight mode one that doesn’t allow it. This TIANG one also has a better spray than my flight mode one. The flight mode one is insanely fine, honestly it’s actually to fine but it was still my favorite up until now. This TIANG one is slightly stronger of a spray which is enough to really mist your face without feeling like you dumping skincare or water on your skin. This TIANG one also holds a charge longer and I can easily get a day or two out of it even if I am using it frequently throughout the day.<br /><br />The only real negative is the size of this TIANG one bits much larger than my old one and most of the others I have tried.

It’s not relaxing at all and it’s way to strong for a pillow spray.<br /><br />Generally I love hibiscus scents, but there is just something really off about this one, it’s almost perfume like. Plus the sprayer nozzle on this is terrible. It shouts out huge droplets that splatter everywhere and leak down the container and onto my hand every time. They put two different caps on this, but then the sprayer is terrible… why? Overall I was just really unimpressed by this.

The mousse seams to me to have a little bit of stiffness and stickiness when I put it on my skin. I do still like the mousse, but I would take there lotion over this if given the choice.

The candle does smell good, but it is super tiny and only burned for a few hours before it was gone. The shower gel smells amazing, but didn’t lather as well as I hoped and the scent didn’t linger.

3.0,1615297578151,Don’t smell before you brew it!,"I’m a huge tea drinker and was looking for something different to drink before bed instead of my usual chamomile blend. I had heard of this Welle co brand before, but had never personally tried it prior to this. So I was really excited to give it a go.<br /><br />First impressions, the box it comes in is super luxe looking and very giftable. And the container that holds the tea bags is a very pretty purple color and is glass, giving you that premium look. However once I opened the container I was highly disappointed. They didn’t even splurge on the pyramid tea bags, they went with those cheap pouches. For this price point I expected much better if I’m being honest!<br /><br />Scent wise this tea smells like sweaty socks, it is not a pleasant smell and I highly recommend not even smelling it before brewing because it can easily put you off to drinking it. But once brewing I was surprised that the scent was almost fruity, so much better than in the container! The directions say to steep one to two bags for 2-10 minutes, in very hot but not boiling water. I usually like stronger tea, but with this I just can’t justify using 2 tea bags at that price point!<br /><br />Taste wise it actually has a very mild taste, and none of that sticky socks smell or taste at all. It’s very mild tasting with a slightly fruity/berry taste to it. Is it amazing? No, but it’s not bad. It’s definitely an acquired taste! I will say though that I have been sleeping like a baby the last few nights I have drank this, so even though it’s not my favorite tea it does seam to work, at least for me.",319591,2262
3.0,1615051886387,Extremely thick lash bands,"I use false eyelashes a lot, and am pretty familiar with what makes a good lash. I have particularly been into the magnetic ones lately since they are insanely easy to use and don’t require a lengthy process. These particular magnetic lashes intrigued me because they come with multiple different style lashes instead of a bunch of the same and I was excited to give them a try!<br /><br />The magnetic liner itself is pretty bad, Though that’s not odd for the less expensive sets and I kind of expected it. It’s just a bit to hard to work with and I had to go over the eyeliner line multiple times to get it how I wanted it. It’s just a bit to runny. But I can just use a different liner so it’s not a big deal.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this set, and the reason why I gave it only 3 stars, it the quality and look of the lashes themselves. There really plastic feeling. Plus the magnetic strip on all of them is ridiculously thick. I’m not someone who likes that overly thick lash strip look, and much prefer a thinner band in my lashes. But these do stay on well and I had no issues with them applying to the liner and stating on throughout the day. If you like a thicker band then you might like these, but for me they just looked overly done.",319591,3686
4.0,1613228049649,Not a bad choice at all considering price point,"This is a pretty solid hair straightener considering the price point. One of my biggest pet peeves with cheaper hair straighteners is that the plates tend to not be smooth and you can feel it catching on your hair, basically a lot of times they don’t glide through like they should. However I did not have that problem at all with this one and It easily glided though my hair.<br /><br />Holding it is easy and it feels comfortable in your hand. The temp adjusts from 300F-450F, and it heats up in about a minute. It has an auto shut off after 60 min, which is a pretty long shut off time but at least it has that built in. The button to control it is on the inside which I always prefer since that means I can’t accidentally press the button as I’m using it. The only downside with this is that it’s not good for creating curls or waves like most straighteners are these days. The shape of it makes it incapable of doing this.

Despite what you might think because of my 1 star review, I actually LOVE a lot of Caudalie products. In fact a few of them are staples that I always make sure I have at any given time. So why the one star review you might ask?<br /><br />This set is a complete and total rip off!!! I saw that they had beauty elixir in this and jumped on it without even looking at the sizes. I assumed since it said $106 value these were gonna be at the very least deluxe travel size. No these are legit sample size. Not to mention there radiance serum, Creme sorbet, and premier cru eye cream are terrible. The instant foaming cleanser is ok and I love the beauty elixir but the other 3 are so bad. The eye cream pills like crazy and makes you eyes legit drier. The radiance serum is sticky and does nothing. And the creme sorbet looks like cottage cheese and leave this like film over your face. Also if you apply the eye cream and the serum Sparingly once a day you might get 5 days use out of them. The creme sorbet maybe a week.

4.0,1609551360956,California Love from Armenia: Ingredients (includes a sulfate),"A small amount of this lathers and cleans well. Rinses away easily, doesn't seem to dry my scalp or leave my hair unruly.<br /><br />The scent is distinctly fruity, in keeping with the muscat (grape) theme, sweet but not cloying, with some citrus. I like it.<br /><br />250ml is about 8-1/2 fluid ounces, so don't expect a large container.<br /><br />The description says this has no sulfates, but the first ingredient is one. Sodium laureth sulfate, or SLES, isn't SLS, which some are trying to avoid, but it's still a sulfate, a milder one, that a few may find to be an irritant.<br /><br />Cocamidopropyl betaine was once believed to be an allergen, but it turned out it was impurities from the manufacturing process, hopefully avoided here.<br /><br />Ingredients (with corrected spellings): Sodium laureth sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, glycol distearate, cocodiethanolamide, trimethylcetylammonium chloride, polyquaternium-16, keratin, sodium benzoate, fragrance, citric acid.<br /><br />Manufactured in May, 2020.<br /><br />Made in Armenia.",323453,2279
4.0,1586557682046,OK,"There are a couple complaints about the case, but it's actually one of the better features of this kit, attractive, nicely padded, secure, with a place for everything, though it's a test of dexterity to get some of the tools out of their place. Just keep everything where it belongs and it closes easily with a snap.<br /><br />The tools are mostly fine. They're adequately sturdy. The scissors are a little thin and flexible for tough cuts, but they're supposed to be for trimming facial hair, for which they're fine.<br /><br />The fit and finish of a few of the tools isn't the best. A couple of the nail clippers have a little overbite, where one blade doesn't perfectly align with the other, which can make for messier cuts. And a couple of the blades on the callus removers are pitted a little.<br /><br />On the whole, it's an adequate kit for nail and foot care and grooming.<br /><br />Made in China.",323453,1681
4.0,1585731517981,"No fakes: Two different basic ingredient lists, one regular, one ""sensitive""","There's been some distress recently over supposed fakes or the ingredients being changed, but it appears they aren't fake and haven't changed.<br /><br />I checked in the Wayback Machine, and the ingredients for the one I checked (Coconut & Vanilla) were the same at the Native website on January 2, 2019 as they are now.<br /><br />The confusion is that there are two different versions, one regular and one called ""sensitive,"" for several of the same scents (including Coconut & Vanilla), and they have very different basic ingredient lists. I've verified this at the Native website.<br /><br />Here's the basic ingredient list for the regular versions. (Some fragrance ingredients are also added for all but the unscented.)<br /><br />Caprylic/capric triglyceride, tapioca starch, ozokerite, sodium bicarbonate, magnesium hydroxide, Cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, cyclodextrin, Butyrospermium parkii (shea) butter, dextrose (glucose), Lactobacillus acidophilus.<br /><br />Here's the list for the sensitive versions:<br /><br />Caprylic/capric triglyceride, arrowroot powder, stearyl alcohol, baking soda, shea butter, coconut oil, hydrogenated castor oil, polyglycerol-3 beeswax, jojoba esters, L. acidophilus, maltodextrin, glyceryl caprylate, glyceryl undecylenate, tocopherol (vitamin E).<br /><br />I got the regular version of Peony & Jasmine Tea, Sweet Almond & Honey, and Linen & Cotton Flower. Those are sold as women's scents at the Native website, and they are quite sweet and flowery. The peony one is less strong than the other two scent-wise.<br /><br />They work fine, as these things go, pretty good for deodorizing, not designed to be anti-wet.<br /><br />They go on fairly dry, not very sticky (make sure you're dry first).<br /><br />Doesn't take a lot. No problem with stains.",323453,330
3.0,1584573213993,Step 1: switch the lids; Lots of ingredients and plant stuff in the shampoo,"A lot of the early reviews for this are going to be negative because they shipped the way-too-thick conditioner with a pump-top that doesn't work with it. They should have made it less thick, or shipped it in a wide-mouth jar you could scoop it out of like face cream, but since they didn't, the easiest thing is to switch the lids. The pump-top works fine on the shampoo. The press-open top on the conditioner is still a bother, but turning it upside down and rapping it on something to drive the conditioner to the opening does work. Don't break it.<br /><br />Supposing they'll fix this, how's the shampoo and conditioner?<br /><br />Well, speaking of face cream, the first thing I noticed was the unusual fragrance. Unusual for shampoo and conditioner, I mean. It reminds me of some face and other skin creams, sweet and vaguely flowery. It's light and pleasant enough, though some men may want something more traditional for them. And possibly those with extra-sensitive noses may be able to detect the garlic in the shampoo. (Yes, garlic. There are actually garlic shampoos, with a lot more garlic than here, some of which claim not to smell like garlic.) No garlic in the conditioner.<br /><br />The shampoo is thick and lathers well and cleans well.<br /><br />The ultra-thick conditioner, once you manage to get it on your hair, is fine, leaves my hair soft and combable.<br /><br />The ingredients (given below) look fairly conventional for the most part, a mix of synthetic and natural. For the shampoo, the collagen is the 17th ingredient by weight, so under 6% (probably far less), and the keratin is 28th, under 4% (probably far less). For the conditioner, the keratin is the 12th ingredient, meaning it could be as much as 8% (though again probably far less). For all I know that's plenty for what they're supposed to do.<br /><br />There's a lot of plant stuff in the shampoo, some only given in Latin, so here's the translation of the rest. Besides the acai, Matricaria (German chamomile), echinacea, garlic, lemon, sage, and spirulina, the shampoo has:<br /><br />Argania spinosa = argan<br />Symphytum officinale = comfrey<br />Trigonella foenum-graecum = fenugreek<br />Quercus alba = white oak<br />Viola tricolor = viola, or Johnny jumpup<br /><br />The conditioner also has some argan and acai, and adds:<br /><br />Fucus vesiculosus = bladderwrack (a seaweed)<br /><br />Some people prefer not to have the amodimethicone, here in both the shampoo and conditioner, a silicone some say is hard to rinse out, though others praise it for its conditioning effects particularly with bleached hair and for its limited buildup.<br /><br />Similarly, there's dimethicone in the conditioner, which some find to build up over time, while others don't seem to notice any trouble with that and enjoy its conditioning and emollient qualities.<br /><br />The silicone quaternium-16 is supposed to be a good silicone for rinsing out.<br /><br />For the conditioner, keep in mind that cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol are fatty substances, not at all like the alcohol used for drinking or rubbing. They won't dry out your hair, just the opposite.<br /><br />Shampoo: Water, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, glycerin, acrylates copolymer, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, fragrance, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium cocoamphoacetate, guar hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride, panthenol, glycol distearate, laureth-4, lauryl glucoside, sodium lauryl glucose carboxylate, sodium cocoyl glutamate, hydrolyzed collagen, amodimethicone, trideceth-12, cetrimonium chloride, silicone quaternium-16, undeceth-11, butyloctanol, undeceth-5, Argania spinosa kernel oil, Euterpe oleracea (Acai) fruit extract, polyquaternium-70, hydrolyzed keratin, propylene glycol, Chamomilla recutita (Matricaria) flower extract, Symphytum officinale leaf extract, Echinacea purpurea extract, Trigonella foenum-graecum fruit extract, Allium sativum (garlic) bulb extract, citrus limon (lemon) fruit extract, propolis extract, Salvia officinalis (sage) leaf extract, Spirulina maxima extract, Quercus alba bark extract, Viola tricolor extract, citric acid, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, tetrasodium EDTA, benzyl salicylate, coumarin, hexyl cinnamal, hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, linalool, butylphenyl methylpropional, alpha-isomethyl ionone.<br /><br />Conditioner: Water, cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, glycerin, polyquaternium-11, panthenol, amodimethicone, centrimonium bromide, butylene glycol, Fucus vesiculosus extract, hydrolyzed keratin, dimethicone, tocopheryl acetate, Argania spinosa kernel oil, Euterpe oleracea (Acai) fruit extract, polyquaternium-70, disodium EDTA, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, benzyl salicylate, coumarin, hexyl cinnamal, hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, linalool, butylphenyl methylpropional, alpha-isomethyl ionone.<br /><br />Each bottle came wrapped in plastic.

4.0,1582868415171,"Color, ingredients","The frosted glass looks good. The color of the plastic and silicone parts is darker than in photos, though. Judging from the website it's supposed to be off-white, actually called ""classic linen,"" but the ones they sent out seem to be more beige. If that doesn't suit, there's also a ""midnight blue"" color available, which is a sort of medium gray blue judging from the photos (which may or may not be reliable).<br /><br />Or you can take the silicone skirt off this--it's made so it's removable, good for occasional cleaning--and replace the push top with whatever color you want. It's a standard size. I think it looks better without the skirt even with the beige top. Just be careful not to break the bottle. It feels pretty sturdy.<br /><br />The scent of the soap is lavender with citrus. (Not coconut--that's in the photo because it's where some of the saponified oil comes from.)<br /><br />It washes well, doesn't leave any noticeable residue for me, though I suppose the aloe juice is intended to moisturize some.<br /><br />It comes oddly over-packaged but in cardboard that can be recycled or biodegraded.<br /><br />The ingredients given at the website are:<br /><br />Saponified coconut oil, saponified olive oil, potassium soap, aloe juice, citric acid, sodium chloride (table salt), natural essential oil blend, vitamin E.<br /><br />It's not clear why potassium soap is listed separately from the saponified oils, since that's what potassium soap is, oils turned into soap by the addition of potassium hydroxide (potash).",323453,2342

The emphasis is on safe ingredients.<br /><br />This is the first deodorant I've tried with a cream-extrusion applicator. Took a few tries to figure out how much to use. After that it seems to work pretty well, though it's hard to tell if it's better than others I've tried. Goes on fairly dry feeling.<br /><br />As with others, it seems to me the scented ones create a better overall effect than the unscented. Masking helps.<br /><br />The Evergreen Forest (Adventurer) scent is very much what the name implies, much like pine sap, fairly strong when going on, not as noticeable later. I love that smell, but I've heard some don't.<br /><br />Modern Spice (Maverick) is indeed spicy. I mainly smell something cinnamony, but there's no cinnamon in it. Maybe the balsam. There's also eucalyptus, patchouli, vanilla, cedar and peppermint.<br /><br />The Fragrance-Free (Minimalist) does have a scent, no doubt due to some of the plant ingredients. It's a dull earthy, slightly spicy scent.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients for each:<br /><br />Adventurer: diisopropyl adipate, glycerin (organic, vegetable derived), beeswax, dimethicone, heptyl undecylenate, Maranta arundinacea (arrowroot) root powder, sodium bicarbonate, Zea mays (corn) starch, triethyl citrate, sorbitan oleate, Copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, glyceryl stearate, Cocos nucifera (coconut) oil (organic), tapioca starch, Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf extract (organic), Thuja occidentalis (northern white cedar) leaf oil, Thuja plicata (western red cedar) wood oil, Abies sibirica (siberian fir) oil, Eucalyptus globulus (eucalyptus) leaf oil, Pogostemon cablin (patchouli) oil, Pelargonium graveolens (geranium) oil, Lavandula hybrida (lavandin) oil, Canarium luzonicum (elemi) gum nonvolatiles, raspberry ketone, Mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, zinc citrate, water, bisabolol, titanium dioxide, silver chloride.<br /><br />Maverick: diisopropyl adipate, glycerin (organic, vegetable derived), beeswax, dimethicone, heptyl undecylenate, Maranta arundinacea (arrowroot) root powder, sodium bicarbonate, Zea mays (corn) starch, triethyl citrate, sorbitan oleate, Copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, glyceryl stearate, Cocos nucifera (coconut) oil (organic), tapioca starch, Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf extract, Eucalyptus globulus (eucalyptus) leaf oil, Pogostemon cablin (patchouli) leaf extract, vanillin, Myroxylon pereirae (Peru balsam) oil, Vetiveria zizanoides (vetiver) root oil, Juniperis virginiana (Virginia red cedar) oil, Mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, Cistus ladaniferus (rock rose) oil, Dipteryx odorata [tonka bean] seed extract, zinc citrate, water, bisabolol, titanium dioxide, silver chloride.<br /><br />Minimalist: diisopropyl adipate, glycerin (organic, vegetable derived), dimethicone, beeswax, heptyl undecylenate, sodium bicarbonate, Maranta arundinacea (arrowroot) powder, sorbitan oleate, Zea mays (corn) starch, Copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax, triethyl citrate, glyceryl stearate, Cocos nucifera (coconut) oil (organic), zeolite, tapioca starch, Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf extract, zinc citrate, water, bisabolol, titanium dioxide, silver chloride.",323453,2339

Battery Life  has lasted a long time so  far I've been using it for a month and battery life is still good.

So I am assuming for men if you have a very small head then they will work. And I believe most women will fit these. I like the colors in the plastic is very soft.

I make soap so I know what a oil smells like when it is no longer good and this smells just like that. It is oily and greasy and smells terrible. It didnt dry out my skin but I couldn't wear it for long due to the oil smell. It seems to lightly give some tinted coverage but not much. If the oils were not so strong smelling and much fresher I think this might be ok to use. The expiration date is listed as being 3/31/22 so I am surprised at the low quality of oils used and that they are no longer very good.,327751,746

The scent has a strong minty and almost medicinal fragrance thanks to the menthol, though it's balanced with other fragrances that give it a pleasing masculine scent.  It also has the cool feel on the skin that you would expect with the menthol.  I like it for a nice invigorating wake up shower, but don't like it on cold mornings where the cooling adds to the feeling cold when I get out of the shower.  Good stuff on the right day!",327783,1035

I absolutely love the lemon scent.  It has a saltiness to it that makes it a very unique but nice scent.  The light weight texture combined with the scent make this a great product.  My only complaint is that once the lid is turned to open, it can be hard to press down on the top to get some of the lotion out.  The bottle is slippery once I have lotion on my hands and so sometimes it is hard to keep open so a minor design flaw but the product is great and I really think it works well on my more mature skin.",327783,2993

I was hoping this would make an immediate difference.  I was pleasantly surprised that the pain was minimal as anything with ""needle"" makes me nervous.  I noticed some redness on the skin where I used the roller but the pain was not really noticeable.  I did not notice a real difference and am not sure that the red light is strong enough to make any true difference.  The roller and handle were both a good size and easy to maneuver on different areas of my face.

5.0,1529246793630,Great human hair for under $200!,"Okay let’s start by saying human hair lace front wigs for under $200 are rare. Good ones are almost impossible to find. This one is well worth the money. I ordered the 18” and when I received it (prime 2 days) it looked like a hot mess. Yellow, body wave soft but messy. I colored it with medium ash blond and light ash blond box color. It took the ash color too well! I went back and redid it in pale beige blond and lightened it up. I still need to do platinum highlights and a shadow root. I conditioned, blow dried and straightened with a flat iron. It straightened absolutely beautifully. I cut off about 3” because sadly the ends were too thin. The hair is gorgeous though. I curl it with a 1 1/4” curling iron and it looks great at first but curl doesn’t stay well in humidity. It remains soft smooth and silky though. Now the cap-lace front appears pretty much preplucked. I plucked my part. I did not pluck the edges as they were great as is. Lace melted into my hairline. Cap is comfortable and wefts do not show. Good natural density. My one issue:: this cap is BIG. That’s perfect if you have a bigger head or tons of bio hair but I don’t. I’m a petite average and the bigger circumference on this wig makes it difficult to lay the lace without overlap and buckling. Also the cap itself is a little baggy on me.

4.0,1547145600701,BEWARE: Soft ... NOT Extra Soft,"First and foremost, the brushes I received are marked ""SOFT"" not ""Extra Soft"" as product title says.  I received eight (8) brushes in two sealed packaged of four (4) each.  I actually like the fact that the OEM Oral-B brushes are all in individually sealed packaging when you buy them in bulk.  I just think the individual packaging lends itself to the brushes remaining sterile until they are ready to be used.  I did notice some difference in the overall quality of the brush heads in comparison to the OEM heads.  The description refers to flossing action bristles; but the OEM Oral-B actually have several rubber flossing bristles amongst the other bristles.  These replacement brushes do not have the specialized flossing bristles.  But, all in all, these brushes seem to do a good job of cleaning my teeth at a FRACTION of the OEM cost.  They fit my Oral-B toothbrush body well, they stay in place, and they agitate properly.  Although the quality is not identical, these brush heads are a VERY GOOD option for a budget-conscious household.",337982,2034

The only positive is that it doesn't strip my nails or make them feel brittle, but that's probably because it has very little acetone in it.

4.0,1630272807134,It leaves my skin looking beautiful,I was a little apprehensive of this cleanser because the smell reminds me of something cheaper. I was expecting more of a high end pineapple scent. But I will have to say it cleansed extremely well and it left my 58 year old skin looking amazing. Definitely worth a try! You will want to finish off with a good moisturizer.,341415,428
5.0,1621107418771,Finally! Some top coats with pizzazz,I really love this set because it actually will take any color and add a little pizzazz. I really appreciate the fact that they included six white peel off stickers that you can either use to do a sample of the color inside each bottle or put a name on it. I chose to do the latter. They go on smooth and take probably 90 seconds to cure under the UV light. But this is a must have set for anybody doing gel nails.,341415,14862
4.0,1619916033214,Good shampoo and conditioner,So maybe I wasn’t sure exactly what I should expect after using the shampoo and conditioner. I know you’re supposed to use a different shampoo and conditioner at least once a week to get rid of build up. That’s what I was expecting this to be. It does a good job and my hair feels soft and nourished afterwards. I’m not real thrilled about the scent because it reminds me of Pantene. John Freida always puts out a top quality product so this is right up there. Definitely worth the once a week switch.,341415,131
5.0,1615766057938,Add a little fun to your life!,I watched this one show on TV where a gal was going through cancer treatment and decided to wear a pink wig while her hair was growing back. I just loved the way her hair looked and thought I would try this out on me even though I still have all my hair. It’s a very colorful pink wig but it’s a beautiful shade. Make sure you have the right skin tone because it will bring out any redness in your face. It’s a great length and super comfy to wear. You don’t need to use this just for dressing up for costumes. It can be a fun wig to wear going out for the night with your gal pals or boyfriend.,341415,138

5.0,1613327373303,Beautiful and comfortable,"So in the past year, I have started collecting headbands because my hair has been thinning on top and it’s a great way to disguise it. At this point I have about 30 headbands and this has got to be one of my favorites! You would think it would be uncomfortable or heavy with all of the rhinestones embedded on it, but not at all. They’re on there really well so you don’t have to worry about them falling off easily. And I’ve gotten so many compliments on it because it is just so different than your typical headband. The best part is that there are so many colors in the jewels that it will go with many different outfits. I can’t say enough good things about this headband.",341415,1844
5.0,1612134813733,Love these padded headbands,"So it’s official! I own 40 different headbands in different colors, textures and padding. These padded headbands are extremely comfortable and work well on a larger head like mine. Although the headband isn’t covered in actual crystals, the little plastic beads give off a little iridescent sparkle when hit by the sun. It’s quite fetching! And the color is a really nice neutral pink.",341415,2136
5.0,1610074908720,Game Changer!,I was a little nervous about using magnetic eyelashes for the first time. But these are actually very easy to use and stick well to the eyeliner as long as you do two coats.

I’m not sure if I’m doing something wrong and perhaps it may require more practice and lots of patience.<br /><br />So #1:  They look beautiful and natural.<br /><br />I attempted 3 different days to apply the lashes.<br />1st day I may have applied the lashes to soon, they immediately fell off.<br /><br />2nd day I allowed the lash glue to dry.  Lashes lasted only a couple hours and then began to fall off.<br /><br />3rd day they lasted a couple hours until they fell off again.<br /><br />The biggest issue is there were no instructions provided.",341415,1870

Aloe is great, so that's cool... I'm just not sure why you wouldn't just buy a nice organic aloe gel instead.<br /><br />The moisturizing effect with this serum is very mild. It's not sticky or runny, but it's also not super moisturizing. I generally apply it, let it sink in, and then apply straight jojoba oil as my moisturizing.

I don't think it is something I could pull off for everyday wear.<br /><br />What I really don't like about this wig, is that on the top of the wig, right on the part, there is about 2 inches of hair that is cut super short. I included photos to show what I mean. When I put the wig on, these hairs don't wanna stay down. They stick out to the side, or up in the air. I really don't understand why it was cut that way. If they are trying to do baby hairs, they definitely did it wrong. The only hair that is cut is the darker brown part, which really makes it stand out against the blonde. I don't know what they were trying to do, but it doesn't look good.<br /><br />I will probably end up cutting those pieces off and hopefully it will look ok with them gone. Having a cowlick on the top of my head just isn't the look I am going for.<br /><br />The wig itself is on par with the price. It did shed on me a bit.

I could never get them on right, one would come out better than the other, my eye would almost get glued shut, you name it. I was very interested to see how these would work for the lash challenged person like myself.<br /><br />I have become much better at applying eyeliner over the years, and I will suggest that if you do want to try these, that your eyeliner game be pretty good. The ""eyeliner"" pen is your glue with these. It comes out looking like eyeliner, a black color. You set the lashes on top of the eyeliner after a few seconds, and set them into place. These do come with a tool to help you apply your lashes, but I didn't find it to be all that helpful. My fingers and a pair of tweezers did the job. These did go on fairly easy. My first few times it did take a bit of fixing to get a better fit. Once into place, they seemed to dry really fast and stayed on very well.<br /><br />For someone like me who is lash challenged, these went on easy. Does take a bit of practice, but a lot easier than dealing with regular glue, waiting for it to get tacky, and trying not to make a mess. These are much better and easier in my opinion.",344769,5645

This is a medium and their paws barely got halfway in.  It did work, but I couldn't get their paws in very far.<br /><br />This is built really well and comes apart easily for cleaning.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty good cleaning tool for those muddy paws after a nice walk.

This brush is nice because of the trigger that easily releases all the pet hair.  It is so convenient!  It's a real cure design too.  I was initially worried that the antennae on top would easily break off but the are made of a flexible rubber.  The bristles are made of a durable metal with a white coating on the tips so they're not so sharp.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great first pet brush, or a great addition to the supplies you already have.

First let's say this packaging is unbelievably beautifully with gorgeous dissolvable orchid petals in the serum. This is a hydrating balancing serum. It makes my skin feel very soft, it works well with my other skincare products and under makeup.<br />Now the ingredient list is a tiny bit disappointing when I look how far down some of the really fantastic ingredients actually are. The real reason I took off a star is because. I personally don't love putting alot of fragrance on my skin. Fragrance (parfum) is listed midway down. The scent I admit is lovely very floral. The scent lasts a long time. So I decided to use this on my decolletage (my chest area) I usually like to bring my skincare down into that area anyway. This way the strong yet beautiful floral scent is there but so is the skincare benefits. I recommend this if you don't mind putting alot off fragrance on your face. If it didn't contain so much fragrance I would have given this 5 stars and yelled ""GET IT"" from the roof tops, because it does make my face feel so soft!",383339,4062
4.0,1614809843394,Works really well but it's a bit too pricey,I absolutely love a really good brightening mask. This mask feels very good on my skin. It yields very nice results. I'd use this before an occasion where I need to look my best. I used at night at night and it was easy to use. It didn't slide everywhere. I saved all the serum to apply to my skin the next few nights. Yes this is a very good mask. About as good as a $10-$12 mask. Which is a tiny bit pricey for a single mask for the average person. Now as good as it is $26 at time of this review is way too much for this mask. The products great and like another reviewer said if you have the disposable finances then go for it.,383339,2263

We expose our skin to alot of stresses in the environment and at night our skin rejuvenates. So I feel this is great to use while I sleep. This jar may seem small but a little goes a long way so it should last some time. It's not greasy, spreads across my face easily, and it absorbs well. It's very hydrating and it doesn't leave a shine on your face. I do use this sometimes during the day if I'm not wearing any makeup. (Like I said it looked good under makeup, I just don't use a separate moisturizer on makeup days I use a few other products and it'd be too much) Anyway when I wake up in the morning my skin really feels good. It's soft, smooth, and supple. It even has a bit more bounce back of you know what I mean. I'm impressed with this cream. It's fragrance free and doesn't irritate my skin which can be mildly sensitive. So I definitely can say I recommend it.",383339,976

If the mask was either the most amazing mask I've ever tried, you recieved more quantity for the price, or it was alot cheaper in price.

I decided to give these a try because I love a brightening mask that claims to make my skin glow. Well I ended up pretty impressed. I recieved 3 masks in a box.  I immediately saw results. My face looked bright and clear. It was very hydrating and felt cool and relaxing. Definitely great for pampering oneself. The mask is thin and biodegradable. It's filled with serum. It actually drips off the chin area. I just use that for my neck. The serum doesn't leave a film on my skin like many do. With clean hands I removed the mask after 20 minutes and massaged the serum into my skin. I also like to use my facial roller to help my skin absorb the serum. The Oh, glow on sheet masks are very good. I recommend them as part of your skincare routine.",383339,980
4.0,1599571949451,Moisturizing & Sanitizing Not greasy!,"I admit I'm a germaphobe. I always have to have some type of hand sanitizer on hand within reach. So of coarse my hands are usually dry from hand washing and sanitizing. Especially during this pandemic. I was very interested to try this and see if it lives up to its claims. It's looks and feels like a cross between lotion and hand soap. You can smell the alcohol a little bit (but I like that). This for me it's a good thing because I know it's really sanitizing my hands. It also has a nice subtle scent. This doesn't leave my hands greasy at all, which was a concern of mine. It moisturizes my hands. It does not leave any kind of film on my skin (don't use too much) which ends up picking up dirt and kinds of yucky things. (Example: after applying a greasy lotion on your hands it causes your hands to be quite dirty) My hands feel soft, not greasy, and sanitized. I think it's worth the price and it's the perfect size to easily carry in my purse. I highly recommend giving this a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",383339,30723

I follow the directions and apply a few drops on my freshly cleansed skin prior to any other products. It makes my skin feel amazingly soft. I have no trouble applying my other serums after this. I wait until this serum absorbs.  My skin has been looking so healthy. It has a new youthful bounce to it. This serum is already amazing. With continued use (which I plan on) I'm sure I'll see more results. I highly recommend this product.",383339,317
3.0,1597578588953,"Irritated, redness, inflamed","I gave this three stars a neutral rating rather than good or bad. Let me explain why. I was very interested in this product since I always use vitamin C in my regimen I'm always checking out different brands. Plus this one is also a revitalizing oil and I love products that brighten the skin. It's also a cruelty free product. It's a small bottle as you can see from my photo. Has a small dropper which is perfect since you only need a little bit. Now this product directs you to use this first after cleansing your skin before any other serums or creams. It directs 2-6 drops I recommend 2-3 or it'll be too oily. I still had a little trouble when applying my hyaluronic acid. (The drops are small). It has an awful smell that I can't place, but it's familiar from some other skincare products. This smell does go away thankfully. This product claims that your skin will feel light and refreshed. Mine didn't feel that. My skin felt nice to the touch but it felt very irritated and it was inflamed. It caused my skin to become very red (mean while I'm always trying to get rid of redness). I thought about cleaning my face off and starting over without this oil, but it was too late it was absorbed. My skin was left feeling very uncomfortable, irritated, and red. Fortunately I tried this on a day when I was just going to chill at home. I ended up applying a moisturizer that calms skin, reduces redness, and is great for sensitive skin. It helped very little with this particular issue but it usually does help. Please keep in mind that my skin is not really sensitive. Very few products have ever irritated it. I ended up very concerned about a breakout which I never get. This product is sadly not for me at all! So I gave this a neutral rating instead of a lower rating because it may work nicely for someone else. Thus far this has been my experience with this product. I really wanted to love it. Please take my entire review into account when deciding whether or not to purchase this. I personally cannot recommend this product. Especially to anyone with any skin sensitivity. I hope my review has been helpful.",383339,81

It's a nice gentle exfoliant. It has a bunch of small grinds in it. It's easy to rinse off. It's good for sensitive skin. It does a really great job cleaning and exfoliating my skin. I love the way my skin feels afterwards. It feels very smooth. I do think it's a bit overpriced though, but it definitely does its job! I just recieved this recently and it expires in two months. It was the same with a few of their other products.",383339,1092

Unfortunately this one and one other product I received expire in less than two months from when I recieved them. I have pretty nice skin because I take very good care of it. So for me 0.5% retinol is just right. It doesn't irritate my skin or dry it out which is always a concern of mine when I use any type of retinol product. This is a nice serum consistency. My skin looks healthier and brighter. It didn't cause me any redness, which can be a problem for me, nor did it cause any irritation. I recommend giving this a try along with some of their other products. Just keep in mind when ordering that a couple of products I recieved to review were very close to expiration.",383339,299
4.0,1594715443502,I REALLY enjoy this cleanser!,"This is a nice gentle cleanser. It's in gel form, reminds me of a thicker version of aloe vera. Although it's gentle on my semi sensitive skin it really gets the job done. Leaves my skin feeling clean without feeling dry and tight. I love the way my skin feels after I use it. Soft, healthy, and smooth. I feel like my skin glows. It is a bit pricey but it does a great job. After reading the directions I was a little confused<br />It says ""apply through dampened fingers"" is my face supposed to be wet? Well I  did lightly wet my face before applying along with my fingers. As I added water it lathered up and felt great. It's nice and gentle, there was no redness after use. I hoped this helped. I do recommend trying this cleanser.",383339,1010
5.0,1593822367461,Really cleans out pores,This is a wonderful clay mask. It's a little thick coming out but it's very easy to spread. Has a nice subtle sweet scent. You'll feel the mask warm up a bit when it begins to work. So don't think you're having a reaction it's just how it works. You can actually start seeing speckles in the areas where the pores have been cleaned out. It was so easy to remove. I used a warm wet cloth and easily wiped it off. My skin was so smooth and so fresh looking. My pores were so clean and clear. They appeared smaller and tighter. I'm really happy with this mask. Now if you look at the photo I uploaded you'll see the expiration date is 9/20 which is only two months away. The directions recommend using once to twice a week. There's no way I'll finish this before it expires. (Just a side note: I also recieved a retinoid cream from the same brand with the same expression date) and I just recieved these products. Just keep that in mind when purchasing. Product wise though is a definite 5 stars!,383339,1004
5.0,1586076772113,Works great!,I always double cleanse. I first start with either a makeup wipe or micellar water. Then I go in with this. In the past I've tried Farmacy green clean and Pixie's balm cleanser (which is very good). I admit I was skeptical since I hadn't heard of it. I was pleasantly surprised! It gets all the makeup residue off my skin.  It has a subtle rose 8scent. If scents bother you it goes away and it its very subtle. I love it. If you're into Korean skincare or are getting into it I recommend trying this.,383339,1121
4.0,1581992104379,Very nice,I've been using this for about 10 days now. I don't know what if anything it's doing long term yet. So far though I'm enjoying this serum. It has fantastic ingredients.

5.0,1579320083415,Amazingly soft skin,I'm a big fan of argan oil and have tried quite a few. I love this big 4 oz bottle because I like to use it on my body. This one is not as thick as other brands I've tried. I've used it mixed with lotion like I've used others but this one spreads easier and absorbs quicker. It leaves my skin like silk. I have dry skin all year round but winter it's the worst. This has helped it dramatically. The best is I can use this one by itself and it doesn't leave my skin too oily. It just feels amazing!

3.0,1654057606690,Flimsy,The brush is really flimsy so it just bends when it's supposed to brush your hair. Some assembly is required for the brush but the insert piece that is supposed to stabilize it doesn't stay in well which just makes the brush more flimsy. The spray bottle does a good job spraying but only sprays for slightly longer than a normal spray bottle. The comb is pretty nice though. It's durable and works well for thick curly hair.,383340,47748
4.0,1651367441020,They stay in place,"It was kinda hard getting my hair through the hole. Mostly because my hair is very curly and it kept catching on the little spikes on the inside. Once I got it through though, it stayed in place all day. It wasn't loose but it wasn't as tight as a ponytail and I kept having the urge to tighten it, which of course I could not do. It did not however work well at all for my daughter, 5. It started out ok but had completely come undone by the end of the day.",383340,445
4.0,1655669284693,A bit too stiff for me,I tried using this to straighten out some unruly hairs in my extremely curly mustache.  It was a tough assignment due to the natural curl in my facial hair and I had to use a heavy application to try to achieve my desired results.  Unfortunately the natural curl won out unless I used so much wax that my mustache took on an unnaturally stiff appearance.  Haven't found a product that produces the results I'm after just yet.

I tried massaging it in several times during that period, but it just never seemed to absorb very well. Since, as stated, my skin is normally very dry, feeling oily and greasy is very uncomfortable and undesirable to me. Based on the rave reviews, I had very high hopes for this serum, which is why I ordered the larger (and incredibly more expensive) 66 ml size. Lesson learned. I will pass this along to my sister, and maybe she will have the incredible results that seem to elude me. Based on my personal results, however, I'm rating this 3 stars.",383346,30711
5.0,1647212847411,Great for Legs and Underarms,"I ordered this for my wife, and she is thrilled to have it so that she can be ready when shorts and swimsuit season arrives. Not having to shave every day will be an absolute blessing for her. This SmoothSkin Pure Fit Intelligent Ultrafast IPL Laser Hair removal device comes with the device itself, a power cord, an optional precision head for use on smaller areas, and a detailed instruction book. Since this device does not work if the skin is too dark or the hair is too light, it is important to check the online skin suitability chart before purchasing to make sure that this device will actually work for the user. My wife's skin and hair color fell within the effective range, so she was good to go when this arrived. Also, since this device can make the skin photosensitive during the course of treatment, winter is the best time to start the initial 12 week course of hair removal. For those who live in a place where there really isn't much of a winter, just be aware that skin needs to be protected from the sun during this treatment period. Since my wife is still in the early phases of this treatment and it's already mid-March, she'll be cutting it kind of close. Worse case scenario, though, she can at least get a month or so of treatments done and then resume and/or start her treatment over again when winter is back. This SmoothSkin device has two modes for treatments, Glide, which is just like it sounds and is a continuous firing as the device glides along the skin in a steady movement, or Stamp, which is a single controlled burst at a time, designed for areas where you want tighter control over when and where the light fires, such as on the upper lip. There are also three treatment intensities, Power, which is the highest setting and good for larger areas, Gentle, for sensitive areas (also recommended when first starting IPL and getting used to how it feels), and Speed, the fastest treatment mode, for quickly covering larger areas and for doing fast touch-ups. This sounds complicated, but after my wife began doing these treatments once a week, she found that it was actually fairly easy to do. Granted, she is just doing legs and underarms for now, which are fairly basic. My wife's initial opinion of this SmoothSkin Pure Fit IPL laser hair removal device is extremely positive. It's easy to learn, easy to do, can be done in the privacy of our own home and at a time that is convenient for her, and is far cheaper than having either IPL or laser hair removal treatments done in a shop. Not only that, but so far it's working.",383346,6007
3.0,1643384874249,Strong Clay Scent,"I like everything about this BOB Bars Over Bottles shampoo bar except the scent, which unfortunately is a major player with me. The shampoo bar is packaged in an environmentally beneficial way, with a recyclable cardboard box just large enough to contain the soap and its paper wrapping. It is plastic free, vegan, cruelty free, and it uses natural ingredients. The ingredients include green clay, lemongrass, rosemary, and peppermint. I truly enjoy the scents of lemongrass, rosemary, and peppermint, so I didn't give the green clay part any thought at all prior to ordering this bar. Unfortunately, the scent of the green clay overwhelms the other scents enormously, and I don't find the wet clay smell enjoyable at all. The soap lathers and cleans well, and rinses out nicely. However, I don't want to wash my hair with something that smells unpleasant to me, especially since there are so many competing shampoo bars that smell wonderful and are just as environmentally friendly.",383346,4866

This bar works great for home or travel. Since there is no liquid for TSA to have to approve, I can keep this in my carry-on luggage if I'm flying somewhere. It's small size makes it easy to pack.  One of these bars lasts forever, so I can keep it in my travel kit and use it for multiple trips. It's also good for home use, taking up very little space in my shower caddy. The scent of this conditioner bar is very pleasant. This conditioner bar contains Pracaxi oil, which is a vitamin rich hair oil that hydrates, promotes hair growth, and strengthens damaged hair. This conditioner bar is also vegan and is cruelty free. That is an awful lot of good reasons for me to absolutely love this conditioner bar, and I am happy I ordered it.",383346,4618
5.0,1638585041518,"Nice Presentation, Great Positive Message, Very Giftable","This gift set makes a great first impression. The box is black trimmed in gold. On the cover there is a gold outline of a compact mirror. Inside that outline it says, ""Not a Day Over Fabulous."" Inside, there is a nice large white woven cosmetic bag (that of course could be used for lots of other things, too), a 4"" square jewelry plate, and a gold compact mirror. All say in flowing script, ""Beautiful girl you can do fabulous things."" The compact case has the same inscription on both the front and back cover, which is great. In its brand new state, the writing on the compact mirror doesn't show up well from a distance, but I think with use the engraved area will darken a bit and the writing will be better seen. The message is meant for the one holding the mirror, anyway, and not others nearby, so even if it doesn't darken, it still delivers inspiration where it's intended. The mirror quality is good. These items make a perfect gift set to give to a girl in age or a girl at heart, and I'm sure would be appreciated by either.",383346,194

It comes in an 8 fl. oz. (240 ml) plastic bottle with a push top cap and a couple of cute sea turtles on the label. The lotion is thick and white and contains lots of ingredients that are wonderful for my skin--oils, botanical extracts, aloe, shea butter, etc. My skin is left smooth, soft, well hydrated, and smelling wonderful. This body lotion currently sells for $14.99, and I consider it a good value for kids and adults alike.",383346,2218
5.0,1631740443936,Very Nice Pre-Wrapped Gift Set for Moms of All Ages,"This is an absolutely wonderful gift set that is even nicely pre-wrapped with colorful paper and a beige ribbon and bow. The back of the box has a label explaining what's inside, but because of the type of adhesive and the type of glossy wrapping used, this label can be easily peeled off with no sticky adhesive remnant on the wrapping paper (see my before and after photos). Inside the wrapper, is a plain white sturdy cardboard box. Inside, there is a wrapped square bar of scented soap, a box of dried rose petals that look and smell pretty, and three rose and lavender scented bath bombs that spell out the word ""MOM."" The ""O"" in ""MOM"" is shaped like a pink heart. All these items are resting on a bed of white nesting paper. Both the wrapping paper for the soap and the cardboard of the box containing the rose petals have the same pattern as the outer wrapping paper. Among other ingredients, each bath bomb contains coconut oil, sea salt, and shea butter. For the dried rose petals, it says to place them in still, warm bath water. It also says to drain the bath as usual as the dried florals are biodegradable. This gift is not just for Mother's Day, it's for any mom, any day, who would enjoy a thoughtful gift and a relaxing bath with these lovely scented bath bombs.",383346,198
4.0,1630506327082,Can Definitely Feel the Heat,"This order comes with two 60 ml tubes of slimming cream. I use a disposable glove to apply it, and that keeps me from accidentally getting it in my eyes or anywhere else I don't intend for it to be. My focus area with this cream is my abdomen, admittedly one of the hardest areas to lose belly fat regardless of method. The burn is delayed for about 10 minutes, but when it starts, I can definitely feel it. It's a strong sensation, but not painful, and it reassures me that the cream is activating. Like probably many other folks who use this cream, I am also doing other things at the same time to try and lose weight: watching what I eat, exercising more, drinking more water, etc. Therefore, even though I am very slowly seeing a reduction in my belly fat, it's difficult for me to say how much of that is from using this cream and how much is from the other measures that I am taking to produce the same result. I consider $12.98 for two tubes a reasonable price for adding this cream to my weight loss efforts, and will continue to use it as long as I continue to see results.",383346,30720

It fits easily into carry-on luggage, a shaving kit, or a backpack. To me the scent smelled more like chalk than coconut, but it lathers well, cleans thoroughly, and washes out well with no residual scent, so I'm not docking it any stars for the scent. I don't see myself reordering it at the current list price of $13.00 (13% off the original price of $15.00), because there are many other bars with a more pleasant fragrance that do just as good a job, but I will gladly use the rest of this bar without complaint. No matter what, shampoo bars are handy for traveling and are great for the environment, and I like the eco-friendly packaging of just a simply, recyclable cardboard box and no plastic wrapper.",383346,1831
5.0,1624496395044,So Much More than Just an Air Freshener,"I never in my life would have thought I'd consider an air freshener as a giftable item, except perhaps as a gag gift to one of my brothers. This Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener, however, is in a class all by itself. Even the box it comes in is beautiful, with soft sweeping white and beige brush strokes in the background and beautiful flowers embossed in gold. The pattern wraps all the way around the box, with each side being different. The inside of the box is a vivid lime green. The spray bottle for the air freshener looks more like a perfume bottle, light and dark pink with more of the gold embossing, this time with leaves instead of flowers. The key ingredients of this air freshener are water, hibiscus oil, and hydrogenated castor oil. The bottle contains 3.38 fl oz (100 ml). The directions say to wash linens and clothes before spraying this linen mist on them. It says this spray can be used on sheets, furniture fabric, drapes, pillows, and directly in the room as an air freshener. It also says to shake the bottle well before using it. When sprayed, the hibiscus scent is very subtle and faint, but definitely there. My wife had me spray some on the blouse she was wearing so that she could enjoy the hibiscus scent all day long, and she plans to spray her pillow before she goes to sleep. For a soft, gentle hibiscus aroma that stays pleasantly in the background without overwhelming my senses, this Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener works well.",383347,204
4.0,1622406959008,Good gritty feel,"I like a facial scrub that I can actually feel scrubbing and this Disco scrub meets that criteria.  In the attached photo you can see the grit contained in the scrub.  The directions say to use a amount equal to a penny and my experience says that's enough to do a good job of exfoliating facial skin.  The scent to me seemed like a burnt avocado, not particularly pleasant but I'm not using it for the scent and the scent rinses off.  I deducted one-star for the price which seems a bit steep to me.  My regular scrub costs significantly less and exfoliates as well if not a bit better.  Good to try, good as a gift but I probably wouldn't buy again.",383347,2909
5.0,1621305207644,"Not Just a Name, The Shampoo and Conditioner Really Are Purple","I got this shampoo and conditioner for my wife--here is her review: I wanted this shampoo and conditioner because it said it worked really well for gray and white hair--as a senior I have plenty of both--and because it got good reviews re fragrance and how soft it left hair. When I was in the shower and squirted some shampoo into my hand, I was amazed to see that the shampoo really is a dark purple color. I asked myself if I could live with it if it actually turned my hair purple, decided I could, and lathered up. The shampoo did an excellent job of creating a strong lather, and my hair felt really clean when I rinsed it out. The shampoo has a soft floral fragrance that is very pleasant. I took a quick look in the mirror to see if my hair was purple, and it wasn't, so I then squirted out some conditioner into my hand. It was purple, too, although thicker and lighter in color than the shampoo. As I rubbed the conditioner into my hair, the wonderful floral scent of the conditioner filled my shower--what a delightful sensory treat! I checked my hair again when I got out of the shower and dried off--still no purple hair, thank goodness. However, when I squirted some shampoo into my hand to take a photo, there was a big purple stain on my hand when I washed the shampoo off. I squirted the conditioner in a different spot on my hand for that photo, and it did the same thing. I've washed my hands several times since then, and the purple stains are still there. So...even though the product information online says it works fine with gray and white hair, I look down at my purple stains on my hand and I have to wonder. Since I love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and how incredibly soft it leaves my hair, I'm going to continue using it. If it turns my hair purple at some point in the future, I'll do an update and give everyone fair warning.",383347,2357
3.0,1610305473892,Not at $34 a pop,"I've got a bad back and regularly do Epsom salt soaks in very warm to hot water.  I usually pay about $5 for a bag of Epsom salt that's good for 4-5 baths.  That's about $1 per soak.  The Pursoma Digital Detox Bath Soak did about as much to relax me and relief pain as the Epsom salt and with the Epsom salt I don't have to shower to remove the ""mud"" and rinse out the mud/dirt from the tub after using it.  I suspect more of the relaxation comes from the hot water and length of time a person soaks as it does from any additive put in the water.  With the Epsom salt baths I can also add in a bath bomb for a couple bucks more and enjoy the aroma and moisturizing effects of the bomb.  I'll stick with my routine.",383347,45359

I followed the directions and put one of the balls in a dish and poured boiling water over it.  It was kind of fun to watch it re-hydrate but that was about the end of the enjoyment.  The ""fragrance"" given off by these petal balls was akin to a weak tea although I surely wouldn't drink it.  As for putting one in a tub, I suspect the ""bloom"" would clog up the drain and just create a mess.  Plus I don't want to take a bath in a pot of tea.  I'll have to pass on this one.",383347,241

There are individual slide-in holders for each pair of tweezers and the scissors.  There isn't a slot for the brush but I just put it in with one of the tweezers.  The quality of the tweezers is outstanding.  They appear to be very well machined and they passed my ""grab a hair"" test.  What I do is try to grad a single fine hair off of my arm.  If the tweezers get it in one try and can hold on to it to pull it out, they pass.  Each pair of tweezers passed the test.  Another thing I like is that this set doesn't have a bunch of needless junk in it that just takes up room.  This set can fit in my shaving kit without taking up extra space.

I didn't know what that little metal-tined thing (photo 2) was for.  I figured it was a mustache comb and I have a mustache so I gave it a try.  Worked great!  The little tines penetrated the mustache hairs and felt great on the underlying skin.  Kinda like an exfoliater!  I loved it.

I like this lipstick and I would like to order Chilly Jilly but I think the price is on the high side for this lipstick, so I will probably pass on it.",383363,681
3.0,1666805038080,"Reduced redness & hydrating, but need ingredient list in ENGLISH!","This comes in a nice outer product box. Made in Korea. The brand’s website said it’s 100% vegan, excluding animal ingredients and animal experiments. It also doesn’t include parabens.<br /><br />It comes in a nice compact. It’s a compact like a cushion foundation where you open it and there’s a kind of lid that holds the sponge applicator, and you lift that lid to reveal the product. You press the applicator sponge into it (or your own sponge or brush) and then apply it. The brand’s website said the included sponge applicator is an “eco puff” made of “eco-friendly corns” and is “99.9% anti-bacterial and water-repellent,” which makes it safe on skin and keeps puff clean.<br /><br />This is a liquidy but balm kind of texture. It isn’t as thick as a balm. It just feels like a cushion foundation. But this isn’t a foundation. It has a very light, mint green color to it. It’s so light that it’s almost white but has the green color to it. When applied, it reduces redness. It doesn’t do as well as my more pigmented green correctors, but it does a nice job while being hydrating and lightweight on the skin. It’s something that works well before applying foundation. It is lightweight enough to wear well under foundation. It isn’t a primer really, it doesn’t smooth out the skin or fill in pores. But, it does reduce the redness in my skin so then I use less foundation and concealer. If you have a TON of redness or it’s REALLY red, this might not be enough since it isn’t extremely pigmented. But, it will make a difference. I like it isn’t drying on the skin either.<br /><br />I’m just not sure how I feel about it though. It works well on the skin. But, I do like to know what’s in my products. I don’t like that they provided barely any product info, and the ingredients on the product box weren’t in English. They also didn’t include them here on the product page. Not even the product photos provided any real info on the product - what it does, who it’s for, how to use it, ingredients, etc. I had to go to the brand’s website to find out more. Yes, it’s a simple Google search, but it’s not really something you  should have to do.<br /><br />Normally, I would just go to the brand’s website to find the list of ingredients when they’re not included on the Amazon product page. But, the Jung Saem Mool website didn’t have them on their website either. I looked for them elsewhere and did find an ingredient list on Korean Beauty Box, but didn’t think they were accurate because they didn’t include centella asiatica, pine sprout, or green calamine powder, which are supposed to be in this product. So, I translated the ingredients from the box myself. But, I’m not that confident in the ingredients provided on the box.(I included a photo from the box, and also included the ingredients at the end of my review in English)<br /><br />It doesn’t seem like a complete list of ingredients to me. It has the first ingredient as titanium dioxide. It has tocopherol (vitamin E) as the 3rd ingredient. The rest of the ingredient are 7, kind of versions I’d guess you’d call them, of centella asiatica. There’s nothing else listed. It’s kind of odd. The brand’s website said this is supposed to have “2 plants - pine sprout containing fresh moisture and centella asiatica roots.” I saw the “centella asiatica roots” in the ingredients when I translated them. But didn’t see any “pine sprout.” I also saw something about “cica pine water” on the brand’s website, but again, not sure what that’s supposed to be? The brand’s website also mentioned “Natural green calamine powder covers reddened skin tone.” Again, I didn’t see any calamine powder at all in the ingredients.<br /><br />The 7, I guess versions, of Centella Asiatica are:<br />Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm) - Well known soothing, antioxidant, and moisturizing ingredient. Anti-inflammatory. The main biologically active components are Asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid. All of which are in this.<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm)<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm)<br /><br />Madecassoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica. It’s less prominent than it’s sister component, Asiaticoside, but it still contributes to the well-established moisturizing and wound healing abilities of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Overall, it works well. It reduces my redness, feels hydrating on the skin, and works well on its own and under foundation. It feels lightweight on the skin. If they provided the full ingredient list, it would be something I’d be willing to purchase. But, right now, I don’t like they didn’t include them and don’t like that they can’t even be found online as far as I could tell. And I just have a hard time believing the ingredient list I translated from the box is the full ingredient list. I don’t know. If the ingredients aren’t a big factor for you, this is nice and works well. If knowing the ingredients are important to you, I’d look elsewhere. There’s other similar products that actually provide a full ingredient list, and a lot of them are far cheaper. I give it 3 stars.<br /><br />How to Use (from brand’s website):<br />Use as last step of skin care routine. Dip puff into content and gently apply and dab on skin.<br /><br />Special Tips (from brand’s website)<br />Carry it in makeup bag or purse for easy supply of moisture to skin when it dries up.<br />Use as lightweight skin tone corrector to correct sensitive skin tone covered by masks instead of applying heavy, caking makeup.<br /><br />FULL INGREDIENTS<br />Ingredients | Titanium dioxide (CI 77891], Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm), Tocopherol, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm), Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm), Madecassoside (0.0025ppm), Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm), Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm), Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm)<br /><br />**NOTE: Just for reference, 1ppm = 0.0001% (or 10,000 ppm = 1%).

4.0,1666148532859,Extremely hydrating but lightweight. Does have essential oils & fragrant ingredients though,"This comes with no outer product box, just the bottle. But, the bottle is sealed with plastic wrapping around it. It is made in the US. The ingredients are listed on the label.<br /><br />This is supposed to be cruelty free, gluten free, silicone free, sulfate free, paraben free, talc free, 100% vegan, and have clean ingredients. It didn’t have any labels on it saying it was cruelty free, but the brand’s website said they’re cruelty free. It also said they use natural and organic ingredients. But, they are not certified organic. It states,  “Our products are made with natural and organic ingredients, however, they are not certified organic. All of our products are made in the U.S. using top-quality domesticated and imported ingredients.” I’m not surprised they said they’re not certified organic. I love their honesty. I’ve seen lots of skincare brands claim their products are 100% organic when they definitely aren’t. Most skin care products are water-based and water can NOT be certified as organic, so the possibility of finding a 100% organic skincare product is close to impossible.<br /><br />This claims to be hydrating, brightening, and soothing. It claims to target fine lines around the eyes, reduce appearance of dark circles and puffiness, and hydrate the eye area. It claims the key ingredients are triple peptides, bergamot oil, and citric acid. I included a full ingredient list at the end of my review (marked with 🟣). I included some info on some of the ingredients before that (marked with 🟢).<br /><br />This comes in a nice pump bottle. The pump does squirt out too much if you’re not careful. I find if I carefully press it so I’m not pushing it down all the way, I get enough product and don’t waste any. It’s a thin gel consistency. It glides on nicely. It absorbs quickly leaving my under eyes feeling really hydrated and smooth. I have pretty dry under eyes. If I apply concealer, I have to make sure to moisturize them really well so they don’t look dry and cakey. A lot of the moisturizers that hydrate my under eyes enough are thicker and end up being too heavy to use concealer over. This is PERFECT! It’s thin and lightweight, but feels extremely hydrating! It gives my under eyes enough hydration and plumps them up. It doesn’t leave a sticky residue at all. Concealer goes over it beautifully and looks nice and smooth.<br /><br />I haven’t been using it long enough to say anything about how it works long term on dark circles, firming, etc. But, I can say it’s really hydrating and plumping if you’re looking for something extremely hydrating under the eyes. I’m hopeful for other benefits long term given the ingredients, but even if I don’t get any more benefits, I’m still loving how well it hydrates my under eyes while being so lightweight!  Just keep in mind it does have some essential oils and fragrant ingredients in it, so if you have sensitive skin, you might want to avoid this or at least check the ingredient list to see if they’re things that you’re sensitive to.<br /><br />🟢Info on ingredients<br />Saccharide Isomerate, which is a 100% natural and plant-derived moisturizer. It binds to the skin stronger and longer than other moisturizer ingredients do so it can keep skin hydrated longer than usual.<br /><br />Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 & Palmitoyl Tetrrapeptide-7 - These are peptides combined to create a compound called Matrixyl 3000. Matrixyl is a highly-effective peptide composition that has been shown to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, fill in fine lines & wrinkles while restoring elasticity.<br /><br />Sodium Hyaluronate, which is a form of hyaluronic acid (HA). Helps skin hold onto water, making skin more plump and elastic.<br /><br />Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 (aka Argireline), which is called “natures Botox.” It is a synthetic peptide that has several different potential wrinkle-fighting and anti-aging effects. It's so effective, that experts say it's the closest thing to Botox you can get. It prevents the muscle movement that leads to wrinkle formation. Argireline also promotes collagen production and optimizes the function of collagen, which both fight fine lines and improve moisture levels in the skin. It’s good for anyone looking to smooth wrinkles caused by repeated muscle movement in areas such as the forehead and around the eyes.<br /><br />Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, which has great anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />ESSENTIAL OILS, PERFUMING INGREDIENTS<br />It has some essential oils and perfuming ingredients in it - Bergamot Fruit Oil, Orange Oil, Linalyl Acetate, Geranyl Acetate, and Linalool.

3.0,1661457062620,"Great IF need quick application, need to last no more than couple hrs, & only need couple uses","I got the style “A201.” I have really small, really hooded, and downturned eyes. With such small, hooded eyes, a lot of full lashes can end up poking me in my inner corner. I like the inner corner of the lashes to be shorter. Somehow, I missed seeing that the inner corner of the “A201” style was the same length as the outer corner. I also like the outer corner to be longer and lifted to give my eye a more lifted look. While the “A201l style isn’t bad, it isn’t as good as “A202” would have been. I’m not sure how I picked so wrong 😂 I think I just saw the “A201” style looked more natural and “A202” looked darker/thicker/fuller, so I went with the more natural looking ones? No clue! I’m usually so picky when choosing lashes and so particular, I don’t know how I missed that! But, “A201” worked well enough.<br /><br />I liked the idea of self adhesive lashes. No glue, no magnetic liner, no magnets. Just pop them on and be done! Easy peasy!  I had a feeling they weren’t going to stick to well, but figured they were worth a try because…..”WHAT IF THEY DID?! Wouldn’t that be something?!”<br /><br />They did stick….but not for long. These are perfect for anyone who only needs the lashes to feel secure for no more than a couple hours, after that, they start lifting and feeling like they’ll fall off at any moment. You get 4 pairs for $14.99 (currently down from regular price of $16.99), that is $3.75 (or $4.25 at regular price) per pair. Not too bad. At that price, some might not mind them only feeling secure for a short while. Like if you’re someone who does makeup looks on Instagram/TikTok/YouTube/etc., you might only need the lashes on for a quick photo session or video. These would work well for that.<br /><br />They did say you need to apply these BEFORE makeup. I tried it that way and then applied my eyeshadow and it was fine. I also applied them after applying my eyeshadow. They stayed secure longer when applied BEFORE eyeshadow, but did stay secure for about 40 min when applied AFTER eyeshadow.<br /><br />After the first use, they don’t stick very well. If you applied them to clean, dry skin, they stick much better and stay secured longer. But if applied to eyeshadow, they don’t stick as well the second time, even if you make sure to clean them off after.<br /><br />Overall, I can’t really recommend these unless you only want lashes that will be quick to apply (few seconds), don’t need them to last longer than a couple hours, and don’t mind getting only a use or 2 out of them. If that works for you, go for it because they do stick.",383368,2920
5.0,1659949968815,"Very thin, looks and feels like nothing on skin but sets makeup in place well!","I have loved a lot of the By Terry products I’ve tried. I tried a mini of the loose Hyaluronic Hydra Powder, so I was excited to try the pressed powder version of it. But, I recently tried the By Terry Hyaluronic Hydra-Powder palette that had 4 different pressed Hyaluronic hydra-powders in it. It had colored powders, not translucent like this one. I got the “Fair to Medium” so it contained a pale pink, a pale bone colored shade, a pale bronzer, and a light bronzer shade. I didn’t like the light colored shades at all for setting my makeup. They seemed to make my skin look so dry, which I thought was so weird since it’s just a pressed version of the loose Hyaluronic hydra powder, which I loved. But, the loose Hyaluronic Hydra Powder only had 2 ingredients - silica and hyaluronic acid. The Hyaluronic Hydra-Powder Palette had a lot more ingredients, so I’m guessing that’s where the difference came from. They were also colored and the loose powder was translucent. This pressed powder is also translucent. It does contain more than 2 ingredients, I guess since it’s in pressed form rather than loose. But not a ton of ingredients (full list at end of review). But, given it had more ingredients and they were similar to the ones in the Hyaluronic Hydra-Pressed Powder Palette I tried and didn’t like, I was worried I wasn’t going to like this one either. But, I’m glad I tried it because I ended up loving it!<br /><br />This comes in a nice outer product box. It comes in a nice compact with clasp closure, a mirror in the lid, and a powder puff. I never use the powder puffs that come in compacts like this, but it seemed nice enough.<br /><br />The powder is very thin. It almost seems like you don’t pick any up when you dip your brush into it, but you do. Usually when I dip my brush into a powder, I have to dab off the excess from the brush before applying it to my face. I don’t have to do that with this. It only picks up a light amount, which is just enough for a very light layer. I have normal to dry skin, more on the dry side with some extremely dry areas. This doesn’t dry out my skin like the powders did in the palette that I tried. This goes on smoothly, sets my makeup in place with a very light layer, and doesn’t look dry, powdery, or cakey on the skin. It lasts well throughout the day.<br /><br />I did notice that if I applied too much, I could get a dry look and feel to my skin. It’s so thin that it’s easy to think you haven’t applied any and to add more, which is when I get the dry look and feel to my skin. With the Pressed Powder Palette I tried, I found those powders worked well with a thin layer and didn’t leave my skin looking and feeling dry, but they also didn’t seem to set my makeup in place unless I applied more, which ended up giving me the dry look and feel. With this powder, I can apply a very small amount and my makeup seems to be set in place well and I don’t get a dry look and feel to the skin. So, I’m not sure why I got such a different result with the powders in the Pressed Powder Palette vs this one. Given they have similar ingredient lists aside from the color ingredients, the only thing I can think of is that this one is translucent and those ones in the palette were colored so that much<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great powder! It’s very thin and looks like nothing on the skin, but sets my makeup in place. It doesn’t feel or look dry on my skin.

I included the ingredients at the end of my review.<br /><br />You get 3 glosses - a peachy pink toned one that has a strawberry scent/flavor, a more reddish toned one that has a grape scent/flavor, and a clear one that has a bubble gum scent/flavor. As for the scents, I can notice them when applying, not so much after the fact. I don’t really notice a taste really with any of them, but the ingredients do list “flavor” not fragrance/parfum, so it made me think they’d have more taste to them. Not a big deal to me though.<br /><br />While 2 of them are tinted in color, the color doesn’t really translate onto the lips. They just look clear on the lips. They don’t change any color of lip liner, lipstick, matte lip, etc. that I put them over top of. So, I liked that.<br /><br />The formula is nice. It feels nice and moisturizing on the lips, which I expected given they have nice moisturizing ingredients like Shea butter, coconut oil, and squalane. They do feel SLIGHTLY sticky on the lips. I hate sticky glosses, but these aren’t overly sticky. They don’t feel thick or heavy on the lips. They feel nice and thin. They are glosses so they do need re-applied often throughout the day. But, I’m used to that with glosses so it’s not a big deal to me.<br /><br />The strawberry and grape both have micro glitter in them (mica). I didn’t know that when I got these. None of the product photos showed they had glitter and the description didn’t say it either. I’m not a fan of micro glitter in my lip glosses. I feel once the gloss wears off, it usually leaves behind glitter particles on my lips. Also, they can sometimes feel gritty. So, I was surprised when I saw 2 of the 3 had glitter. Luckily, these didn’t feel gritty. I do notice that there are some glitter particles on my lips after they wear off, but it’s not too bad. The glitter particles are really small, so it’s not really noticeable. So, I don’t mind that.<br /><br />Overall, these are nice glosses with a nice formula. They might seem pricey when seeing the $30 price tag, but you’re getting 3 tubes of glosses, so that’s only $10 a piece, which isn’t bad. Of course, it isn’t great. You can get a tube of gloss that looks great and works just as well from the drugstore for slightly less. But, the ingredients might make it worth it to spend the little more.

5.0,1654231128302,Can make you look pale. Only takes a little & will not look pale at all,"This comes in an outer product box. It’s made in the UK. It is talc free, cruelty free, and vegan.<br /><br />This has a very simple ingredient list - Corn starch modified, distarch phosphate, silica. I liked that.<br /><br />It comes in simple packaging - It says it is sustainable packaging. It is an amber colored glass bottom (at least it seems like glass). It is thick, so seems durable. The top seems like tin. Mine was dented when I got it. Not sure how but it just came that way. The top twists off. Inside there is a plastic piece with 4 holes in it. There’s a sticker covering the holes that you remove. I like that it only has 4 holes. Loose powders can be so messy and I store mine in a drawer, but sometimes they get knocked over in the drawer and the powder goes into the cap and when I remove the cap I have to be careful not to get it everywhere. Because of that, I’ll usually only uncover like 3 of the holes on a loose powder. It means less powder getting out into the cap if it tips over. But, with this only having 4 holes I didn’t feel the need to do that.<br /><br />The powder is finely milled. It feels silky and smooth. It is white. It goes on mostly transparent. I’m really pale and was surprised that this made me look a little paler when I first applied it. I ended up going over where I applied the powder with a clean brush to get any excess off and that removed the pale look. So, the next time I used it, I used a damp sponge. I picked some up on the sponge, dabbed it off on the back of my hand to spread out the powder and get off excess, and then pressed it into my skin. That worked much better. It left my makeup set and smooth, without looking pale at all. It doesn’t feel or look dry or cakey. It gives a nice smooth, matte finish to the skin, but not too matte. I have normal to dry skin, more on the dry side with some extremely dry areas. So, I only powder where I have to. This doesn’t make my dry areas look or feel any drier and doesn’t accentuate them either.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this powder. It keeps my makeup looking nice all day. I don’t have breakthrough sweat or oils coming through it. I work 12 hour shifts and I’m on my feet running around for a lot of that time, so I often sweat. A lot of powders I’ll end up sweating through and needing to touch up throughout the day. I didn’t feel the need to do that with this. I really like it a lot. When I first saw how pale it made me after applying it the first time, I thought I was going to end up hating this. But, I’m glad I dusted off the excess and tried a different way of applying it the next time. Both ways work, but the damp sponge definitely is the best way I found for me. If you’re looking for a really nice powder, I’d recommend this!",383368,15274
4.0,1646557460248,"Works really well, but even getting 2 in 1, it’s pricier than my go-to drugstore liquid liners","This comes in an outer product box. It is made in Korea. The product page says it is cruelty free and vegan, but I didn’t see any kind of certified logo saying it was on the product box. It is free of parabens, sulfates, gluten, and “other harsh chemicals.”<br /><br />This is a dual ended liquid liner. One end has a felt tip and one end has a brush tip. The caps are labeled, which is great! I don’t have to pull off the tops every time to figure out which end is which! Of course, since the labels are on the CAPS, you have to make sure not to mix them up. I don’t see myself having an issue with that since I don’t ever see a reason I’d take off both ends at the same time. But, if you do, you definitely want to make sure to put the correct cap on the correct side so you don’t mix them up. It probably would have been better for them to put the label on the center part rather than the caps, but it’s fine as long as you don’t take both ends off at the same time or just make sure to put the right caps back on.<br /><br />Both ends work really well. They glide on easily without skipping or bleeding. They are a pigmented black, not thin or watery black. They dry down quickly and stay in place throughout the day without smudging or coming off. I have really small, really hooded eyes, so having a dual ended eyeliner pen is great! I have the brush tip to get the thin tightline I want on my upper lash line, then I have the thicker felt tip to do my little wing when I want to. Both work great.<br /><br />When I first saw it was priced at $28.50, I thought that was pretty darn pricey for an eyeliner. But, it is dual ended, so you’re getting 2 eyeliners in 1 pen. Looking at it that way, it’s $14.25 a pen. I usually spend somewhere around $8-10 on my usual ones at the drugstore, so $14.25 isn’t the cheapest, but it isn’t too bad either. Personally, I love it being dual ended, but not enough to spend more than I spend on my usual liquid liners. My usual one at the drugstore ones are $10 (NYX Epic Wear Liquid Liner) and $8 (Maybelline Curvitude Angled Liquid Liner) and I never have any issues with them. So, I don’t see myself spending $28.50, even if I’m getting 2 for 1 because that’s still $14.25 each, which is more than I usually spend on my liquid liners. If price isn’t an issue for you, this is a really good liquid liner. Both ends work great and it’s a nice formula. I give it 4 stars.",383368,1712

But, there is plastic sealing around the jar. When you remove the lid, there is no seal there. It is made in the US. The ingredients are listed on the label.<br /><br />The product itself is a creamy yellow color. It has a slight scent to it, but I can’t quite place it, but it isn’t a bad or unpleasant smell, and I only smell it if I stick my nose right up to the jar. I don’t smell it while applying it. It has a gel like texture. It glides onto the skin. It feels extremely hydrating while applying it. Like your skin is going to be really hydrated. But, once it dries down it doesn’t have that feeling, it has a slight tacky feeling that takes a few minutes to go away. It does make the skin feel smooth and slightly hydrated but not as hydrating as I’d like. But, I didn’t get this to be my main face moisturizer. I got it for its brightening effects. So far I haven’t noticed any brightening, but something like this will take time.<br /><br />Right now I can say that it’s not very moisturizing. It doesn’t feel drying, but doesn’t feel moisturizing once it absorbs either. I haven’t noticed any brightening effects, but I’m going to continue using it and hopefully will notice some after continued use. It does work well under my moisturizer and makeup. Right now I only feel comfortable giving it a middle 3 stars since I can’t really speak to its effects and don’t find it moisturizing.",383368,2291
2.0,1643453028936,Hair isn’t great. Tons of short hairs mixed in. Doesn’t seem like remy hair.,"I got the 3 Bundles of Body Wave - 18 inch, 20 inch, and 22 inch.<br /><br />Overall, these aren’t my favorite bundles. They aren’t the worst, but definitely no where near the best. The hair definitely doesn’t look like the smooth, beautiful, healthy looking hair the product photos show. It looks like it’s just full of shorter hairs. It seems like each bundle is made up of a bunch of different length hairs - like they have strands that are the right length, but then they took a bunch of shorter lengths to add to it to make it thicker. I can’t really recommend them. There’s better out there for around the same price.<br /><br />It says that “each package have a free gift.” I’m not sure if it’s different for everyone but what was included in mine was 2 black elastic hair ties that have a little fabric like bow tied to it. Each bow had a different design.<br /><br />The product page said that these are “true to length.” Like I said before, I got the bundles that were 18 inch, 20 inch, and 22 inch. Now, when you measure hair that is wavy, curly, etc. - basically any style that isn’t straight - you are supposed to pull the hair straight to measure the length. It seems that most hair sellers state the length of the hair as what it is when it is completely straight. So, usually, if you want a body wave style hair that is 18 inches, you’d want to pick one that is a few inches longer than 18 inches since it will only be 18 inches when pulled completely straight. I never understand why hair sellers do it this way. Usually, if someone is buying a style like body wave, curly, etc. it’s because they want that style of hair. So, if someone is buying bundles/wigs and they don’t know about this, they would buy an 18 inch body wave bundle/wig thinking it will be 18 inches in that body wave style. But, it won’t be with most hair sellers. There have been a few times I was pleasantly surprised when I got a body wave or curly style and it was actually the length I ordered without having to pull it straight. But, it’s so rare, I’m usually pretty darn surprised when it happens! (And, that’s definitely a brand I’ll go back to in the future when purchasing because of that!). Anyways, these are NOT the length you ordered UNLESS you pull them completely straight. And I mean COMPLETELY straight. Sometimes with body wave or curly hair, you just need to pull it a little straight and the hair will be to the length you ordered. But, other times, you really need to TUG to get the hair as straight as possible to get it to the length you ordered. So, if you were to straighten the hair, THEN it would be 18 inches, and 18 inches EXACTLY. I wanted the body wave style, so I won’t be straightening mine. But, I wanted to mention that in case you’re like me and want to keep the body wave style, if you want a certain length with it in the body wave style, make sure to order a few inches longer.<br /><br />When I measured the 18 inch bundle with it in the body wave style, it was about 12 inches. When I pulled (and I mean PULLED so it was as straight as could be), I just BARELY got to 18 inches, but that tells me that IF I was going to straighten it, it would go to 18 inches.<br /><br />When I measured the 20 inch bundle with it in body wave style, it was about 13.5 inches. When I pulled (again, I had to PULL as much as I could), I could just it just BARELY to 20 inches, which, again, tells me that IF I was going to straight it, it would go to 20 inches.<br /><br />When I measured the 22 inch bundle with it in the body wave style, it was about 14.5 inches. When I pulled (again, I had to PULL as much as I could), I could just it just BARELY to 22 inches, which, again, tells me that IF I was going to straighten it, it would go to 22 inches.<br /><br />The hair itself isn’t the greatest. There are A LOT of short hairs that look like fly away hairs. I had to use a lot of oil in the hair to smooth it down.<br /><br />The product page said that each bundle weighs 100 grams, so all 3 together weighs 300 grams. I did weigh them myself when I got them and they did each weigh 100 grams. Keep in mind that even though they each weigh 100 grams, they are NOT the same thickness. The longer the length of your bundles, the more hair you’ll need. That’s because, hair bundles are measured by grams or ounces. Typically, each bundle is around 100-114 grams regardless of the length. This means that the SHORTER lengths, from 8 inches to 16 inches will be THICKER when compared to LONGER hair bundles. Since the weight is the same no matter the length, longer hair will start to slightly thin out near the ends. So, always keep in mind that the thickness of the hair will differ based on the length - the shorter the hair, the thicker the hair.<br /><br />Bundles/extensions weighing between 100g-140g are suitable for most women. Hair of this weight is usually sold in various lengths, but the weight is ALWAYS the SAME, for example a pack of 14 inch hair and a pack of 22 inch hair will both WEIGH the SAME but the 14 inch piece will have more hair on the WIDTH whereas the 22 inch extensions will be LONGER in length. <br /><br />With these bundles, you get 3 bundles of differing lengths. I got the bundles that are 18 inch, 20 inch, and 22 inch. So, the 18 inch bundle is the thickest. The 20 inch bundle falls in the middle. The 22 inch bundle is the thinnest. When I felt the thickness of each bundle, I didn’t really notice a difference there. BUT, I did notice that it seems like either there are a ton of shorter hairs mixed into the bundles, or there are a ton of split ends/flyaways in the hair. It just makes it look really unhealthy. It does feel silky and soft, but doesn’t look it at all.<br /><br />This has a double weft, which is supposed to reduce shedding. I haven’t had any shedding at all with these, so that’s great!<br /><br />The product page said that this is 100% unprocessed Virgin hair. Unprocessed hair is also referred to as Virgin hair. They mean the same thing. Unprocessed hair is human hair that has NEVER been processed - no chemical, heat, etc. This means over the life of the hair it’s never been dyed, coloured, bleached, or heat treated. As a result, unprocessed hair is incredibly healthy. The hair is it’s natural color, which indicates it hasn’t been processed. To me, the hair doesn’t look that healthy. It feels smooth and soft. But the little hairs make it look so unhealthy. It honestly looks more like there’s some strands that are the right length but then they’re added with a bunch of different length strands to make the bundle. It doesn’t seem like they’re split ends. It seems like they’re just shorter hairs. Hopefully that makes sense.<br /><br />The product page also said this is Remy hair.<br /><br />When people talk about Remy and Non-Remy hair, it refers to the direction of the cuticles! The cuticle is the outer layer of the hair strand. It locks in moisture and provides strength. If you look at a cuticle under a microscope, it is not smooth. It grows kind of like a trunk of a palm tree with many overlapping layers. If the cuticles point in different directions, they catch, which causes hair to become tangled, broken (shedding), rough, and hard to manage. If there is no cuticle at all, then the hair will be thin, brittle, and dry.<br /><br />All Remy hair is unprocessed human hair (I know it can be confusing and I’ve seen lots of people confused by Remy hair. I’ve even seen some people in reviews saying that the hair is Remy hair not human hair, but Remy hair is human hair). Remy hair means the hair was collected in a way that kept the cuticles intact and aligned in one direction. Meaning that it's very healthy, soft, shiny, and ultimately very high in quality! True remy hair is considered the best of the best. It’s 100% human hair, which usually comes from donors ranging from one single donor to a small few. Remy hair is gathered in one bunch. Keeping the gathered hair in bundles preserves the integrity of the cuticle with the hair laying in the same direction from root to end. This prevents tangling, matte, and provides natural movement. Remy hair is a smoother, shinier, and healthier appearance than NON-Remy. The hair will lay flat, have a healthy, shiny appearance, look smooth, and will be less likely to knot and tangle.<br /><br />To me, this doesn’t seem like Remy hair at all. Like I said, it seems like it has some hairs that are the right length, but then they’re mixed together with a bunch of different length hairs to make the bundle. It doesn’t seem like it’s split ends. It seems like there’s just a bunch of different lengths in each bundle.",383368,39605
4.0,1642869044192,Great 1st step in my 2 step cleanse!,"This comes in a nice outer product box. It is made in Korea. The writing on the box and jar is in Korean, except for a part saying to use these on the face.<br /><br />These come with little plastic tweezers to use to pick up the pad. There is no where to store them when you’re not using them! I thought I could just sit them inside the tub on top of the wipes to keep them where I wouldn’t lose them, but they don’t fit. It would be nice if they would have put something on the tub where you can attach them to keep them from being lost. I feel like they will easily get lost! On top of that, I feel like they’re more of a pain for me than a help. I need to try to get in there with them and separate the top wipe from the rest, then pick it up. I might just not be coordinated enough for them 😂<br /><br />The product page says the pads are made of 100% pure cotton material. They are hypoallergenic, made with all natural ingredients to prevent burning sensations, stinging, itching, swelling, and redness. They keep skin hydrated. They contain 1000ppm of eggplant extract, extract from Centella Asiatica, Salvia Hispanica Seed, Houttuynia Cordata and Birch Sap to naturally hydrate and protect skin. They also contain lupeol, anthocyanin, polyphenol, vitamin C, and choline. Of course, I have no way of knowing if any of that is true since I can’t read any of the info on the box or tub since they didn’t put the info in English and didn’t provide a full ingredient list on the product page.<br /><br />For use, according to the product page (since, again, they couldn’t be bothered to provide info in English on the box or tub), use the wipe to remove makeup then rinse off face with water. I’ve used wipes like these before, some of them leave the skin feeling pretty oily or like there’s a lot of residue left, which can make you want to wash your face after using it. Others don’t, which can make you feel like you don’t need to wash your face after. Really, it comes down to the wipes - how well they wipe the makeup off, what’s left on the skin, etc. - and personal preference on if you prefer to rinse your face off after, wash your face after, or just leave it.<br /><br />For me, I always do a 2 step cleanse. I always used an oil cleanser as my first step in my two step cleansing. I love oil cleansing pads so that it was all in one - rather than putting some cleansing oil on a pad, the oil is already on these pads. I like these pads. Some wipes aren’t wet enough so you feel like you really need to scrub at your face. I don’t like makeup wipes for removing my makeup because I feel like they’re too harsh on my skin. There are some that are wet enough they wipe the makeup off pretty well, but they still feel harsh. I find oil cleansing pads feel gentler on my skin. These are soaked in enough oil where they gently wipe makeup off. They even remove my stubborn mascara and waterproof liner. But, I don’t feel like my skin is truly cleansed after using them. I like they get most of it off, then I go in with my facial cleanser to get the rest off. If you wear a full face of makeup and wanted to skip that step, I feel like you’d need to use at least 2 of these to really get all the makeup off, and I still feel like you’d definitely need to at least rinse your face after to remove any leftover makeup residue.<br /><br />A lot of time wipes like these will break apart as you’re using them. These didn’t break apart at all while I was using them, so I was happy about that!<br /><br />Like I said before, if you wear a full face of makeup and don’t want to do a 2 step cleanse, you’ll probably need to use at least 2 of these to really get all the makeup off. I find that trying to use 1, it just gets too much makeup on it and kind of just starts spreading oily makeup residue all over your face. If you use just 1, you can wipe the majority of your full face of makeup off and then rinse your face and go in with your second cleanser. That works well. If you don’t want to go in with a second cleanser, I found the best way is using one to get the majority of the makeup off, then once it’s covered in makeup get a new one and wipe your face again. You’ll see on that second one there’s still a ton of product that gets on it..at least for me. Then, you can rinse off your face and be done. I would say it really depends on how much makeup you wear. On no makeup makeup days where I’m not wearing much makeup at all, I can easily use just 1 of these and rinse my face off and I would feel like my skin was clean (although I still always go in with my facial cleanser because I get hormonal breakouts and doing that second step helps keep those at bay!). When I do a full face with full coverage foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, etc., I don’t feel like just 1 of these is enough. I need to go in with 2, rinse my face off, then go in with my facial cleanser to feel like I got my face completely clean.<br /><br />For a while I used cotton rounds. I’d put my cleansing oil on my face, rub it around to kind of melt my makeup, add a little water by rubbing that on my face, then take a cotton round and wipe it off. That worked well. Then, I started using reusable cotton rounds. I like those because I can use just one and rinse it if it gets too much on it, rather than having to get another one if it was a disposable cotton round. Yes, I have to wash them, but they work better and save me money in the long run since I’m not going through disposable cotton rounds like crazy! I do find these to be easier since I don’t need to wash them. I feel like these are a lot gentler on my skin than my reusable cotton rounds are. Reusable cotton rounds always kind of just feel like a small wash cloth, which can be harsh on the skin. So, I do prefer these.<br /><br />Overall, I really like these! They feel gentle on the skin. They are soaked in enough oil where they gently and easily wipe makeup off, even stubborn makeup. Even though I need to use 2, I still really like them! You get 60 pads for $19.99 (at the time of writing this review). I don’t think that’s too bad compared to other cleansing oil pads I’ve tried. These work really well compared to others I’ve tried. They don’t break apart when using them. Even using 2 each time, I still feel like they are a good value for me. They save me time compared to using reusable cotton rounds since I don’t need to wash them. They feel gentler on my skin than my reusable cotton rounds. And, when I use my reusable cotton rounds, I still need to rinse them off while using them to remove my full face of makeup, so to me that’s the same as needing to use a second one of these. They have a slight fragrance but it isn’t anything unpleasant or overwhelming. I would have liked them to include the ingredient list in English on the product box and/or tub. I also would have liked them to include somewhere to place the tweezers so they don’t need to be loose outside the tub where they’ll easily get misplaced and lost forever! But, the pads work great and I definitely recommend them!",383368,14285
2.0,1640217194460,HAS ACETONE!! Takes WAY longer than the 5-10 min they say!,"NOTE - It says this is for gel nail polish, glitter gel, dip powder, or nail glue. It is NOT FOR ACRYLIC NAILS OR POLY GEL!<br /><br />I do a lot gel polish and a lot of dip powder on my nails, so I always have to use acetone to remove the polish/dip powder. When I saw this was a gel polish remover kit that had a NON-acetone polish remover, I was really intrigued! I was even more intrigued when it said it “gently removes gel nail polish, glitter gel, dip powder, or nail glue from your nails without damaging within 5 mins, the gel polish remover even can remove the toughest polish quickly and effectively, recovering the original state of nature!” To say it removes gel polish and dip powder gently within 5 minutes is a HUGE claim for a NON-acetone polish remover. To say that it also removes glitter gel gently within 5 minutes is an ever BIGGER claim for a NON-acetone polish remover! Even when I use my 100% acetone to remove dip powder and glitter polish, it takes longer than 5 minutes! So, for this to be NON-acetone but say I removes gel polish, gel glitter, and dip powder gently within 5 minutes…I had to try it!<br /><br />Then, I got the product…It comes in a nice outer product box that is sealed with plastic wrapping around it. It is made in China. It does have an ingredient list, which is really short…”Alcohol, Acetone, Propylene Glycol, Essence, Deionized Water.” Yep, you see that right, ingredient #2 is….ACETONE! Exactly what they said this did NOT have in it! They are calling it a NON-acetone gel nail polish remover, yet the second ingredient is ACETONE!! After that I realized, the product name itself didn’t even say it was a NON-acetone polish remover. It was only in the product description that they said it didn’t have acetone in it. It said, “NON-ACETONE GEL NAIL POLISH REMOVER KIT: The gel nail polish remover, acetone-free remover liquid, is infused with premium formula.” Just a straight up LIE! 🤦‍♀️<br /><br />On top of that, they’re all over the place on how long you’re supposed to let this sit in your nails. First, they say quite a few times that it removes the product “within 5 minutes.” But, then in the product description when they get to the part of how to use it, they say “wait 5-8 minutes.” THEN, if you look at the product photos, the 6th photo has steps of how to use it. There it says to wait “8-10 minutes.” They just can’t decide!<br /><br />Normally, to remove my gel polish or dip powder, I would first file each nail a little to kind of break the seal. Then, I would take a little cotton round, dip it on my 100% acetone to soak it, place that on my nail, place a soak-off clip over it to hold it in place, and let it sit for about 15-20 minutes before it would even start to come off! If it’s glitter polish or glitter dip nail powder, it needs to sit even longer sometimes! So, for this gel polish remover to be NON-acetone and say it works within 5 minutes, I was really excited to see that! Of course, imagine my disappointment when I get it and see the ingredients on the back Includes ACETONE as the second ingredient in this “NON-acetone gel polish remover.”<br /><br />For use, it says to apply the polish remover to a cotton pad, put the cotton pad on the nail, clip it on with the soak-off clip, and then wait for 5-8 minutes, then remove it. I thought it was funny how it said it removes the product “within 5 minutes” quite a few times in the bullet points prior to the part where it tells you how to use the gel polish remover, but then when it gets to the part where it tells you how to use it, it says to “wait 5-8 minutes.” So, that means it works within 8 minutes. Saying it works “within 5 minutes” means that it will remove the product in 5 minutes or less. They should have said within 8 minutes if you’re supposed to wait 5-8 minutes. BUT, THEN, if you look at the product photos, there is one that shows the steps for how to use the gel polish remover. It’s the last photo before the video (6th photo). It says first file the nail surface. Second, soak the cotton pads in the nail remover. Third, cover nails with cotton pad folded in half. Fourth, and this is the important part, fix the nails with the nail clips and then remove the clips and pads “after 8-10 minutes.” Fifth, use the cuticle pusher to remove all the popped off polish.” So, first, they repeatedly said that this gel polish remover would remove product “within 5 minutes.” Then, it changed to “wait 5-8 minutes.” But, then, it says “8-10 minutes.” So, definitely seems to be some confusion there with what they wanted to put. Of course, removing the product “within 5 minutes” sounds a lot better than 5-8 minutes and waaaay better than 8-10 minutes. But, I’d rather a company just say what it is than try to sell it to me using some random numbers. But, even if it takes 10 minutes, it’s still faster than it takes when I use 100% acetone, so I was still really interested to see how this would work! Again, imagine my surprise when I got it and saw the second ingredient listed for this “NON-acetone gel polish remover” is ACETONE!!<br /><br />I liked how they included a little bottle to put the polish remover in and cotton pads, so you just need to put the cotton pad on the top and push down to get the remover onto the pad. It also includes 10 soak-off clips to use. It also includes a cuticle pusher, which can be used to scrape the polish off once it is ready, and a nail file. So, it includes everything you need to remove your gel polish/dip powder!<br /><br />Even though they totally lied about it being a NON-acetone polish remover, since I usually use 100% acetone on my nails, I figured I’d give it a try anyways.<br /><br />And another thing..since it has acetone in it, it has a STRONG odor like acetone nail polish remover have, which I also thought was funny because on the product page, if you scroll down to “Customer Questions & Answers,” someone asked if it had a strong smell. The SELLER responded with, “No, it does not. It is colourless and low odour.” Along with a strong odor, it isn’t colorless - it has a slight yellow kind of tint to it. Looking at the other questions and answers I saw someone else asked if the kit came with cotton pads and the SELLER answered, “Yes, I get cotton pads with my purchase.” What?! “With YOUR purchase,” you’re the seller! 🤦‍♀️ 😂<br /><br />Just ridiculous all around…<br /><br />As for the products in the kit…<br />The nail polish remover works just like nail polish removers work. It isn’t as strong as 100% acetone. It definitely takes longer to remove my gel polish and dip powders, especially the glitter polishes. It takes longer than the 15-20 minutes it takes with my 100% acetone. No where near the 5-10 minutes the product page says. It doesn’t even work better than my Sally Nail Polish remover, which has acetone as the 1st ingredient. It does work better than any of my ACTUALLY non-acetone nail polish removers, which won’t remove my gel polish or dip powders (or at least I’m not patient enough to wait to see how long it would take for them to remove it 😂).<br /><br />The clips work just like any other plastic soak-off clips I’ve used before.<br /><br />The cotton pads are little square pads that are stiff at first, but soften once the nail polish remover is applied. They work just like any other pads I’ve gotten before.<br /><br />The little nail polish remover push dispenser bottle works okay. It takes quite a few pumps to get any nail polish remover to come out, but it comes out eventually. I’m interested to see if the bottle holds up with the nail polish remover inside it given that there is acetone in it. I’ve had bottles like these before, kind of plastic type feeling bottles, and the acetone usually eats away at it and I have to remove it before it starts leaking. So, maybe this is made out of something that can handle it. Or, maybe since this isn’t 100% acetone, maybe it’ll handle it okay. But, I’ll be keeping my eye on it since the 2nd ingredient is acetone.<br /><br />Overall, I’d say, if you’re looking for a kit that has all this in it - soak-off clips, nail file, cuticle pusher, cotton pads, nail polish remover push dispenser bottle, and nail polish with acetone in it, this is a good kit. The price isn’t too bad given what you get and how large of a bottle of nail polish remover you get. But, if you’re looking for a NON-acetone nail polish remover - This is NOT it! This has acetone has the 2nd ingredient, so you’ll need to look elsewhere. If you’re looking for nail polish remover that is 100% acetone, this isn’t it. If you’re looking for nail polish remover that works quickly in 5-10 minutes like the product page says, this isn’t it. If you’re looking to buy from a brand that is honest in their description, this isn’t it. So, basically, I’d say, if you’re looking for a nail polish remover with acetone in it, that works like any other nail polish remover that has acetone in it but isn’t 100% acetone and that comes with everything else in this kit, then I’d say go for it. Otherwise, I’d look elsewhere. I’m giving this 2 stars because of all the lies on the product page!",383368,790
4.0,1636308102467,"Great razor, but no way to buy just replacement heads (at least not when I’m writing this)","First the good…<br />I love the razor! It’s cute and comfortable to hold. The razor has 5 blades that are stainless steel. It says they’re made of high quality steel in the USA. The razor head is magnetic so it just clicks right on, I was a little worried with it being magnetic that it might slide or move during use, but the magnets are strong and I wouldn’t even know they were attached magnetically has I not done it myself 😂 It has a metal handle that’s comfortable to hold. There’s a nice ceramic base for it to sit in when you’re not using it. The razor head moves nicely to conform to your body as you shave. It says it goes down 15 degrees and up 65 degrees (it says degrees Celsius in the image but that’s only for temp, not angles so not sure why they added the C? 😂). It has aloe on top AND bottom for extra protection and slip, which is nice. It said it came with 2 replacement razors, which I thought meant it came with the main one and then 2 additional ones, making 3, but it only comes with 2.<br /><br />Now for the bad…<br />They recommend to replace the blades every 2 months. But how?! There’s no replacement heads here on Amazon. Why sell something on here that requires replacement heads but not sell the replacement heads on here? Hopefully they will add them before I need them because I love the razor. The razor is currently $11.99. For that you get the razor handle part, ceramic stand, and 2 razor heads. So, if I replace the razor head every 2 months like they recommend, I’ll get 4 months of use out of this. Do I want to spend $11.99 every 4 months just to get replacement heads? That is $5.99 per replacement head if that’s all I’m buying it for. Then I also get a ceramic base every time that I won’t need since I’ll already have one and another razor handle, which I guess isn’t a big deal to replace over time. I can get 4 Venus Gillette replacement heads here on Amazon for $10.99. It’s basically the same thing but I can actually buy a replacement head for it.<br /><br />So, I’m not sure about this. I love the razor, but it isn’t anything crazy special. The Venus Gillette ones I usually use have aloe on them and 5 blades that work well. I don’t get the nice ceramic base for it to sit in, but that’s not a huge deal to me. I can at least replace the heads easily with it. So, it’s up to you if you don’t mind spending the $11.99 to get replacement heads for this and having to get the handle and base every time too. It’s a really nice razor that works well and is comfortable to hold, and it has a nice base to sit in. The only downside is the replacement heads. Like I said, hopefully they’ll add the replacement heads onto Amazon soon. Right now, I’d say it’s a great razor and if you don’t mind that you can’t buy replacement heads for it, I’d recommend it. If you do mind that you can’t get replacement heads for it, I’d still say it’s a great razor so maybe by the time you’re reading this they have added the replacement heads onto Amazon, so you can check and see! If they have, I’d recommend it. If not, I’d say skip them if it’s an issue not being able to buy just the replacement heads.",383368,802
4.0,1635653098633,Nice glowy finish with good coverage. Contains chemical sunscreen ingredients.,"This comes in an outer product box. It is made in Korea. The info on the box is not in English. I assume it’s Korean since that’s where it’s made. I hate when companies sell a product in the US, but then don’t put the product info in English. They did include the ingredients on the product page, I included them at the end of the review. This is NOT reef safe since it contains chemical sunscreen ingredients like octinoxate and octocrylene. I didn’t realize this had chemical sunscreen ingredients in it like octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene. I prefer physical sunscreens. But, it was my own fault for not looking closer at the ingredient list before getting this.<br /><br />This does contain silicones, alcohol, and parfum too.<br /><br />It has some good ingredients too like niacinamide, glycerin, jojoba seed oil, adenosine, sunflower seed oil, squalane, centella asiatica leaf extract, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), honey extract, and madecassoside.<br /><br />I love cushion foundations. I have normal to dry skin, more on the dry side, with some extremely dry areas. Cushion foundations usually give me great coverage but look natural and healthy on my skin. This one claimed to “plump your skin” with “advanced luminous lasting cushion.” It claimed to be “fitting and superstay” that it had “advanced formula Fixative Polymer technology, which forming a moisture film on your skin, keep your skin hydrated, moistured and leaving your skin with the most luminous look. Simultaneously, this film helps to keep the foundation layer thin yet stay fit all day long.” I didn’t like the idea of a film on my skin, but liked the idea of it hydrating my skin and giving it a luminous look, but lasting all day.<br /><br />This comes in a black plastic compact. It has magnetic closure. When you open the top there is a mirror in the lid and a little cushion applicator. When you take off the cushion applicator you’ll see the little plastic shelf that covers the cushion foundation. There’s a little tab to pull on to open it. Once you open it, there is a protective cover over the cushion that you remove. Make sure to always push down the shelf part over top of the cushion completely so that the cushion doesn’t dry out.<br /><br />This comes in 2 shades - “21 Light Beige,” which is described as “bright and glamorous light beige,” and “23 Natural Beige,” which is described as “natural and lively natural beige.” I have very fair skin so I can usually go for the lightest shade and can make it work for me. But, I wasn’t quite sure which would work best for me so I got both.<br /><br />I took a photo of swatches I did. I did a photo showing a swatch of shade “23 Natural Beige,” “21 Light Beige,” and a comparison swatch of Maybelline Fit Me Matte+Poreless in 110 Porcelain. I always like to use the Maybelline Fit Me since I know a lot of people have tried it and hopefully know their shade in it so they can hopefully get an idea of if the shade will work for them when compared to the Maybelline shade.<br /><br />“21 Light Beige” is lighter. Usually the lower number is the lighter one, but sometimes that’s not always the case because of undertone or just weird labeling. In my opinion, the swatches in the product photos are much lighter than they appear in person. I’d say that they are definitely at least a shade darker in person than they appear in the product photo. They both have yellow undertones.<br /><br />They provide good, natural coverage and gives a glowy finish. It doesn’t transfer once it’s dries down, which is nice. I don’t even need to set it with powder. Since I have normal to dry skin, I prefer not to use powder where I don’t have to. But, with glowy foundations it’s usually needed. So, I like that I don’t need to with this! It doesn’t give full coverage, but can be built up to medium. If you use a the included sponge or a beauty sponge for application you can get light coverage with 1 layer, medium with 2 layers. If you use a brush for application you can get medium coverage with 1 layer, but I find it looks to heavy if you try to apply a second layer using a sponge. My preferred method is using a brush to apply a thin layer, and then going over it with a sponge to kind of make sure it’s all blended in nicely. Then, if any areas need additional coverage, I’ll use the sponge to add some additional product where I need it.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a really nice cushion foundation.

4.0,1635653041886,Nice glowy finish with good coverage. Contains chemical sunscreen ingredients,"This comes in an outer product box. It is made in Korea. The info on the box is not in English. I assume it’s Korean since that’s where it’s made. I hate when companies sell a product in the US, but then don’t put the product info in English. They did include the ingredients on the product page, I included them at the end of the review. This is NOT reef safe since it contains chemical sunscreen ingredients like octinoxate and octocrylene. I didn’t realize this had chemical sunscreen ingredients in it like octinoxate, octisalate, and octocrylene. I prefer physical sunscreens. But, it was my own fault for not looking closer at the ingredient list before getting this.<br /><br />This does contain silicones, alcohol, and parfum too.<br /><br />It has some good ingredients too like niacinamide, glycerin, jojoba seed oil, adenosine, sunflower seed oil, squalane, centella asiatica leaf extract, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), honey extract, and madecassoside.<br /><br />I love cushion foundations. I have normal to dry skin, more on the dry side, with some extremely dry areas. Cushion foundations usually give me great coverage but look natural and healthy on my skin. This one claimed to “plump your skin” with “advanced luminous lasting cushion.” It claimed to be “fitting and superstay” that it had “advanced formula Fixative Polymer technology, which forming a moisture film on your skin, keep your skin hydrated, moistured and leaving your skin with the most luminous look. Simultaneously, this film helps to keep the foundation layer thin yet stay fit all day long.” I didn’t like the idea of a film on my skin, but liked the idea of it hydrating my skin and giving it a luminous look, but lasting all day.<br /><br />This comes in a black plastic compact. It has magnetic closure. When you open the top there is a mirror in the lid and a little cushion applicator. When you take off the cushion applicator you’ll see the little plastic shelf that covers the cushion foundation. There’s a little tab to pull on to open it.

5.0,1634954545437,Great white eyeliners for lower waterline!,"These are great! They come in a box all together, not individually. They each have caps. They are sharp. They are the kind of pencils you need to sharpen on your own. They work well in the lower waterline, which is where I use my white eyeliners. A lot of white liners go on great but fade away quickly. These last well in the waterline. They are pigmented, but not so much so where it’s stark white, which I don’t mind since I have such dark brown, almost black, eyes. If a white liner is really pigmented, it can look a little too much. So, these work great! Plus, you get 12 so it’s a great value I think!",383368,7205
5.0,1633614769725,Stunning!,"This comes packaged nicely. It comes in an outer product box. It has styrofoam protecting it well. It even had a little styrofoam kind of eye mask protecting the eyes! Mine did have a little gouge on the collarbone, but it was only little so not a big deal to me.<br /><br />It’s GORGEOUS! She has makeup and beautiful eyes with lashes! There’s a kind of wig cap on top of the head that seems to be glued on.<br /><br />It doesn’t state the size of the head or how tall the mannequin is. The head seems to fit standard wigs (22-22.5”). There is a photo that shows a measuring tape around the head. Why they could show that but not actually state the measurement is beyond me. But, it looks like it’s about 54 and 1/4 cm. 54 cm is 21 inches, which seems about right. When I put a 22” wig on this, it fits snugly. I measured the height and it’s about 16.5” tall.<br /><br />The bottom has a kind of felt on it so it moves easily.<br /><br />She even has pierced ears if you want to put earrings in.<br /><br />Overall, this is a gorgeous, well made mannequin head! You can use it for wigs and jewelry.",383368,770
5.0,1633058283187,"Luckily, I got the full nails as shown in product photos, not just tips!","These come in a nice little box with the sizes assorted into little compartments. The box has a latch closure that is easy to open and close.<br /><br />I saw another review that stated that they thought these were more press on nails even though the description said nail tips and that she can’t use them because what she got were actual nail tips, not what the product photos showed. That surprised me because I got what the product photos show. I’m glad I did because, like the other reviewer, I didn’t want tips. Even though the title says “nail tips.” The description says, “square full cover square nail tips” and the product photos show full nails, not tips. When you scroll down to the lower part of the product page, where it has “Product Description,” it states, “Shape: Full Cover.” So, even though they say “nail tips,” their product photos and descriptions imply they are full nails. So, like the other reviewer, I was hoping for full nails. Unlike the other reviewer, I did get full nails like what are shown in the product photos. So, I’m really happy about that! Another reviewer who provided photos also got the ones that I did, which are the same ones shown in the product photos. So, I’m not sure why the other reviewer got different ones. But, the company should really figure that out so that customers get what is shown in the product photos!<br /><br />Anyways, the nails are nice. They’re thinner, but not too thin. They are solid white and really shiny. The product page has “recommendations for use,” which states, “Lady french acrylic style artificial false nails have a smooth surface. It is recommended to polish the surface to make it adherent.” I definitely agree with that. They are so smooth and shiny, if you want it to adhere good, you want to file the inside some to get them to stick the best and adhere for the longest. If I didn’t do that, they lifted pretty quickly. But, as long as I did that, they lasted a long time!<br /><br />I expected these to be a little shorter than they were, like just over my nail beds. But, they were longer than that. I’d rather have them longer than I need and just cut and file them, so I didn’t mind. They’re still definitely short compared to most nails.<br /><br />Overall, these are great! They are full nails, not just tips (at least the ones I got, which are the ones shown in the product photos). You get a nice assortment of sizes in a nice container. They are solid white. They adhere well to the nail bed when you file the inside down a little first. They hold polish well and last really well as long as you file the inside down before gluing them. I recommend!",383368,46541
5.0,1632662411674,Fills in fine lines and pores giving a smooth base for foundation,"This is interesting! I’ve never seen a primer that comes with a brush built in like this! You push the bottom and 3 dots come out onto the brush. How I apply my primer usually depends on the primer I use. There’s some I use that I apply with my fingers to help melt the product into my skin and really press it into my skin. There’s some I apply with a brush to really spread it out. A while ago I watched a video from a well known makeup artist. He said that if you want to hide your pores, you can use a brush and basically press the product INTO the pores. Yes, your occluding the pore by using the bristles on the brush to put product INTO the pores, rather than just going over the pores, but if you wash your face well at the end of the day it shouldn’t be an issue. He said when you take the brush, you use the bristles to push the product into the pores, which fills them, and leads to an even base. If you use a product that just kind of layers over the pores, they aren’t filled, they just have a layer over them. A lot of times just having a layer over them works. It creates a smooth layer to put your base on. But, throughout the day the layer kind of breaks down and you end up with your pores showing. If you had actually put product into the pores, then they would continue to be filled and leave you looking smooth all day. So, ever since then I try to use a brush when applying product where I want my pores filled. So, this coming with a built in brush was perfect!<br /><br />The brush is soft. It isn’t rough or scratchy. With 1 push giving 3 dots of product onto the brush I have enough product for everywhere I want to use it.<br /><br />It makes my skin nice and smooth, so I have a smooth base to apply my foundation on.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great primer! It fills in fine lines and pores. The built in brush really helps with that. And foundation goes over it great!",383368,2241
4.0,1631483394640,Powder gives light wash of color. Good for someone who doesn’t need too much.,"A little while back I got an eyebrow stamp kit like this and loved it! The only thing I wished was that the eyebrow stamp was a little thinner. When I saw this kit and saw the stamp looked a lot thinner than the one I had, I had to try it!<br /><br />This comes with the brow stamp, 24 brow stencils, and 4 spoolie brushes.<br /><br />Theres a whopping 24 eyebrow stencils included in this kit! That’s crazy! So, I’m sure most everyone can find a shape that they like for their brows among these stencils. Unlike most kits that have brow stencils like these, these have adhesive backing that sticks to you. Most kits I’ve gotten like these the stencils are plastic, so reusable. I like that they stick because you don’t have to worry about holding them perfectly in place while also trying to use the stamp to fill in your brows and worry about it moving some. But, I don’t like that they aren’t really reusable like this since once you pull off the backing and stick them on, they won’t stick anymore.<br /><br />The first time I tried a brow powder stamping kit I wasn’t expecting much. I kind of expected this to make ugly, thick, blocky looking eyebrows. But, this actually works great! The product in the stamp is powder, so it creates a nice, light color, and you can dab more to build it up if you want. Once you use the spoolie, it looks pretty natural. You can also add pencil to if you wanted.<br /><br />I don’t have thick brows, but I don’t have extremely sparse brows. My brows are thinner, where you can see skin poking through, but there’s basically an even amount of hair all the way across. I used to just leave my brows be, but when I do a full face of makeup I do feel like my brows need a little something. So, I started doing my brows. I usually do a little tinted brow gel. It usually gives enough tint to make them look a little fuller and complete, but not so much where they look too thick. I feel like since I’m just starting to do my brows, whenever I have them filled completely I think they look too thick and weird 😂 So, I like a middle area. So, using this stamp works well for me. If I’m doing full glam, I like to apply it to get a kind of light wash of color. Then, I’ll kind of go over the tail a little with some more powder to darken it a little more. Then, I’ll take a brow pencil and do a few kind of hair like strokes in the front. Sometimes I’ll go in and do some brow gel if I feel they need more defined. This fills them out nicely, makes them look complete, but doesn’t make them look too dark or full. If I am doing a more natural look, I’ll just use the brow powder in the stamp. I do feel that there isn’t a ton of product that comes out and I’m not sure how much product is in the stamp. I don’t mind that not a lot comes out, I actually prefer it. But, if you wanted more product, it might be kind of annoying for you.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice little set! It is a nice way to try different brow shapes to see what you like for yourself. The product works well. The brow powder looks natural and lasts nicely in the brows. I would definitely recommend this for someone who isn’t sure about their brow shape - what they like best on their face, what shape works best, how to fill in brows, etc. This set will help with those things! If you’re someone that just likes a little wash of color and fuller, more filled out brows, this would help with that. If you’re someone who likes a lot of color in the brows, you might not like this since it just gives a wash of color. So, I would recommend it but only if you’re someone who wants to try out different brow shapes to get an idea of what works for you or if you’re someone who likes a light wash of color throughout their brows.",383368,2145
5.0,1631278746134,Exactly what I needed to make picking up rhinestones/gems/sequins/etc. easy!,"These are great! They feel nice to hold. Not flimsy. They’re comfortable in the hand. Plus, they have a cute look to them!<br /><br />They are dual ended. You have the wax tip that picks up rhinestones/gems or any other nail art like sequins or charms. Then there is a stainless steel tip that you use to press down the rhinestone/gem/etc. to keep them in place. You can also pick up a little rhinestone glue with the stainless steel tip and use it to apply a small dot of glue to where you want it on the nail. It’s so helpful!<br /><br />I needed something to help me pick up rhinestones, gems, sequins, charms, etc. When I tried to use one of those pencils to pick up rhinestones, it worked but not every time, so I’d have to fuss around with it. Using tweezers worked, but it’s hard to not have the rhinestones/gems slip through them and sequins are so thin it’s hard to pick up just one. I tried using a little brush to pick up sequins and things like that, which worked, but sometimes I’d only get 1 or 2, sometimes I’d get a ton that were overlapping. So nothing seemed to work right and be totally easy to use. Until these! I really have no complaints!<br /><br />Overall, I definitely recommend these if you do a lot of nail rhinestones/gems or art using sequins/charms/etc. It’s totally worth it to help with the ease of application and save you time and frustration trying to use something else. If you don’t do a lot of nail art using stuff like rhinestones/gems/sequins/charms/etc., then it might be fine just using something you probably already have like tweezers or a brush. But, if you were going to buy one of those pencils that pick up rhinestones/gems, I say skip that and go for these! They work so much better and you get 2 of them!",383368,39515
5.0,1630428845601,Great set! I needed brush protectors and got a great cleaning mat with them!,"While most people would probably purchase this for the cleaning mat and have the included brush protectors be a bonus, I got this mainly for the brush protectors and the cleaning mat was a bonus.<br /><br />I have natural haired brushes - some expensive, some mid range. My mid range ones, the hairs can sometimes get kind of splayed out when they’re drying if they don’t have something holding them in place. With the MANY brush sets I’ve gotten, I have gotten tons of the brush protectors that came on the bigger brushes, but those were stretched out from being on a brush already, so I needed new ones. These are great. Since they stretch out when you put them on a brush, if you use one for a bigger sized brush, you’ll either have to always use that protector for the same brush or at least a brush of the same size. The same goes for the ones you use on smaller brushes. I only have a few brushes that need the brush protectors, so I can easily keep track of which ones go on which brushes, so it’s not a big deal for me. Before I had the brush protectors, I would take a piece of toilet paper, split it into 1 ply, and the tightly wrap that around the brush to hold the hairs in place while it dried. This worked fine, but it was a hassle to have to get the toilet paper and split it into plys. Then when it would get wet from the brush when I was trying to roll the toilet paper around the brush, it would start to rip. So, using these brush protectors is a lot less hassle! And I can just continue to reuse the same one on the same brushes, so it’s not like the toilet paper where I’d have to get a new one every time!<br /><br />The brush cleaning mat is just a basic silicone brush cleaning mat. It has little suctions on the bottom so you can place it on the counter to have it hold in place while you scrub the brushes on it, which is nice so it won’t be moving around.<br /><br />There’s different textures for different types of brushes. The product page states what each one is for…<br /><br />The pinstripe pattern at the top between the ears is to rinse smaller brushes. (Notice this area says it’s for RINSING smaller brushes, while the heart shaped area says it’s for SCRUBBING smaller brushes).<br /><br />The thick striped pattern around the ears is to “reshape big makeup brushes.” I’m not sure what reshape them means.<br /><br />The 2 big dot patterns below the eyes is “suitable for blush brushes, separating oil by up and down friction.”<br /><br />The small dot pattern that goes around the 2 areas of big dot pattern is suitable for cleaning eyeshadow brushes.<br /><br />The I-shaped area on the left side of the body is suitable for cleaning concealer and eyeshadow brushes.<br /><br />The heart shaped areas in the middle of the body is for scrubbing small brushes. Notice this area says it’s for SCRUBBING smaller brushes, while the pinstripe pattern at the top between the ears says it’s for RINSING smaller brushes).<br /><br />The U-shaped area on the right side of the body is suitable for cleaning concealer and eyeshadow brushes.<br /><br />Personally, I don’t really notice if one area cleans brushes better than other areas. I tend to use the ones that have bigger, higher up grooves, like the heart shaped area for scrubbing brushes that have foundation and concealer in them. I find these really get in there and clean out the liquid foundation/concealer well. Any of the smaller areas work well for my eyeshadow brushes.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great little set. You get the cleaning mat which is a good size with many different areas and has the suction cups on the bottom that can hold it in place. Plus you get the brush protection nets, which is nice. So, I definitely recommend it if you’re looking for both or even just one!",383368,18549
5.0,1626468234060,"Very cute, little dishes that can be used as dappen dishes or for other things!","These are so cute! First, they’re heart shaped. Second, the glass has a rainbow look to it. Third, they’re small and most small things are cute!<br /><br />They have a kind of felt on the bottom, which can keep it from scratching a surface if it slides, which is nice. But, it also means it slides easily. These are meant to be dappen dishes, so they are supposed to be used for liquids you’d use when doing your nails, such as slip solution, polish, etc. I found it had a habit of slipping easily when I dipped a brush in and wasn’t being careful about it (like if I dipped in and kind of hit the side). As long as I gently dipped into the dish, I didn’t have issues with it sliding, and even when it did slide it wasn’t a big deal because it’s not like it slid all the way across the table. Just something to be aware of.<br /><br />The lids are clear, which I thought was interesting. I’m not sure why they don’t have the rainbow look like the bottom, but it doesn’t look bad with the clear lids. I love that these came with lids that actually fit. I previously saw dappen dishes I wanted, but they had these huge lids that just kind of sat on top of the dishes, so I didn’t get them. These lids actually fit the bottoms so I’m happy about that!<br /><br />Even though these are meant to be dappen dishes, they can be used for many other things you might need a little container for. They’re very small, so there aren’t a ton of uses I can think of. But, they’d work for any kind of liquid or small items you’d want to put in them (like on your dresser to put your earrings and rings in when you take them off at the end of the night).<br /><br />I think these are great dishes. The glass is thick and durable. They look beautiful. They’re cute. And you get 2 of them! I recommend!",383368,777
5.0,1625942011819,A contour powder that’s actually a cool toned contour shade! And works for my pale skin!,"This comes bubble wrapped really well. It has a nice outer product box, but there’s no ingredients listed on it. It’s made in Korea.<br /><br />I got the shade “Light Gray.” I’m pretty pale and I’ve been looking for a good contour powder for a while. Everything I try always is too orange toned or is the right kind of color but too dark for me. When I saw this, it seemed perfect, so I was excited to try it!<br /><br />The compact is nice. It’s plain matte black with the brand name in shiny black lettering. It’s very simple but sleek. It has a nice weight to it. It doesn’t feel cheap at all, and feels nice and durable.<br /><br />When you open it, you just pull it open. There’s no indent where you put your finger to grab it, which I thought was odd. But, it opened easy. It has magnetic closure. There’s a nice sized mirror inside (it’s the full size of the lid). The pan size is good too. It takes up basically the whole bottom part of the compact, which is nice to see. There’s many times where I open a compact to see the pan much smaller and some wide border that just is wasted space.<br /><br />This is a beautiful contour shade! A lot of times I’ll get a powder that claims to be a contour powder, and it’s more like a bronzer shade. When I use a contour powder, I want one that is cool toned and will mimic my natural shadow like it should, not one that is warm like a bronzer. Otherwise, I’d just use my usual bronzer. So, I loved seeing that this was a great contour shade - cool toned. And, it was a good shade for me, not too dark for my pale skin!<br /><br />The powder works great. It’s finely milled. It applies nicely. It goes on smoothly. It doesn’t look powdery. It applies evenly. It doesn’t cling to dry or textured areas. You can apply a light layer of it or build it up to get a sharper contour. I like that it gives you the ability to change it up how you want it.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great contour powder. The compact is really nice. The powder works beautifully and looks beautiful. I recommend!",383368,11923
3.0,1624403602502,"Thought this was amazing, but now only like it..read UPDATE at bottom of review","I’d been using the Sol De Janeiro Bum Bum Body Scrub. I looooove that scrub. It smells AMAZING and the smell stays with you. You know how most body scrubs smell nice but as soon as you’re done using it, you can’t really smell it on you? Well, the Bum Bum Body Scrub isn’t like that! You can smell it on you after, heck, my whole apartment smells like coconut after using it! BUUUUT it’s $42 and it’s a sugar scrub so it goes FAST. I also hate the container it comes in. It’s cute, but it’s a pain to open in the shower, get your hand in there and get some scrub out, and it dissolves pretty quick as water hits it since it’s a sugar scrub. So, I wanted a sugar scrub that was more affordable, but still smelled great, that wasn’t such a pain to get out in the shower, and that possibly didn’t dissolve so quick when water hit it. THIS SCRUB CHECKS ALL THOSE BOXES!<br /><br />It’s way more affordable than the Bum Bum scrub. It comes in a jar, so you have to screw the top off, similar to the Bum Bum scrub. But, a lot easier. It smells amazing, like vanilla. It isn’t as strong smelling as the Bum Bum scrub, but I still feel like I can smell it on me after my shower. The BEST part....this is a “Sugar Balm Body Scrub.” The balm makes it kind of like a thicker, kind of paste. It is easier to pick up with your hands, spread on your body, and it doesn’t dissolve anywhere close to as quick as most sugar scrubs.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this scrub! I will definitely replace it when I run out, and definitely recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE - The first few times I used this, I don’t know how I didn’t notice. But, when I was using it again, I saw a loose hair from my head on my arm, I went to pick it up and as I did, my nails kind of scraped against my skin. I felt gunk go under my nails. I looked and saw all this gunk under the 2 nails that scraped against my skin! I was like, “WHAT THE HECK?!” So, then I took my nails and scraped against another area I’d used the scrub at and the same thing happened. I remembered people saying this left a film on their skin, which at the time I initially wrote my review I didn’t feel it did. But, now I DEFINITELY say it does. BUT, it can be washed off. After I scraped my skin and found out about the gunk, I took a regular body wash on a wash cloth and went over the areas I’d used the scrub. After that I scraped my nails over the areas again and, thankfully, no gunk. So, you can get the residue off. Now, whether or not you want to go through scrubbing your body with this scrub and then go over it again with soap or body wash, that’s up to you. For me, it’s not a big deal because I like how this is a balm that doesn’t rinse away as quickly as a regular sugar scrub does. I like that I can spread it onto my body and then scrub without worrying about it melting away as soon as it touches my skin. So, I’m okay dealing with having to go over the areas with a body wash after using it. But, I’m definitely going to keep searching to find the perfect body sugar scrub that is affordable and doesn’t melt away quickly like this one, but that doesn’t leave a film I have to wash off after using it. So, I’m dropping my rating down from a 5 to a 3. I thought about only dropping it to a 4 since I still like it and am willing to deal with having to go over and wash again where I used it. But, it is still kind of a pain to have to do, so I decided to drop it to a 3.",383368,965
5.0,1621633162117,Gorgeous Packaging! Amazing Formula! I Love All 3!,"This comes in a nice outer product box. The ingredients are listed on the back. It’s cruelty free, talc free, gluten free, and paraben free. It’s made in the PRC. (See photos).<br /><br />The palette is plastic. It has a white marbled appearance, which I really like. It looks really pretty. Personally, I don’t usually like to leave things sitting out on my counter. I feel like it looks like clutter. But, sometimes packaging is pretty enough where I don’t mind leaving it out. This is one of those items. There was a plastic protective sheet over the pans. A nice thing that this palette has is that the pans can be taken out, so if you want to put them in another palette or I suppose you could even rearrange them. There are shade names below each pan. The blush is “Blessed,” the highlighter is “Goddess,” and the bronzer/contour shade is “Incredible.” I like the names!<br /><br />They are all very soft, very smooth, and pigmented. They all applied beautifully! They picked up easily with a brush. Applied nicely and blended so easily! I applied too much of the bronzer/contour shade one time, I just wasn’t paying attention and dug my brush in too much, and I was still able to blend it out easily! I love when powder products are like that! I hate having to always pay attention and be careful not to pick up too much product or else I have to spend forever blending it out or apply a skin tone powder to blend it out. So, I love when powders are like these and blend so easily that it’s okay if you accidentally apply too much because you can easily blend them out!<br /><br />The blush is a beautiful light peachy color. The color works great for my pale skin. It’s pigmented, but since it’s a light peach color, it gives a nice kiss of color to the cheeks. Even if you really put a lot of product on your brush, it never looks like too much! Given that, I don’t think this would work well for darker skin tones. I’m pretty pale. I usually go for the lightest foundation shade, and even on me this blush gives just a kiss of color. It does build up slightly, but I still feel like it never looks like too much. Hopefully they have other shade options for darker skin tones because the formula is great! The blush has a slight sheen to it, but it’s just a touch of sheen. It shows up more when I swatched it than it does on the cheeks. On the cheeks, I don’t notice the sheen at all. But I do feel like it doesn’t look at flat as a matte blush, if that makes sense? I like that because I love a glowy look and love blushes with sheen, but sometimes blushes with sheen emphasize texture too much. So, I love that this sheen isn’t really noticeable, but still looks better to me than a matte blush.<br /><br />The highlighter is a beautiful gold. I was a little worried it might be too dark for me looking at it in the pan, but it seemed like it would be odd if it was too dark for me since the other shades seemed like they’d work so well for me. After swatching it I saw that it was pigmented, but a light gold, so I figured it would work for me, and it did! It’s pigmented and smooth. It gives a nice highlight. You can get a slight glow from within or build it up to be a little more. I always like having the option. It works beautifully on my skin. It didn’t emphasize texture. It didn’t look powdery at all! I love it!<br /><br />The contour/bronzer shade is just as good! It’s soft and smooth. It has good pigment. It goes on easily and blends out really easy, even if you accidentally apply too much, it’s still really easy to blend out. The color works perfectly for me.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is an amazing palette! I love all the powders! They all work beautifully! They are beautiful colors that work perfect for my pale skin. They are all so buttery, soft, and smooth. They are so easy to work with. It says the palette was $28, but now it’s $19.95 at the time of writing this review. With the packaging being so pretty and nice, decent pan sizes, and the powders being so beautiful and working so well, I would spend $28 on it, but the $19.95 is even better! If you have pale to light skin like me, I definitely say go for it! I don’t think you’ll be disappointed! If you have darker skin, I hope they have other shade options because the formula of these powders is great!",383368,14026
5.0,1618245593743,Beautiful Tube! Beautiful Glitter! A Lot of Glitter & Even in Just 1 Swipe!,"This comes in an outer product box. It is made in Korea. There’s no ingredients in English.<br /><br />The tube is really pretty! Pink and sparkly! The glitter on the cap doesn’t transfer onto your hands, so that’s great! The tube is small, but about normal size for a liquid glitter shadow like this.<br /><br />The applicator is a little doe foot. It’s easy to hold and maneuver.<br /><br />The glitter in it is great! A lot of liquid glitter shadows like this you need to layer to get a good, even amount of glitter. With this one, I did 1 swipe using the doe foot applicator on my arm and it came out with lots of glitter and was evenly spread! You can see in my swatch photo.<br /><br />Once it dries, it stays in place well, even on my hooded eyes!<br /><br />If you’re looking for a really glittery liquid shadow that will apply it evenly and a great amount of glitter from the start, I’d recommend this!",383368,14000
5.0,1617910983387,Cute headbands!,I love these! They’re so cute! They work perfect to keep my hair out of my face when I’m doing my makeup! They are comfortable. They fit my head nicely without being too loose or too tight. They haven’t seemed to stretch over the many uses. They are so soft! I love that you get 2! I use one for when I do my makeup and I use the other for when I do my skin care routine! It’s perfect! And they’re such great quality for such an affordable price! I definitely recommend!,383368,19180
4.0,1617470212597,So far so good...,"So far I really enjoy this! The EGF is at the bottom of the ingredient list so there isn’t a lot in it, which I’m okay with. It’s my first product with EGF in it and I read that EGF can be harsh on the skin. I don’t have sensitive skin but did get slightly red when using this. I’ve been using it every other night. It moisturizes my face well. I haven’t noticed any other benefits so far. If you’re looking for something with a high amount of EGF, this isn’t for you since it’s so far down on the ingredient list. But, if like me, you’re looking for something with some EGF in it to get you started but not be too much, this is a good one to start with!",383368,722
4.0,1616483170806,"Small Jar, But Very Moisturizing!","This comes in an outer product box. The bottom of the jar is made of thick glass that is frosted, the top is thick, white plastic. It has a nice appearance. There’s a plastic safety seal, which I always like. The cream is white. It has a thick consistency, but just glides onto the skin and melts into the skin. It doesn’t feel heavy on my skin. It actually does t feel like anything on the skin...it just feels like you have really moisturized skin without anything on. It absorbs quickly, it doesn’t leave any residue or sticky feeling. The cream does have a scent, like citrus, but it isn’t too over powering and is a nice smell.<br /><br />The cream feels nice on the skin. I feel really moisturized after applying it. My skin feels nice and soft. Whenever I’ve applied this at night, the next morning my skin still feels moisturized. I have dry skin, some really dry areas, so I love anything that can make my skin feel moisturized and keep it feeling that way for a while! It works nicely under makeup too. I wouldn’t use it under my makeup all the time, but on days when I’m extra dry, this works perfect! A little goes a long way, which is good since the jar is so small!<br /><br />I haven’t noticed any help with brightening or anything, but I am hopeful! The only thing I don’t like is it’s a pretty small jar for the price. But, a little goes a long way and with so many great ingredients and how moisturizing it feels, I would consider paying that. But, I can’t say for sure if I would just yet. So, I’ll update the review once I’ve used this for longer. So far, I definitely recommend this if price isn’t a factor! It has great ingredients, I love the way it feels on my skin.",383368,238
5.0,1612817273333,Great Starter Set!,"This comes packaged together in a cute purple box.<br /><br />There’s 8 tubes of poly gel. Each tube is sealed. There’s a nice sized pink nail file. There’s a dual headed tool - one end has the flat metal side to apply the poly gel. The other side is a brush. There’s a bottle of base coat and a bottle of top coat. There’s also a bag of dual forms.<br /><br />This has everything you need EXCEPT for slip solution, which you can just use alcohol so that’s not a huge deal. The product info page says, “you can use alcohol ,cleanser or base coat to instead, They act the same effect.).” Also, one of the photos on the product page says, “Base coat could be used as a slip solution. It will make it easier to make gel smoothly. No alcohol or nail cleanser needed!” I’ve never heard of using cleanser (what cleanser do they mean? 🤷‍♀️) or base coat as a slip solution. But I’m pretty new to poly gels, so I could just not know. Unless it’s just this brands base coat that can be used as a slip solution? 🤷‍♀️<br /><br />There’s a good assortment of colors. You get “clear,” “nude,” “pink,” “orange red,” “bean paste” (I’m not sure why the product info page calls it that but it’s like a pinky mauve type color to me), “brown” (this is like a light tan color), and 2 “color changing” (one looks like it goes from a hot pink or purplish pink to white and the other looks like it goes from a pinky red to a white).<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great set. There’s a good assortment of colors. The poly gels work well. You get everything you need (EXCEPT the slip solution). So, I think this is a great set for anyone, especially someone starting out with poly gels.",383368,1546
3.0,1612370091319,"It’s Okay, But Not For Me...","This is okay but there’s a few issues I have with it....<br /><br />First, the mirror came with a little chunk in the corner gone. It’s not a big deal because it’s so small, but it would be nice if the mirror would have come better protected so that it wasn’t missing a piece no matter how small.<br /><br />Second, this doesn’t really hold much unless you want it to be all separate parts. If you have it all put together with the side trays sitting on each side of the big oval tray, the silicone pieces over top the side trays, and the square tray sitting in the middle of the big oval tray - Then you can’t hold much with it. The side trays with the silicone pieces only hold so much. The one with the lines you can lay brushes in the grooves like shown in the photos on the product page. But, there’s only 4 grooves where brushes can actually lay, and more than 1 or sometimes 2 brushes is all that fits in each groove. The other silicone tray has the X’s that you can put things in so they stand straight up. There’s 11 small ones and 8 big ones. The big ones you could potentially fit more than 1 item in. Also, the middle tray part that the mirror goes over as a lid, if you’re going to do that, then you can only have items in that tray that the mirror will be able to lay flat over, so that limits how much and what you can place in it. If you have it all put together, then it doesn’t take up much room. But, if you have it all in separate parts (like the first photo on the product page), then it takes up a lot of room for not holding too much. I might as well keep using my cups or brush holders for my brushes, which hold a ton of brushes, and plastic or acrylic drawer organizers.<br /><br />Third, I don’t like how the mirror just sits, it isn’t actually attached. It comes off so easy. One little bump and the mirror falls over. It would be nice if they would have that attached somehow so that it would fold down over the tray but still be connected.<br /><br />Finally, it’s supposed to be easy to wash and dry. To me, the silicone pieces are not easy to clean. The dust collects on them like crazy. And I try to just wipe off the dust with a dry cloth but the silicone is rubbery and the dust just kind of sticks to it. If you use a wet cloth you’re able to get the dust, but you have to work really hard to get it off. I just don’t like it.<br /><br />Overall, this just doesn’t work for me. I wanted it to organize things while taking up less space. But, when it is taking up less space, it doesn’t hold enough for me. If you’re looking just to hold a few small things. Like you have some small items that you just want to have a place, then this might work for you. As long as you don’t mind that the mirror isn’t attached and might come off easy.",383368,1979
2.0,1612367533407,Way Too Big For Me to Use,"I’m an adult female, but this is way too big for me to use. I’ve always had a small mouth, it’s even been an issue for my teeth. My teeth were crowded and my dentist always said it’s because my mouth was too small for the normal amount of teeth. I didn’t think about the fact that my mouth might be too small to use this. So, unfortunately I wasn’t able to actually use this since it was just too darn big! It seems like it is a standard jar exerciser. It seems durable. Just unfortunately couldn’t work for me.",383368,19174
1.0,1612347857978,"Not Creamy, Not Pigmented...","This comes in a cute outer product box. Inside, the pencil is wrapped in plastic.<br /><br />The pencil is a standard jumbo kind of pencil and has a clear lid. I show a photo comparing it to a pen to show size.<br /><br />I got the shade “Chalfont - 303,” which is described as a “shimmering shade of Pearl.” For me, this just wasn’t great. For me, I just think it’s definitely not worth $18 (at the time of writing this review).<br /><br />The product info page describes the pencil as having “intense colour.” I did not notice any intensity of color! It says, “Use your makeup highlighter pencil as a creamy, velvety eyeshadow, eyeliner, and highlighter. Apply it to your inner corners and entire eyelid for a pop of intense colour.” This pencil wasn’t creamy or velvety. To me it felt really dry and was even kind of powdery on application. It also says, “It can be used on its own with a beautiful opaque colour payoff, or built up for extra glamour thanks to its vibrant pigment.” It didn’t seem opaque at all. It could be because I got a shimmer Pearl shade. But, when I applied it, you could hardly see it, I had to really layer it, and even then it’s just not very noticeable.<br /><br />I’ve tried other Pippa of London products and they’ve been great. Unfortunately, this pencil wasn’t one of them. This was a no for me. It could have been the color, maybe if I would have gotten a darker color it would have performed as the product page describes. But, that shouldn’t be the case. The pencil should perform as described no matter what color you get. So, I wouldn’t recommend this.",383368,724
5.0,1611724045464,Beautiful Glitters!,"These come together in a nice box that flips open at the top. There’s styrofoam at the top protecting the bottles. There’s an instruction booklet inside. There’s styrofoam holding each of the bottles in place inside, which I liked a lot! There’s stickers on the top of each colored polish. The stickers are the color of the polish and have numbers on them (like P037 and P038). I really liked they had stickers on the TOPS of the bottles so you can easily see which color the polish is. The bottles are all made of glass. They feel nice. And they are decent sizes.<br /><br />There are NO base or top coats included. This is ONLY colored polishes. So, if you don’t have a top and base coat, you’ll need to get your own to use this set.<br /><br />I got the chameleon shimmering color and black. Theres 6 polishes in total. There’s 5 glitter polishes - a lime green, a blue (the sticker is a little misleading, it makes it look like it’s a baby blue, but really it’s a royal blue), purple (again, the sticker is a little misleading, it looks like a pink, but the color is a purple), another purple, and a dark blue (again, the sticker is misleading, it looks like it’s a silver, but it’s a dark blue). There’s 1 solid color - a black.<br /><br />Even the photos on the product page can be a little misleading. On the product page the first photo shows a dark teal glitter, a dark blue glitter, a dark green glitter, a dark purple glitter, a blue glitter and then the solid black. But those are what the shades are supposed to look like with a black base. If you look at the other product photos, especially the 3rd one, you’ll see what the colors are without a black base and with a black base. All the shades look the same in the bottle as what’s shown in the 3rd product photo without a black base, EXCEPT “P041.” In the 3rd product photo “P041” without a black base looks like a silver glitter, just like the sticker on top of the bottle makes it seem. But, in the bottle and on the finger (without a black base), it looks like a dark blue glitter.<br /><br />These are glitters so they are a little thick, but they’re still easy to work with. They cure easily. They look beautiful with or without the black base. I love that I basically get 10 colors because I get 5 colors when I use a black base, and then 5 slightly different colors if I use the black base.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a cute set if you’re looking for glitter polishes!",383368,16372

It has a digital display. The plug is a standard prong plug, which I love! So many products have USB plugs nowadays. I always appreciate when a product has a standard plug!<br /><br />The shiny gold appearance of it is a little gaudy for my taste. But, I hadn’t seen an at home nail lamp with this high of wattage before, so I was willing to have the shiny gold if I got the high wattage. It actually didn’t look too gaudy once I got used to it.<br /><br />Overall, I’m very happy! I think you get a great lamp, that works great with such a high wattage.",383368,1549
4.0,1608823986030,Feel Soft and Creamy! Not too Pigmented But Do Build Up Well!,"These come in an outer product box that is sealed in clear plastic wrapping. Once you remove the plastic wrapping, the product box has an open window in the front where you can see the eyeshadow shadow sticks (see photos). The back of the box lists the ingredients be the manufacturer (in China). It also has the cruelty free bunny logo. (See photos)<br /><br />The eyeshadow sticks are all in black tubes. They have the brand name “Luxaza” along with the name of the shade on the front written in the shade of the shadow stick. There’s black lids on one end and a clear lid on the other end. Under the clear lid, there’s a brush. Now...it was really weird with the brush end. First, I went to pull off the clear cap, and it wouldn’t pull off. So I thought maybe it was screw off, so when I tried to twist it, I heard the clicking sound like the crayon part was twisting out, which I didn’t want since I still had the cap on that end. I then pulled really hard and the clear cap came off. Then, I brushed my finger across the tip of the brush to feel it, and it looked like a bunch of powder came flying off of it. So I thought maybe I missed somewhere where it said the other end of the shadow stick had a powder brush. So, I went to the product page to see and it doesn’t say anything about powder. It was just what I initially thought, that it’s a brush to blend out the shadow stick. So, I brushed my finger across the tip of the brush again to see if more powder came off and none did. So, I then took the clear cap off another shadow stick and brushed my finger across the tip of that brush to see if powder would come off...none did. Then I went through doing that with all the other shadow sticks and no powder type stuff came off of those. So I don’t know what it was with that first one...or if I’m just crazy which is entirely possible too 😂 Anyways, the brush feels nice and soft. It’s short and dense, but still a little fluffy, so blends out color well. Like I said, the clear cap is a little tough to remove...I really had to pull to get it off each shadow stick. Also, you need to be careful when putting the cap back on because the hairs of the brush get in the way.<br /><br />The crayon part you don’t need to sharpen. It twists up. You twist the end with the brush. There’s not too much product in the tube. I twisted them all the way up to see. It ends up looking to be less than half the size of the tube (see photos, I took a photo of one twisted all the way up). They do feel smooth and creamy. They aren’t very pigmented. To get the pigment you see in my swatches, I needed to go over them each quite a few times (about 5 times). Most are shimmers. 2 of them have glitter particles in them (“Mermaid Teardrop” and “Purple Sunset”). The glitter isn’t too bad, it doesn’t fall out and leave glitter particles everywhere. But, like any glitter, when you try to remove it, you will see glitter particles randomly afterwards (anyone who have used anything with any glitter in it knows what I mean....it’s just everywhere! 😂).  I do think that a few of the colors are so similar you don’t notice a difference on the eyes. Especially “Dark Orchid” and “Dark Magenta.” I just don’t notice much difference between them. The brush on the other end blends them out well. They last okay on my eyes. I have really hooded eyes, so any type of cream shadow usually creases and wears off within a few hours. These were no different when I used them on their own. But, if I used them together with powder eyeshadow, they lasted well.<br /><br />Overall, you get 6 shadow sticks for $9.99 (at the time of writing this review). If these are colors you like and you want just a wash of color, I’d say go for it! They are smooth and creamy. If you’re looking for something with really good pigment, you’re going to have to really build these up for good pigment. Since there’s other cream stick shadows out there that are much more pigmented without needing to build them up, I wouldn’t really recommend these if you want something with a lot of pigment without needing built up.",383368,977

The product itself is white, a medium consistency cream feel.<br /><br />It’s very gentle. It doesn’t lather up at all. You just move the product around on your face to get off any makeup or whatever. I always double cleanse, but if I didn’t, this isn’t something I’d use to remove makeup. This is something I’d use in my double cleanse - I use a makeup removing oil to remove my makeup, rinse that off, and then use this cleanser. This is marketed for people with sensitive skin, and I would definitely say it’s very gentle. I’m not saying this wouldn’t clean off makeup, but personally since it doesn’t lather up, I just wouldn’t feel like my face is totally clean just using this. But, I already always double cleanse anyways, and I like how gentle this is so I’m not overly stripping my face.<br /><br />This is such a nice, gentle cleanser. After using it, my face doesn’t feel stripped or dry. Usually, after I wash my face it feels tight and dry and I need to put on moisturizer. After using this, my face doesn’t feel that way. I don’t feel like I HAVE to apply moisturizer.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great choice for a gentle cleanser! If you’re looking for something extremely gentle, I’d definitely recommend this!",383368,732

It’s “Korean inspired, American made.” It has no parabens, fragrances, GMO, or allergens, and is cruelty free.<br /><br />The pump works well. It disperses a good amount of product, but not too much. The product is a nice, thin cream. It glides onto the skin easily, absorbs quickly, and doesn’t leave any sticky or tacky feeling or residue of any kind.<br /><br />This has a lot of good ingredients like organic aloe, hyaluronic acid, jojoba, Shea butter, and retinol. These good ingredients are high on the list of ingredients too.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great product. It feels good on the skin and my skin feels hydrated. It isn’t too pricey and a little goes a long way. I can’t speak to any long term results since I haven’t been using it long. But, so far I like it. I would recommend trying this!",383368,22417

I love travel sized products, so you can try the product to see if you like it!<br /><br />I really liked the priming essence and priming water. They worked way better for my dry skin than the no poreblem primer did. The no poreblem primer feels too silicone for me. The priming essence and priming water both feel so light but hydrating and my makeup looks so much better when I use one of them!<br /><br />If you’ve been wanting to try Touch In Sol primers, this is a great way to try some of them!

I was happy to see this set of 4!<br /><br />These liquid glitter eyeshadows are GORGEOUS!<br /><br />They come in a product box. The tubes of product have gold caps and clear tubes, so you can see the shade. The brand name and logo is on the front of the tubes in gold. The applicator is a nice sized doe foot - not too big for my small eyes, but big enough. These are short tubes, so the applicator is short. But, it’s still easy to hold and maneuver. The shade number and name are on a sticker on the bottom of the tube.<br /><br />You get 4<br />- 001 Mauve Plum - Mauve liquid shadow with silver glitter.<br />- 002 Rosy Gold  - Rose gold liquid shadow with silver glitter.<br />- 003 Silver Flash - White liquid shadow with silver glitter<br />- 004 Sparkle Midnight - Black liquid shadow with silver glitter.<br /><br />They all look so beautiful. The shimmer with them looks even with application. You can layer them well. They don’t take too long to dry. They lasted well on my hooded eyes without creasing (that is, no more than what I normally get with any eyeshadow). When the light hits these they look so beautiful.<br /><br />I show photos of swatches - I did 1 swipe for each color. Then I did little areas where I layered the colors to show how they built up. I also did a video showing them.<br /><br />I think this is such a great set! To get 4 liquid glitter shadows for $13.99 (at the time of writing this review), I think that’s a great deal! All other liquid glitter shadows I’ve found were sold individually and buying 4 would have been way more than this set costs! I’m definitely going to be using these up and hoping they’ll come out with additional colors soon!!",383368,9808
5.0,1605801795952,Provides Great Coverage. Feels Nice On Skin & Looks Smooth!,"This comes with an outer product box. It has the same appearance as the tube of foundation - black with white wording. There’s also a little rectangle in the shade, with the shade number and name. The product packaging looks nice. It comes with a product card saying they love to hear from you and 2 samples for hair products (which I thought was odd for hair products with foundation, but whatever 😂) - 1 for “RG II Hair Loss Clinic Premium Shampoo” and 1 for “Sohair Morocco Argan Oil Hair Essence.” I didn’t try either of the samples so can’t say anything for how those work.<br /><br />The foundation comes in a squeeze tube. When you twist off the main top, there’s a protective seal. I usually like pumps with my foundations. But, I don’t mind this being a squeeze tube. It isn’t messy at all. I just squirt some out onto my brush or sponge, dab it in areas on my face, then blend it out.<br /><br />They don’t have a large range of shade options - there’s only 2. With BB & CC creams, they’re usually so thin that a shade that’s a little off from you is usually still okay. I got the shade “#1 Light Beige.” I’m pretty pale. I can make the shade work for me, but I do wish it was a tad lighter. See my photos. I did a photo showing a drop of this Bb Cream, then a swatch doing 1 swipe with a small amount on my finger, then took what was left on my finger from the swatch and dabbed it and blended it out. I also show a photo of a swatch of this BB Blemish Cream, where I also show some blended out. Then I compared it to a swatch of L’Oréal Infallible Pro Glow in 201 Classic Ivory and Maybelline 24 Hr Foundation in 102 Fair Porcelain (I tried to use foundations most people might have tried). As you can see, both are lighter than this BB Blemish Cream. The Maybelline is MUCH lighter. I’m pretty pale, but even that one is a tad too pale for me, so I always have to warm it up with bronzer. But, this BB Blemish Cream is definitely on the darker side for me, but I’m able to make it work.<br /><br />The formula feels nice. It isn’t too thin or runny. It feels nice and creamy. On the product info page it said, “BB Cream Tinted Moisturizer Blemish Balm lets you perfectly blend & build tones from sheer to medium coverage.” Most BB creams I’ve tried are usually sheer to light, not able to go up to medium coverage. But, this actually provides a lot more coverage than I expected with a BB cream! I usually don’t go for BB/CC creams that often because they’re such light coverage. But, there’s times when I want lighter coverage and was looking for a new BB/CC cream and figured I’d give this a try. I’m really glad I did! It evens out my skin tone like I’d expect with a BB cream, but also provides decent coverage too. It doesn’t feel dry on my skin. You can also build it up too if you want, and it doesn’t look dry or cakey. I’d say you can get anywhere from really light coverage (like just evening out your skin tone and maybe covering small, light spots with a thin layer) to good medium coverage (if you build it up some). It builds up nicely enough where it might even be considered full coverage to some, but for me I consider it medium coverage 😂 I can’t build it up too much on myself because the color isn’t a good enough match for me. The more I build it up, the more it doesn’t match my skin. So, when I use this since it’s not really light enough for me, I can only use a thin layer of it. But, I did build it up just to test it out for this review and it looks nice and smooth on the skin whether you’re doing a light layer or building it up.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a really great BB cream! It gives you more coverage than other BB creams I’ve tried. I like the squeeze tube. The product feels and looks nice on the skin. I definitely recommend giving this a try if you’re looking for something that will give you light to medium coverage while looking nice, smooth, and not dry or cakey.",383368,19175
3.0,1603564306149,"Bad Smell, Don’t Wipe Off Makeup Easily","They come in a nice little disposable pack. Theres a plastic area where the top opens and closes. The opening for the wipes wasn’t big enough. It had the little plastic opening with the split in the middle, and it was just TINY! I ended up cutting the plastic part off, and then the opening was big enough.<br /><br />The wipes are a good size. They are nice and soft. However, they have a weird smell - like cardboard? I don’t know. I can’t really place it, but I don’t like it.<br /><br />The wipes aren’t too wet. I do a lot of makeup swatches of eyeshadow palettes and things like that. So, I constantly am using makeup wipes to wipe the swatches off of my arms. These work good for that. I wouldn’t use them on my face because, while they’re wet enough to wipe the swatches off my arms, I need to rub more than I do with my usual wipes. Given that, I wouldn’t want to use them on my face where I’d need to rub hard, pulling my skin. It’s not good to use makeup wipes to remove your makeup anyways, since it can tug at your skin and because they usually don’t remove all of your makeup. I still sometimes like to use makeup wipes to wipe the majority of my makeup off, then go in and cleanse my face. But, again, I just wouldn’t use these for that. With the odd smell and needing to rub more to get the makeup off, I wouldn’t want to use these on my face. But, for getting the swatches off my arms they work good.<br /><br />So, for purposes of wiping swatches off my arm, they work good enough. As I said earlier, with the weird smell and them being not that wet, causing me to need to rub harder, I just wouldn’t use them on my face.",383368,2288
2.0,1602993546225,"STRONG Smell, Couldn’t Get Past The Smell to Really Use It Other Than a Drop on My Hand","When this first arrived, I was going to open the amazon packaging and I could smell a strong, medicine like scent. So, I immediately thought that it must have broken in transit. Once I opened the amazon shipping package, there was a box inside. There wasn’t anything all over the box, so I opened it, and inside was a glass bottle completely intact. I couldn’t understand why the scent was so strong if the bottle was intact. Then, I thought if I can smell it that strong now, I wonder how it’ll be using it. The scent of the packaging had such a strong medicine kind of pepper smell, it was really overpowering.<br /><br />Inside the box, there’s a product info card. It has the product on one side with what benefits it’s supposed to have. The other side has specific instructions on how and when to use, and a full list of ingredients. I really liked that!<br /><br />The product comes in a glass bottle with a dropper. The bottle seems nice and durable. The product itself is a orange-yellowish color. I applied a little to the top of my hand and it felt oily. Someone in another review said it felt oily but they expected that since it was an oil. I’m not sure if they were talking about this product or another one. This is called a serum, so I don’t really expect it to be oily. I’m not sure if it’s some kind of serum, oil combo? I have dry skin so the oiliness wasn’t too bad for me. But, I could still feel it, so if I had oily skin I probably wouldn’t even want to use it.<br /><br />Anyways, the most use I could get out of it was the little I put on the top of my hand. The scent was so strong, it made me a little sick to my stomach. I’m not usually sensitive to smells, so it must have just been this specific scent - it had a medicinal, pepper type smell. I don’t really know how to describe it, but it wasn’t for me. So, unfortunately I can’t really say whether or not this is a good product. All I can say is that it comes in a nice glass bottle with a dropper, has a really strong scent, and it feels oily. If you’re sensitive to smells, I would say this isn’t for you.",383368,81

They are easy to open and close but clamp tightly onto the finger. They are so helpful when doing poly gel nails! They keep the mold in place, keeping it flat against the nail bed without any bubbling, giving me a smooth poly gel nail! I’m so glad I got these! They’re definitely one of those things you don’t really think you needed until you get them, then you’re wondering how you ever did it without them! If you like doing poly gel nails, these are a great help!",383368,2196

4.0,1599799047458,My First Nail Drill and I Love It!,"This was my first nail drill and I love it!<br /><br />It comes well packaged. It’s in a box, and everything is in it nicely.<br /><br />I’ve been doing my own nails, and wanted a drill to make it easier. I was a little scared since I’d never used one on myself before. This one was so easy! It comes with instructions. It’s so easy to work! It is easy to hold and maneuver, it isn’t too big or heavy. It doesn’t get too hot. I love that all the controls for the drill are on the power cord, so I don’t accidentally hit anything and end up hurting myself while I’m using the drill! I love how it comes with so many attachments! It even comes with a little brush so you can dust off any dust. The one thing I wish is that it had a standard plug, rather than a USB. It seems so many things are USB plugs now though, so it is what it is. But, if it had the standard plug, it would have been perfect! Other than that, I have no complaints!<br /><br />The ease of use and compact size make this perfect for a beginner like me!<br /><br />EDIT: There’s no switch or anything to remove the different heads. You just need to pull it out. They push in easy enough, but my goodness are they hard to pull out! It makes sense since you’d been using it and it was rotating. So I wish there was some kind of switch to make it easier to take out the heads. So I’m taking off 1 star because of that.",383368,2197

I had used a Jade roller before, but never a Gua Sha, so I really appreciated that these came with a little pamphlet telling you how to use them.<br /><br />The Jade roller is great quality. It doesn’t squeak at all. Rolls nicely, without any skipping or sticking. The bigger side is great for your whole face, and the smaller side works perfect for under your eyes.<br /><br />I love using this to rub in any oils or serums I’m using. Sometimes I will put this in the refrigerator to get it cold, and then use it. It feels so nice on! It’s really relaxing whether you use it cold or room temp.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this set! It’s so affordable but so well made!",383368,7129
2.0,1599757016448,Okay...,"I wanted these because they looked short. I love fake nails, but hate really long ones. And most are so long. So, I liked that these were on the shorter side.<br /><br />I like the French manicure look. They look beautiful. However, I do not like the rhinestones. I thought that they’d be smaller. But they are so big. If they fall off, it’s pretty noticeable....and they do fall off.<br /><br />They come with an alcohol wipe, nail file, and stick to clean under your nails and push your cuticles back. If you use the alcohol pad, file your nails, and push your cuticles back, these last a decent amount of time. However, a lot of them didn’t fit the curve of my nails so the sides kept lifting up on some. That was pretty annoying and those areas just wouldn’t stick down. Also, not many of the nails fit well. So, in the product photo, the nails with rhinestones are on the thumb, pointing finger, and middle finger. I usually prefer my nails with accents (like rhinestones to either be on the thumb and ring finger or pointer and ring finger, not the first 3). I couldn’t find a nail to fit my middle finger, except for one with rhinestones so I ended up with rhinestones I’m the first 4 fingers, and I just didn’t like the look of that. It seems like you don’t have many options for fit with these nails. And I didn’t like how big the rhinestones were. So these just aren’t for me.",383368,1160

5.0,1599319748162,Great Mask! A Lot of Product!,"These are great masks! There seems to be a lot of product on the masks, which I wasn’t sure I’d like at first. But, after using a few of them, it really seems like your face is getting the extra benefit of the extra product. With most sheet masks, there’s product on them, but once they sit on your face and you remove the mask, there’s only a little residue left, that you rub into your skin. With these masks, it seems like there was a lot left after. So, I rubbed it into my face after. With all the excess product, I feel like my skin is getting mote of the benefits. You can feel the bubbling, which feels interesting but in a good way!<br /><br />The only weird thing I found was, with most sheet masks, you apply the mask, let it sit for the appropriate time, remove the mask, rub in any excess product left over, and you’re done. With these masks, however, the instructions say to re-wash your face after removing the mask. It says, “Apply the mask to face after cleaning. Remove it after 15-20 minutes. Re-clean skin until it is completely absorbed.” That makes zero sense to me. “Re-clean skin until it is completely absorbed” 🤷‍♀️ If you’re washing your face after removing the mask, the product won’t be absorbed, it will be washed off. So that makes no sense. I’m not sure what that’s about. So, I would leave the mask on for the 15-20 min, remove the mask, rub in the excess product for a minute, then rinse off my face.<br /><br />I love that you get 10 masks! A lot of facial sheet masks you only get one or you get 10 but at a higher cost. So, I love you get 10 of these, and that they didn’t skimp at all on the product on the masks! I definitely recommend these!<br /><br />I value reviews and always try to provide the kind of information I’d want to know about a product before making a purchase. So I hope that this did that for you and was helpful to you in making your decision! If so, please click “helpful” below!",383368,2207
5.0,1599073450180,Pretty Great!,"So far I’m really enjoying this! It comes with a dropper, which I like. It’s consistency isn’t too thick or thin. It glides on smoothly, and absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky residue. It has no scent, which I also love.<br /><br />I am 34 and still suffer from hormonal breakouts. When will they end?! 😤  I get them around my mouth and chin area. I’m always looking for something to help with the hormonal breakouts. Usually, I get a pimple or 2, it usually takes forever to go away, and a lot of times there’s a red dot left behind where it was that just seems to hang around forever, sometimes even after a new breakout has come there’s still a red mark where the old one(s) were! By the time the breakout finally goes away (at least mostly other than the red mark that sometimes stays), it’s time for another! Vicious cycle 😠 So, I’m always looking for something that will help! I’d love if I could find something that would keep the breakouts away completely...if anyone knows of that magic, please let me know!! But, I’d be happy with something that would help get the breakouts to go away faster and leave no marks. I also have some indentations (scars) where I had breakouts in the past and picked them (oh, if only my past younger self could know what I know now!). So, I’m always looking for something to help make those go away or at least lessen them.<br /><br />This says it’s an intensive 21 day treatment. The product information on the product page says, “Achieve a flawless complexion in 21 days.” The company is even is so confident in that claim that it also says, “We're confident you'll see results in 21 days with our acne treatment. And if you’re ever unsatisfied, no worries! We back it up with a 100% guarantee!” That is a bold claim, and they are backing it up! So, when I saw that I definitely wanted to try it!<br /><br />It doesn’t say exactly what you do AFTER you’ve used it for 21 days. I guess since they are guaranteeing a “flawless complexion” in those 21 days, so they didn’t feel the need to say what to do once those 21 days were over. 🤷‍♀️ I did see someone asked if they could continue using it after 21 days, and the company responded saying, “The optimal time is 21 days, but you may use it even longer, as you see fit.” So, that answered that question.<br /><br />I have been using the serum for 21 days every night, and some days even in the morning. I did notice that my hormonal breakout wasn’t quite as bad, but I still got it. It did seem to go away slightly faster too. But, I definitely do NOT have a “flawless complexion.”<br /><br />I honestly didn’t think I would get a “flawless complexion” after using this for 21 days. That is a pretty bold claim. I honestly don’t like the fact that they are making such a claim. That sets people up for disappointment if they really believe that using this for 21 days will give them a “flawless complexion.” The fact that they offer to backup that bold claim by offering a 100% refund if the person isn’t “satisfied with the results,” makes it a little better. But, I’m sure they know most people probably aren’t going to take the time to send it back after using it for 21 days. 🤷‍♀️ Even though I didn’t think I’d get a “flawless complexion” after using this for the full 21 days, I at least hoped it would help lessen the hormonal breakouts and help them go away quicker. It did seem to do that. Now, since my breakouts are hormonal, that might be a factor in why I still got them even while using this regularly. So, if you suffer from acne and it isn’t hormonal, it might heal up current breakouts and keep any future breakouts away. I can’t really speak to that.<br /><br />So, if you see that this product is saying you’ll have a “flawless complexion” in 21 days and that’s why you’re getting it, I think you might be disappointed. But, if you have realistic expectations - that this will help lessen the breakouts and help heal them up a little quicker, then I think you’d like this. Overall, it helped lessen my hormonal breakouts, helped them go away a little quicker, and my skin seemed smoother and less red in the areas. So, I’m happy with the results. But, boy do I wish it really did give me that “flawless complexion!” 😉",383368,2185
5.0,1598282178719,A Great Mascara AND A Great Lash Curler!,"I have pretty small, hooded eyes, so it’s hard to find a lash curler that works for my eyes. The biggest issue I have is them pinching my eye when I’m clamping down to curl them. I always have to lightly clamp down to see if I’ll pinch myself and, if I will, then adjust. Then, I end up having some parts not curled. I’d been looking for a new curler for a while, when I saw this I figured it was worth a try since I also got mascara.<br /><br />Someone in the reviews had said the package came damaged. Mine also did. It wasn’t too bad, just seemed a little beat up. But, the products inside were completely fine and didn’t seem damaged at all, so I was okay with that.<br /><br />I am very picky about my mascara. Well, not so much the mascara as I am the mascara wand. With my small, hooded eyes, it makes it so I end up with a lot of mistakes of the wand hitting below my lower lash line or onto my hood. So, I prefer thinner wands. I wasn’t sure what to expect with this mascara, but I was also getting a lash curler so I figured I’d hopefully like at least 1 of them. I’m happy to say that the mascara wand isn’t too thick. It’s not extremely thin, but still thin enough so it works for me. It also has a little bend to it, which helps with application. The mascara goes on very easily and doesn’t clump up after a few coats, which is great! It stays on all day without smearing. But, it also washes off easily at the end of the day, which I always love. It’s hard to find a mascara that stays all day without smearing or smudging, but is easy to wash off. So, it’s nice this does both!<br /><br />The lash curler is amazing! It’s lightweight. It feels so nice. I love the red, black, and gold. It looks so fancy! It fits my eyes really well and curls my lashes AMAZINGLY without pinching my eyes at all! I’m really happy with it! It also comes with replacements for the rubber part on the curler, so that was great!<br /><br />For $11.99 (at the time of writing this), it’s an amazing deal! You’re getting an amazing lash curler and an amazing mascara. You can’t beat that! If you’re looking for a great mascara, a great lash curler, or both, you should definitely give this a try!",383368,889
3.0,1597577229511,Pretty Decent Set! Avoid If Sensitive to Smells!,"This is a pretty decent set! For $25.99 (at the time of writing this review), you get a lot of items!!<br /><br />I love that it comes in a cute little caboodle box! Everything fits in it great! So all of the stuff is together in one place and it’s small enough that it’s easy to store!<br /><br />The little pots of glitter cake together in a little zip lock bag, which I appreciated because some of the glitter had spilled out, so that kept it contained. It was only a few glitter particles, but I was still glad it was contained to the little bag! The poly gel tubes each come in their own little bags too, which I thought was nice. None of them leaked, but if they had it would have been very messy had they not been in a bag and still messy if they weren’t in separate bags. So, even though mine didn’t leak, I’m glad the company thought of the possibility and planned ahead just in case!<br /><br />The polishes all come in their own box. I wish they would have labeled the OUTSIDE of the boxes. The only thing on the boxes were “Nail Polish” on 2 of them and “Gel Nail Polish” on the rest. Since 2 were supposed to be the top and base coat and only 2 said “Nail Polish,” I figured those were the top and base coats. I was wrong. I’m not sure why 2 said “Nail Polish” and the others said “Gel Nail Polish,” especially since they’re all supposed to be Gel polishes 🤷‍♀️ So, I had to open each box and look at each nail polish bottle to see which ones were which. The base and top coats were labeled on the outside of the bottles. BUT, the colored polishes weren’t labeled in any way. So the only way to figure out which color was which was to open each one. A minor inconvenience, but annoying when they could have just labeled them with the colors! So, I ended up putting a dot of the polish on the top of each box so I’d know in the future. It would just be nice if in the future the company labels them better!<br /><br />The polish STINKS! It smells like burnt plastic 🤢 All Nail Polish stinks, but I’ve gotten used to the “regular” stink of nail polish. Smelling burned plastic while painting my nails is not something I’ve gotten used to! But, for the price of everything I got, it’s something I can deal with. But if smells bother you, this is not the kit for you!!!<br /><br />The UV lamp works okay. I took a few times of turning it on to get the nails to dry, but it’s small so I wasn’t expecting too much and they did and it was still faster than if I painted my nails with regular polish and waited for them to dry. So I’m happy!<br /><br />Overall, it’s a good little kit! I love that it comes all together in the cute little caboodle box. I love that you got an assortment of polish colors and an assortment of poly gel colors. I love that it came with the base and top coats. I love that it came with a UV lamp. I love it came with the tool needed for the poly gel nails. I love it came with glitter, foils, and strip tape to decorate the nails. I didn’t like that the polishes weren’t labeled better and I didn’t like the burnt plastic smell of the polish. But for everything I love and the affordable price for everything you get, I can get past those 2 things I didn’t like!!<br /><br />I’d say the only thing that would make me tell you to avoid getting this kit would be if you’re sensitive to strong smells because of the burnt plastic smell from the polish. Other than that, I’d recommend this kit!!",383368,2835
2.0,1595370379863,Meh...,"This is an okay eye mask...<br /><br />First, I’m not sure if the size or shape is off. It kind of poked me in my inner corner. If I put it any lower so it wouldn’t do that, it left way too much of my under eye uncovered.<br /><br />I like that it has sticking on the back, because most gel under eye masks slide off easily. However, these didn’t stick well at all. As you can see I’m the last photo, it lifts up and that was taken right after I applied it. Every time I tried sticking it back down, it would just lift back up again.<br /><br />Finally, it wasn’t hydrating at all. When I applied them, there didn’t seem like there was much substance on them at all. I didn’t think too much about that though, because I’d used masks like that before that were still very good. However, after leaving these on for the recommended time, I didn’t notice any difference and my under eyes didn’t feel any more hydrated than before. A moisturizer would be better, and I wouldn’t have to wait around with it sitting on my under eyes to do that.<br /><br />Overall, it’s okay. It definitely isn’t great. Unfortunately, I definitely don’t recommend it at $6 (at time of writing this) for 1 pack that only includes 1 set of under eye masks. There’s much better options, especially ones you get more than 1 set and for less money.",383368,2329

This review is for: [SKIN&LAB] Barrierderm Milky Serum | Infused with Milk Ceramide Complex, Squalane, and Panthenol to ...<br /><br />I have used products from Skin & Lab before and liked most of them, and this serum is no exception. I was coming off of a different moisturizer that really irritated my skin, so I introduced this serum slowly. I started using it only once a day and once that previous irritation cleared up I moved up to twice a day.<br /><br />This serum is somewhere in between watery and a cream. The glass bottle is opaque and the serum does dispense as  milky-looking. It has no scent that I can detect. The dropper dispenses enough for about half my face, so I've been using two droppers per application. It has soothed my skin, clearing up my previous Rosacea break out and smoothing out my skin. I have an oily t-zone and a super dry chin this winter,  and all of that seems to be gone now.<br /><br />Due to these cold, breezy winter months, I have been using a moisturizer over this serum. I suspect that in the summer months, I might not even need to do that.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to continued use of this product and when it's gone I will most likely buy more.

Some have a type of...cord-like elastic that leaves its imprint on your forehead for hours after you wake up.<br /><br />I do find that this one slips a bit, so a bobby pin tucked in the back will help it stay on overnight, especially if you're an active sleeper like I am.<br /><br />I find this bonnet to be better than average and I would get another one in the future.",383371,45478
5.0,1630682049698,Excellent Moisturizing,"As many of you already know, I am a lotion addict. That addiction is now branching out to facial serums and moisturizers. This ampoule is one of the better ones I have tried. This review is of: ZEROID Dermanewal Revitalizing Ampoule | Restore Energy to Stressed Out Skin | (30mL).<br /><br />I've been using this each morning for about a week now and I love this stuff! For whatever reason, I wasn't expecting much from this product and as it turns out, it's one of the best things I've tried from Vine.<br /><br />I can detect no scent from this serum, which is good. What I do detect is healthier looking and ALIVE looking skin. The directions for this serum are rather vague and consist of one line ""Apply liberal amount to the needed area."" I didn't really know what to make of that, but I've been applying it to my face and to my neck. It's a clear fluid and it goes on easily and smoothly and my skin does not appear to be sticky or have any residue left on it after a moment or two.<br /><br />I feel like my skin is...radiating brightness, if that makes any sense? The last two days I've used this only, with no makeup and I had a few compliments on my skin on both days! Whatever is happening is noticeable enough for my co-workers and even one client to  comment on.<br /><br />The redness on my cheeks has faded to a barely noticeable healthy looking flush. I've had no breakouts and my skin looks bright and healthy. I don't know what else to say other than I love this. It's affordable too, which is just an extra bonus. I'm very happy with this serum!",383371,1519
4.0,1623945385178,"Smells Wonderful, Good Lotion For Dry Skin","It's nearly summer here in New England, which means lots of time swimming and sunning. As a result, quality lotions are needed. That is why I requested this one. This review is of: Spanature Aloe Vera Hand & Body Lotion Travel Size Selection Made In Korea 75 ml/2.53oz (4pcs)…<br /><br />As the product information states, this comes as four cute boxes of lotion, great for gift giving. Inside the boxes, all four tubes of lotion do have foil caps, so your safety was considered.<br /><br />The lotion itself smells light and airy to me, not heavy. It's also not very thick, and for that reason I do not like it as a hand lotion. I'm washing my hands all the time and I really need something thick to really moisturize and coat my hands. However, for a body that's been in the sun and/or water, this lotion is absolutely perfect and quite effective. It's a bit thin as I said, but it absorbs quickly and seems to last for at least 3-4 hours. (I am talking really dry skin here, so for you, it would probably last longer.)<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this Spanature Lotion. I think these would make for a nice small gift or stocking stuffer, or of course, a gift to yourself.",383371,211

By the time we were done, I was tired and felt dried out. What a perfect time to try this body wash!<br /><br />It smells so good and it felt refreshing on my skin. It creates a nice foamy lather, so it works perfectly with a loofah. It felt like my skin was hydrating instantly and have I mentioned the lovely cucumber scent?<br /><br />HASK body wash is a good value considering how large these bottles are, it’s creamy and lathers well and it smells wonderful. It checks all my boxes!",383371,429

Never having heard of spray wax before and loving the hold that it gave my hair, when I saw this available for request on Vine, I asked for it. This review is of: Got2B Glued 2in1 Spray Wax, translucent, 8 Ounce.<br /><br />Being that this is an entirely new product for me, it took me a few tries to get just the right amount to hold my hair back from frizzing and flying away, but I did find it. I like this better than hair spray because it doesn't make my hair crunchy while still keeping my style. I do sometimes have some flyaways near the end of the day, so I don't know if the hold fades or what exactly is happening, but 9 hours of hold is pretty good. I am considering buy more of this when I empty this bottle.",383371,132

This review is of: Waterproof Mascara 2 Pcs Silicone Brush Head 4D Natural and Long Lasting Lash Blast Volume Mascara.<br /><br />I love this stuff. I can't deal with the whole false lashes thing, I don't do well with glues, and the magnetic ones don't seem to stay on well. When I tried this mascara I was hoping for fuller looking lashes and that's what I got! I do two coats and that does the trick for me. The brush is short so it's easier for me to apply as I seem to have more control, It's also a dense wand which seems to lift up and thicken my lashes without that super chunky look.(However, if the mood strikes for super chunky look, I'm sure I could achieve that with another coat of this mascara.)<br /><br />I've gotten to try a few bougie mascaras from Vine, some with high price tags, but none of them has worked as well as this one. Also, for this price? This mascara is a deal!",383371,12266
4.0,1618235195055,"Good Kit, But No Bottle and You Will Need Acetone","Since I recently requested and started using a Gel Polish kit, I found myself in need of some gel polish remover tools, so I requested this product from Vine. This review is for: Nail Polish Gel Remover Tools Kit for Women with Nail Clip Caps, Nail File, Nail Remover Cotton Pads,Brush, 2-in-one Cuticle Scraper/Pusher.<br /><br />First things first, I was surprised to come here to write this review and discover that I received no dispenser bottle as listed and pictured in the product description. Since this kit does NOT come with the remover liquid,  you are going to have to buy some acetone. (In my state, you must be 21 to buy it.) Since this came with no bottle, I followed the directions on the acetone itself, and used a glass measuring cup in which to pour it. (This way if I didn't use it all, I could easily pour it back into the bottle. Note to self, buy another measuring cup!)<br /><br />With that out of the way, this kit worked as described. I used tweezers and soaked the little pads in acetone and then wrapped it around my nail and applied the clamp. I did this to all of my nails at once, because my husband was here to help me with the second hand. If you have no one to help you, then you're going to need to do each hand separately. It is impossible to do much with these clamps on your fingernails. Once the clamps are on, you need to wait at least 20 minutes before removing them, to soften up the polish.<br /><br />Once I removed the clamps I set to work scraping off the polish. It does NOT come right up like regular polish does, but if you've soaked them for 20 minutes, and you applied it in thin layers when you originally polished them, it's easy to scrape the rest of it off. Once you're done, your nails look pretty bad. It will be necessary to buff them out and then wash them and apply some moisturizing lotion because your nails and the tips of your fingers will be very, very dry.<br /><br />I have heard some real horror stories of people trying to get gel nails and gel nail polish off, but this kit made it much easier and alleviated my fears. Other than the missing dispenser bottle, I'm rather happy with this kit.",383371,11915
4.0,1617196730486,Big Pads!,"Having recently started wearing makeup again, I found myself in need of a really good makeup remover. That is why I requested KLAVUU Pure Pearlsation pH Balancing Quick Cleansing Pad 100ea - Powerful Makeup Mild Exfoliating Cleansing.<br /><br />What I like most about these pads is their size. They are really big, especially as compared to...almost every other makeup remover pads out there. I mean, they're really big. Also, there's a lot of fluid in this jar. With some pre-moistened pads that I've tried, I've found that they dry out, halfway through the container. What a ripoff, because they're not cheap! With these, there's so much fluid there's extra on the bottom. I have no doubt that the bottom pads will have just as much fluid in them as the top ones did.<br /><br />I've found that unlike with some micellar water removers, you will need to rinse your face afterwards. (I usually do anyway, but I thought I'd mention it just the same.) I've also found that, depending on how much makeup you're wearing, you may need to use both sides of the pads or even two pads. Again, it depends on how much work there is to be done!<br /><br />I've found no issues with my skin while using these daily for the past week or so. No break outs or redness is always a good thing. I also like the scent-even though it says unscented, I can smell a certain....freshness when I open the jar. It's not a strong scent, but it is rather pleasant and it doesn't linger once you've applied it. (As I said, I rinse, (or even cleanse) my face after application, so that may be why I no longer smell it.)<br /><br />The only drawback I see with this product is its price. I'm not sure I would pay that much for these. However, I will certainly use the rest of what I received through Vine because I do like them!",383371,13636
4.0,1613051054374,I'm A False Eyelash Newbie!,"When I saw these up for request on the Vine program, I decided to give them a shot. I recently started wearing makeup again, (and now have stopped, because...masks!), and since my eyes are all anyone sees all day, I thought these might look nice. This review is of: Magnetic eyelashes with eyeliner，Beevila False Eyelashes Upgraded 5D Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit, fake eyelashes 5 Pairs with Tweezers, Easy to Wear,No glue!.<br /><br />As I said above, I'm a newbie at these. I have had no other experience with them, so take my opinion with a grain of salt! I played around with these twice. The first time, I couldn't stand how they felt at the outer edges of my eyes. The liner was easy to put on, but the lashes themselves? Not so much. I was finally able to reposition them to where my eyes felt comfortable. They made a BIG difference in how my eyes looked-so much so that it surprised me.  The second time I tried them, things went a bit more smoothly and definitely faster. They looked great, but again I had to adjust them a little bit because my eye lid was getting irritated.<br /><br />Not gonna lie, the problems I had with these were most likely MY problems and not the fault of the lashes. Since I've not tried the glue on type before, I have nothing to compare these to. As I get more proficient with them, (I will keep trying because I love the look!), I'm hoping that the process will become even easier and I can make these a part of my daily routine.",383371,3686

I can't really reach it with a loofah, which is why I requested this brush. Man oh man, is this brush SOFT!  The long bamboo handle makes it possible to reach everywhere you need to. There is a rope? type material wrapped around the top to make it easier to grip. (My arthritic hands appreciated that.) There is also a loop to hang it to dry, but it does not come with any kind of hook. (I already had some, so yay me!)<br /><br />I have used this brush with a wonderful Pink Himalayan Salt scrub and it works beautifully. The only thing I wish for is a bit more stiffness to the brush, so that it could scratch my back itch as well as exfoliate.

3.0,1605111494917,Just Okay,"Since I've started wearing makeup again, I wanted to get some makeup remover wipes, most especially for removing waterproof mascara. When I saw these up for request, I clicked right away.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm not that happy with these. I do like the design of the package-the plastic cover that clicks closed. (Resealable ones I've used in the past don't stay resealed because the adhesive wears off over time.) Trying to get one of the wipes out was difficult, because it doesn't seem like the slit is begin enough to pull them out. Once I got the first one out, though, it did become easier.<br /><br />Most days, I'm only wearing eye makeup lately, because I'm always wearing a face mask at work and a lot of foundation rubs off on those. For waterproof mascara, these wipes do NOT remove it all, AND you have to wipe pretty darn hard to get anything off at all.<br /><br />Look, I'm a maturing woman, I don't need to be rubbing and rubbing and rubbing around the area of my eyes. No, these don't contain anything that irritated by eyes, but I feel like I'm rubbing my skin OFF-that's how much pressure I had to apply.<br /><br />These might work better at removing foundation, but since I'm not bothering with that right now, (because..face masks), I'm only reviewing these for how they remove waterproof mascara and that answer is just barely....okay.",383371,2288

Putting it on fresh out of the shower seems to keep my skin in lovely condition all day long. There is no scent to it, which kind of bums me out. I was expecting a lotion to be a little bit thicker, but since it's still very moisturizing, I deducted only one star for that.

After a while, it does not reseal and the wipes dry up. That is the reason I was interested in these.<br /><br />They work great! They come in a box, and each towelette is individually wrapped. If you travel a lot, or just want to keep one or two with you in your purse, you can do that and not have to worry about them drying up.<br /><br />All you do is remove it from the wrapper, dunk it quickly under running water and then squeeze. Immediately, the towelette suds up and all you have to do is wipe your makeup away, even waterproof mascara and eyeliner!<br /><br />These are excellent wipes and I'm very pleased!",383371,739

It's just so irritating!<br /><br />I requested this product in the hopes it would help me out and it has. I basically use my loofah to apply suds to the scrubby side, then it's just a matter of figuring out where to place your hands so that you reach your trouble areas. I like screaming hot showers, but I know they help to dry out my skin. I can combat that with lotion and loofahs, but it's hard to loofah the center part of your back, you know?<br /><br />The other side of this scrubber is for a massage type feel, but I wasn't digging that as much as the other side. I did wish that there was some way to make more suds on both sides, like a loofah does, but it works. It came with little hooks that you can stick on to your shower walls/tiles, from which you can hang your loofah, your scrubber and whatever else.

It's great for removing make-up, (which I rarely wear), and brow liners.<br /><br />Afterwards, even prior to applying serums and/or moisturizers, my face feels refreshed and vibrant. I feel like I'm getting a deeper clean than with my fingertips or washcloths or even make up removal wipes. I also feel like my skin glows a little bit more than it used to.

It has a built in flap that comes down to cover your eyes if you are used to sleeping with a sleep mask. I am, so I was interested in that feature. However, this will be a winter item for me, only if the room I'm sleeping in is cool enough. I get hot very easily and found this restricting and yes, hot! I prefer a lightweight sleep mask, so I felt a bit smothered by this, lol.<br /><br />It stretches but has to be broken in as it is quite tight in the first few uses and hard to get long hair into it.

If you want a more dramatic look, just add more.  There is no fragrance.  I love that!  I won't be using this all over my face, so I am not sure about the SPF.  If it matched better, it would be perfect.  Really gives you a suntanned glow.",383445,1680
5.0,1613858493631,Helps your skin absorb moisturizer.,"I love the combination of these two rollers.  The microneedle roller is great for rolling your face before applying moisturizer.  It helps your skin absorb it better.  I also use it on my eyebrows.  I have very sparse eyebrows.  I am applying hair growth serum on them.  I roll my eyebrows, apply the serum and then roll it again to help it get better absorbed.  It really seems to be helping!  I have fine hairs growing back in.  I also like the derma roller.  I put it in the refrigerator.  It feels so good to roll over your forehead and across your eyes.  Helps to relieve headaches too.  This is a nice duo to add to your daily facial routine.",383445,756
4.0,1613686272822,It is bright!,"I can't say anything bad about the light this mirror provides.  It has three light levels.  I usually just use the same one.  The daylight one can be a little too much.  You can definitely see every flaw in your face!  I like that you can use this with batteries or USB charged.  I have so many other things plugged into my outlets.  This is just one less.  There are two fold out mirrors - one on top on the left side and one on the bottom on the right side.  They have different levels of magnification.  Those would be a little better if they were a little larger.  The middle mirror is the perfect size though.  This stands up on a base.  I just wish the mirror tilted back a bit farther.  It's kind of difficult to do my eyebrows without lowering my head down.  I may make a stand for it to lift it up about 2 -3"".  But it's a nice light and magnification.",383445,1545
5.0,1611265878017,One of the most natural looking wigs I've seen.,"This wig is beautiful!  It does not look like a wig.  The roots are dark and the rest is blonde.  The crown is very layered and you can't see any part.  There are not fake wig areas that show.  It's got wig combs in the front and the back.  There's lots of volume on the top.  It's a short tapered cut around the ears and back of the neck.  It's very easy to style.  I just fluffed it up with a comb.  I have medium brown hair.  This is a lot lighter than my natural color.  So, I can't pass it off as my own hair.  But other than that I would totally be able to fool people.  I loved the cut so much I decided to cut my hair the same way on the crown.  It gives me so much more volume.  You really can't do wrong with this wig.  It's excellent quality at a very low price.  I wish I could get it in medium brown.",383445,4071
5.0,1610556749402,Love these!,"You get two different size rollers in this set.  One is a facial roller with different size ends.  One end is 1 1/2"" and the other is 1"".  The larger one is great for all over your face - forehead, cheeks and neck. The smaller end is good for around the eyes and chin area.  Put this in the refrigerator and it's heaven to use!  Feels wonderful.  And at the same time it's helping to firm your face and neck.  The other box comes with dermarollers.  Two different sizes - one has a 1 1/2"" head and the other is a 3/4"" head.  I use the bigger one all over my face and then apply moisturizer.  It really helps it to absorb better.  The smaller one I use gently around my eyes.  But I mostly use it on my eyebrows with growth serum.  I roll the area first, apply the serum and roll again.  It helps to open up the hair follicles and allow the serum to absorb better. It's slightly painful and leaves your face red.  But it clears up in about an hour for me.  The handles are comfortable to hold while using.  They come in nice clear plastic cases.",383445,28389

It has foam inserts for your makeup brushes and eyeliners, lipstick or concealer tubes and a wavy type insert for laying your brushes flat as you use them.  The mirror has slots to make it stand up or you can hold it in your hand to use.  It's 6 1/4"" x 7"".  It is not magnifying.  The bottom has tiny foam pads to keep it from moving around.

The nape comb ends up about halfway down the back of my head, the cap is too small. SUCH A BUMMER. I’d be slaying in this beauty. I wish it fit but I could feel it slipping when I tried it on.

A little amount smooths on nicely, making my face feel instantly moisturized without feeling greasy or heavy. It definitely feels like it has more youthful plumpness to it (I’m 37). It absorbs pretty fast, within about 10 min I can no longer feel it on my face. Since using it I haven’t felt any tightness in my skin. It has a nice clean soap like fresh scent to it.

2.0,1611541981805,Bad quality- short hair except for the back,"So disappointed in this unit and I feel like it’s a waste of real human hair. I had to put a lot of work into it to make it look halfway decent. As it came the curls are super tight and when worn looks like some 80s Gerry curl type thing. Not a good look. Even with the tight curls you could tell how short it was on the sides compared to the back. So I took my flat iron out and straightened it out at 350 degrees. As you can see it wouldn’t go completely straight, but I didn’t want to use a higher heat and damage the hair. I’m ok with it being wavy, but as I straightened it all the tiny broken  filler hairs on top of the unit became extremely obvious. Not sure what they were thinking when they made this. It’s clear to achieve the “16 inch” length they only added long hair at the back bottom of the unit, leaving the sides short. Now the whole reason I wear wigs is because I chemically damaged my hair, and the sides are shorter than my back, JUST LIKE THIS WIG! Ugh. While it looked better wavy, it’s still a hot mess. The hairline part and cap fit funny. Like the hairline goes past the ears. The side combs are near the nape comb. The top part of the lace doesn’t lay flat to the head, I’d have to glue it down. The only way I can make this hair look decent is if I wear a head scarf with it, to pull back and hide the short sides. The hair itself isn’t even all that great. It’s a mess on top and feels dry. The only reason why I’m giving it two stars is because I can make it look cute with the scarf. If I would have paid money for this I would have returned it immediately.",383503,1544

I’ve been using this one for about a week now, in replacement of my morning moisturizer. I really like it! Two small pumps gives me enough product for a liberal application. The product absorbs well. No irritation. I have combo skin and this does a great job at moisturizing my dry areas. It doesn’t sit on my skin so I can go to work and wear my mask without irritation.

It has a nice light scent that I appreciate (I am sensitive to scents) and it has a light brown color to it which for me is perfect for my skin tone because it blends in with the color of my skin well so my kids and husband don't act like they've seen a ghost every time I use it lol. I rinsed it off just before it was completely dry and it rinsed off easily and thoroughly. After rinsing it off my skin is left so soft, smooth and clean feeling! It also doesn't dry out my skin at all which for me is great since my skin can dry out pretty easily especially with clay masks.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this clay mask!",383519,430
5.0,1612635314069,What a treat for my dry itchy eyes!,"I LOVE this heated eye mask! About a year ago I fell in love with a heated mask that you have to microwave, I loved how it felt but I ended up not using it often because the timing of heating it up in the microwave never quite worked out for me. Either I would heat it up before I headed upstairs and then by the time I got into bed it would be cold, or I would get ready for bed and then be too lazy to go back downstairs to get it and heat it up. This USB plug in mask solves the problem entirely! Now I can get ready for bed and then use this once I'm in bed to help me relax and fall asleep. I find myself using it almost every night because of how convenient it is.<br /><br />It heats up very quickly and has a great range of 3 temperatures. It also has 3 options for the timer which is very convenient/a great safety feature for me since sometimes it relaxes me to sleep. Low and medium is where I keep it, medium is almost too warm for me so I haven't even tried the highest setting honestly. One side definitely heats up more than the other so keep that in mind when using it. It is very soft and fits perfectly over my eyes. It's small enough that with the strap holding it tight it presses in perfectly onto my eyes.<br /><br />My only suggestion would be to make it a little less dense, while the material is very soft the mask itself is very full and kind of hard because it is so full. My microwave version is larger so it covers more than just my eyes and is less dense so it has a more giving feel to it which I do prefer a bit. A small style change could definitely make this mask my sould mate. Don't get me wrong, I still love it and highly recommend  it though!",383519,1543
4.0,1611873019661,Absorb fulling without tacky feeling,"I really like these masks, the serum absorbed fully into my skin very quickly without leaving any kind of tacky residue behind like I have experienced with so many other sheet masks. It moisturized my skin great and all the tiny fine lines from dryness were gone. There was also a lot of extra serum in the packet so I'm able to use the extra serum 3 to 4 times in the morning and at night which is a nice perk. The only draw back I noticed is that the extreme moisture didn't last as long as some of my favorite sheet masks do.",383519,310
1.0,1609283590616,Didn't see any results,"I used these for 20 minutes and saw absolutely no change to the skin around my eyes. The weather is very dry where I live right now so I get extra fine lines from the dryness that will easily disappear with a good moisturizing mask or eye patch and these patches did not get the job done. I have other eye patches that are much cheaper that work great (I wont even say work better since these didnt work at all).<br /><br />At any price, but especially at the currently listed $50, these are a hard pass for me.",383519,77
5.0,1600281515124,The gentle warming is SO relaxing,"I love the gentle warming effect of this mask! it feels great on and the warming seemed to reactivate for me so after rinsing it off my skin felt warm for a little while afterwards, which I loved! This mask left my skin feeling nicely moisturized and not tight which I prefer. I didn't need a lot for application and it dried nicely then came rinsed off as expected for a clay mask. It is easier to wash off in the shower or with a washcloth at the sink.",383519,1004

2.0,1599085086892,"Works for short hair, useless for longer hair","This Brush works well for my husband and son who both have super short hair (less than an inch long) but I got this brush for myself and it doesn't work for me at all. I got the brush to use when I straighten my hair so I could keep my hair healthy and brush the oils from my scalp down to the ends of my long hair. I have thick long hair, to my mid/low back, and this brush did not have enough stiffness to get through my hair to my scalp or even to get out any tangles, it just bends to the side. This brush is completely useless to me.<br /><br />The brush cleaner included with this brush works very well and was a great bonus. The comb with pointed tip is also sturdy and works well.<br /><br />Overall, I can only recommend this brush for people with very short hair that is less than an inch long.",383519,3353

They are fairly easy to get out of the packaging the mask does take some manuvering when it comes to opening it up. The eye holes could be just a little larger as I have big eyes. Other than that the mask sits nicely on the face it doesn't move around and it has a cooling sensation to it when applied. Overall I love these masks for a good pampering treatment when you just want to relax.,450194,310
4.0,1622698447266,Something I will have to continue to work with,First impressions of these magnetic eyelashes is that I def like the packaging i feel like its a nice way of storing everything that comes with the kit making it easy to have everything you need to apply the lashes right at your hands. I love the look and style of the lashes I think they are like a soft glam look and not too overly dramatic. The lash band is lined with magnetic pieces which you can see if looked at closely not while wearing but prior to application. The magnetic eyeliner applicator is also something I truly like as it is a felt tip which isn't bendy or floppy. Its not so stiff you can't work with it but its not flimsy as in it would be hard to apply or even get a nice sharp wing with it. The one issue I do have with the magnetic eyeliner is it almost comes across as a glue adhesive and when I say that I don't mean like with glue you can reapply as much as you need to even if you mess up with this formula one coat and you can't go back over it because it will not only pick up pieces of the other product and it also doesn't layer well. However what I do mean is that if you apply the lashes and say you its not sticking to your inner corner and you have to remove some if not alot of the adhesive is def coming with it dry or not. Outside of the above mentioned problem I just had issues with it sticking to my inner corner but the lashes look absolutely beautiful on and I def love the style that's for sure. Its one of those things where I am not used to magnetic lashes and this is my first time trying them so its something I'm going to have to get used to. I will also say the adhesive was pretty easy to remove in which I used something similar to a makeup eraser. The only issues I had were the bits that stuck im my own lashes that I had to physically remove with my hands.,450194,2300
3.0,1615618139844,Was intimidated by the process,I got this for myself since I struggle alot with all over pain in my body everyday since having my son but honestly I got a little intimidated by it after reading the instructions and it talking about purging your inpurities from your body. To some that may seem like a nice trip to the spa but for me I am highly cautious about things so I havent yet decided if I am going to use this or not. This comes packaged as most bath salts that I buy and they look just like bath salts when you open the package. However your suppose to use the entire 10 oz bag in one bath and sit for 20-30 mins I usually will use about a cup at most of Dr Teals bath salts so that to me seemed excessive followed by a sweat and rest afterwards which no female is crazy about sweat let alone in your own bed. So overall I think the concept is there but for me it put me on the fence and I will update if I or my husband maybe tries this but this taught me to look into something a little more before clicking get just for the purpose of pain relief.,450194,45359
4.0,1614409333963,"Cute kit,love the variety but fell in love with the one in the tube","First impressions I have to start with the packaging which I think was cute in a way. I have not ever heard of this brand or used it before now and since getting it have heard great things about certain products from this little kit. I will say from this kit my favorite is the primer in the squeeze tube that I add in with a matte primer and it does a great job at minimizing pores which is something I have a problem with on my nose,cheeks and chin and this does a great job at covering up those problem areas and looks great under makeup. I wasnt the biggest fan of the 2 other primers and havent really played with them a whole lot not in comparison to the one in the squeeze tube. Overall this would be the one I would repurchase and reuse time and time again.",450194,816
2.0,1611904481440,Does work but you have to be a patient person as this could take weeks to fully happen,Alright so I got this for me and my husband to try on his vacation which we did this on 9/10/21 it is now 1/29/21. I will start from the beginning. This was the first time ever doing anything like this for me and my husband so we werent sure what to expect with the process. When you take these out I will caution you to watch how much you cute the parts that go on your feet as I cut my husband's too wide and some of the liquid that is inside did come out. So you know there is liquid inside each of the bags that go on your feet that feels weird on your feet and cold. We left on for the recommended time of an hour the process is explained in detail which I will give them kuddos for. Now after we let them stay on for an hour we then showered them off I placed lotion on my feet the first night again not sure what to expect and I didnt want this to dry my feet out too much as to where my husband didnt have a preference so he did not lotion his feet. He started seeing the peeling first. Now keep in mind I do get pedis and my last one was probably in March of 2020 and since then I have used a foot file and soak during that time. My peeling did not start until halfway thru the week so I thought that was important to mention. He does not get his feet done and never has. His peeling lasted about a week. We are about what a week and half in of peeling 2 weeks in since I did the foot mask my feet still look aweful and they are still peeling. I have started to apply lotion to the feet to see if this will help the process and only have seen minimal improvement. Now keep in mind I am an impatient person. Also to mention a burning and tingling sensation is expected its what we felt during the process once we were done. Overall I think I will stick to my parifan drips and doing my feet the way I have been doing I will say that it did wear down a few calluses I had on my feet its just the process I am not patient enough for I dont mind wearing socks too much but this is more of being forced to wear socks so I dont shed everywhere and even then I still find dead skin somewhere. This process was horrible to me and I think there are better ways to get these results. My husband didnt too much mind the process and his feet were in worse conditon than mind and his process didnt take as long and for me that was even more frustrating. This would not be something I would recommend unless you are a patient person and dont mind waiting like this for results I just want to let my feet breath again.<br /><br />Update: 2/2 My foot is still peeling this is def something I will not be doing again for me its about the fact that this is suppose to be something that takes time but really this amount of time for me is ridiculous and I can get the results its providing by using a foot file after soaking is that process more difficult yes but I get results within an hour not almost a month. My feet look nasty and dry even lotion isn't helping.,450194,2333
5.0,1607584166976,"Great quality, works great for thick,long,curly hair, and works wonders",This is my second set of these brushes I originally got these for my middle daughter and we keep one in her bathroom and one in the kitchen for the times I put a hair mask in her hair and use these combs to get the tangles out and the product into each part of her hair up to her root. So when my oldest seen these and I used them in her hair she was like ok I want one now too and then I also thought these would be great for my son who also has tons of hair and curly hair at that. So now everyone has one and I think I may sadly be getting another set for my daughters when there at their dads house too. They love these brushes and I have to attest using these to comb thru their hair makes things a world easier and less of a hassle I do wish they had a grip on the handle for wet hands but really outside of that I dont have any complaints. These come in packs of 2 and even if you dont have kids using one in a purse and keeping one home is enough reasons to get these especially if you have thick hair these are amazing. My kids are mixed and range from hair length to neck length to butt length and I will tell you these are amazing at handling getting thru those thick tangles. The back has a piece that allows you to have the comb itself at different firmness I like the top one personally it is the firmest level. Overall if I am not a fan I dont know who is but I know for sure I have 4 and I will have 6 by the end of the year.,450194,11346
4.0,1606544347572,"Easy to use,works great and has a sensor inside so you dont have to push buttons","I am totally new to the idea and concept when it comes to doing gel nails at home myself. This was the first time I have owed and used a UV lamp by myself to cure my nails. I def like the initial unpackaging the machine itself looks professional and well made. It plugs into the wall the cord could be a tad longer but it was workable. I didnt read over the instructions since I have seen this machine be used both in the nail salon on a number of ocassions not regularly but I am a quick study. I have also seen ppl I watch on youtube use machines like this as well so I was familar with the concept of what your suppose to do. Now I did pair this with gel polish that I had never used before so my review may not be the best since I am unfamilar with both the product and the products used but it is coming from a first time user as I am sure there are others out there like myself. So in use I will say the machine does get warm not hot but warm depending on how long your using it. The light is very bright and def caught me off guard. The buttons are extremely easy to use but I love that the machine also has a sensor so you dont have to push the button if you dont need to which I thought was a nice touch. The only downside of that is if you lift your palm up then it goes off so its extremely important to pay attention to the numbers you were on for curing sake. I will say thou using this machine at first with the base coat that I was using it came out tacky so my first thought is great I was excited about using this and it doesnt all the way work but once I thought to just go ahead and apply the first layer of polish, cure, and then do the top coat everything was fine. So overall this works great and I look forward to using again in the future as I begin experimenting with both gel polish and poly gel (I think its called). As stated I am a quick study and I dont think I did too bad of a job my first time around.",450194,1549
4.0,1599023721470,Thick and minty,• Light mint scent<br />• Thick formula but makes for great moisturizing<br />• A little difficult to get out the bottle<br /><br />Overall this was chosen for my husband who is on a journey of finding things he likes for his beard maintenance. He has enjoyed this product in reference to how well it pairs with the shampoo. It leaves his beard feeling nice and soft and in combination with the shampoo really clean. He all around was happy with this product.,450194,23299
5.0,1599023493000,Pretty decent shampoo,• Lathers really well<br />• Has a light mint smell<br />• Leaves your beard feeling nice and clean afterwards<br /><br />Got for my husband as he is moving into grooming and managing his growing beard. He has told me that he really likes the way this shampoo cleans his beard and the fact that it lathers well without having to apply much product which for me is a win cuz that means less money spent in the long run. Overall he has def enjoyed using this product and we're still gauging if this is something we would repurchase but if we did it would def be because it's long lasting.,450194,23298
3.0,1597716806079,Takes time and patience,"I choose these because I've seen these before product curls without the heat and it was as simple as applying them and letting your hair air dry. Well let me tell you it takes alot of practice and patience and knowing what your doing. Is it simple enough to understand, yes. However the sectioning hair, getting tangled, knotted or stuck was alot of the problems I ran into. If my husband had not been home I think I might have been in some real trouble. I'm not mild tempered and almost was pulling my hair out trying to get it unstuck at some points. I will say there were times when I got a rhythm going and I was getting my hair to go thru effortlessly but in the end once I was done I found pieces that weren't even in there and it was uncomfortable to wear unless maybe I was up doing stuff around the house. In the end I took it down and I'd had enough of the torture these provided. Overall would I suggest these yes to someone a little more familiar with there head and maybe to do in my daughter's hair but personally unless it's a day I'm bored and nothing else to do I may give it a go again. I will say my husband did see some curls in my hair when I ended up taking them out they didn't stay that way but he said he could see results and that was just in a matter of getting them all in. There may be potential there just not patience in my book.",450194,9812

This product works and is gentle, just be sure to follow the directions and don't overuse it.<br /><br />My teeth are pretty white, but I'd noticed in the last year they were looking less bright. I drink coffee and coke, and I'm 45. This product appealed to me because it's very easy to use.<br /><br />The pen has a clicker on the end to release the product and you apply it to the front of your teeth. I used it twice a day for the first three days and after achieving the results I wanted, I have been using at night every other day.<br /><br />This product contains hydrogen peroxide for whitening, xylitol for oral health, and potassium nitrate to reduce sensitivity. When you apply the gel, you let it dry for 30 seconds, and they you can't drink or eat for 30 minutes. I would use this before bed, before working out, or after dinner while watching TV.<br /><br />By the third application I could tell a big difference in the whiteness of my teeth.

The size is perfect for travel or to keep in your purse. Smaller than a travel tissue pack. The cloths are also small, but just large enough to wipe your face or your hands. Also the wipes are not too strong or drying, they are gentle on the skin, and safe to flush down the toilet.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend these for anyone who needs a compact cleansing wipe to keep with them. But for big cleanups or wipes for kids, these would be too small.",450208,2239

They also say it has no artificial colors, synthetic oils, or harmful chemicals. This manufacturer is based in Ontario, Canada and you can find similar products at the Way of Will Amazon store, or the Way of Will website.<br /><br />I took off one star for the price, which I thought was high.

I don't usually pay too much attention to my lips, but they do peel a lot and it drives me crazy sometimes. This lip scrub is easy to use and gets rid of all the peeling skin and leaves my lips looking even colored, plump and smooth.<br /><br />You only need the smallest amount. You just dab some on your index finger, then apply it and let it sit for about a minute. You need to let the product sit so the ingredients can penetrate and soften your lips. After a minute, wipe the scrub off with a tissue and maybe a little water. I've found a tissue works best for me. Top off with some chapstick or jelly and enjoy how amazing your lips look.<br /><br />I love this product and would absolutely recommend. Great to own or give as a gift.

It is very pigmented, I only swatched it once and it was full coverage. Some of the polishes in this set are very unique like the ones with fur or hair on them, I’ve never seen polishes like that before. They apply smoothly and are a nice good thick consistency. Do not let the size of the bottle fool you, these gel polishes may be packaged small but they pack a good punch. I definitely recommend this to beginners or people who like adding unique shades to their collections.",450209,1541
5.0,1611729093231,Small Rainbow,"These Rosegin gel polishes are small, around the same size as the modelones. There is a good variety of colors and some have glitter. I like this set because you get almost all the colors in a rainbow without breaking the bank and an added bonus, depending on how you look at it, is that they are small so you’re more likely to use it all instead of the polish just sitting there. The one thing for me was that the blue glitter polish was very sheer and I needed like 4 coats to build it up but the other colors worked great. I definitely like this little set.",450209,23011

I got this as a joke for my girls night since our work does not allow our nails to be done, I figured this kit would be perfect and it was. It is very sheer despite the colors in the bottles looking very pigmented. It also peels extremely easy so acetone is not needed to remove the polish which is great for little kids. Overall, quality wise it isn't the best, for an adult, for a child this is perfect. I recommend this kit for your kids, it's very cute and fun!",450209,842
4.0,1610432920130,Pretty metallic shimmery shadows,These eyeshadow sticks are very smooth and creamy. You have to slide it on a couple of times to get good pigmentation payoff however once you use the brush to blend it out the color slowly fades and leaves you with a sheer looking shadow. You will need to reapply a couple of times to have good coverage. Overall the colors and finish are cute however the execution could use some work. I recommend this if you want eyeshadow that is not too in your face or for tweens.,450209,977
5.0,1609743175180,Variety of stamp plates,"These stamp plates are very cute, I like how there is a variety and a theme to each one. This is the perfect set to have for different occasions/holidays.

I love how they have attachers to attach to bags and such that have fruits and match their overall color. It's very cute definitely great if you have multiple kids as each can get their own color/fruit and they will not fight over which is who's. I like these to leave around so I always have access to hand sanitizer.,450209,35533

This is definitely something worth investing in. I got this so I can take it on the go to retouch my makeup or do it if I need to have it done last min.

These do change colors but only with hot water and for a few seconds, after they go back to normal which i thought wasn't very fun. They are nice colors however, i just don't know if you get a good amount of products as the bottles are dark and feel almost empty.

But I have been hearing a lot about oud wood oil and its scent.  WOW I would describe it as soft and warm.  Sort of a nice leather jacket that has been around a little pipe smoke.  Its a scent that you notice only when near someone.  Its not a scent that broadcasts itself to a whole room like a teenager cologne.<br /><br />Looks like they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.<br />So trust me, buy one of the oud products they have available, maybe just the $15 bottle.  If you arent keen on it then you just contact the seller.<br />I doubt that will happen though.  As soon as you smell it you will probably go ahead and buy the larger bottle, or maybe by then the cologne will be out.<br />Thats what happened to me.  As soon as I bought the beard balm I quickly grabbed the beard oils.  I wont be putting it in my beard but I have been mixing it into unscented hand lotion and putting it all over.<br />I wish I had adequate words to describe the scent.",450212,1527

5.0,1564355620995,Strong little device.  I think this might be good for diabetics too.,It is a great little grinder.  And runs by USB power so its very low wattage.<br />My mother is diabetic and has to be very careful about the shape of her toenails.  Its very important to avoid infection.  Regular clippers are hard to position correctly sometimes.  And there is a risk of 'over cutting' the nail and causing issues that way.<br />With these you are shaping the nail slowly so you can control it a whole lot better.  Less chances of clipper accidents.<br />**I'm not a doctor nor do I play one on TV.  Its just my opinion that these are a good choice for diabetics.<br />I was given these as a vine promotion for the review.  But that aside I like it and see it as a durable useful tool.  Mostly because I end up being the one that has to take care of the toenail business And these make it easier to take care of.,450212,1587
5.0,1655511353067,Purse essential,This is a must have for your purse in the summer months. Really takes away the shine. It's a compact with a mirror and it will last a long time.

4.0,1636512147473,Beautiful natural color,In the colder weather my lips get really pale but most lipsticks I try don't look natural enough for daily wear. This one is different. It's matte so it looks more natural and the color is gorgeous. It lasted about 4 hours before needing to reapply so that would be my only complaint but overall it's great.,450214,3570
3.0,1627259534190,Easy to use,So I really like the concept of this and it's super quick and easy to use in my daughter's hair but it's definitely better for adults. It's rather large and ended up falling out of my daughter's hair after a few hours.

4.0,1595857598728,Very soothing,This mask looks pretty terrifying when on but it does a fantastic job of soothing the skin.

It did leave my skin a bit oily looking but I used an oil paper to pull that out and my skin looked great after that.,450214,319
3.0,1592934227935,They are ok,I only got a 1 pack so it may take a lot longer to see any results. I have used gold under eye masks before and this one wasn't as good. I like to put them in the refrigerator for a nice cooling effect when I wake up in morning and usually the cool feeling lasts 10 mins but with these after a minute it wasn't cool anymore. My eyes didnt look any brighter underneath after wearing for 20 mins. They do feel more moisturized so I gave 3 stars because of that.,450214,2329
4.0,1592107795413,Works,It is a soft material headband and it is comfortable to wear. You do need to make sure the headband is flat against your head or your mask elastic will keep popping off the buttons though. It does give your ears a break if you have to wear a mask all day.

4.0,1579146782419,Works,Pros: I had noticeably firmer skin after one use. It was cold and relaxing.<br /><br />Cons: The instructions on how to use are in Chinese. It's is a little difficult to position as the mask itself feels very much like slimy loose skin. My face turned red - but I do have very sensitive skin.<br /><br />Overall I was happy with the tighter looking skin.

I like to use this in the morning, as it's just the right amount of moisture to carry me through the day.<br /><br />This is unscented and doesn't irritate my skin at all. It's a little runny, so the hole it comes out of is a tad big and sometimes dispenses too much all at once, but now that I know that, it's not too hard to control.<br /><br />And not that it matters to some, but I think the packaging design is quite pretty.",450218,2222

I didn't see any visible results (like de-puffing) but they felt nice.<br /><br />The lip mask was unique! I didn't know lip masks existed. I panicked at first, feeling like I couldn't breathe, which is totally stupid, because I sit with my mouth closed all the time.  I guess the thought of not breathing through my mouth for 20 minutes sent me into a panic. ha! It didn't feel like it did much to soften my lips, however, so not sure I'd put myself through that panic again (just teasing).<br /><br />This is a cute set and would be a cute addition to a gift.",450218,12672
2.0,1619807860874,Greasy Residue and Scent is Odd,"Let me start by saying that I love body scrubs that leave my skin softened rather than feeling like it's been scrubbed to death and stripped of all moisture. My favorite has been Kiehl's Creme de Corps Soy Milk & Honey Body Polish, and I haven't really found anything that I like as much as that. I wanted to try this because I like the brand C'est Moi, and also because this product comes in a handy jar, which makes it so easy to scoop out and apply to skin.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this product didn't live up to my expectations. It does have excellent exfoliators and feels like a good scrub for the skin all over my body, but the residue it leaves on my skin is icky. It's just too much - kind of feels like a coating of Crisco on my skin.<br /><br />Also, the scent is odd. It doesn't smell like vanilla. It smells like... well, it's hard to explain. It's just off, and I had an aversion to it.",450218,965

They dissolve easily and make the water feel so soft and lovely. I feel wonderful after bathing in these salts.<br /><br />The package was popped open when it arrived, but I taped it up and it's held fine. Sometimes that happens with heavy bags being thrown in flimsy boxes.<br /><br />The bag says to use 3 cups, but I usually do about 2, because I prefer having expensive magnesium chloride flakes last a little longer.

They go on in a narrower line, of course, but then you can take your finger, or a brush, and spread it out to look more like an eyeshadow rather than a pencil. It's a little harder to apply under the eyes when you have a pencil design like this, but it's doable. (It is a powder, though, so it doesn't stay very well underneath the eyes.)<br /><br />Overall, pretty colors, interesting pencil design, and a good product that I can recommend.",450218,724

4.0,1640868320440,Excellent cream but too scented,"I really hate it when companies ruin an otherwise excellent product by a very correctable and stupid mistake. I don't want to go so far as to say that this cream has been ruined, but it is far too scented for my liking, and probably most people's tastes. The cream itself is very nice and thick, and a little goes a very long way. It is very expensive, there is no doubt about that, however when considering how much use I was able to get out of it by simply a dab with the tip of my finger being enough to spread across my whole face, I would say that this cream will last you a very long time. I have an oily T zone, as well as dry spots around my chin, and found that it did a reasonably good job of not exacerbating my oily areas, but most importantly an excellent result in hydrating my dry spots. I think I would recommend this cream to those people who have a drier skin type, as it does do a very nice job of moisturizing with its thicker consistency. The downfall of this cream is how scented it actually is. It's not that it is unpleasant, it's that it is strong and lingers for a very long time. I used it as a night cream, so by the morning it had dissipated some, but I could even still smell it then. That might be something that some people like as a feature, but for myself personally I actually prefer unscented creams. It is rare to find a cream that is so powerfully scented, that it can last all night long. Even my pillow had begun to absorb the scent. So I felt like I was unable to get away from it, even if I didn't apply the cream. I think if they dial back the scent a lot, or simply get rid of it altogether, you'll have a fantastic cream on your hands here. All in all, performance wise it works really well at moisturizing and hydrating, but they have to tone down the scent or get rid of it for this to be a top notch cream. That may be a subjective opinion, but something tells me I wouldn't be alone in thinking that.",450249,72
4.0,1630679340150,Great formula,"I think you have to know how to use this foundation for it to work. I have a strict skin care routine and since I’ve started to really pay attention to my skin most  foundations I use look great. This is a medium coverage foundation. And you probably would need two coats to cover any dark spots and even out your skin tone. I exfoliate my face three times a week and I feel the foundation sits better on my skin when I do. The formula is light. The primer is supposed to smooth out your skin. So I mainly use it on my T zone where I have larger pores. And I apply a super glowy and dewy primer on the rest of my face. I like to apply some foundation with my finger and spread it around on my face and then I go with one of the sponges. The sponges feel a little dense. Make sure you wet them before blending the foundation. These sponges work better damp. They don’t absorb the foundation too much, which is great. The foundation blends beautifully and gives me enough coverage to cover my imperfections. I do like to set it with powder as well and it usually works great under powder. I’d like to set it because I feel like it lasts all day long then when I don’t. Make sure you hydrate your skin very well before applying this foundation. I love how it looks on my skin.",450249,294

And it mixes well with the rest of my products. I don’t get any irritation when mixing it retinol either. I like to apply directly on my face. And I think my favorite method is to mix it in with my foundation. I found that my foundation looks a bit cakey and this face oil, really gives me a nice dowy finish. Sometimes I like apply it  before bedtime but I do find that it sticks a tad to my pillowcase but every product usually does. So the most important for me is that it doesn’t break out.",450249,517
5.0,1629893512854,Really great,"I live down South, in South Florida, and I'm no stranger to a nice coconut scent. This body wash smells so nice. The other thing about that, is that the scent actually hangs around for a while after you exit the shower. It leaves you smelling nice and tropical. From an aromatherapy perspective, it makes the shower experience really lovely. Couple of pumps on the old loofah, and it lathers up extremely well for full body coverage. I can't stand body washes that require half the bottle to maintain a good lather. This one is not one of those. It cleans very nicely, and does a bang up job of leaving me feeling nicely hydrated as well. So the natural moisture from my skin is not stripped away, and I'm left feeling clean and smelling wonderful. I actually lost it to my wife, who gave it a try and insisted that it was no longer mine, and that I was not allowed to touch it. Because I consider myself a gentleman, I gave in to her demands, and sadly gave her all of the wonderful shower experiences going forward from that point on.

5.0,1629571947128,Excellent hydrator,"I have to say, that my experience with Korean skin care products is really fantastic. I do have combination type skin with an oilier T zone, and drier areas that surround my chin. As such, I do find it difficult to find products that walk that fine line between exacerbating the oiliness and solving the dryness, or tamping down the oiliness and exacerbating the dryness. Hydrating products generally don't do too well for my T zone, but I need them for my dryer spots that surround my chin. This recovery cream works extremely well at hydrating the skin, and is a nice texture and consistency that saturates very well and doesn't leave the skin feeling greasy. That is key for me, because I was able to use it on all of my face, and not worry about exacerbating either issue that I have. I found that the finish that it left on my oilier t zone, was surprisingly matte, and not glossy at all. As for the dry areas around my chin, this cream did wonders. At first I thought to use it as a spot treatment cream for myself, using it only on my chin to hydrate the dry skin that I have there, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that I could use it on both my oily skin, and my dry skin. A little of this cream certainly goes a long way, as I only needed about a dime to a nickel sized amount, in order to cover my entire face. The flaking skin issues that I often have on my chin, were completely alleviated. In my experience, this is another hit for Korea's skin care industry. I found the packaging to be rather subdued, but certainly adequate enough considering the price point. That for me is another nice thing, as I found it to be fairly reasonably priced. All in all, my experience with it was tremendous, and so I would recommend it.",450249,710
4.0,1629462799832,pretty decent,"This vitamin C and lemon peel brightening cleanser does a great job of cleaning the skin very effectively.  Just to give you an idea, I have an oilier type T-Zone as well as dryer areas on my chin to give me a bit of a combination type skin. While I appreciate it how well this cleanser cleansed, I did find it very drying. I was in absolute need of a moisturizer, and serum after using it. I guess that wasn't that bad, considering that I always use serums and moisturizers anyways.  I certainly wouldn't be able to use this cleanser on its own, as a face wash and go type product. It really needs to be followed up with other skin care products. That being said it does cleanse extremely well, and has a very pleasant scent to it. Surely if you're somebody who has oilier skin, I think you would appreciate how well this will alleviate you of that issue either at the end of the day, or before the day gets started. If however, you are somebody who has a dryer type skin, you might be over exacerbating that issue with this cleanser. All in all, I think it depends on your skin type as to whether this is the cleanser for you. For my combination type skin, I liked it very much on my oily areas, but less so of course on the dryer spots I have around my chin.",450249,393
3.0,1629331805390,It’s ok,"These were really hard to open. I just couldn’t get it right. I got the chance to try these for free thanks to the vine program. If I had paid for these I wouldn’t of been happy. I wasn’t really impressed with the product itself. I thought it wasn’t hydrating enough. And just for  seven days worth, i didn’t really see any improvements on my skin. It absorbs quickly and all but felt that my skin was really dry after half an hour. I think I was just expecting more that I ended up disappointed. I do have to say that it worked well with the rest of my products. I like to use retinol, glycolic acid and vitamin c. I didn’t get any burning sensation after applying this right after my retinol. I didn’t get any redness as well. I just would have wanted more hydration.",450249,1535
5.0,1629214068224,Great for everyday,"I live in sunny South Florida, so it's important that I do my best to try and protect my skin from the sun even with casual exposure. This is a very expensive and small quantity of sunscreen, but I think if you look at it for particular application it might be worth it. I used it entirely for a face sunscreen. It does extremely well to saturate into the skin and I didn't find it gave me a white cast at all, which is what I really appreciate about it. It can do very well as an everyday wearing type sunscreen that will give you protection from the sun, while at the same time moisturizing your skin. As a matter of fact, I found as a moisturizer it worked very well. I appreciate very much the sun protection SPF 50 that it has, because the sun where I live can certainly get very strong. I usually dislike sunscreens, because of the oily nature of them, but I found this one to be well balanced, and didn't leave me feeling greasy at all. I also found that it had a bit of a matte finish to it, so you didn't notice any sort of shining, especially for someone like me who tends to have an oilier t zone. In combination with that, I actually get dry areas on my chin, and this did very nicely to moisturize my dry areas while not causing any sort of exacerbation of oilier areas. All in all it's probably one of the best, if not the best sunscreen that I have ever used for my face. For everyday wear, and protection, I would certainly reach for this sunscreen without a doubt. I do recommend it.",450249,712
5.0,1625767684071,My skin feels so smooth,"I've been using this trio for over two weeks now. And already I see my skin even out. I have a lot of acne scars in this tree or really helped fade some of it away. My skin looks a lot clearer and healthy. I use this morning and night and I feel like my skin is hydrated for a long period of time. All the formulas blend nicely into the skin giving a nice healthy glow. I think if you wanna see improvement in your skin, you need to be consistent with your skincare routine, and adding something like this can really help restore and revive your dull skin. These are lightly scented which is something I really appreciate. It is a small travel size but a little bit of product goes a long way. My skin definitely looks plumper and tighter. I am really liking how my skin looks after starting using this kit.",450249,1538
3.0,1625693037559,pricey but very hydrating,"This is a nice hydrating moisturizer. I wouldn't say this is one of a kind product but it is better than your Walmart moisturizers. It blends nicely into the skin and does hydrate for a long period of time. I hate moisturizer that after half an hour of having it on your face feel like you haven't applied anything at all, it's so dry. But I do feel it's a little pricey. I mean, I won't tell my sister to go run and purchase it. It does work well with all of my skincare products but because this is a clean formula, I do find that after a while a tends to have an unpleasant scent. Overall, hydrating and non-greasy.",450249,1537
5.0,1624817281668,Very nice quality mask,"Of the choices available I chose to take the Aqua mask. I found it to be very nicely hydrating, and was full of plenty of serum on the mask itself. Application of the mask is pretty straightforward, you just align it with your face according to the pattern on the mask, and allow it to sit for 15 to 20 minutes. I always like to apply the mask right after my shower before bed. After I've washed my face in the shower, I will apply the mask before any of the rest of my nighttime skin care routine. When I would use the mask, I would skip the serum part of my nighttime routine. I found that applying serum after the mask is simply redundant an unnecessary. After removing the mask there was always plenty of extra serum that would sit atop my skin, so I would rub the rest of it in gently with my hands until it's saturated which didn't take very long as the serum I found saturated very nicely. The mask did provide a very nice amount of moisture to my otherwise dry skin. I tend to get a dry spot or two on my face from time to time, particularly around the chin area, and I found that after wearing the mask I would not suffer from that issue. It left my skin smooth and with a nice afterglow as well. All in all I was very satisfied with my experience, so I would recommend giving them a try. A nice added bonus is that they are very affordable.",450249,446
5.0,1624458284618,Impressive,"This was my first time trying a mask of this type. To be honest I didn't really know what to expect, but to make a Long story short I was very impressed. Applying this mask is a little different. You should leave your face nice and damp, and apply a very thin layer of this oxygen mask over the damp skin. The mask will begin to foam up, and you leave it applied for about 10 minutes or so. After which you simply rinse it off, and enjoy your nicely treated skin. I tend to have a little bit of a drier skin type on certain areas of my face, and so I would say that this mask did dry me out a little bit. Of course the mask isn't the final step, rather it's the first one so following it up with a good serum and moisturizer will alleviate any sort of dryness issues. What I did notice is that with prolonged use, I was seeing some pretty encouraging results with the diminishment of fine lines. I am in my 40s now, and the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines are beginning to become a reality. When I would use this mask, and then apply a nice retinol serum, and a good moisturizer overtop, I noticed that after several weeks I was seeing a pretty nice reversal of the aging process. I think it's a very high quality product, and isn't the first product that I've tried from this brand. In my experience Tonica makes excellent products, with simple packaging but are highly effective. All in all I was very pleased with my use of it, and would certainly recommend it to anyone willing to give it a try.",450249,1539
4.0,1621695361089,Very nice,"Sia is a brand that I've had the opportunity to use more than once. Generally I like their products quite a bit, and this serum actually works very nicely as well. It's a small bottle as most serum bottles are, but the really nice thing about this particular formula is that a little will certainly go a long way. You do not need to overuse any abundant amount of this particular product as it spreads extremely well, and saturates very nicely too. I find it has very nice hydrating properties, as it did a great job of moisturizing my skin and leaving it feeling soft. I do have an age spot or two on my face that have appeared over the last few years, and I was hoping that this serum would do a good job to lessen the appearance of those age spots. Unfortunately I would have to report that I haven't noticed any difference after using this for about a month now. The age spots in my opinion are pretty much just as prevalent as they were from the get go. That being said as a hydrator, this serum does an excellent job of moisturizing and softening the skin. The scent is nice too, with kind of citrusy tones. It doesn't last very long however. So if it turns out that the scent is something that you don't like, it dissipates rather quickly. I've used this serum as part of my night time routine before applying moisturizer, and I liked it very much. All in all my experience was very good, so I would recommend giving it a try if this is something you were thinking about.",450249,2221

5.0,1620847319031,Love it,"I tend to have very dry skin, especially when the weather doesn't help that situation like in the winter months. For myself personally, I have a couple of spots on my face, that tend to get drier than other areas. That results in dry patches of flaking skin. Needless to say, having those spots flaking, is not ideal. I wanted to try this particularly for its hydrating and moisturizing properties. I am pleased to report that this skin care product works extremely effectively. It has a very thick consistency to it, which to me indicates that it works well through its dense property. I use it after my shower in the evenings, and it totally alleviated the problems I had of any dry patches appearing on my face. I will say that it isn't in an inexpensive price range, but I'm happy with the results that I achieved when I used it. So if you can afford it, you might justify the expense. All in all it's an excellent cream, and I would certainly recommend it if you are like me, someone who suffers from dry skin and dry patches.",450249,1542

The mascara didn't flake off. It didn't smear during application. And I like that the color is black.  It did add length and volume to my lashes.

4.0,1615305261029,Decent,"I have found that my results with this cream are decent.  I wouldn't brag about or or anything like that, but at the same time it does do a nice job of hydrating the skin, and saturating well.  I did find that the cream was like whipped up, so being that it felt that it contained a bit of air, it didn't have the consistency that I like in creams, for them to be able to go a long way with only a little bit. That being said, it did saturate very nicely, and I found that it does a nice job if applied before bed, and in the morning, of keeping my skin well hydrated throughout the day.  The one thing I wasn't too crazy about was the scent.  I do not think that it is scented, but there is a natural smell that is a little weird.  I wouldn't really know how to describe it, but it's not terribly pleasant.  I wouldn't call it off putting either, but I'd rather it had a better overall smell.  That being said, it did perform well as a hydrating cream, and whether or not it prevents damage from your environment is difficult to judge really.",450249,976

5.0,1608825159373,Unique experience,"At first the bar feels a little rough but it smooths out pretty quickly after that.  The lather that comes off of this is pretty intense, but I really like that.  If it's a bar of soap it better lather, and this one does for sure.  I like the shape of the soap, like little shields, because it makes it easy to hold and handle.  I don't know if that was intentional, or a nice unintended consequence of the design, but nonetheless it works well in that regard.  I do wish the bars were a little bigger.  They have the size of something you would get in a hotel, which means you'll go through them rather quickly.  I remained nice and moisturized after my shower, and did not suffer from dry skin from this bar. Does it improve immunity?  Honestly I do not see how, unless you claim it washes away bacteria and viruses from your skin, but any soap will do that.  So I doubt it, but even still I like it, and would use it again.",450249,729

5.0,1606227763932,I like it very much indeed,"Yes this is a very nice product.  I have used it for a little while now, and am liking the hydration, and hopefully with more time, perhaps a little regenerative effect on my skin to give me a nicer more youthful glow.  Retinol seems to be all of the rage lately, and to be honest I wasn't even really aware that this had retinol in it until I read the ingredients a little closer.  I started by simply applying it to my desired area via the dropper that it uses for applying the product, but I soon learned that my preferable method of using it is to mix a drop or two with my facial moisturizing cream, and spread it around that way.  I have used facial serums before, and they tended to be a little more oily and thicker.  It's for that reason that I think I prefer mixing it with my cream, because when I tried to simply apply it straight to my face, it kind of ran down my face and didn't really stay put to where I wanted it to.  that being said, I do like the effect it has given me.  My primary reason for use is hydration, which honestly I don't always achieve with my facial cream alone.  I still tend to have a dry spot or two to contend with with just a cream or moisturizer.  This mixed with the cream does not leave me with any dry spots, and I hope that with more use, I will perhaps turn back the clock a little on wrinkles and sun damaged areas, as I live in south Florida, and sun damage is easy to come by.  I really like it so far, and have high hope for continued use.  I do recommend it.",450249,728

I also appreciate that it doesn't really have a scent, though a nice scent sometimes isn't all bad.  I just can't stand creams that are over perfumed, and to be honest, it doesn't seem like a great idea to me to add scent to something that goes on the sensitive skin of ones face, so I appreciate that this one does not.  All in all, I have been using it for a few weeks, and have had good moisturizing results, which does well to reduce wrinkles in the long run.

You have lavender for when you're in a floral mood and balsam fir for a woodsy mood. Both of them are not too strong so they're not overpowering. My wife and I like them both.

I wouldn't call the feeling on the scalp invigorating, but it does feel nice and fresh. After rinsing, it leaves the hair feeling clean and non-greasy. The price seems to be a bit much for a bottle this size, though.",450252,2279
5.0,1621967148066,Smells great!,I'm slowly turning gray and always looking for shampoo and conditioner's to stop the brassy tones.  I thought this Lux Spa shampoo and conditioner set worked well to keep the brassiness at bay.  This also smells great.  I washed my hair in the morning and could still smell the fresh scent at night.<br />It also kept my hair soft and managable.,450253,2357
5.0,1615432846720,Works great,"This mascara works great.  It lengths your lashes without clumping.  I love that its hypoallergenic.  There are a few brands that bother my eyes, especially during allergy season.  The very black is perfect for framing my eyes",450253,506
3.0,1609773580804,Could be better,"I was excited for the petal balls but they left me wanting more.  They arrived in a brown bag and were smaller than I anticipated -about 1"" around.  All the petal balls are in color foil.  The smell isn't the best and they aren't labeled so I was unsure what flower ball I was using.  These could really be a wow in a bathroom or add to your bath time enjoyment if they were larger, had a better smell and you could tell which petal ball you were using.",450253,241
4.0,1608172329474,A good eyeshadow pencil,These are fun and easy to use.  I like that color  easily apply the color I want quickly.  The colors aren't my cuppa but I can work with them.  I was able to blend with a more neutral shade to get the perfect look that I wanted.,450253,977
5.0,1600027736545,Great coverage,I really liked the look and feel of this foundation.  It went on easily for a full coverage smooth look.  I usually use a sponge when applying foundation but I really liked the easy of the brush.  The only downside is that neither color worked.,450253,11888
3.0,1594302249519,Not a change in tone,I’m outside a lot in the summer and my hair sees a lot of sun and chlorine from the pool.  It’s also becoming lighter with more grey.  I was excited about trying this.  I’ve used it for a few days and adult didn’t notice a huge change in the tone.  It does feel somewhat softer though<br />I’m also not a fan of the packaging.  There isn’t a pump or squeeze bottle. You just stick your hand in the jar.,450253,439
5.0,1576525726811,Love it!!!,"I had lash extensions for a bit but was tired of the fills , the cost and the time it took me to get them done.<br />This is a think mascara but it gives you the same look as the false eyelashes.  It does take time to dry so it's a bit of a process but worth it.",450254,848
5.0,1567735073239,Works great!,I thought this nail polish remove worked really well.<br />It removes my nail polish easily without much rubbing.,450254,11938
4.0,1566179370416,Easy product to use,"The MiroPure curing nail lamp is an easy product to use.<br />You really just plug it in and set the time and wait 30, 60 or 90 seconds<br />The hardest part of this is getting the gel coat on correctly and accurately.",450254,3585
5.0,1564022467324,Fast to heat and easy to use,This is a easy to use curler.  I thought the automatic twist feature was great!  The wand heated up quickly which is a plus.<br />The handle is a little big but it contains the heat settings as well as the twist control.,450254,3574
5.0,1673512473756,Thoroughly enjoyed this product highly recommend,It's got a wonderful scent the smell is delicious and the overall feel is great the way it applies and nourishes the skin. It's not normally what I would use in my regimen but after using this product I can definitely say I will be including it and now I am going to recommend it.,450259,2870
5.0,1658265579764,works just like the versa spa,This works just like the versa spa because it is the same exact formula!  i love the way it smells and the color it provides to my skin!! Absolutely love it!  I like that i can take it with my on vacation and upkeep my spray tan longer when it starts to fade!  i am a huge fan!,450259,3342
5.0,1651677002825,Some of the best massaging solution out there,First of all the size of this is perfect because I don't have to worry about how much I'm using there's a ton here. And a little goes a long way it actually spreads out very evenly and has a lot of silky smooth characteristics. There is no smell very subtle scent and it's not too oily. It soaks into the skin eventually where you will want to apply more but like I said a little goes a long way definitely worth the investment and unless you're giving massages all day this will last a long time. The pump works effortlessly and so far whether I've massaged some of it into my own legs and shoulders or applied it on a friend or family member it has been a unanimous decision that this cream lotion boil for massaging is as good as it gets.,450259,191
5.0,1641523467215,Great feeling razor very stoked,I try all types of different razors and the ones I grew up using from the major companies are just not made with the same quality as they used to in my opinion. So when I found an interesting shaped kind of new school style I wanted to try it and I'm glad I did. Definitely a comfortable grip and pretty decent quality that's what I was hoping for and I am experiencing satisfaction with these razors.,450259,427
5.0,1624517687491,Great feminine wash,Great ingredients inside this feminine wash. I like that it keeps the pH balanced out an acidic level with the ingredients used. I like the ingredients are pure and natural and I have nothing to worry about. I feel so fresh and clean after using this feminine wash.,450259,830
5.0,1621119973981,Lotion after using serum is the way to go,This peptide lotion is awesome you can feel it working the second you put it on. It's a very concentrated formula of pure extract and there is no shortage of quality as you work it into the face and neck. I enjoy serums and different types of liquids but there is nothing like a good old fashioned lotion with pure ingredients to nourish especially when you live in a dry area like I do,450259,11
5.0,1618007704440,Spreads easily and softens skin,I got this for my sons face because his cheeks have been getting extra dry and the other sunscreen was not helping.  It is very moisturizing and the skin felt silky smooth after just one application.  It gives off sun protection for a while but i would definitely keep applying it throughout the day to keep it at SPF50.<br />Im glad it doesnt have the popular bad chemical sunscreen ingredients but it does list a lot of chemical ingredients ive never heard of.  I hope these are not harmful.  i will have to do more research another time,450259,712
5.0,1613684515656,My go-to for this dry cold weather,This stuff is literally perfect for where I live it is cold and dry and all the Moisturizer in the world never seems to work but after using this out of desperation for some nourishing feeling skin I really have to say this did the trick. Definitely a nice thick feeling that leaves affirming sensation afterwards but not a dry feeling felt powdery soft after and even got it compliments on how nice my skin looked,450259,1542
3.0,1612307601156,This is a nifty product but you can't beat regs Epsom salt,As nifty of an idea this is granted I'm not a scientist to know exactly the formulations involved but nothing quite beats good old-fashioned Epsom salt right out of the giant bag it's the only thing that works it does the trick it's the least expensive and you can't beat it.,450259,45359
5.0,1611692767141,I take this mirror from the bathroom to my desk no problem,Nice and bright there's nothing about this vanity mirror to complain of lightweight and plugs into any USB perfect for traveling moving around,450259,1545
3.0,1607326157240,Not Impressed.  Too large in size to use.,I dont think the picture description is very fitting for this.  The jaw piece is a lot larger in person than how it looks in the womans mouth in the picture.  I found it to be HUGE.  I could barely fit it in my mouth.  I have to overextend my jaw just to try to slide it in there and it does not fit comfortably at all.  I wish that this product worked for me because I really want to start exercise my jaw but this one simply just is WAY too LARGE!  This might work for someone who has a very large mouth and can open their mouth very big.,450259,19174
5.0,1605512778051,Great for scrubbing off the dead skin,"This is an awesome body scrub.  I love that is is made with coffee, the smell is so good and it just gives me energy and focus just smelling it in the shower.  I love how this really helps to polish the skin, I feel that my skin is much smoother after using.  I like that it has some natural oils in it so I feel like it does not overdry",450259,4057
4.0,1605169436115,Was attracted to the fact it's a imported product from a place far far away that's not China,These products always confuse me do they come with a safety seal or not when I opened this bottle it seemed like it had been open and some of the oil was missing from the top not a big deal The product itself is pretty good I was under the impression it was going to blow my mind but after a few uses I can't really notice too much of a difference but I do like that it's from a faraway land,450259,728
4.0,1603829840185,I feel like I'm living in the future,This is definitely easy to use and not so hot that it's uncomfortable I kind of just like the old-fashioned way of curling but new innovations are cool. I need to stop sleep shopping,450259,1813
5.0,1603668318042,This lotion is good for everybody,This masculine smelling lotion is actually more feminine than you would think I've used some on myself men and women and nobody knows the difference in everybody likes it,450259,435
5.0,1601632327194,Perfect for acidic water,These are great glass bottles. The sprayer works very well and the dark glass makes it where my acidic disinfecting liquids stay fresh much longer. I like to use PH 2.5 water in my glass spray bottle and I keep it in the refrigerator and I love to use it for cleaning around the house as well as cleaning skin.,450259,1815
3.0,1601368529209,Took a chance ...missing the mark,It's tough because I know when lotions are natural they are not necessarily that thick but this stuff's pretty watery and I'm getting tired of the whole CBD infused products but they're not using good quality stuff so I don't know not my best lotion purchase,450259,436
4.0,1599958617283,Cannabis sativa is being marketed everywhere just know what you're actually buying,Not a bad serum but kind of getting tired of falling for the same hemp related products that don't really actually do anything hemp related they're just marketing the buzzwords but it's still a decent serum,450259,1005
5.0,1585262777757,Leaves your skin with a nice glow,This lotion works great and the smell is delightful. The best part is that it is vegan so I feel comfortable with the ingredients. Looking forward to using more of it and getting a nice tan going.,450259,1568
5.0,1581557053114,Unique scent and feel makes this one of my favorite face products,Compared to other face serums and creams I feel like this one is one of my favorites. It glides on very smooth and silky and has a unique scent but pleasant. So far since I've put this in my regimen I have noticed subtle differences in my wrinkles and skin firmness. The bottles are always small when it comes to lotions like this but this one packs a punch and seems like it will be a good long-lasting serum just need to apply it liberally.,450259,90
4.0,1684126047882,Gentle but effective,"This facial cleanse foam comes in a convenient plastic pump dispenser that contains 8.45 ounces of plant-based soap. It has no alcohol and is enriched with aloe extract, hyaluronic acid and ceramides. You only need a small amount of foam to wash your face and neck effectively. It cleanses gently but deeply, leaving your skin hydrated and refreshed. It is suitable for all skin types and can be used daily or nightly.",450264,2281
3.0,1640663357523,Runny consistency,"1.7 ounces of moisturizing face cream in a compact glass jar. While the cream does deliver a nice moisturized finish I found the 'cream' to be more of a runny liquid than anything else and had me questioning the possibility of whether this was a bad batch due to an unpleasant fragrance tinge reminiscent of yeasty sake lees. Once applied to the skin its not a big deal, however there are much better options at this price point without such initial unpleasant qualities.",450264,2986
4.0,1620109779403,Pleasant,"Nicely sized portion with 4 ounces of face wash in a plastic squeeze bottle. The wash is formulated to provide a satisfying cleanse with anti-aging properties through its incorporation of 20% Vitamin C and lemon peel bio ferment among others in the mix. The wash is pleasantly scented with citrus fragrances. Lather quality is so-so but overall it's a good cleanse and tired, greasy skin will look properly refreshed after use.",450264,393
4.0,1598231252319,Giving the ears a breather,"Well designed all black, stretchy headband with 2 side buttons to fasten face masks too as opposed to wrapping them around the ears. If you wear face masks for extended periods this is a great alternative solution as it puts the stress on the headband as opposed to the ears. This is an all black headband on both the material and buttons and looks great on men as well.",450264,3375
4.0,1594697368250,Good set,"Really good set of Men's grooming products  - everything you need to stay fit and fresh in and out of the shower with 16 ounce hybrid shampoo/body wash, 8 ounces of face wash, 6 oz of shave cream and 4 oz of facial moisturizer.  All of the products gets the job done nicely with good lather and a cleansing finish. The facial wash features micro rock particles to provide some exfoliating benefits. All 4 products come tucked in a black, zippered dop kit.",450264,2184
4.0,1587944089831,Implements galore,"Fairly comprehensive 18 piece home manicure set with implements for finger and toenails, eye brow grooming, callus treatment, nose hair scissors and an ear wax pick (common for use in Asia). The pieces are all constructed from black painted stainless steel and are mostly machined nicely. The pieces are all set in place in an included, snap shut, carry case.",450264,1681
4.0,1583901409096,Keep it minty,"Zippy and refreshing body wash nicely formulated with botanicals and essences to keep you feeling fine and fresh. Product comes in a plastic squeeze tube containing 6 ounces of gel. A little dab is all that's needed on a scrubby towel to generate rich lather and provide a proper wash. The menthol essence is pronounced so its best used during the warmer seasons to provide that nice, tingly cooling effect when you're done with the shower.",450264,1035
4.0,1583724919741,Firm hold is apt,Product description as firm hold is spot on. Mind you 'firm' is not a 'strong' hold but it does manage to lock in short'ish hair properly in place with all the benefits of a wax styled product (ie - does not stiffen the strands). Product is listed as a 'matte' finish and while this is mostly true - when applied to dried hair it does leave behind a slightly greased finish. That said its a decent styling product that applies efficiently to the strands and gives you just the right level of control.,450264,1077
4.0,1583630520610,"Mild, floral scented toner",Product comes in a clear plastic spray bottle containing 6.76 ounces of liquid. The liquid is lightly scented with floral essences and can be used in ways - if used as a toner you'll spray into a cotton ball and then rub it along your face. If can also be used as a skin mister for quick rejuvination of tired/dried skin as you need it. Product contains no alcohol and the floral formulation is fairly effective at removing dirt/grease from the skin.,450264,915
4.0,1559362855941,Lotion mask on the cheap,Product comes in a small fabric pouch containing 100 individually sealed compact paper masks. The masks are folded in such a way that they're compressed to the size of 2 nickels stacked on top of each other. To use you simply pour lotion or facial cream onto it and then slowly and carefully unfurl it on your face. The first time around you'll likely waste a few masks as the paper is very thin and if you're not careful they tear quite easily. That said once you get the hang of it they provide a decent and cost friendly way to get a homemade lotion mask treatment.,450264,3376
5.0,1666680977621,Lovely,Fantastic overnight treatments with smoothing results. Great value !,450271,2000
5.0,1664116290782,Great design,I really like the fact that there is a scrubber attached and you just pump the product right into the scrubbers. My skin feels the cleanest when you this product.

Such a great design and great way to get your face thoroughly clean.,450271,2870

5.0,1653834856626,Wonderful & compact,"Great product, great for traveling or everyday in your purse. I can't tell you how many times I have gone to the bathroom and the soap hasn't been refilled, even in these Covid. Hand sanitizer works, but I prefer soap and water. These are great compact and refillable. All and all great product.",450271,207
5.0,1642926888211,Such a gorgeous gift!,"I gave this gift to our college aged family member and she loved it. I saw her open it several times. It seemed she really enjoys it.

Great value and unique gift.",450271,194

5.0,1622405895232,Lovely travel candles,I am one of those people who loves to take a candle with me because sometime rooms at hotels smell musty and just not welcoming. I always try and find travel tins. They are lightweight an compact for traveling. Great relaxing scent and a great value for the money.,450271,229
4.0,1622262844869,Packaging failure,"Everything was wonderful about this set and I am a big fan of this brand but, the material of the bottle itself is weak. The shampoo had a crack in it and half the product was empty so I took a star away for that. As far as the product itself working as described, it is perfect. I hated to take a star away but if half my product it’s going to leak out what good is it then.",450271,131
5.0,1621011527396,Love it!,"Amazing, clean scent and soaks in nicely. It is not sticky or greasy. Lovely value set and it comes in a pretty gift type of box. I really liked this set. Great value for the money.",450271,2256
5.0,1618335780484,Great set,"Great moisturizing purple shampoo that doesn’t strip the hair. Some purple shampoos leave my hair feeling dry and crunchy, not this one.",450271,2933

5.0,1605932609418,Clean and no odor,"This is a wonderful carrier oil set, or oil set to use on it's own. I have found the cleanest moisturizing products are single ingredient oils. This set doesn't smell old or anything, just purely clean. This will be a great help as winter is approaching. This oil set can be combined with essential oils to make your own scents, or combined for other projects. Great value for the quantity.",450271,140
5.0,1605734713404,Impressed,"I have used this in an unconventional way. I have been using it on my bikini line after waxing and shaving. I tend to get irritated skin easily and this has been the golden ticket in healing. I can't believe how nice it made my skin! I have really sensitive skin and this was amazing. Such a great product for me. I was skeptical to see the photos, but it works great for me!  I'll be getting this again!",450271,314
5.0,1603562969238,Lucious Foam,"Luscious thick foamy wash. I have another foam wash and this one seems way more moisturizing.

4.0,1673120230203,Good size bottle and feels lightweight on skin,I like this tanning sunscreen. I think the SPF level because it provides protection without being too high to prevent tanning. It goes on nicely and doesn't feel too heavy or greasy on my skin. I like the bottle style and size - it's easy to throw in my bag. The color of the lotion itself is kind of surprising (yellow) because most sun lotions I've used are white but I like the scent - it smells like sun lotion but with a subtle tropical/coconut scent.,450272,17746
5.0,1668730369534,Great set,"I really like this collapsible foot tub set. It is a good size for soaking my feet and I like the pumice stone and foot file that are included with it.

It's portable, can be used for a multitude of other things, and it stores easily. I couldn't be happier!",450272,2877
4.0,1666413318663,Nice product but not the best cream I've used,"I like this day cream, but I don't LOVE it. It's a bit more gel like consistency and not as creamy as I like but it does help my skin feel moisturized and hydrated. It looks nice and the overall packaging/design/aesthetic is quite beautiful so I think it would be nice to gift, however, I'm not sure if I would order it again for myself.",450272,12465
4.0,1665864763050,Works pretty well,This cream is helpful for moisturizing my feet. I prefer to apply my foot cream after getting out of the shower because I feel like it helps absorb better and then I like to put socks in to lock in the moisture. I have had pretty good results.,450272,2228
5.0,1664684660748,Gives me soft skin,I love a good exfoliator and I'm quite happy with this one. I really like the style/packaging as well as the scent. There are little exfoliating beads which I'm a fan of and it helps my skin feel clear and soft.,450272,426
5.0,1661059037146,Comfortable relaxing foot spa,"This foot spa massager is comfortable and relaxing. Although I prefer to fill it with warm water to start with, it will actually heat the water on its own in about 25 minutes. It also keeps it warm and you can control the temperature that you want. I love how relaxing the massage rollers feel after a long day on my feet. I also love that it has a remote control. It's also collapsible so it doesn't take as much space to store as other foot massagers.",450272,2315
5.0,1657342067982,Quick results,"This teeth whitener is easy to use and my teeth looked whiter after just one use. I like that you only have to wait 20-30 minutes after applying before you can eat/drink and also that you don't have to brush your teeth afterward. When I first used I had to click the button probably 20 times before any of the gel dispensed but after that it was smooth and easy to apply. Right after I use this my teeth look noticeably whiter and brighter especially for the first day or two, but the brightness kind of fades although overall I am seeing, hopefully, a long lasting whiter smile.",450272,11934

I’ve had and used IPL lasers in the past but literally none of them were this fast.<br /><br />This thing is so simple and easy to use; read the booklet, follow the instructions, but all you have to do is plug it in and use it. It’s not complicated it’s actually very easy and simple to use.<br /><br />You do have to start with a shaved clean skin and then all you have to do is press and hold the button and in speed mode it will continuously flash as long as you move it along the skin. I have found that IPL laser results are effective and long lasting as long as you use this right. Go by the skin tone graph and use it weekly, unless skin irritation  develops.<br /><br />I absolutely love this thing. I like the little cap that it comes with for precision treatment areas such as the face. The cap Is actually magnetic so it stays on very well. My only gripe with this is that for this price, and this was priced at $379 at the time of purchase, you should get a case with this product, but you do not get any protective case just a box that it ships in, that’s kind of disappointing to me but it’s not a dealbreaker because this product produces excellent results. I would highly highly highly recommend this IPL laser in particular just because of the speed and effectiveness of it.

Once I removed them, my skin feels fresh. The following morning, I feel my face moisturized and soft. There is enough serum to apply on the neck and chest area. There is no need to rinse after using them. Great option to use after a facial. It covers pretty well all face. I had to fold the nose area because of a recent nose ring, but it does cover the nose as well.<br /><br />Regarding the ingredients, I use skincare ingredient analyzers that follow the EWG, which individually rates ingredients from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest hazard). I was impressed to see all ingredients are rated EWG1.

The actual sheet masks work like charm in prepping the skin. However, I am not exactly sure they are saving me time. Overall I feel they are adding those 3 extra minutes to my routine, which may not sound liek a lot of time, but in the mornings, every minute count! Usually, after cleansing my face, it takes me 1 to 2 minutes applying toner and moisturizing cream, including the time to let each product be absorbed. When using these sheet masks, I have to leave them for 3 minutes and wait about 2 minutes to let the remaining serum be absorbed.<br /><br />What I absolutely love about this product:<br />- Comes in a nice container not too big that can easily fit into your sink/beauty area.<br />- Tweezer are included as well as a place inside the same lid to attach it!<br />- Scent is absolutely enjoyable, it is a sweet fresh scent that is noticed since you take out the sheet mask.

Not to mention Eggplant extract that has antioxidants.<br /><br />The only callout would be to include a way to keep the tweezers attached to the lid, this way you don't have to put them on top of the wipes or keep them outside the closed bottle that could possibly get lost.",450291,14285

None of these are included in this product. I have been using this oil as pre-poo, which is basically adding 2 pumps into my scalp and 2 more into my hair (wavy, length half way back) before taking a shower and leaves my hair soft and moisturized.<br /><br />With the above explanation on ingredients I avoid for my skin and hair, it is difficult to find a product that meet both requirements, but this product does!!",450291,73

When I removed it, it was very easy, I did not even needed to use makeup remover, I just got one of my reusable pads, got it wet, rubbed my eyes a few times and done.<br /><br />In addition to the above, it is hypoallergenic and package and overall the ingredients are environmental friendly. This brand does seem to care about what type of ingredients are being used and our planet.",450291,506

4.0,1615589395801,Puffy reusable pads,"I am a big fan of reusable pads. I have tried several kind of pads, thin, thick, tiny, medium size. They are soft, puffy and thick, however they are a little difficult to clean up your face easily due to this thickness.<br /><br />The package comes with 3 so you can wash them often and still have one available always.<br />They all have a ribbon to be able to hang it once used.",450291,30438
5.0,1611178725047,Amazing and fluffy wig,"When I saw the pictures of this wig, I kind of like it but wasn't sure how it would look like on me since I am used to have longer wigs, at least shoulder length. But decided to give it a try.<br />When I received it, I was impressed by the look and texture. I instantly love it!<br />The wig is fluffy, cut on the back looks amazing, a little shorter than the actual pictures, but still nice.<br />The headband is adjustable, so it is really comfortable when wearing it.<br />It comes with a certificate that says it has 70% human hair. This is why I assume it is a little more expensive than other wigs.<br />No need to style it, the pics I took were taken as soon as I took it out of the bag.",450291,4071

It cures in about 60 seconds with a good UVLED lamp (48W).<br />I did my nails at home and they did not last 2 weeks, 10 days tops, but it might be the technique I am using. Not a pro but still learning all tips and tricks. I will be adding dehydrator and primer in addition to the base coat to see if that can make them last longer.",450291,11372
5.0,1609285273204,"Flexible brush, great for detangling wavy/curly hair!","I like that you can adjust the comb rows depending on how thick your hair is. It is a little bigger to regular brushes.<br />I only use this detangling brush on my wet hair to avoid damaging or breakage, either inside the shower after conditioner or after shower before applying leave-in and curl cream.<br />The curved brush really adapts well to the shape of the head, it feels like a massage when running it through your entire head and hair.<br />It is flexible when trying to detangle.",450291,11346
4.0,1609283833682,Great variety of poly gels,"9 different colors you can choose from, 3 of them are glitter/sequins. A free gift is included which is basically gold glitter.<br /><br />The dual forms are way to big for my hands, good thing I had another set of dual forms already.<br />It also comes with the ""gold stickers"" nail extensions in case you want to mold your nails from the top. But you got to have some practice to follow this approach. Otherwise, it will take you forever to distribute and mold your nails.<br /><br />All poly gels come sealed. They do match the color listed on the outside of the little bottle. Even though they are small, they can last a few rounds since you don't need a lot of product for each nail.<br /><br />Once the poly gel is cured, you will need to apply a top coat since they are sticky after cured.",450291,1551
4.0,1609265872247,"Different container, soft hair, CGM approved","I was a little confused when I got this leave-in because I was expecting a bottle with a pump and instead I got a tub with product all over the place.<br />This leave-in cream is very runny, fruity scent a little too strong for me. Although after I applied it into my hair, it wasn't that bad.<br />I have incorporated a few times now into my regular routine (shampoo, conditioner, leave-in, curl cream and gel) and it has worked well so far. Hair feels soft and define. The way I applied it was on damp hair, making sure product was evenly distributed.<br />One thing to consider when using it, is not to apply too much product on your hair, I used about 2 dime size on all my hair. For thin hair I would recommend half of it, otherwise hair will look very greasy.<br />Lastly, ingredients are very good for your hair. I have been following the Curly Girl Method (CGM) for about 6 months and one of the major recommendations is to avoid parabens, silicones, sulfates, non-water soluble waxes and drying alcohols, and all ingredients in this leave-in are safe to use if you are following the CGM as well.",450291,985

It feels similar to slime, thinner than regular slime though, but definitely a slippery sensation. It might not be pleasant for all people. I had no problem at all.<br />1 pump is good enough for thoroughly washing your hands.<br />It does smells like lemongrass, not too strong, but you can definitely tell it is lemongrass.",450291,726
5.0,1605905838076,Perfect to reduce frizz!,"I love this set!! Microfiber is the best especially for wavy/curly hair. It helps minimize frizz and it is very absorbent.<br /><br />I found very useful the turban for whenever I am doing my makeup or I am just at home and don't want to touch my hair to avoid getting tangled or frizzy. I haven't really used it after a shower.<br /><br />The twist head towel is great for plopping your head for some time after shower. My routine using this has been: right after shower, apply leave-in, curl cream, and plop for 20 min using this twist head towel. After that, I remove the towel, apply gel and diffuse for 15-20 min. Also, I wear it ""backwards"". I know the button should be at the bottom of the head, but I found using it at the top also works for me.",450291,141
4.0,1604895452801,High quality but pricey,"Nice to have nowadays! Conveniently individually wrapped. They claimed to be unscented refresh, but they do have a slightly non-pleasant scent. Wipes are light beige with tiny brownish dots, nothing wrong with that but just different to the white plain wipes we are used to see everywhere.<br /><br />Package (both box and each wipe) is nice and high quality. Price seems to be a little high. But given the fact they are all natural (paraben-free, cruelty free, plant-based, aluminum free, etc.) and conveniently individually wrapped in case you need to get one handy in your pocket or pursue and don't have to bother with a hand sanitizer bottle (even the small ones), I think it's worth having them as an emergency. Definitely not for daily use (or several in a day).",450291,2271
4.0,1604694492997,Thick and good quality,"This is a good set of gel nail polish. Bottle size is average from other brands I have tried (usually between 6-8 ml), these bottles contain 7.5 ml. Gel is thicker that most brands, which is kind of good and bad at the same time. Good because you can get a great coverage with 2 thin layers. However, it is a little more difficult to apply, especially the white one that is super thick, but you will get a perfect white!<br /><br />Like any other set that does not come with base and top coat, make sure to get them before trying to use this nail polish on its own. They won't last if not using base and top coat.<br /><br />Not a fan of bottles that do not include the sticker with the color, just the number, so you either apply it to the bottle and cure them or get some nail watches, cure them and have them handy when choosing colors.<br /><br />I have not tested the durability of them (it would depend a lot of the quality of your base and top coat and how well you prep your nails). But so far, I am please with the texture and color set.",450291,10017
5.0,1602798549277,Excellent nail drill,"This nail drill is an excellent choice when doing your nails or re-doing them!<br />I have used it with gel nail polish and acrylic nails and works wonders.<br />USB cable only, no adapter included, but you can use any other you already have (~5V needed).<br />It is really powerful compare to other non-wired I have tried. You can regulate the speed as well. Super easy to operate, on/off switch and rotating button for adjusting the speed.<br />I like that it comes with all kind of bits, sanding bands and cuticle remover bits which are easy to swap.",450291,2197
4.0,1602787044183,Good portable set of spray and pump bottles,"This is a good set of spray and pump bottles. Full disclosure, they are small: 100ml/3.4 oz for the spray bottle (which is the approved size when using in your carry-on on a plane) and 60 ml/2 oz for the pump bottles.<br /><br />Pump bottles have a removable lock cap.<br /><br />My only complain (reason why I am rating 4 stars) is that one of the spray bottles came crushed, but I got 2 other spray bottles in perfect condition. Package was not damage at all, so I am not sure at what point of the delivery process was smashed like that.<br /><br />Any way besides that, they all work great, totally worth the money!",450291,1091

The nano glass side is gentle enough for your nails.<br /><br />You can polish, buffer or just trim your nails and will have great results. It is highly recommended to rinse your nail files after each use, warm water (a bit of soap if desire) will do the trick.<br /><br />The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because they are too thick that it is difficult to use it when trying to file your nail from the bottom.",450291,1553
4.0,1598553524108,Good mascara with a tweak,"This is a good mascara. The brush is a little curve so it can help with the application.<br /><br />My first impression wasn't that good, since the mascara felt so thin that looks like I wasn't really wearing almost anything. It dried so fast that when I tried to apply the second layer, it wouldn't let me because it was already dry and the brush wouldn't run nice and soft through my lashes. However, I added 2-3 drops of castor oil (you can also use almond oil or any other natural oil that you like) and it was a game changer. I instantly felt the brush was running smoothly on my lashes, and was able to apply a second and even third layer with no problem. Lashes looked way better (not to mention they were also being lubricated with the added oil).<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Does not smudge<br />- Easy to remove with makeup remover or even in the shower<br />- When removed, it comes out in small flakes which is great because it does not leave you with raccoon eyes<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Very thin mascara (although this might be a pro for some people)<br />- Felt a little dry at the beginning but manage to ""enhance"" it with castor oil (as mentioned above)",450291,889
4.0,1597950313364,Good quality design set!,"Let me start by saying ... I LOVE the look of these tools. The rhinestones inside a clear handle gives them such an attractive and high quality look.<br /><br />The bristles/brushes are all different sizes, same thickness. Would be nice to have a variety of thickness as well. But they are soft and work great when drawing lines or mostly any design.<br /><br />The metal part at both ends make them feel sturdy and durable.<br /><br />My only complain is that the 2nd size dotter (the pink one) is not as soft as the other. It's a bit sharp which does not work when trying to use it, but other than that all good. This is the only reason I give them 4 stars.<br /><br />I highly recommend this set!!",450291,4596
4.0,1644128415315,Wear over black to help with sheer formula,"So pretty! I love the holo paired with the multichrome magnetic polishes! That being said, the pigment is fairly thin on these polishes, while the formula is pretty thick. They’re still easy enough to work with, but I would likely recommend wearing them over a black polish.<br />I show them in one coat with no magnet (obviously very sheer), and with a magnetic coat on top of that (still pretty sheer, but better). I feel they’re slightly pricy for how sheer the formula is, but I would still recommend them because they’re so pretty, and I’ve found Homost to be a pretty reliable brand in the couple of sets I’ve ordered from them. They all cure within 60 seconds. Just know, their bottles feel super tiny, and their brush is definitely very short and small.",450295,38606
5.0,1625971856890,2-3 coats,"This is a great little set! It’s a neon set, and the colors are for sure neon. One thing to note though - the first picture in the listing made me hope that the colors would have some shimmer in them, but they definitely don’t. Looking at the other pictures, this matches up, but that shimmer was the most noticeable thing to me in the first picture so I just thought I’d mention it.<br />These polishes do cure within 60 seconds, and give decent coverage. Most of them gave full coverage in two coats, but a couple (mainly the yellow), I’d consider a third coat for. Since the polishes are quite neon, are gel (meaning fast and easy to work with), and this is standard especially for yellow neons, I’m not upset about it. Honestly, when I added a top coat over just two coats, it ended up looking pretty good, but I’d still probably add that third coat just to be sure, because… It’s neon yellow. But, overall, I’m happy with the polishes! At 8 mL, they’re also a decent sized bottle for gel polishes.",450295,1125
5.0,1625971814460,Almost 1 coat coverage,"This is a great little set! It’s more of a neutral color palette, without being boring, and without being the standard reds and pinks. One thing to note though - the first picture in the listing made me hope that the colors would have some shimmer in them, but they definitely don’t. Looking at the other pictures, this matches up, but that shimmer was the most noticeable thing to me in the first picture so I just thought I’d mention it.<br />These polishes do cure within 60 seconds, and actually give great coverage. Most of them gave full coverage in pretty much one coat, but they all gave full coverage within two coats for sure. Overall, I’m happy with them!

5.0,1620589426976,Comes with 8 scrunchies!,"This is definitely one of those products that I absolutely don’t need and didn’t know it existed, but now that I have one and know it exists, I love it and don’t want to let it go.<br />Honestly, this product is incredibly simple - it’s just a tube with a base, and even the base probably isn’t completely necessary.This particular holder comes with the tube and base connected and the open end of the tube facing down, so you’re unable to store anything inside of it unless you use it upside down, but then you couldn’t grab scrunchies off of it as easily. The strange thing about it is that the bottom of the base has some kind of brown paper on it - it looks like it should be removable, but it’s not. Honestly, since I’ll be keeping scrunchies on this pretty much all the time this will likely remain covered, but I still don’t like it. I would also like it better if the diameter of the tube was slightly smaller so some of my ties that are slightly smaller don’t get stretched out, but I can work with this. I’m very happy it fits perfectly on my bookcase where I wanted it to go, and I also really love that even though it’s only $10, it comes with eight scrunchies to get you started. I’ve been using one of these scrunchies all week and so far it’s holding up well - while I thought I wouldn’t like the material, it actually feels way nicer than it looks. I’m very happy with this product and am considering getting more as gifts for others later this year, if it holds up. I did get mine to use for scrunchies as the listing suggests, but you could also definitely use it for other things such as bracelets - it’s quite simple, but convenient.",450295,11914
5.0,1619323590972,"Beautiful, well-behaved polishes","These polishes were exactly what I was hoping for when I ordered Krisnice creme colors! One of them is actually more of a jelly polish, but it’s a stunning color, which you can definitely build up some opacity and depth with. The others are, as I said, exactly what I was hoping for. I’ve used this brand’s magnetic polishes before, but these cremes apply just as dreamily, and have absolutely excellent coverage! A couple of them were almost one coaters, but they’re all definitely perfect within two. And, they all cure within 60 seconds, so I couldn’t be happier with them!",450295,2153
3.0,1616963788589,Very oily,"Bottom line - this nail polish does what it’s supposed to do, I just don’t love it as much as I was hoping I would.<br />The first reason for this is that it’s oily - it leaked during shipping, so about a quarter of the shipping box was soaked in oil. Of course, since it leaked it’s all over the bottle, and since it’s oil, it’s not terribly fun to clean up. Even if it didn’t leak, I don’t love the oiliness. It definitely sticks around on your hands when you use it.<br />The second reason is the smell - as soon as I opened the shipping box, I could smell it and at first I thought it smelled wonderful, like a rainbow cherry flavored candy cane, although the smell was incredibly strong. Riding in my car with it for a few minutes, my husband and I both could smell it for the rest of the day, and leaving it in the car while we shopped for maybe an hour, the smell was overpowering when we came back out to the car. So, I let it sit in the box for a few days hoping the smell would eventually die down; it did, but when actually using the polish, it doesn’t have this same nice smell. It smells a bit like vinegar, or something similar - definitely not like acetone, and not like flowers which is like I was worried about, but still not great. Personally, I’d prefer the smell of acetone.<br />Finally, the bottle - it has a convenient flip cap and a pump you press down to dispense it which is supposed to be convenient, but in reality, it makes a mess. I think this is possibly because you have to push fairly hard on it to get any out. But, as I said, this nail polish remover does work pretty well. I used it on a polish with tiny holo glitter in it, and had no problems, and my husband had no problems getting it to remove foil or plain creme polish. Essentially, the thing both of us really don’t like about it is the oiliness. The other things we could deal with, but because of the oiliness we won’t be buying this product again after this bottle. However, if that wouldn’t bother you, we think this is a great option if you’re looking for an alternative to acetone.<br />I have provided a picture of my bottle - you can see the oiliness around the edges of the label, and you can somewhat see the oil still all over the bottle. Note that I did clean the bottle off before I used it, and have kept it upright and in a plastic bag since then - it’s just a messy product.",450295,860
5.0,1613350340447,Awesome unique colors,"This is by far the most unique set of gel polishes I've ever seen... I only wish the bottles were bigger! They're only 5 mL, but you do get a lot of options so I think the price is still fair. Depending on your preference, you'll probably want 2-3 coats of each color; they're all pictured in 2, and do cure in 60 seconds. There are colored stickers already on the top of each bottle, but I don't feel they accurately show the colors inside, so I still added swatch dots.<br />The black velvet box does rub off on the white top / base coat bottles, but that's okay. One of these white bottles also had some color on it making me wonder if I possibly got a set that was returned, but I honestly like the color selection far too much to take off a star even for this.",450295,1541
5.0,1613008734480,Very nice colors,"Especially for the price, these colors are very nice! They're difficult to photograph, but in the light in person, they're quite pretty. Several of the colors are jellies, but I still think you could get full coverage from them (the dark red particularly would be a beautiful, deep red). Pictured are all of the colors in two coats, but on the nails you might need three, as when holding the swatch dots up you could still see through them. They do all cure within 60 seconds. I do also like that the bottles look different than my other gel polishes do, but are still the same size / shape so they still easily fit in with the others in my storage boxes.",450295,3351
4.0,1612586903247,"Thin lotion, but works well for me","I was a little hesitant about getting this set, since it is a little bit pricey and is a rose scented lotion (I can be sensitive to floral smells in particular). I figured I'd like the cuticle oil, and the lotion less so. But it actually turned out to be the other way around - I like the lotion better than the cuticle oil.<br />The lotion itself is very, very thin, almost the consistency of water, but it does work well for me. Before I used it, my knuckles were cracked to the point of bleeding. I applied a generous amount before bed, and that first night it healed my hands enough that they were no longer bleeding, just cracking a little bit. Even with my handwashing and having my hands frequently wet at work, this lotion brought them back to life. The second use resulted in no more cracks. The third brought my hands back to feeling normal. Since then, I've been using a more moderate amount only a couple of times a week (note the bottle DID come completely full - the pictures are after about three weeks of use, with the first week of that using a lot more than I normally would, due to how bad my hands were cracking). The lotion does have a definite floral scent, but it's actually a lot lighter than I expected it to be. My skin absorbs it pretty fast, within about 5-10 minutes even using a ton, and the scent fades pretty much completely even before this. So it doesn't bother me at all.<br />The cuticle oil, on the other hand, has a much stronger scent. It's more ""planty"" and less pleasant to me. Definitely not something I can use when I already have even a hint of a headache. Also, it lingers a lot more than the lotion's scent does. I do like the roller applicator as it makes it much easier to control my application onto my dominant hand, but I don't feel that this cuticle oil is anything better than any other one I've used. Combine that with the smell of it, and I definitely like the lotion in this set better. It is pricey, but to help my hands as much as it has, I think it's worth it.",450295,448
5.0,1609654914632,$9 is a steal for these plates!,"I definitely think that Bituee is one of the better cheap stamping plate brands on Amazon... the plates don't have a plastic backing, but they're thick enough not to hurt or cut your hands (please note they are still thin enough you can bend them with your hands pretty easily if you want to). I'm not sure what the logic on putting St. Patrick's Day plates together with winter ones is, but all of the plates have really great designs and pick up well. Personally, I'm not a fan of the stamper and the scraping card this set come with, but they do definitely work. Definitely get these if you like the designs on them! They're well worth it.",450295,9806
5.0,1609112222393,These colors have winter-y vibes!,"I wanted this set for the greens in it and wasn't sure how I'd like the other ones, but once I started swatching them they gave me a happy, wintery feeling so I liked them a lot better than expected! The lightest one is the only one I likely won't use often, but I love all of the others. They cover really well in 2 coats, and cure in 60 seconds. Plus, the shade names are really cute; the labels themselves are the color of the shade inside the bottle which is helpful, though it doesn't seem like the stickers are stuck on the bottle very well. And perhaps most exciting is these bottles are almost full size! They're 9 mL and full size is normally between 10 and 15 mL. Pictured are all colors in two coats, with the top coat they came with over the top - the holder in the picture is NOT the box they came in.",450295,1547
5.0,1608601416848,5 holo colors and 1 foil color!,"I'm really happy with these colors - most of my gels are just plain solid colors, so I definitely need more holo and glitters in general. All of these except for the silver are holo, so it's so hard to pick just one favorite, especially when the silver is a metallic foil!<br />All of the polishes are pictured in two coats just to show how that looks, but if you're going for full opacity you might want to do a third especially if you have long nails. Alternatively, you could wear them over a similar base color. They cured just fine under my lamp in 60 seconds; they are wipe colors though, so you either need to wipe them or put a top coat on. They're pictured without a top coat, because this kit didn't come with one. They're still wonderfully shiny without a top coat!<br />The bottles of this set come with numbered dots to label them, but not colored dots; however, it comes with a sheet of stickers that you can swatch them on your own. If you're like me and have other gels which also don't have colored dots, you might be happy to know this comes with a few extra stickers so you can do a couple of others too. Definitely recommend!",450295,3370
5.0,1607912756974,Nearly one coaters,"With the exception of the glitter in this set, they're pretty much one coaters! All cured in 60 seconds; the creme colors are nice, but I got this set for the magnetic ones and I'm not disappointed! Even without the magnetic effect, those two polishes are shimmery and beautiful. With the magnetic affect, they're very different, but still stunning. I actually feel that even with the magnetic affect, one coat was just fine. I added a second just to see what that looked like, and it made the edges darker, and the magnetic effect less profound, in my opinion. Still, this set is absolutely worth it! The tops of the bottles are labeled with a colored sticker for convenience, which is great.",450295,2537
5.0,1607912437182,Chameleon shimmers!,"The black in this set is not even close to the best - it 100% requires two coats, and even then still isn't the best (pictured is two coats). But, I'm here for the shimmers, and I'm not disappointed! The tops of the bottles are labeled with a colored sticker for convenience, and the shimmers only require one coat over the black. It's hard to capture the color shifting on camera, but it's absolutely stunning! I couldn't recommend it more. It looks different at different angles, and over different colors. All polishes in this set cured in 60 seconds for me; they are pictured without a top coat since this set didn't provide one.",450295,16372
3.0,1605223805093,"Refreshing cucumber face mask, unpleasant texture","When I pulled the first of these masks out of the package, I didn't think that it would fit on my face at all. Mainly, because the eye holes were only about a centimeter wide, and the mouth hole was literally just a slit in the plastic. However, once I pulled off the plastic sheet that helps the mask keep its shape in the package, I found that these holes stretched, so it ended up working out okay, though I would still like for the eye holes to be a little bit longer as they barely fit around my eyes. Overall, because of the material / stretchiness of the mask, this fit my face better than a lot of other sheet masks do.<br />The main reason I'm giving only three stars is the feel of the mask itself. When I first touched it, my immediate thought was that it felt like a donut that sat in a pool of water for several hours and ended up being soggier than anyone should have to even imagine (trust me, I worked at a donut shop for years and this accidentally happened sometimes). My husband's reaction was that it felt like boogers. After taking it off and inspecting it a little more closely, we both thought it pretty much looked and felt like soggy toilet paper. Whichever answer you got with, it's not at all pleasant to touch, and not a pleasant texture moving around on your face either. Once you get it on, as long as you basically hold still and don't talk or anything, then it actually has a nice cooling, refreshing feeling. And it smells wonderfully like cucumber, which is what I was really hoping for!<br />The other reason I'm giving three stars is because it left my face feeling sticky for a long time after I removed the mask. Some masks leave a sticky feeling for a few minutes, but this one took almost two hours to absorb into my skin because it left so much. With other masks I don't normally help this along, so I didn't with this one either. When it finally did absorb, I was happy with how my face felt...

It has an automatic shutoff feature that is very sensitive so even if my dog would tolerate his paw being in it, it would turn off if he moved at all. That being said, this thing is kind of loud and both of my dogs are terrified of it. I've done all I can with treats and positive reinforcement, but it's not working. This isn't just a pull his paw out kind of thing, but like a panic, worse than the vacuum. You can see from the picture of him, with it not even on, that he is mortified. So for me, this isn't good and I don't like the automatic features. However, if you have a smaller and more calm dog this could be a great option.

Then, once you've put them on, you can't move them around or else the liner starts to come off!

There are two containers of magnetic eye liner and one plastic tweezers.<br />The eyeliner has a thin brush which makes it simple to paint the black line where it needs to be and keep it straight. I had to go back and re-do the very edges to make sure there was enough to hold the lashes. These are easy to remove from the box with the tweezers and place onto the eyes. I was surprised how well the lashes hold...it's not over grippy but they stay in place as long as you don't knock them around. The felt a bit scratchy along the corner to the nose, although it wasn't really rubbing. This sensation was only slight and soon forgotten.<br /><br />The eyelashes are easy to remove and place back into the box for re-usage.

It's no problem to spread over the face and doesn't drip or run while doing so. It actually starts to foam the second it hits the skin. This was actually fun to watch (joy in little things) and tingles a bit, too. Even the foam stays in place and doesn't run off of the skin or drip.<br /><br />It is to be worn for 3 min, and then washed off....like a mud mask (but foam is simply more enjoyable than mud).

The mask has a sturdy, plastic backing, which is the only reason it can be unfolded and placed on without any trouble because these are thin. Surprisingly, they don't rip or tear easily, though. After taking off the backing, it takes a little maneuvering to get these to sit in place. Firstly, the thin material wanted to bunch and roll along the edges of the face, and the lack of thickness made it difficult to get to lay flat. Also, the eye holes aren't quite right. I, my son, and my daughter tried them (each with very different face sizes) and all of us had trouble with the eyes. When they were in position, The bridge of the nose wouldn't stay pressed against the skin, but kept lifting up. The suggested wear time is 20 to 25 minutes, which is longer than the 15 to 20 I normally see on masks. Removing the mask, however, is no problem, and there's a good amount of moisture left over to massage into the skin....which also works well<br /><br />The masks are moistening and have a gentle, pleasant odor (although I can't really place it). These are refreshing and leave the skin shiny. If only they'd sit better, I'd enjoy them more.",450304,734

This one sits well on the edge of the tub/shower and doesn't tip over every time I reach for it. The pump top works well and makes it easy to get soap without fiddling. It smells nice without being overwhelming and doesn't hang forever on the skin. The soap itself doesn't sud up as much as I'd like (can there be enough bubbles?), but it's not bad, either.

I've been using a straight razor for some time, but these cartridge type razors are definitely easier to use and less likely to produce accidental cuts. I was excited to try this, and in general, it's been pretty good, but not amazing. The razor itself is quite heavy and looks very cool. The cartridge fits easily and is easy to change if necessary. There's also the heavy base piece to stand the razor up. The shaving cream is not that great. It comes out of the can with impressive body, but once you start applying it to your face, it deflates and just doesn't provide awesome coverage. The razor is smooth on the skin, but because of its asymmetrical design, it's less comfortable in the left hand. I'm right handed, but I still switch between hands when I'm shaving different sides of my face. It would have been better if they made it symmetrical.

The best thing after the easy application is you can try different types of lashes, included in the set, to see which one is perfect for your makeup and wardrobe choice.

I’m a 21” wig wearer and this fit me comfortably with my long/thick hair in a bun at the nape of my neck. Long! I’m 5’2-ish and this hit me lower back.

Once dry, I used the tweezer to apply the magnet eyelash. Each eyelash has tiny magnetics that adhere to the liner. I was pleasantly surprised that it worked!! The tweezers was not helpful to me for applying, and the second lash I applied with my hands without a problem. Beautiful lashes!! Wore them all day yesterday and wasn’t uncomfortable at all.

5.0,1562454061693,Great travel toothbrush!,"[[VIDEOID:b2565b535e1d3f3297ca6703d7f26383]] A tip for those would never used an electric toothbrush: put the toothbrush into your mouth and then turn on (and off before removing from mouth). Lol, I got toothpaste everywhere and learned this the hard way. Functionally, the vibrations are powerful by default, so if you are sensitive like me, turn it down. I’ve used it 4 times now and the first time it was strange, but now I am use to it. There are 5 different pulsating settings (see video). The plus and minus icons allow for easy and quick adjustment of how hard/soft - fast/slow the vibrating brush-head will pulsate. The bristles on the brush attachment is firm, but soft on gums; so there is some bend to the bristles and was comfortable for me. It sits on a charger to power it up via usb cord that plugs into standard charger plug. The case is beyond awesome. I travel for conferences and this stores the brush and charger with the brush head in a beautiful pink bottom and clear top hard case. Easy to pack and go. My teeth feels very clean after using this electronic toothbrush. For my set, I have 5 extra brush head attachments for exchanging after wearing out. This set looks exactly like advertised. I love the pink design. It is long and slender with sliver trim. My video will show the different settings and I hope you can hear the slight vibration changes because you could easily tell from the sound of the pulse by which setting it is on through a couple of uses. My favorite thing about it is that the charger is small and doesn’t take up any room on the sink countertop. The travel case is sturdy. The quality of this brush is so great that I don’t want to ever go back to a standard manual toothbrush. I highly recommend if you need a travel brush that is electronic!

5.0,1665887780658,COMPATIBILITY (must read),"One significant issue that this listing did not address is compatibility. IPL's are not effective for all skin and hair color types. Please research online as there are several infographics on how effective laser therapy is on each color type. This is the main reason why some reviews rave about the results and some are so disappointed.<br />That being said...<br />This is the most compact IPL device that I've tried, but it packs all the new features you are looking for. I personally have not reached the intensity where I need the cooling function, but it's nice knowing it's there when I reach that point. I do like the compact size, but wish there was more grip to the exterior. Everything is smooth and I came close to dropping the thing the first time I used it. So be careful handling it. One of the newer trends on these devices is to have the invisible screen, instead of a visible LCD screen. When you turn it on, the data lights are under the gold rectangle and illuminate to show the functions etc.<br />I personally have had great success with IPL devices, since I fit the designated hair and skin color. Hair hardly, if at all, grows back in the targeted areas... but it does take some time to see results.

I had gotten a decent amount on my wash cloth and rubbed it on my leg and immediately noticed that it was causing like little micro scratches. The salt flakes are really coarse and uncomfortable to rub against the skin. It’s suppose to exfoliate not rub off the skin. Like goodness. I started using it on my calloused feet and it didn’t really hurt and made a little bit of a difference. But as for like legs, arms and things like that? I definitely wouldn’t use it on those places. It also leaves a thick film/residue. Much too oily in my opinion. It does smell nice though but overall, I’m just not impressed unfortunately.

These hair curlers don’t come with any instructions whatsoever and just in a plastic non resealable bag. Which is a little annoying. The instructions on here aren’t very helpful if you’re a first time user (like me). So I had to look up some videos on how to use them properly. While they work, my hair did get snagged pretty often or tangled in these so I’m not sure if I’ll use them again. Yes my hair was wet and had some gel in it to help the curls form and stay but the tangling and snagging was a huge turn off for me. Maybe it’s just because it was my first time trying them.

4.0,1592470041663,Works Beautifully For My Fair Complexion,"Let me start off by saying I am fair skinned so it's hard to find a bronzer that doesn't look so harsh with my complexion. This was offered to me to try in return for an honest review. So, upon first getting this - it was relatively heavy for just a bronzer/highlight. When I got the duo out, I realized why. The packaging that the actual bronzer/highlight is in is made of some heavy glass like material. It's packaged really pretty though.  There's not a lot of product that comes in the container. But, you get a beautiful golden bronzer and a peachy highlight. The bronzer actually looks very natural on my fair skin. It's not harsh or orange. It looks like a natural shadow on my face - granted you apply bronzer with a light hand - anything that's applied heavy will look harsher. I only use bronzer in the hollows of my cheek and jawline. The highlight is subtle but just enough for on top of my cheek bones and my cupids bow. Overall, I love that this duo looks very natural on me and that it goes on lightly - you can achieve a darker bronzer by layering it. I am a little shocked by how pricey this is but the packaging should've been an inclination that this was going to be a rather expensive duo. This works really beautifully for my fair complexion but I'm just not sure I'd pay this price tag for a bronzer/highlight duo..",450348,891
3.0,1591955441913,The Liner Is Super Tacky,"This is my third set of magnetic lashes and liner (I'm obsessed and will never go back to the glue). You get 5 different kinds of lashes in this set (I personally like the third set the best). Two liners and a tool to help apply the lashes but I don't use it - it's easier to not. However, I do press my real lashes to the fake to make it more inconspicuous. My problem with this set is the liner. For one, its VERY tacky. Even after it dries. My lower lid kept sticking to my upper eyelid any time I'd blink. Secondly, the liner is watery looking when applied. Like it's transparent almost and takes a few coats to get a solid line. Even with the first coat dried, the liner was tacky. The lashes did stay with the liner but I can't get past how tacky the liner is. Thankfully I have some other brand of magnetic liner that I can use with these lashes so this wasn't a complete bust. But kind of defeats the purpose when you buy a set like this. Also, in case you're new to magnetic lashes (well this particular kind) they have like 4-5 really small magnets on the band that adhere to the magnetic liner. You can't see the magnets unless you take the lashes off and show someone. Anyways, I've deducted two stars for the poor liner.",450348,1430

It’s comfortable and helps with my spine not hitting the cold tub. I wish it was a bit more conforming/squishy but it does work well in supporting my back and neck. The suction cups stick well to the tub and haven’t had any issues with them popping off. This is a nice tub pillow and works well for added support and comfort.",450348,1136
1.0,1584227050096,Bizzare Smelling Shampoo/Conditioner,"I’ve heard of Keratin treatments and that its supposedly good for your hair. So, I figured I’d give this combo a try. First off, it’s hard to squeeze the shampoo out of the bottle, even more so when your hands are wet. That was frustrating. The conditioner comes in a pump and it’s much too thick for the small pump thus making it hard to get out. Thirdly, these do not smell nice. They smell very bizarre and did not like that my hair smelled like it afterwards. The results of this combo were not impressive either. Especially for $50! My $20 combo works so much better than this shampoo and conditioner. I am bummed that this was not better. I could’ve gotten past the weird smell if it had done wonders for my hair, but it didn’t. My hair feels soft but that’s about it. This is not worth $50 and doesn’t do anything great for your hair. Don’t waste your money.",450348,1022
5.0,1584136790591,Salon Manicure At Home,"I got this gel nail set on a whim. I wasn’t really expecting much from it or for it to work well. I was super skeptical as I was doing my sisters nails. She has much more elegant hands and long nails so hence why she was my model for trying this gel kit. The instructions are clear and explain what is used for what and how to use them in the proper steps. The instructions also come with tips which were helpful. You get a UV light, a buffer and pads, topcoat, peel off base coat, two colors, prep it and end it solution. The UV light is a plug in and not battery operated. It is a bit of a time-consuming process – it took me about an hour to do my sisters nails. I love the gray that comes in this set, but the pink leaves a bit to be desired. The gray applies beautifully and isn’t translucent unlike the pink. The pink was still translucent even after two coats. The instructions state to cure it for 45 seconds (well this is how long the UV light stays on) but her nails were still sticky. So, I cured them several more times and they remained sticky. I finally decided to just finish them with the topcoat. I cured them then the instructions stated to take a pad with the end it solution and rub her nails to rid the tacky coating. I was super nervous about this step and was worried that all my work and her patience would’ve been for nothing. After wiping her nails, I didn’t see any polish transfer or dents on her nails.  Which I had let out a sigh of relief. I suppose they’re tacky because of the sort of polish this is and didn’t need to cure it as much as I did. This was my first time doing anything like this, but I think her nails turned out nice. I’m sure with practice, I’ll get even better. I really love that you can get salon nails from the comfort of your own home. I also believe this kit is well worth the money. What you pay for this kit is what you’d pay in one salon visit, at least for me. I am so pleasantly surprised by how nice this is and so glad I decided to give it a try!",450348,1020

The glitter one has the finer glitter effect which I think is gorgeous. The Fur one I thought was odd at first but with a few more coats it really grew on me (lol no pun intended) The speckled one was ok. But the cat eye - Oh My!!

4.0,1626133196308,Great for the gym and for the environment,"I like shampoo bars for the gym, beach or travel.  This one has a nice scent.  It lathers well and also rinses out of my hair cleanly.

4.0,1619561049709,Conditions well,"I always like John Frieda products, so I was happy to give this detox and repair duo a try.  The shampoo cleans my hair really well.  In fact, since I swim 3 or 4 times a week, I only use this shampoo once a week so I don't dry it out.<br />The conditioner, on the other hand, is so nourishing, that I use it every time I shampoo.  It has revitalized my damaged hair and makes it soft and bouncy.",450369,131
5.0,1643909342430,Smells Amazing,"This vegan beard balm is a great natural alternative for beards. It smells amazing and once you're done with the product, you can reuse the container.

It applies incredibly smoothly and looks great. Highly recommend!",450370,1527

5.0,1626328071073,Acne Be GONE!,"I am head over heels (no pun intended) for the hydrocolloid pimple patches. You just place these on unwarranted acne after cleansing the skin and either leave on over night or for a few hours around the house. Usually I put mine on before bed and I wake up to all of the lovely ""gunk"" cleaned out of my acne break out. So gross, yet so satisfying. Usually only takes one time to clear those pesky acne spots up... twice if it's rooted a little deeper. Highly recommend!",450370,25084
5.0,1626286313294,Fun Top Coat Variations,"This gel set is pretty nifty! There are different types of visual and textured gel top coats. I ended up getting out my nail polish swatch sticks so that I could try every single one of these out. Each were so very different in their own way. I really like the speckled top coat. It makes some more lighter pastel polishes look like easter/spring egg shells. There's a really pretty velvet top coat that makes the color of gel polish underneath look and feel soft to the touch. Super impressed with the quality of these top coats and all the amazing, versatile looks I can create with each and every one!",450370,14862
5.0,1626205836587,No More Oil!,I really like this organic dry shampoo powder. It really helps get the oil and grease under control with second day after hair washing hair. It is easy to apply with using the very focused tip on the bottle. It also gives my rooms a little touch of volume as it also helps refresh my hair for the day. Definitely recommend this over the spray in dry shampoo!,450370,711
3.0,1615914644797,"Great Polish, Wrong Set",I ordered this set of gel polish in a different set of colors I got. I did not realize this until I had these open and was testing the colors out. The polish still applied smoothly and cured within no time under my professional gel lamp. I still like the colors and the quality of the gets I got. I just wish they had come in the colors that I had ordered and was expecting.,450370,3351
5.0,1615911827734,So Calming & Soothing,"I really love drinking this tea to calm down after a day of hard work or just before bed. This tea comes in a very nice, very well made, reusable glass container. I love how the container really holds in each tea bags flavor compared to each individually wrapped in paper packets or in a paper box. I will definitely continue to use this glass container to store all of my future teas in as well as it is so pretty! I am really in love with this calming, soothing and subtle tasting tea. I do not prefer to add sugar, honey, milk, etc to my teas. I think this tea is perfect as is and will definitely continue to drink this to calm my nerves at the end of the night.",450370,2262
5.0,1612981786242,"Actually ""Invisible"" Magnets","I have tried other magnetic lashes before but you can see each individual magnet and they are not comfortable at all. This set of magnetic lashes are very different. The entire length of the lash is a thin but strong strip of magnet. It is flexible and you almost don't realized it is even there. It looks like your typical false lash. I apply my eye makeup, then my regular liner. After that I use the special magnetic liner along the lash line, over top my regular liner exactly where I want the magnetic lashes to adhere. I only wait a few minutes before the magnetic liner is dry, then I apply the lashes and they stick like MAGIC! I love how these stay in place all day but also the fact that I can actually take these off and readjust as the day goes on. Be sure to wait until the magnetic liner is dry or you will end up with liner stuck to the lashes rather than your eye. I love that I can wash these and reuse them. Removal is simple, you just peel off the lashes WITHOUT any pain what so ever. The magnetic liner is fairly easy to get off with soap and water or an oil based makeup remover. So much easier than that awful glue that can stick around for days on days!",450370,825
4.0,1612811079961,Great for Blonde & Silver Hair,"This purple shampoo and conditioner set really helped get out some of that brassiness in my blonde hair. I am going more silver soon, so I know it will work well with that hair color as well! As for moisture, I felt like the shampoo was a little drying but the conditioner made up for that. I do wish this had more of a nice scent to it as it was kind of bland. It did the job well though, so I cannot complain much! My hair is a lot brighter and less brassy in the end and that is all I can ask for!",450370,2933
5.0,1610820307196,Beard Shaving Catcher,"This beard shaving catcher is awesome! Finally, there is little to no mess when the hubby shaves. This stays in place and catches all. I like that this also came with a shaving cream brush. It really helps lather the shaving cream for shaving. I like that this also fits around the neck nicely too. Seems to be sturdy and made quite well. A really awesome addition to our bathroom to help with a smoother cleanup!",450370,3350
5.0,1610820188967,Amber Glass Spray Bottles,I love these 16oz amber glass spray bottles so much! I used these to put my own homemade room and sanitizing spray in. The amber glass is so beautiful. I love that these bottles are glass rather than plastic as essential oil can break down plastic over time. I get a fairly good mist from these as well. These bottles seem to be made very well and are of high quality.,450370,234
5.0,1609855432388,Dried Flower Bath Bombs,"These little flower bath bombs are so pretty and smell amazing. I read that you could use these for blooming teas too but not sure that I would, though I do like those. I love using these every once in a while during a bath with a regular bath bomb or bath salts to add a little extra something for a little self care time. I love how some of these spread the petals all over and some bloom as a whole flower. Each are individually wrapped for easy, mess free storage. A really beautifully curated set of dried flower bombs!",450370,241
5.0,1609619755785,Dark Grizzly Shampoo,"I ordered this shampoo for my hubby and son but I kind of might try this out myself as it smells amazing and makes their hair smell amazing as well. It has a wonderful citrus cinnamon scent to it that is absolutely heavenly. My son in particular, usually has a smelly head instantly after even the smallest sweat, and his head seems to be holding the scent of this rather than being sweaty kid smell right away. Finally! I'll definitely be ordering more of this and also trying out some of the other scents and products from this brand since my boys and I liked this so much!",450370,3899
5.0,1608580107175,Nail Stamping Plate Set,"I used to do a lot of nail stamping back in the day and cannot find my older plates for the life of me! I ordered this set because I loved the holiday designs and remembered how much fun these were. I like that this came with a clear silicon stamper. It is so much easier to see that you've picked up the design and where you are trying to place it. This also came with a thick sturdy scraper, about the size of a debit card. It actually scrapes quite nicely and doesn't scratch up the plate like other scrapers I have used in the past. With regular polish, this works very well but you have to work quick. With gel polish, you have to let the polish set into the design for about 20 seconds, scrap, let set another 20 seconds, then pick up the design. You also have to really know exactly where you want to place your design and instead of rocking back and forth, you firmly place down the stamp for the best, most crisp stamp. If not, with gel, it tends to be less crisp or smear. It's definitely a learning curve if you are working with gel. Still, this set works really well and I can do more designs rather than trying to hand paint details on. Love this nail stamping set!",450370,9806
5.0,1608571279310,CONBOLA Make Up Organizer,"Loving this makeup organizer so much! I usually have an over flow of makeup and brushes even though I try to purge from time to time the items that I do not use. This makes it so much easier to see what make up I am currently using. Love the little compartments and the attached mirror! I might also end up using this for jewelry as well since I think I don't like the clutter of jewelry I have going on right now. I like that this is also somewhat portable because I can move this room to room without spillage. Overall, a really great way to organize your jewelry or makeup items!",450370,1979
4.0,1608005923057,6 PCS Purple Eyeshadow Sticks,"I love the colors and names of these eyeshadow sticks. I am normally an eye shadow powder girl but wanted to give these sticks a try. They are very pretty and sheen. They blend out well too. However, they are not super pigmented so I use powder shadow and these mixed to create the look I really want to get. These apply super smooth and I haven't noticed a whole lot of creasing after a few hours of use like I have with other eye shadow creams. Overall, a really nice set of eye shadow sticks!",450370,977
5.0,1596922123469,Lucious Lashes,"This duo is a dream duo! I really needed a new eyelash curler and this is a really awesome one. I just had a lash lift done, so I barely have to curl my lashes but on days when I don't wash my lashes, this really helps mine add some nice curl to my lift. I like that the curler came with 3 soft pads, so I can replace as needed. Mine usually last a while so I'll be good for quite some time! I also really like this mascara. I am pretty picky when it comes to mascara because I already have fairly long lashes. I look for mascaras that add volume rather than length and this one does not disappoint. The mascara wand makes application a breeze. It is super easy to apply and wears all day long without having to reapply. A definite duo to add to any makeup lover's collection!",450370,889
5.0,1596473410614,Red Carpet Gel Polish Starter Kit,I love Red Carpet's nail line! This is the perfect gel nail starter kit! I've been looking for a smaller gel light compared to the large professional use light that I've been using. I really like every piece that comes in this gel nail set. I highly recommend this kit for beginners as it is very easy to use. I love that this kit has a nail prep step in it as some other similar kits do not have this. Can't wait to see all the beautiful nail creations I can make using this set!,450370,6009
5.0,1596221162401,Little to No Damage Easy Curls,"I absolutely love hair curl & wave forms. I have used these before but the wave curl form set when I had longer hair. These curl forms are super simple and easy to use! It is important to take small enough sections, but large enough to be able to cover your entire head. Taking too large of sections can create a pulling out of the hair and scalp, so be very careful! This set is the perfect length for my medium to short, shoulder length hair... give or take a few inches depending on whether or not I had a recent trim or not. I usually shower in the morning, but these curl forms definitely work best if you shower at night then dry or air your hair first about 50-80% of the way before using the hook to pull your small-medium sections of hair through. This cuts down on the drying and setting time. I like to put these in my hair before bed then wear a silk hair cap over night. You could also do this after a morning shower and let them dry and set while you do things around the house, but this always tries my patience. You can also use a dryer cap to speed up the process if you do this during the day or your morning routine. These create the perfect little ringlet curls. I always use hair spray, let set for approximately 5 minutes,  then tassel and/or finger comb through my hair after for a more natural curl look. I highly recommend trying these curl formers if you would like to try a little to no damage heat option for your hair!",450370,9812
5.0,1596154954020,"Magic Frizz ""Mascara""","I was hesitant to try this frizz control mascara want but I am sure glad I did! I used this for the first time on my hair part today and there are NO frizzy little baby hairs sticking up at my part! I am amazed what this magic little wand can do. I thought at first that it was going to continue to look wet like a gel at my roots but it dried up within just a few minutes and I am still frizz free near my part even a few hours later! The tube looks like a regular mascara tube and same with the application wand. It glides on very smoothly and I barely ever have to go over the same area more than once. This wand is a little miracle worker and believe you me, I have tried many tactics to get the little baby hairs to stay in place. So far, this is the only thing that has done the trick. What have I done without this my whole life?!",450370,2170

Then I simply lined up over my lips and wet paper with sponge and peeled off.<br />Easy to remove with baby oil or rubbing alcohol.

This IPL has an integrated skin tone sensor that scans your skin before every flash and automatically selects the most powerful treatment for your skintone. It also has 3 comfort modes, and an attachment for more precise areas of hair removal such as your lip area or T zone.

I'm loving the results I'm seeing after just using this for a short period of time. Hair be gone!

Usually, I wear them as they are without polish. These are white nails. They can last one to three weeks. I rough up my nails and wipe with alcohol before using nail glue to glue them on.

I just started wearing these lashes but I like them. They're a bit more voluminous and dense than anything I currently offer, but they hold up very well. My only complaint with how these were packaged is that unlike when you buy singles, it's not obvious which is for the right vs the left eye. So, if you're the type who needs to customize the length — and the length of both eyes is slightly different — it's easy to get the right vs. left mixed up.<br /><br />But so far, I'm a fan. I've worn them twice and there's been no shedding.

3.0,1638278324176,It tears easily.  Nope from me.,"This is probably about the 100th brand I have tried for an eye mask if I exaggerate a bit.<br />I use under eye patches almost everyday, sometimes twice a day not only for under eye but also for my neck lines and forehead.<br />So I am not kidding when I say I have tried 10s of different brands of under eye patches from Amazon.<br />To be honest, under eye patches are for a rather temporary fix, in that you have to use them everyday or for a long period to have more permanent effects. But that’s how all skin care products work in my opinion. I use it to reduce very fine lines under my eyes (you can’t really see it unless you look in the mirror closely but it bugs me), and prevent my neck and forehead lines from getting worse (and hopefully to improve).<br />This one didn’t stay well at all on my neck, and I felt it dried out too quickly.<br />FYI, I don’t have dark circles, so my rate of effectiveness is solely for fine lines and such.<br />For my neck lines, I think most eye patches are at par in terms of quality, to be honest. Of course, from time to time, there are brands with quite inferior quality to others. I wouldn’t know about this one, as it kept falling off.<br />The last straw was that it just ripped apart when I tried to move the slipped mask back to the intended spot. It was annoying. After a couple of times, I just took it all off from my face.<br />The bottom line is that this product doesn’t have any price advantage to overlook its rather inferior quality compared to similar quality eye masks in this price range either.<br />I got so many other eye masks right now, I am not going to use this one unless I run out of eye masks between shipments or something (highly unlikely though).<br />Overall, 2.5/5 from me based on my experience of trying this mask for the very first time, and I won’t be recommending this.",450457,2489

Especially for less than $0.90 per sheet?

Since this one is my first cleansing oil, I don’t have any experience with other cleansing oils to compare this with. So my impression about this is as a general cleansing product whether oil or otherwise.<br />The bottom line is that I liked how it worked on removing make-ups and how my skin felt afterwards.

Once I finish with the micro needle, I apply hyaluronic acid, and then roll with the jade roller. It is SO SOOTHING. The roller has two sides- a large end for the planes of your face, and a small end to get in smaller areas like under your eyes. I only use the micro needle roller once a week-usually on Saturday nights. It does make your face a little red, but it goes away by morning. I use the jade roller a couple times a week, especially after stressful days. Just so you know, make sure to sterilize both rollers or you will have major breakouts from spreading bacteria around.

3.0,1606785980184,The nicest part is the box,"Honestly, I was disappointed in these. The quality isn't great and I feel like the colors were misrepresented. None of them are as bright as they appear online, and the glitter in the sparkly ones is so fine that it mostly just makes it look cloudy. The tubes have stickers slapped on them that don't stay on. The packaging is nice and really giftable, though. It all comes nicely arranged in a gift box. But once you get past that, it's kind of....meh. There are better sets (and colors) for the price.",450537,14006
3.0,1605406046699,Meh,"They are fine, but not worth the price. The size of the wipe is about half the size of a baby wipe, meaning you're not going to get all that much cleaning done with just one.<br /><br />The smell isn't very good. I know they're more natural, but for the price they could have added a drop on essential oil or something.<br /><br />They say you can use them for body grime and odor, but be careful where you put them. Any skin that qualifies as sensitive may get a burny/tingly feeling that makes you question your decisions...that's all I'm saying about that.<br /><br />The price is just too high for these ten very average wipes.",450537,2271
3.0,1605049652887,Moved and caked,"I couldn't seem to keep this foundation from looking cakey or settling into lines. It definitely settles when you don't use the primer. The primer is pretty good - silky, and a little goes a long way. With it on, the foundation doesn't settle much, but it still looks cakey unless you put barely any product on. At that point, it's pretty sheer and doesn't do much.<br />I liked the shades, and was able to match my skin tone by mixing the two.<br />The brush that comes with it is also pretty useless. Very soft, and too thin to really blend in the makeup.<br />Overall, it seems nice, but I just couldn't get it to work for me.",450537,11888
5.0,1604872578751,Color Variety,"This is a great set to expand your range of dip powder colors. It has the perfect mixture of bold and subtle colors. The containers are really small, so whether you have short nails or not, save yourself the headache and use these in something larger. The dip powder recycling trays are great for this. You can also pour the powder directly on your nails over a paper plate, then fold the plate to funnel it back into the container.<br />The dip powder works well, and the price is good, so I think it's a good purchase!",450537,2195
2.0,1603681904184,Weak and complicated,"I couldn't get these to work on my hair, and the struggle just ended with cheap plastic tangled all in my hair. The clips are pretty weak, both the one on bottom and the smaller ones on top, and didn't hold my hair. They feel pretty cheap.<br /><br />The method also seems pretty straight forward in theory, but more challenging in practice. Figuring out what hair to lift and where to place the clip underneath took some practice, and then the clip kept sliding while I was trying to put the twists in place.<br /><br />Needless to say, it looked nothing like the pictures. These may just be better suited to thick hair - mine is fine and straight.<br /><br />I definitely wouldn't get these again.",450537,40517
4.0,1602037357427,Worth it? Yes and no.,"This mascara and eyelash curler combo has its pros and cons:<br /><br />The mascara - I actually really like this mascara, which I didn't expect, given the price and the cheap packaging it comes in. The formula is smooth and glides on easily, and the curled brush on the wand is dense enough and shaped just right to get every little lash. But most importantly, it stays on ALL day without running or flaking. I'd say it's pretty waterproof, but also comes off easily with eye makeup remover. I had a brand for mascara that I have been loyal to for years, but this is my new go-to in my makeup bag. And the price is great! My only issue with it is that it dries very quickly, so any mistake you make isn't going to budge. It also means that it's easy to make the lashes stick together if you don't apply it carefully.<br /><br />The eyelash curler - Actually I only have cons about this one. I hate it. It's shaped in a way that makes it difficult to use. The finger grips are set too far apart, making it awkward to squeeze, and the shape of the press is odd and it to angle my lashes into it. It's basically useless, and I tossed it in favor of my simple revlon lash curler.<br /><br />This mascara, however, I will be buying again!",450537,889
3.0,1602003365879,Worth the money?,"This mask is okay, but there are better ones out there, especially for the price (currently $25).<br /><br />The consistency is a little on the thin side, but applies smoothly. It dries okay, and the smell is mild and pleasant. It washes off easily, and it did leave my softer and a little brighter.<br /><br />But it really didn't do much for the overall quality of my skin -  the softness and brightness were gone by morning, blackheads were still visible, and existing acne was not improved.<br /><br />I have personally tested a number of masks that did a lot more for my skin, and some at half the price. This one isn't bad, and may be a great option for those who want something mild, but I wouldn't buy it again.",450537,1004
5.0,1601391303420,A nicer way to clean your face,"At first I thought there's no way these are good for anything, but they incredibly soft and pleasant to use. And they actually do a pretty good job of cleaning. When I tested them out with the just water method, there was still makeup residue left behind, but much less than I expected. I use an oil cleanser with them, and my pores are squeaky clean.<br />They hold up pretty well in the wash, I've had one or two loops come loose. I really like the wash bag they come with. For the price, these are a great buy.",450537,7607
3.0,1599256468811,"Not terrible, but not for me","After trying these masks out, here's what I found:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- No fragrance<br />- Very moisturizing<br />- Easily fits big faces<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Cold and slimy<br />- Very drippy<br />- Slightly numbed my skin in a disconcerting way<br />- Gave me breakouts<br />- Kind of pricey (currently $18 for 3)<br /><br />Overall, these weren't the worst. I think that if someone had really dry skin, and warmed these up and wrung them out a little before use, they might be absolutely great for them.",450537,980
5.0,1599064943661,A nice kit!,"This is a great set! You get a good sized box full of stuff.<br />Upon opening it, I was initially disappointed when I saw they went kinda cheap with the eye mask- it's only about half full of the gel beads. It's mostly air. Because of this, I assumed the whole kit would be cheap. But it's actually pretty nice! The packaging is great, you get a big pack of the facial cleansing wipes and five of the face masks, and it all feels great on your skin.<br />My skin was softer after the mask. I suggest warming it first - I tossed it in its package right into my hot bath, along with the eye gel mask. The mask can be a little drippy ( they usually are), so soaking in the bath with it on means no clean up.<br />The lip treatment was great! My lips were a little dry and peeling, and after the treatment, they were so soft and moisturized.<br />Nothing had any unpleasant fragrances, either. Which I appreciate.<br />I really enjoyed taking the evening to pamper myself with this kit, and it would make a great gift!<br />Totally recommend it.",450537,2327
3.0,1598586589483,"Strong smell, tiny bottle","It works and feels good on the skin, smooth and moisturizing. I can tell that it is a better quality product than your average hand sanitizer.

Wipes are generously soaked in liquid that leaves no oily or sticky residue. It smells nice and fresh. The jug with pads is huge, it’s like a peanut butter jar lol No complaints here but not exactly something you want to put in a travel bag.

5.0,1600448094788,works well for me,"I was a little bit concerned since some reviewers mentioned this vit c is oily. I thought it would feel too heavy for my skin but thankfully that wasnot the case.<br /><br />Compared with any other Vitamin C serum I have used during the past 7 years, this is the thickest version I have seen. Usually Vit C is thin almost like water but this variety by MD is oil based. It works great for my skin giving it a bit extra hydration it needs. I use at night, I do believe it would be too heavy for daytime use as humidity is high. It makes my skin softer and feeling more hydrated then usual.",531968,81
3.0,1598925298137,Natural ingredients and nourishing BUT parents BEWARE,"I love the natural ingredients and the mild and pleasant scent, I also love how the skin feels after this bath oil. However, I regretted using this oil to bathe the baby. It made things slippery and when I was getting  her out of the tub to wash her bottom I was terrified because she felt slippery. I will continue using this for myself but I am worried about using it on the baby. I also hesitate using it when bathing my toddler because he loves to move around a lot and I am concerned he would slip. Also, some oil leaked out during shipping.",531968,267
5.0,1596069423900,Beginner friendly application,"I am terrible at doing lashes but I really like having nice lashes, now during pandemic lash salon is out of the question. Before trying these I tried lashes with glue and that was a disaster. Then ai tried magnetic ones and that was a good experience. When these came up for the review I honestly didn’t understand how different it is then a glue? Well, it’s the application process that’s different. With glue you have to squeeze it out and make sure not to put  too much, then you have to make sure to place the lash correctly on the first attempt or you might have glue on your eye lid. This liner serves as a glue! It’s just like regular liner, has that sharpie tip and works like a pen. You draw your line over the eye lid and then place the lashes and they will stick to it perfectly. If you need to reposition the lash there is no mees and glue residue, you just pull and place it back accordingly. I only wish these would be more natural style but for the ladies that like their lashes little more dramatic this is perfect choice.",531968,5645
5.0,1621268935818,Great coverage for a BB Cream!,"I am very important with this BB cream and will be buying it again in the future! It covers blemishes and marks easily and doesn’t smear off. It’s lightweight and doesn’t clog my pores either! It gives me a perfect natural look without much effort and blends quickly with my skin tone. I like the amount of product that comes in the tube and that it lasts a decent amount of time with daily use. It feels good on my skin and gives my eyelids a primer to stick to as well. Overall, I have no complaints and will definitely recommend this and purchase it again!",237000,19175

I'm still very pleased with this product and will buy it again in the future. It's great for pictures and when you want to have tanned, flawless looking skin.",237000,1568
5.0,1579118555288,No irritation and full thick lashes!,"This lash and brow growth serum works great and doesn't irritate! I've already noticed a substantial difference in the length of my lashes and the thickness of each lash. I don't have any bare spots and I can see little lashes growing in too. I don't use it on my eyebrows so I can't speak to how well it works for that but as far as the eyelashes I think it's fantastic. I has sensitive skin and this doesn't give me any trouble at all. It's easy to use, just depress the button on the back to dispense serum and apply to lash line. I like that it's not a brush applicator like the others I've tried as they are harder to apply for me. The applicator is more of a soft tube that's easy to swipe along. I love that this is drug free and eye color safe so I don't feel like I'm doing any harm to my eyes when I use this. Another positive is after I apply this, it helps my eyelashes curl easily with my curler too. All in all, i would highly recommend this and will definitely buy more in the future!",237000,1165
5.0,1576676768114,Makes skin so soft!,This charcoal scrub makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I like that it has minimal ingredients and that its paraben and formaldehyde free.

4.0,1569893831171,Great product all around!,"I love this exfoliating scrub! I tried the one with honey and it smells great, works amazing and left my skin feeling like new! I gave 4 stars because the seal was not on and it leaked out, I worried that it had been tampered with but I didn't see any obvious signs that it had. I tried this on my hands first and had no adverse reactions so I used it on my face and body thereafter. This did burn a little on my face but so does any exfoliating scrub as I have somewhat sensitive skin. It made my skin so silky soft and moisturized! I thought it would be sticky as it contains honey and it wasn't sticky at all. The price is very fair considering this has no artificial ingredients and no chemicals. It didn't leave me feeling greasy or oily, just buttery smooth and clean. I'm in love with this stuff and will be buying more!",237000,748
3.0,1569297874458,"Not really for ""professional"" use.","As a professional hairstylist, I wouldn't consider this a ""professional"" straightening iron. The cord is too short to be used in a professional setting.<br />Also, it operates in Celsius and not Fahrenheit which is confusing to me.  It does have some nice features like a rotating cord that doesn't bind up. The<br />automatic shut off is another plus, as well as the lock/unlock, hanging ring, carrying case, hair clips, hot glove, rat tail comb and the LED display panel. I love the rose gold color and the iron feels durable enough.  I personally think this would make a great gift or travel set as everything fits nicely in the provided bag.  It does a good job straightening and defrizzing as well. All that being said, it's not my favorite but it's also not bad either.",237000,2344
5.0,1652987290341,Not good for greasy skin,"You have to be careful with these pads if you are prone to break outs because the oil can build up on your face and though they are for cleansing, I found that they did clog my pores if I used them exclusively. They worked well though if used with another non-oil cleanser, and for that reason I give them 5 stars as they really do take off all my makeup and moisturize my face well.",531981,14285
5.0,1630424268115,Close shave,Not a dude but I have plenty of curves so I can testify to how well these work on curves and because of the shape of these they are easy to use on all curves.

4.0,1598889637062,A great option!,"I've been a natural deodorant user for years and have tried many brands on the market, my favorite so far has been Native, which is also one of the most popular, so I thought I would do a comparison with that brand.<br /><br />Both are stick deodorants, but the PF deodorant has a larger case, and just a little more product, barely enough worth mentioning though. The deodorant on the PF brand slides on thicker and isn't as hard as the Native deodorant so it would be easier to apply too much with the PF than with Native. Not huge but something to consider.<br /><br />They both seem to do an equally good job at keeping odor away and I noticed no increase in odor while wearing the PF vs. the Native.<br /><br />Price-wise they are about the same so you really don't save money either way.<br /><br />Fragrance-wise I didn't really have a preference for one brand vs. the other, they both have a nice range of fragrance and there is enough variety to appeal to most people.<br /><br />Because of application, I will be sticking with Native, but if you are looking for something that glides on a bit thicker than this would be the best choice.",531981,998
5.0,1592523232806,Good stuff!,"Nothing beats aloe vera to treat burns for me, and this is a little easier to use than to cut off a leaf from a plant and apply it, though I have done that before too.

The one issue she had was the smell, but she says it doesn't last long. Overall, it's a nice quality product that even a beginner can use to get beautiful nails!",531981,1020

They are a good assortment and well coated so they don't snag your hair, the clip snaps tight too to really keep a hold on things. They are very glossy, and if you like bright colors there are some brights in there, but also pastels and earth tones. I kept the neutral ones and small of the more muted colors and am giving the rest to my 13-year-old niece who loves bright colors.",531981,847
5.0,1549678927748,Smooth finish!,"These work really well to blend make up so you don't have any lines on your face. They are good value for as many as you get, and they are very smooth and soft and don't soak up the make up into the sponge as much as some other I have tried so that the make up will actually stay on your face . They seem to be holding up quite well too and even after having them for a month they are not breaking and pilling up like others I have had. Good product!",531981,258
4.0,1544721633779,Mostly good,"Before this I used the electric tank water flossers, and while they work great, I have very limited counter space and hated how much room they took up, so I switched to this. Overall, I really like it, but I do think that the high setting could be a little stronger, it is a bit lower pressure than the tank ones. I had no problem filling the tank and it still does a good job on flossing my teeth.

5.0,1457733375000,Can't imagine a superior model of nail-clippers,"It's sometimes hard to tell from small web photos just how a product will look and feel for real. The amazon picture for this clipper did look quite appealing, but I can say that in real life the item's quality is even higher than I'd been expecting. Really excellently designed weight and shape for a man's medium-size hands; perfectly balanced tension against the blade-closing action; great surface texture for easy gripping and avoidance of dropping during use. I especially like the wider-than-usual outer end of the push-lever--it doesn't slip away from under your thumb.<br /><br />But the best part is how this clipper cuts through any sort of nails &#34;like butter&#34;--smoothly, so so easily. I can now trim my nails in half the time it used to take, and I no longer need to &#34;smooth out&#34; small sharp corners of nail that I used to get because of how the the whole instrument (older, smaller clippers I had) would move during the cutting action. It's very hard to find *any* purely straight-bladed nail clippers (which I find far more versatile than the curved ones) either online or in stores, and among the few available on amazon, I am convinced these can't be beat. The &#34;pro&#34; in its name is entirely appropriate.<br /><br />Note 1: When you first unpack this product, the gap between the two cutting edges might not seem as wide as you might like, particularly for larger toenails, but then it opens to a better size when you get the push-lever handle up.<br /><br />Note 2: This is my unvarnished and uncompensated opinion. The company did send me a very polite email a few days after I got the product, urging me to write a review, but not for any sort of consideration. I recommend them without reservation.",607126,3007

4.0,1610935394194,Too early to know results for sure but so far love it.,"First of all the packaging is so sleek, sheen, and cute- and it does come with 2 pumps!! I wasnt expecting that but super happy as I knew I'd be using more than needed and wasting if I were just pouring straight from the bottle/s. Which leads me to my second point- I still think I used more than needed, particularly the conditioner. My hair is thin & rather short now so I don't need much as is, but because it's so dry & brittle the conditioner seemed to have a bit of difficulty actually saturating and smoothing out so I kept pumping more out and adding it. Well I ended up just clipping it back to sit for a bit like usual & let me tell you...when I took it out it was so silky smooth I was surprised it didnt fall out of the clip on it's own. The smell is a rather strong floral scent, I've noticed all my Korean hair products have a strong floral scent to them tho & personally I dont mind it. Havent used long enough for much result yet but will update.",623447,53040

5.0,1557366177290,Worth the price for under eye dark circles,I have tried many eye concealers ....and this by far ...is my favorite! I had been searching for something to help my dark circles and nothing seemed to work...and this did the trick. This is not dry or cakey like some consealers. It actually helps smooth and blend under eye dark areas and is very creamy and smooth. I will definitely be buying this again and again. I also used the PUR translucent powder and with both in combination... gives you a flawless finish!,626251,5619

Glitter busted everywhere so now blue glitter haunts my life now. Slip guard came half full and it has a crack so it leaks. Just got this 2 days ago and all the slip guard is almost gone. The product works, but SUPER slapped together no care whatsoever. AND NO DIRECTIONS. YOU HAVE TO USE THE CRAPPY ONE ON HERE. Overall, i want my money honestly. Not getting this brand EVER again.",626474,5651
